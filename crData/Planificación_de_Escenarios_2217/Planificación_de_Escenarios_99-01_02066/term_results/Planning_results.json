      "abstract": "<jats:p>HIV/AIDS is a threat to individual lives and the national economies of many sub-Saharan African countries, despite efforts to contain its spread. The region also suffers from high levels of other reproductive tract infections (RTIs), some of which increase the risk of sexual transmission of HIV. The control of RTIs is therefore seen not only as an important reproductive health care strategy, but as a key strategy in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. Most national health care programs in the region are actively seeking cost-effective ways of implementing an RTI management program that would reduce and prevent RTIs and HIV. To date, most emphasis has been placed on managing RTI/HIV within high-risk groups, but many programs are now trying to reach a bigger proportion of the at-risk population through integrating RTI/HIV management services into existing maternal and child health/family planning (MCH/FP) programs. As noted in this baseline survey report, a variety of methods were used to collect and synthesize information that could be used in developing an appropriate and cost-effective approach to the integration of RTI/HIV within FP services.</jats:p>"

Research activities are conducted in addition to analysis of service statistics and compilation of quarterly and annual reports. With a staff capacity of five and inadequate research skills existing in other units, the ERU finds it difficult to manage and monitor the diverse activities of the organization. To address these problems, a buy-in was signed between the Zimbabwe Government and USAID in May 1995. The objectives were to assist the ZNFPC in conducting operations research studies and strengthening the ERU’s research capacity. The ERU’s traditional role of implementing research had to be revised to research management. The ZNFPC requested that the Population Council’s Africa OR/TA II Project provide technical assistance to implement this new role. The ZNFPC convened a meeting of cooperating agencies, donors, government, and municipal departments to explore ways of improving the coordination and implementation of population activities in Zimbabwe. As noted in this document, recommendations from the meeting were developed and the Africa OR/TA Project used these as guidelines for designing future programs for strengthening the ERU’s research capacity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>The development of U.S. urban transportation policy over the past 50 years illustrates the changing relationship between federal, state, and local governments. This comprehensive text examines the evolution of urban transportation planning from early developments in highway planning in the 1930s to the concern for sustainable development and pollution emissions. Focusing on major national events, the book discusses the influence of legislation, regulations, conferences, federal programs, and advances in planning procedures and technology.</JATS1:p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<JATS1:p>The book offers an in-depth look at the most significant event in transportation planning—the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1962. Creating a federal mandate for a comprehensive urban transportation planning process carried out cooperatively by states and local governments with federal funding, this act was crucial in the spread of urban transporation. Claiming that urban transportation planning is more sophisticated, costly, and complex than its highway and transit planning predecessors, the book demonstrates how urban transportation planning evolved in response to changes in such factors as environment, energy, development patterns, intergovernmental coordination, and federal transit programs. It further illustrates how broader concerns for global climate change and sustainable development have braided the purview of transportation planning.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The current spread of HIV/AIDS poses a major threat to individual lives and national economies in many sub-Saharan African countries. The region also has some of the highest levels of other reproductive tract infections (RTIs) in the world. Some of these RTIs increase the risk of sexual transmission of HIV infection. Thus, the control of RTIs is seen not only as an important reproductive health care strategy to alleviate symptoms of infection and long-term gynecological, obstetric, and neonatal complications, but also as a key strategy in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS. As a result, all national health care programs in the region are actively seeking cost-effective ways of implementing an RTI management program that would reduce the spread of RTIs and ultimately HIV. Although there are many reasons to support an integrated approach to service delivery, many unanswered questions remain concerning its implementation, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. In 1998, the Africa OR/TA II Project and the Zimbabwe National Family Planning Council (ZNFPC) undertook a study to assist the ZNFPC in developing the most appropriate and cost-effective approach to managing RTIs in its clinics. Findings from the study are presented in this report.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Estimates from the United Nations Population Fund indicate that the costs of family planning (FP) and other reproductive health (RH) services are increasing and that it will be difficult for donors and countries to meet these costs. Many institutions delivering RH services operate significantly below their physical capacity to see clients, and much of the equipment required for expanding RH services may already be available for use. The marginal costs of adding infrastructure could be low. Many institutions have staff that are not fully occupied, and thus the staff necessary to expand RH services may also be in place. In this paper, we examine the cost implications for labor of expanding the provision of syndromic management services in FP clinics in Zimbabwe. Syndromic management of sexually transmitted infections allows health care workers to make a diagnosis without sophisticated laboratory tests because it is based on clinical syndromes and, in some cases, assessments of an individual patient’s risk for STI infection.</jats:p>"

In the past it used to be the sectoral plan for water management which provided the instruments to thwart demands for ever more of the floodplain to be released for development. At local-authority level there continues to be little awareness of the need for flood-protection measures to be conceived as a concern of the entire municipality, rather than concentrating solely on those areas adjacent to the main water body directly threatened by flooding.&#x0D;\nTaking the River Lenne as an example case, a river-basin-based strategy of preventive flood protection is developed. This strategy takes account of all relevant spatial plans and is tailored to reflect the topography and settlement structures prevailing in specific sections of the river's course.</jats:p>"

Carries out a survey of 91 firms (through questionnaires sent to Chief Executive Officers) using a 7‐point Likert scale to measure responses. Performs varimax rotation and regression analysis to analyse the results. Focuses on three specific characteristics ‐ power/control, creativity, and people/dependence ‐ and attempts to establish the impact these characteristics have on plan intensity (the degree to which organization members are guided by an established plan) and the use of direction‐setting tools such as mission/vision, long‐term objectives, short‐term objectives and action planning. Reviews some literature in the separate fields of strategic planning and leadership, drawing together various strands to suggest that leadership characteristics are important predictors of plan intensity within organizations and that they will also be strong predictors on how direction‐setting tools are used within the organizational planning process. Discusses the findings as they link into the three leadership factors mentioned. Mentions, also, the planning index and how it relates to planning intensity. Concludes that leadership characteristics are strong predictors of planning intensity and planning tools. Notes limitations of the study.</jats:p>",

With state-of-the-art guides for fire modeling and guides to the writing of fire hazard assessment standards and fire risk assessment standards, ASTM E-5 has played an essential role and has been one of the earliest major players in this activity. But now the landscape has changed. Groups from SFPE to NFPA to ICC, from ISO to IEC to CIB, and others are all active, and each brings a special focus and a special skill to the activity. ASTM E-5 needs to decide what its special role can and should be. This paper will discuss some of the options, based on the traditional scope and areas of traditional strength and emphasis for ASTM.</jats:p>",

Our terms of reference agreed with the Government (that is, the Planning Commission) were very vague, but I think we were supposed to galvanize empir¬ical economic research in liaison with four existing institutions: the National Council of Applied Economic Research under Dr Lokanathan, the Economic Growth Centre of the Delhi School of Economics under V. K. R. V. Rao (both in Delhi), the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta under P. C. Mahalanobis, and the Gokhale Institute in Poona under Dr Gadgil. These terms of reference were totally unrealistic for reasons of time, distance, personality, and lack of any research material. Outside government there were almost no up-to-date figures for anything, and we had neither the time (Swan and I were in India for only nine months) nor the resources to create data. Nor was this what we were sup¬ posed to do.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>3D stochastic reservoir modelling is an emerging new technology for the oil and gas industry and is increasingly used by oil and gas companies as a tool to support major business decisions in field development planning, and the acquisition and management of petroleum assets. However, the potential benefit that 3D stochastic reservoir modelling can offer is still overlooked by many asset teams. Conventional methods are often still applied for field development planning and reserve estimation, where over-simplified geological models are used and reservoir uncertainties are substantially under-estimated. This is one reason why the oil and gas industry does not have a good track record in estimating reserves and field development planning.3D stochastic reservoir modelling methods that incorporate the structural-stratigraphic framework, facies and petrophyscial properties can ensure that the reservoir models fully describe reservoir heterogeneity. This in turn lays a sound foundation for field development planning. The 3D stochastic reservoir modelling methods also quantify and reduce uncertainties in various aspects of the reservoir. This allows a field development plan to be more robust yet flexible enough to take the advantage of upside reserve potential and to be economically sound if the downside case occurs. Based on quantification of uncertainties, optimal well positions and well paths can be designed to maximise oil and gas recovery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMore and more companies in Germany are running into economic difficulties. Whilst consolidation for small and medium-sized enterprises have been put in place in eastern Germany both by the national government and by the Länder (the federal states) — e.g. the consolidation fund and consolidation programmes introduced in the Länder to promote co-financing, there is in western Germany no immediately apparent sigh of a coherent basis for consolidation policy to set alongside the more traditional programmes geared to promoting economic development. This is all the more surprising in the light of the fact that it is much easier, as far as financial policy is concerned, to save existing jobs than to create new ones. On the other hand, an offensive policy of consolidation has to contend with very real regulatory obstacles, which tend to create a situation in which those wielding political power prefer to adopt a policy of covert consolidation. The regulatory models and paradigms in place in the various Länder vary considerably in the detail to which they have been elaborated (and this quite independently of the colour of the party in government). Consequently, there are similarly quite striking differences in respect of both the concrete content of consolidation policies and the manner in which they are presented to the outside world.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The procedure — i.e. conjoint analysis, a tool which has now been established for several years in marketing analysis — is explained with reference to a number of examples taken from commercial planning. The article also makes a plea for a more differentiated view of commercial planning; it also outlines the scope for price-based planning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In the 1970s, these methods began to be applied. From 1974 to 1982 there were massive public sector investment booms in many of the developing countries. It appears that much of this investment yielded little or nothing. Were the methods flawed in principle? Were they ignored? And if so, why? Was the possible effect of project appraisal swamped by unforeseen events that rendered potentially valuable investments useless? We do not provide definitive answers to these questions, but we hope to contribute to their answers by discussing the current state of the theory of project appraisal and the current practice and influence of social cost-benefit analysis, particularly within the World Bank.</jats:p>",

These predictions contain many kinds of uncertainty, for example,  prediction and measurement errors. Inevitably, this has an effect on  forest management planning. It is well known that uncertainty in the  forest yields causes optimistic bias in the observed values of the  objective function. This bias increases with the error variances. The  amount of bias, however, also depends on the error structure and the  relations between the objective variables. In this paper, the effect of  uncertainty in forest yields on optimization is studied by simulation.  The effect of two different sources of error, the correlation structure  of these errors and relations among the objective variables are  considered, as well as the effect of two different optimization  approaches. The relations between the objective variables and the error  structure had a notable effect on the optimization results.</ja:p>"

It is argued that the planner engages in a variety of metacognition as s/he perceives, interprets, evaluates, and produces cognitive actions that require careful attention and analysis. Following Flavell's (1981) model of cognitive monitoring, a metacognitive model of conversational planning is proposed. The model consists of several cognitive and metacognitive components that are grouped into three categories: Causal Knowledge, Working Knowledge, and Conscious Experiences. Next, to elaborate the metacognitive components of the model, several examples of metacognitive variables in problem-solving situations are proposed. Then, focusing on these variables, the proposed model of conversational planning is illustrated using natural data taken from a clinical supervision session. In the last section, the relevance of the present study to pragmatics is briefly discussed with respect to mental operations involved in interpretation.</jats:p>"

It summarises the results of the cost benefit analysis\n in terms of \ncoverage, accuracy and safety requirements for different types of user\n and describes the most \ncost-effective GNSS 2 architecture. These analyses also assume that the\n overall system is \nlayered into wide area, regional and local systems. The future planning\n of satellite navigation \nis essentially driven by the wide area requirements and ensuring that these\n are global and \nseamless. There is some flexibility in coverage and accuracy for a wide\n area system in that \nit can be augmented regionally or locally if required, but it must provide\n the highest level of \nsafety required. The paper approaches the architecture for a future navigation\n system from \nthis safety aspect. An analysis of the chosen architecture shows that the\n required safety \nperformance can be met. An implementation plan is described which allows\n a gradual \nevolution from the first system to be realized for safety critical operations\n to a fully civilian \nowned and operated system.</jats:p>",

Zielsetzung ist dabei eine am Bedarf orientierte Netzplanung. Am Beispiel eines deutschen City-Carriers wird ausgehend von einem sozialgeographischen Ansatz eine kleinràumige Analyse der Nachfrage und des Potentials des Marktes durchgefuhrt. Mit multivariaten Methoden wird auf der Basis verfügbarev Statistiken und Umfragen fur verschiedene Kundensegmente der Bedarf ermittelt und ràumlich differenziert dargestellt. Die Ergebnisse fliefien als Sachdaten in eine GIS-Applikation ein, mit deren Hilfe Vorschlage fur eine Netzplanung entwickelt werden konnen. Es wird somit ein Bogen gespannt von einem sozialgeographisch motivierten Ansatz über empirische Untersuchungen nicht nur zur Adaption, sondern auch zum in seinen Quell-Ziel-Beziehungen differen¬ zierten Telekommunikationsverkehr, um zu Aussagen über Marktvolumen und -potentiale zu kommen, welche die Grundlagen einer Te lekommunikations -Netzplanung auf lokaler Ebene bilden.</jats:p>"

In addition to the targets, measures and the institutional basis of\n   the activities envisaged by the program, attention is also given to the\n   evaluation of the document itself. It is highlighted that formulation of the\n   elements of the family planning program and their adoption constitute only\n   the first step and that the success of the program shall largely depend on\n   the manner of its operationalization, and particularly, on the\n   implementation of the proposed measures and activities. In the first part of\n   the paper, the author also asserts that the document adopted neither\n   included the points of particular interest nor the specific conditions for\n   implementing the program-related activities in the context of rural\n   population. Hence, the second and the third parts discuss the research\n   findings regarding rural population of Serbia and the pragmatic experience\n   acquired by other countries in carrying out similar activities. The\n   information gathered in the 1990s by means of questionnaires conducted in\n   low and high-fertility regions was analyzed to highlight the need for\n   implementing the program in rural population and to assess the prospects of\n   the program-related efforts pertaining to a change in reproductive behavior.\n   The summary experience gained in implementing family planning programs in\n   other countries, and concretization of different elements of the activities\n   undertaken was observed from the point of view of the need to operationalize\n   family planning programs in Serbia.</jats:p>"

The discursive subject is the identification and justification for the allocation of large sites for economic development purposes. The way this discourse has been developed in two case study areas (the West Midlands and Lancashire) is summarised, drawing out the institutional contexts of discourse development, the functions of the discourses (persuasive, co-ordinative and justificatory), the different discursive levels which are affected by changes in the discourses, the ways in which discourses are disseminated and translated from one institutional arena to another and the institutional work that discourses perform. </jats:p>",

The notion of community is usually associated with social ties and interaction within a locality, but it also has a normative interpretation. Communitarianism as an expression of the good of community is experiencing a revival: the author reviews the content of communitarianism, observing similarities with the ethic of care which has featured in some feminist critiques of mainstream moral philosophy. However, the ideal of community and the partiality of care are open to critique, which requires a rethinking of community in the context of the changing nature of personal relationships and of localities. This has implications for moral learning and development, or how behavioural norms are transmitted and possibly transformed. </jats:p>",

It is still solved manually in most advanced assembly plants, despite the large amount of related research. One of the main reasons might be the use of exact- and/or linear-solution approaches. This paper introduces a different approach by applying a modified genetic algorithm (GA). A “best” solution is generated without searching the complete candidate space, while search is performed on a sequence population basis. The GA is modified to cope with sequence nonlinearity and constraints. [S1087-1357(00)70401-1]</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since colleges were made responsible for strategic planning in 1993, managers in further education have encountered criticisms for not managing the process in a sufficiently business-like way and for being too business-driven in their approach. This article explores the experience of a group of principals who lead strategic planning, in the context of an analysis of a sample of strategic plans. It suggests planning takes place within a national strategic vacuum and that there is a diversity of types of plan and planning process. Plans based on achieving a competitive edge are in evidence, but so too are plans based on the need to build commitment in the face of severely constrained strategic choices, and driven by educational values. It is concluded that analysis and response to the planning of the sector should take better account of the diversity of purposes and practices within colleges. </jats:p>",

The intention was to highlight ways in which the quality of discharge planning could be improved within the acute hospital setting. Generally staff described failures more commonly than successes, with a number of key failures being identified, including problems associated with vacating beds, lack of appropriate staff, patients and carer education about discharge activities, general process issues, problems associated with community service provision and patients who are difficult to discharge. Staff identified the lack of feedback on the outcome of their efforts as a source of frustration and a barrier to improving discharge planning activities. The challenges for improving the quality of discharge planning in the acute hospital setting would appear to be in establishing appropriate structures and processes that promote interaction between staff,patients and community providers, and provide incentives for behavioural change.</jats:p>"

The most efficient, environmentally preferred, and cost effective spill response is dependent on the following factors: chemistry of the spilled product, quantity, location, response time, environmental conditions, and effectiveness of available response technologies at various degrees of oil weathering.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Time windows is a highly targeted process, in which the selection of response technologies will be more efficient, cost effective, technically correct, and environmentally sensitive and appropriate. The strategy integrates dynamic oil weathering data and performance effectiveness data for oil spill response technologies derived from laboratory, mesoscale, and experimental field studies. Performance data has been developed from a wide range of viscosities of different weathering stages of transported oils into a dynamic oil weathering database to identify and estimate time periods, called \"technology windows-of-opportunity.\" In these windows, specific response methods, technologies, equipment, or products are more effective during clean-up operations for specific oils. The data bases represent the state of the art for response technologies and research in oil spill response.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The strategy provides a standard foundation for rapid and cost effective oil spill response decision-making, and is intended for use by local, state, federal agencies, response planners, clean up organizations (responders), insurance companies, tanker owners, and transporters. It provides policy, planners and decision-makers with a scientifically based and documented \"tool\" in oil spill response that has not been available before.</jats:p>",

This is particularly true where local government decisions impact on people with a range of racial and cultural identities, especially marginalised indigenous people. The authors explore Young's theory of democracy and difference and develop a model of communication and democracy in which all discussions and exchanges between people are inter-related in a spiralling process of decision-making. This model is used to analyse the impact of local government land use decision-making in Broome, Western Australia on local indigenous people. Theoretical concerns with difference can offer insights into the ways in which relations between indigenous and non-indigenous people in Australia are structured. These theoretical arguments, however, need to be carefully related to indigenous concerns and, in this instance, local government relationships with indigenous people over meanings of land and debates about its use. In the case of Broome, only through new ways of thinking about equality and difference, society and justice<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> can there be a reconciliation in local government areas between indigenous and settler Australians. </jats:p>",

Each of 23 people played with two dogs (one familiar, one unfamiliar). Videorecorded participants spoke about 208 words per interaction. Of all words used, eight accounted for more than 50%. Phrases most frequently used and repeated were \"come on\" and \"come here. \" In decreasing order of frequency, sentences ranged from imperatives to attention-getting devices, declaratives about the dogs, and questions. Additional declaratives and talk for the dog rarely occurred. Data support the conclusion that repetitive talk to dogs during play has some conversational aspects, but mostly attempts to control the dog. Little evidence exists for \"on-line\" planning in talk to dogs.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Chronicles the historical development of social policy in Hong Kong since the inception of the colonial government in 1842; identifies that, with the exception of a short‐lived period of expansionism (stimulated by social unrest in the mid‐1960’s) social welfare provision appears to have been low on the government’s agenda and incremental in nature ‐ the emphasis being on economic growth, rather than public spending on welfare programmes. Examines the strengths and weaknesses of this incremental approach; outlines the commitment of the SAR government to the market  economy and its proposals for a modest increase in welfare provision, essentially building on the legacy left behind by the colonial government.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Etzioni's communitarian project is considered in the context of a wave of writings on ‘civic’ themes in recent years. His views are outlined, with a particular emphasis on their political implications, and on his figuration of a politics based on reflecting community voices. It is argued that it is less helpful to view this new communitarianism in the context of sociology, or social science more generally, than to see it as a revival of civic republican ideas which have long influenced discussions in the US public sphere. The implications for democratic arrangements of such a revival are examined: there are problems of compatibility between a politics of civic virtue and modern representative arrangements. In conclusion, the importance of locating and explaining the success of exhortatory public philosophies in complex and far from communal policy processes is emphasised, because whatever flaws this kind of work may exhibit in academic terms are outweighed by its apparent political utility. </jats:p>",

Among major factors contributing to these problems are: societal attitudes, urban-biased development schemes, gender-based discriminatory transport policies, inappropriate spatial organization, and negative trends in the country's economy. The author argues that the uniqueness of women-specific transport problems warrants special and calculated action on the part of planners and policy makers in a developing nation such as Cameroon. Remedial steps, such as altering societal attitudes, lessening and simplifying women's chores, promoting non-motorized modes of transport, reducing trip volume and length by, for instance, revamping antiquated zoning ordinances, and actively discouraging gender-based discrimination in public transportation through appropriate legislation, are suggested.</jats:p>"

A systematic approach, which includes laboratory analysis and computer modelling, has been used to design and plan acid treatment for sandstone formations. Matrix reactivity to acid mixtures (reaction rate) and the relationship between the porosity and permeability are established by subjecting the Pacoota Sandstone core samples to different acid concentrations and injection rates at different temperatures. Based on material balance and reaction kinetics a numerical simulator has been developed and verified in the laboratory. This simulator can adequately predict spent-acid concentration and changes in porosity and permeability as a function of acid penetration depth for given acid treatment conditions (acid concentrations, injection rates and treatment temperatures).</jats:p>"

Through an examination of the constructions of community negotiated and deployed by young British Muslim women she highlights the ways in which different imaginations of community can be both empowering and constraining. </jats:p>",

However, further analysis suggests that the corporate tax rate, and not the apportionment formula, may be driving employment growth. Also, the findings do not support the importance of the throwback rule or the recent trend to overweight the sales factor in attracting economic development to a state.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we argue that as models of profitability and growth within the Marxist tradition have become more formal, they have relied increasingly upon assumptions of equilibrium. An alternative single-region, single-commodity model is proposed in which output, demand, and capital accumulation are independently determined and therefore potentially in disequilibrium. In the short run this means that profitability can be rising or falling, depending upon the rates of growth of demand, supply, and net exports, the rate of capital accumulation, the rate of change of unit costs of production, and the initial starting position of the economy. In the longer run, though, output is limited by the capacity of capital to produce and by the size of the labour force, and demand cannot exceed supply. These constraints place an upper bound on the rate of profit and its growth, a bound that depends on the rate of change in the unit costs of production and on the rate of growth of the labour force. In the longest term, net exports cannot continue to grow, and certain regulatory conditions are deduced: if those conditions are met as equalities then the rate of profit is constant; if they are met as inequalities, the rate of profit falls. </jats:p>",

Previous studies evaluating such programs have relied on anecdotal evidence rather than on data describing actual land use change. A model of land use is specified as a function of socioeconomic factors, land rent, and landowners' characteristics, to examine how well Oregon's land use planning program has protected forests and farmland from development. The empirical model describes the probability that forests and farmland in western Oregon and western Washington were developed to residential, commercial, or industrial uses, before and after Oregon's land use planning program took effect. Land use data are provided by the USDA Forest Service's Forest Inventory and Analysis program. Results suggest that Oregon's land use planning program has concentrated development within urban growth boundaries since its implementation, but its success at reducing the likelihood of development on resource lands located within forest use and exclusive farm use zones remains uncertain.</jats:p>",

This paper questions the exclusive reliance on this traditional belief. Instead, because IS planning requires significant organizational resources, prior IS success is essential to convince top management of the importance of IS planning sophistication. Therefore, IS success may influence IS planning sophistication. Several theoretical arguments are advanced in support of this explanation.</jats:p><jats:p>Data from a survey of 236 academic institutions are used to empirically assess the two alternative directions of the relationship between IS planning sophistication and IS success. Four structural models including the alternative causal directions are evaluated. Two of these models are supported. Together, they imply that for a high level of IS planning sophistication, either the previous ISs should have been successful or the organization should possess advanced information technology capabilities. Thus, empirical results suggest that the explanation presented here (i.e., IS success facilitates IS planning sophistication) provides an equally good alternative to the more traditional explanation (i.e., IS planning sophistication facilitates IS success).</jats:p>",

Instead of an old-established adversarial system, the food industry has allegedly witnessed the development of trust-based partnerships along the supply chain. These have been nurtured by sophisticated retailers apparently in order to secure reliable sources of supply. The author examines the nature, extent, and consequences of this transformation. She argues that, although there is a tendency for buyers to favour ‘known’ suppliers, the role and importance of ‘weak ties’ is subsumed beneath straightforward competitive processes. To the extent that a community of supply-chain partners has been created, its role in terms of filière dynamics is simply one of facilitating and lubricating buyer—supplier relations which retain an underlying rationale: competition between individual actors over the distribution of value added. </jats:p>",

A set of digitized coronal images from a stereotactic rat brain atlas is preprocessed: the images are registered, and the structures of interest plus the bulk of the brain are assigned specific gray levels. The Interactive Data Language (IDL) computing environment is used for volume reconstruction, visualization, and implementing the search procedure. Selected rat brain structures can be analyzed with our method, provided that the preprocessing of the atlas images is performed. As a first application of this method we have identified a set of parameters for which a plane (0.4 mm slice thickness) cut through the rat brain includes as many as possible intact connections between the fornix fibers and the mammilary bodies. Further development of the application will focus on automating the process and extending it to visualization of histochemical and autoradiographic data.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper summarizes a series of investigations to determine whether biomechanical simulations can be used to plan scoliosis surgery by predicting the outcome as a function of choices available to the surgeon. In order to test this idea, simulations have initially been performed with prior knowledge of the real outcome (from postoperative radiographs). In addition, intra-operative measurements of the spine shape and displacement of instrumentation have been used to improve documentation of the influence of different steps in the surgical procedure. Several difficulties have emerged which have given new understanding of both the mode of action of surgical procedures, as well as the biomechanical modeling. 1. Important reduction of the Cobb angle occurs in the anesthetized patient compared to pre-operative (standing) radiographs. 2. For an elastic analysis the stiffness of the spine and rib cage should be known for each anatomical level of each patient. 3. Shape changes in the non-instrumented part of the spine are mainly due to the patient and their muscles, not the instrumentation directly, and are difficult to analyze biomechanically. 4. The large difference in stiffness between the stiffest and the least stiff parts of the model, as well as the large displacements which occur in surgical procedures, create technical difficulties in simulations using finite element modeling. 5. Segmental instrumentation offers surgeons many variables and multistep maneuvers to adapt to individual patients&amp;rsquo; needs, but conversely create many unknown inputs for the biomechanical analyses, and difficulties in validation of model predictions.</jats:p>"

The percentage change in employment is regressed on each of these factor income tax rates separately. Additional tests determine if the statutory rate, overweighting the sales factor, and employing the throwback rule are also correlated with relative changes in employment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>I analyze this research in three components.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In spatial statistics and spatial econometrics two coding schemes are used predominately. Except for some initial work, the properties of both coding schemes have not been investigated systematically. In this paper we do so for significant spatial processes specified as either a simulta-neous autoregressive or a moving average process. Results show that the C-coding scheme emphasizes spatial objects with relatively large numbers of connections, such as those in the interior of a study region. In contrast, the W-coding scheme assigns higher leverage to spatial objects with few connections, such as those on the periphery of a study region. To address this topology-induced heterogeneity, we design a novel S-coding scheme whose properties lie in between those of the C-coding and the W-coding schemes. To compare these three coding schemes within and across the different spatial processes, we find a set of autocorrelation parameters that makes the processes stochastically homologous via a method based on the exact conditional expectation of Moran's I. In the new S-coding scheme the topology induced heterogeneity can be removed in toto for Moran's I as well as for moving average processes and it can be substantially alleviated for autoregressive processes. </jats:p>",

The system simulates the endoprosthetic reconstruction of the hip joint with hemipelvic replacement for bone tumor patients and supports the individual design of anatomically adaptable, modular prostheses. Three-dimensional models of the patient&amp;apos;s hip are generated based on CT data. The surgeon simulates the operation and defines the position and shape of the custom- made endoprosthesis. Stereoscopic visualization and 3D input devices facilitate the navigation and interaction in the virtual environment. Special visualization techniques like texture mapping, color coding of quantitative parameters or transparency support the determination of the correct position and shape of the prosthesis. Furthermore, the system can be used for patient information or educational tasks.</jats:p>"

It is so interwoven with the social and economic structure of all societies, and most conspicuously American society, that its connections and impacts are inextricable from the understanding of the society itself. We do not really understand it in any quantitative sense and are not capable of assessing its real value in our society. What we expect from transportation today has changed sharply from the past. Today there is a whole list of “musts” and “must nots” that define the context in which transportation functions. Transportation seems implicated in everything and is the universal lever for accomplishing public goals. We expect more of transportation today than ever; therefore we need more from our data sources and presumably from planning and policy. This lecture reflects on 35 years of practice and the lessons provided. It concludes that we need new mechanisms for evaluating and justifying transportation investments and policies. We need tools to transmit the basis for investment decisions to the public. </jats:p>",

After processing, an fMR scan was registered to the anatomic scan, and this dataset was registered to a stereotactic CT scan. The imaged functional areas were contoured along with standard anatomical targets. Dose planning was done at first with the functional volumes rendered invisible; the plans were then adjusted as needed using the functional targets. Doses were measured using a dose-volume histogram tool. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; SRS was performed in 12 patients, 1 of whom also underwent SRT. Functional volumes studied included motor cortex in 8 patients, visual in 6 and language in 3; a total of 33 functional targets were imaged. Prescription doses ranged from 12 to 22.5 Gy (mean 19.5 Gy), and the maximum dose to functional volumes from 8 cGy to 18.5 Gy (mean 2.9 Gy). In 6 patients, arc adjustment using functional targets yielded a &gt;50% reduction in dose to at least one functional volume; in all patients, the dose reduction to 50 and 75% of functional volumes averaged 4% (12 cGy) and 13% (30 cGy), respectively, while the reduction of maximal dose averaged 24% (50 cGy). &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; fMRI can be used in SRS to reduce irradiation of eloquent brain using standard prescription doses. Appropriate arc adjustment may allow for escalation of the dose to the targeted lesion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the late 1980s and 1990s, Andean Ecuador experienced the reconfiguration of national ‘imagined community’, thereby making a new civil society. With the aid of research in rural and urban Cotopaxi province—which comprises self-identified indigenous and mestizo populations—I examine how varied notions of community are expressed at the present time. Evidence from Cotopaxi suggests that senses of community are considerably more ambivalent and uncertain than either social movements or nation-centred analysts recognise. Provincial inhabitants of the Ecuadorian Andes have constituted a number of different ‘routes to community’, utilising the various resources, institutions, and cultural practices available to them, and forging an identity and political agenda from within wider circuits of power, capital, and flows. The recommunalisation of Andean society taking place at ‘local’ spatial scales and in diverse arenas—such as religion, civil associations, consumption, land distribution—has profound implications for the projects of nation building by the state, and the mobilisation around an ethnic politics of CONAIE (the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador). Serrano populations formulated a critical political interpretation of the (national) community they comprise, whereas the community of indigenous nationalities offered by CONAIE appears more attractive. </jats:p>",

The probability of a crash, or the Caring Highway variables, may also be studied for policy decisions. Also, by manipulating the exposure element, the model may be used by transportation planners to include road safety in their analysis of transportation impacts. The new model will help authorities—in developed and developing countries—to select the most effective road safety programs and to understand some of the interactions between programs. </jats:p>",

Scenario methodology is related to central issues identified in three contexts that define the environment in which the development of scenarios for transportation systems is likely to take place: strategic planning, regional transportation, and public–private partnerships. Limitations and concerns that are common to many regional transportation plans and strategic-planning activities are presented. The concept of scenarios is introduced. Several functions that scenario planning can perform in the context of regional transportation are discussed. The way in which scenarios address the identified shortcomings in transportation and general planning are highlighted. The province of Mendoza, Argentina, is introduced, and a scenario exercise for its transportation system is outlined. The primary conclusion is that the scenario methodology is an approach that is responsive to the needs and characteristics of modern regional strategic planning. </jats:p>",

Such a methodology was developed, documented, and implemented throughout the state. The methodology was firmly based upon the HCM detailed analysis procedure but had assumptions and defaults that allowed a range of planners to use it effectively. The basic construct was to provide tables of design volumes v and annual average daily traffic that could be achieved for various levels of service and signal spacings for the default parameter values. Two computational tools, implemented in the form of spreadsheet templates as being the most user-friendly and open approach, were provided to users so that they could modify the default settings or specify particular signal spacings and such. The methodology has been in widespread use in Florida, it has served as the basis for the arterial planning technique incorporated into the last update to the HCM, and other states have requested information. The experience with the implementation, including training needs and common user questions, is recounted. </jats:p>",

Present planning practices of rural roads mostly are based on ad hoc approaches, which leads to suboptimal utilization of funds. Presented is a user-friendly model for systematic planning of rural road networks that increases the efficiency of available resources for rural roads. The model provides an all-weather road connection from each village to nearby market centers and education centers at the least cost by generating an optimal rural road network. The model is computer based, which facilitates its effective application. It generates an optimal rural road network by using a heuristic approach that minimizes total transportation cost of the network. The model can be used effectively for preparation of master plans of rural roads. The tasks that can be performed by the model include ( a) identifying the requirements of fresh road construction; ( b) identifying the need for upgrade of an existing road network; ( c) selecting appropriate design and construction standards; ( d) identifying important missing bridges and missing links from an existing rural road network; and ( e) identifying priority links for maintenance in an existing rural road network. Practical applications of the model demonstrate significant advantages over the prevailing practices of rural road planning in India. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:bold>Patient initiatives during the assessment and planning of psychiatric nursing in a hospital environment</jats:bold>¶ The qualitative study reported in this paper aims to describe the planning and assessment of psychiatric nursing in a hospital environment. The theoretical framework consists of the three types of psychiatric nursing outlined in a developmental model of nursing: confirmatory, educational and catalytic. Confirmatory psychiatric nursing is based on a hierarchical and authoritarian model. Educational psychiatric nursing is based on a professionally driven and behavioural model. Catalytic psychiatric nursing is systematic, theoretical, and research‐based. Catalytic psychiatric nursing may vary, depending on the patient’s needs, from confirmatory and educational to situationally determined nursing. However, it always enables patient initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to describe patient initiatives during the assessment and planning of patient care by an interdisciplinary mental health team in a psychiatric hospital environment, and the assessment and planning as described by nurses working in a hospital environment. The data, which were collected in two psychiatric hospitals by videotaping interdisciplinary teamwork situations and recording interviews of nurses afterwards, consisted of 384 pages of written text. A total of 640 sentences were identified in the text as reflecting the assessment of care by the interdisciplinary team and by the nurses working in the hospital environment. Deductive content analysis techniques were used to analyse the written data. The results showed that nursing was described by the nurses to be catalytic in 13% of the cases, while the same nurses assessed psychiatric nursing to be most commonly educational (40%) or confirmatory (47%).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In addressing the intersections between territory-based regional industrial development programs and the challenges faced by firms in the emerging information-based economy, a prerequisite for a more holistic approach to region-wide economic policy development and planning is a public-sector strategic outlook that itself is informed about economic, sectoral and strategic trends and which is built around an understanding of organizational learning. The requirement for public sector ‘know-how’ and ‘know-why’ deviates substantially from past practice wherein the knowledge of sectoral change and economic trends was embedded in separate programs created to provide services to firms. Absent from this model is a feedback loop which builds this understanding into policy making and program design. </jats:p><jats:p> The most common approach to sectoral programming, which involves linking sectoral problems with programmatic interventions, relies on investigations of markets, products, and production processes that form bottlenecks and areas of technological backwardness which require corrective action. Sectoral approaches should be broadened to incorporate a more complex understanding of how information-based competition is altering the business environment. Accomplishing this requires a new approach to firm-based support services that feeds directly into regional planning functions and seeks to improve this environment for both citizens and the business community. </jats:p>",

We address problems that arise in scaling this approach to handle complex behavioral requirements. We propose a dynamics that operates in the space of task constraints, determining the relative contribution of each constraint to the behavioral dynamics. Competition among task constraints is able to deal with problems that arise when combining constraint contributions, making it possible to specify tasks that are mome complex than simple navigation. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we design a system of two agents to perform a cooperative navigation task We show how competition among constraints enables agents to make decisions regarding which behavior to execute in a given situation, resulting in the execution of sequences of behaviors that satisfy task requirements. We discuss the scalability of the competitive-dynamics approach to the design of more complex autonomous systems. </jats:p>",

This paper documents the introduction of person-centred planning in a community-based agency serving people with intellectual disabilities in Ireland. Committed to the extension of Supported Employment and to local options for service users, the authors and their colleagues reviewed the key elements of a futures planning process. Direct-care staff completed questionnaires relating to the outcomes of planning for sixteen service users. The findings affirm the importance of work outcomes for individuals. Recommendations are made for individualised training for those taking part in person-centred planning, for the inclusion of allies in the community who are not paid members of staff and for recognition of the demands placed on members of staff during periods of transition in service agencies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The advent of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) has changed the transportation planning world in three ways. First, it has created an information-rich environment, providing transportation managers with a more informed view of the “state of the network.” Second, it has high-lighted the importance of operating and managing transportation systems through the introduction of transportation services. Third, it has enabled the management of transportation systems on a regional scale. These three factors reveal the need for a framework that can ( a) guide the distribution of information and ( b) govern the deployment of services on a regional scale. A proposed framework for achieving these tasks is a regional architecture, which is conceived as a new output of the transportation planning process. Inspired by the regional architectures in the ITS context, the definition goes beyond ITS, using this concept in planning for the entire regional intermodal transportation system. Five objectives are pursued. First, “regional architecture” is defined. Second, what a regional architecture might look like is illustrated. Third, a frame-work for integrating regional architectures into the transportation planning process is proposed. Fourth, how regional architectures can address shortcomings in existing transportation planning processes is discussed. Fifth, some basic steps that transportation planners can take toward the development of a regional architecture are outlined. In pursuing these objectives, an endeavor is made to advance the state of the art in regional strategic transportation planning. </jats:p>",

Mn/DOT has adopted the philosophy of performance-based planning as the method to integrate planning and programming. Mn/DOT’s planning and programming process will be used to develop District Long-Range Plans and to produce the next update of the Statewide Transportation Plan. Performance measures and performance targets, which were developed for the outcomes of safety, quality of ride, condition of infrastructure, and basic levels of service, will be used to develop the district plans. Economic efficiency will be evaluated through the use of benefit-cost analysis for expansion projects. Values of Minnesota’s citizens will be considered through customer input. Two futures will be developed for the district plans. Future 1 will be constrained not by available funding but rather by the three investment principles of system performance, economic efficiency, and values of Minnesota’s citizens. Future 2 will be fiscally constrained and based on a 20-year financial forecast. It will be used to develop the State Transportation Improvement Program to link the planning process to the development of a program. Principle-Based Future 1 will be compared with Fiscally Constrained Future 2 to develop unmet needs. The difference will represent needs derived from a sound, analytical planning process. Results from the district plans will be incorporated into the next Statewide Transportation Plan. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The detection and correction of malocclusions and other dental abnormalities is a significant area of work in orthodontic diagnosis. To assess the quality of occlusion between the teeth the orthodontist has to estimate distances between specific points located on the teeth of both arches. Distance measuring is based on the observation, by the orthodontist, of a plaster model of the mouth. Gathering of information required to make the diagnosis is a time consuming and costly operation. On the other hand, obtaining and manipulation of plaster casts constitute a huge problem in clinics, due to both the large space needed and high costs associated with plaster casts manufacturing. For this problem we present a new system for three-dimensional orthodontic treatment planning and movement of teeth. We describe a computer vision technique for the acquisition and processing of three-dimensional images of the profile of hydrocolloids dental imprints taken by mean of a own developed 3D laser scanner. Profile measurement is based on the triangulation method which detects deformation of the projection of a laser line on the dental imprints. The system is computer-controlled and designed to achieve depth and lateral resolutions of 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm, respectively, within a depth range of 40 mm. The developed diagnosis software system (named MAGALLANES) and the 3D laser scanner (named 3DENT) are both commercially available and have been designed to replace manual measurement methods, which use costly plaster models, with computer measurements methods and teeth movement simulation using cheap hydrocolloid dental wafers. This procedure will reduce the cost and acquisition time of orthodontic data and facilitate the conduct of epidemiological studies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Accessibility indices (AIs) for public and private transport were estimated in a pilot study in northeast Hampshire, England. The AIs were based on a formulation relating travel time and cost between specified origins and destinations (O-Ds). Wider use of the role of the indices was examined, particularly for reducing car dependency as one element in improving sustainability within the North East Hampshire Transport Strategy. The indices, which can be presented in simplified graphical fashion to inform nontechnical audiences, are based on door-to-door travel times and costs, and the O-Ds represent trips between home and important destinations. Significantly, the only example in which travel-cost AIs for bus versus car travel were approximately equal was that in which a substantial car-parking charge was made. The AIs thus help to indicate the transport corridors where actions to improve equity in transport opportunities for users have the greatest priority and potential. These actions, such as improved bus priority and varying fare levels, parking charges, and other user charges, can be verified by prescriptive use of the AIs to illustrate the impacts. This approach provides a basis for using the AIs to quickly examine future transport scenarios and in associated decision making. It also helps in focusing on detailed modal shift analysis aimed at reshaping the transport system in a sustainable manner. This process is described within the context of strategic transport planning at county and regional levels, and continuing work on the theory and applications of the AIs is outlined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Washington State Ferries (WSF) system has grown tremendously since its ferry terminals were constructed more than 40 years ago. Vehicle traffic is at capacity, and future plans must maximize intermodal transfers of passengers from transit to ferries. WSF has completed master plans addressing this issue at six ferry terminals. The master plans for Anacortes and Bainbridge Island are addressed, and each has unique conditions. Bainbridge is a commuter terminal, has the system’s largest traffic volumes, and is planned for 218-car, 2,500-passenger vessels operating on 35-min average headways. Anacortes, a tourist-driven facility, serves one international and four domestic routes. Although physically the largest terminal, it is also the most remote and has the longest waits. The primary methodology for planning ferry terminals is to separate travel modes for safe and efficient travel and to minimize intermodal transfer time. Direct links are needed for passengers from public transit and rail systems to ferries. Each terminal accomplishes this with similar, but unique, site-adapted solutions. Each terminal is planned using data developed for the project. Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act is analyzed using special programs. Passenger counts and growth curves are developed from WSF’s systemwide planning and processed to predict future modal splits. Fast, efficient, safe ferry terminals must separate modes of travel. Passengers must be able to transfer between travel modes with minimal time. Over-water coverage and environmental regulations offer challenges unique to ferry terminals. For success, each ferry terminal master plan must address these issues. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Des Moines Area Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) completed an early deployment study for the Des Moines, Iowa, metropolitan area in late 1997. The purpose of the study was to develop a strategic plan for intelligent transpotation systems (ITS) deployment and to provide initiative for the development of an ITS infrastructure. When FHWA sponsored the Des Moines metropolitan area’s early deployment study, Des Moines was the smallest metropolitan area to undertake such a study. Therefore, there were no similarly sized urban areas from which to draw examples. Furthermore, although the metropolitan area and traffic volumes are growing, congestion is not seen as a significant problem in Des Moines. As a result of minimal traffic congestion, there was and is some skepticism among the transportation stakeholders in the need for ITSs. The development of an ITS infrastructure is seen as even more problematic when the capital requirements for ITS must compete with the capital requirements of other, traditional transportation improvements. Despite the initial skepticism regarding the need for ITS and the ability to afford ITS, Des Moines-area transportation stakeholders have become very supportive of the initiatives identified in the plan. The generation of support for an ITS was developed through two galvanizing issues. The first was a focus on the safety benefits of an ITS as opposed to congestion reduction benefits. The second was to focus on the use of an ITS to mitigate the impacts of the reconstruction of I-235. I-235 cuts across Des Moines, running through the north side of the central business district, and has been the single most important factor in forging commuting and development patterns in the Des Moines area. As a result, arterial streets that parallel I-235 will be greatly affected by the diversion of traffic from I-235, which is likely to occur during reconstruction. An ITS’s ability to manage traffic under dynamic conditions provided an incentive for transportation stakeholders to rally behind the ITS strategic plan. The process used to develop the plan and review the plan’s recommendations is discussed. One of the issues that the plan attempts to address is the identification of technology appropriate for an urban area the size of Des Moines. </jats:p>",

SPM allows for the examination of peak-hour person movement for different types of facilities within a corridor and estimates the associated public costs (e.g., right-of-way, construction, operation, congestion, and environmental costs). The objective of SPM is to find the alternative with the lowest total public cost. It was decided to enhance SPM by adding toll lanes and high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes as alternatives for evaluation against other combinations of general-purpose lanes, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, and express lanes. The results of this project confirmed previous findings that low- and moderate-demand facilities are best served by improving general-purpose lanes in the corridor and, in some cases, by adding express lanes. Using the criteria of lowest total public cost, the evaluation of toll lanes in the test corridors showed that congested corridors with all toll lanes or with combinations of general-purpose and toll lanes did not perform as well as the alternatives, which included a combination of general-purpose and HOV lanes. However, the alternatives that combined general-purpose lanes with HOT lanes tended to perform as well as—and in some cases, slightly better than—HOV lanes. </jats:p>",

The new Highway Development and Management Tool (HDM-4) now caters to strategic planning, work programming, and project preparation. Strategic planning involves the analysis of the road system as a whole, typically requiring the preparation of short- or long-term estimates of expenditure for road development and preservation under various budgetary and economic scenarios. Work programming involves the preparation, under budget constraints, of multiyear road work and expenditure programs in which sections of the network likely to require improvement are identified and listed by priority. Project preparation is the final stage in which the economic benefits of road schemes are analyzed before implementation. The optimization methods developed for the strategy and program applications of HDM-4, which use incremental benefit-cost ratios in the prioritization process, are described. </jats:p>",

The concept of system capacity (as opposed to link or facility capacity) is developed, and prior literature is reviewed for approaches to estimating it. A model that was developed from the most promising of these is presented. This model is multimodal in concept and is intended to be applicable to any vehicular freight mode.

Existing knowledge about high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane cases can provide quantitative and qualitative information to support decisions about proposed HOV lanes. Using case-based reasoning (CBR) to formalize the use of historical cases, a computer program called PLAN⋄HOV is demonstrated. CBR complements formal modeling by systematically presenting knowledge to users in situations in which formal models are under development or qualitative information is important. PLAN⋄HOV is a planning tool developed in a geographic information system environment that allows users to understand the potential impacts of proposed HOV lanes on the basis of experiences with similar HOV lanes. All historical HOV lane cases represented in PLAN⋄HOV have HOV lane attributes, associated impacts, and the implementation context. In addition, historical cases contain information about lessons learned, such as inferences about their success or failure, prescriptions, and case quality. The historical cases can be accessed by matching them with the dimensions of the current context (e.g., population and network structure) and the proposed HOV lane actions, such as adding a 2+-person HOV lane that operates during peak periods. The retrieval and display of historical cases can occur with varying levels of matching stringency. Users can examine the matched case(s) for their qualitative content (such as controversies over HOV lanes) and also use them to anticipate the impacts of the proposed lane (e.g., mode shift caused by HOV lanes).

A recent review of the methods of planning and implementing manufacturing cells indicates that the visual capability of VR could assist the planning process. Current planning methods are restricted by two-dimensional and three-dimensional modelling systems, which provide visual representation of the cells but lack the full user interaction. This paper describes the framework of an immersive VR approach to the planning and implementation of manufacturing cells in which the planner enters the modelled world of the application. </jats:p>",

The procedure that is described investigates airport and airline impacts of VLCA operations using a systems engineering approach to understand the trade-offs between economic and technological operational factors. Specific topics discussed in this analysis are ( a) the effect of VLCA on airport capacity, ( b) development of new geometric design guidelines, ( c) landside impacts and gate compatibility issues, ( d) airside capacity impacts, and ( e) possible noise and pavement design impacts. These aspects are modeled using the Systems Dynamics methodology, which permits a blend of technological and socioeconomic variables into the same model. Realistic parametric templates of feasible aircraft designs are defined using computer methods, and the impacts of proposed designs in airport operations, capacity, and economics are explored. The analysis focuses on the airside and landside capacity, geometric design constraints, and pavement and acoustic impacts of VLCA operations. A systems engineering perspective is used when aircraft design inputs have quantifiable outcomes on airport capacity, on infrastructure changes, and ultimately, on the cost of operations. Cost-effective ways to facilitate the operations of VLCA at existing and future airports are identified, including new design guidelines. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most transportation infrastructure planning studies are conducted with only a few alternative networks and land use scenarios. Generally, these studies analyze only a few transportation-related measures of effectiveness, such as vehicle-miles traveled, congestion, and air-quality emissions. When such a small subset of possible alternatives and variables is analyzed, it is probable that optimal alternative designs are not included. Ideally, all combinations of land use, infrastructure, and social variables would be examined; however, even a small city of 200 traffic zones with an average of 10 land uses will have more than 10<jats:sub>200</jats:sub> possible zoning alternatives. A more efficient way to examine an extremely large search set of feasible designs is to employ artificial intelligence techniques to quickly narrow the number of alternatives to be considered. The use of a multiobjective genetic algorithm model to optimize land use, infrastructure, social, and fiscal variables is demonstrated. The model considers three primary objective functions: minimizing travel time, minimizing per capita cost (as related to property taxes), and minimizing land use change. A large number of constraints are used. A Pareto fitness function is used to develop a small set of optimal solutions. The model was applied to Provo, Utah, which is a fast-growing community. More than 1.9 million alternative designs were evaluated, and 195 optimal Pareto plans were found. The Pareto set of optimal solutions indicated that solutions clustering higher-density development along existing arterials were most likely to meet the objectives. </jats:p>",

Here we relate that diffusion to economic and social policy, by using approaches from population and community ecology and quantitative geography. We find that patterns of deindustrialization driven by cold war policies have interacted synergistically with the ‘planned shrinkage’ hollowing-out of poor minority inner-city communities, and with the canonical national travel pattern dominated by the largest cities, to create conditions for the rapid spread of emerging infections. Application of this model to AIDS explains over 92% of the variance in observed case numbers through June 1995 for the 25 largest US metropolitan regions containing 113 million people. ‘Resilience’ analysis of the empirical AIDS model reveals that emerging infections, social disintegration, and national travel patterns constitute a sensitive ‘resonant eigensystem’ which greatly amplifies the impact of such perturbations as recent draconian welfare ‘reforms’. We conclude that ‘neoliberal’ and cold war policies have eroded the foundations of public health in the USA to the extent that emerging infections, including multiple-drug-resistant tuberculosis, now constitute a serious security threat. Remedies must include significant progressive reforms, which we discuss at some length, to correct a long-term policy imbalance whose consequences have placed at increasing risk a large and growing fraction of the country's population. </jats:p>",
