      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the 1990s a strategic approach to the organization of space at different levels of scale became more prevalent. Increasingly, it is being assumed that the solutions to complex problems depend on the ability to combine the creation of strategic visions with short-term actions. The creation of strategic visions implies the design of shared futures, and the development and promotion of common assets. Moreover, all of this requires accountability within a time and budgetary framework and the creation of awareness for the systems of power. Delivering on these new demands implies the development of an adapted strategic planning capacity and a shift in planning style in which the stakeholders are becoming more actively involved in the planning process on the basis of a joint definition of the action situation and of the sharing of interests, aims, and relevant knowledge. In this paper I aim to provide building blocks for such an ‘alternative’ strategic (spatial) planning approach. It is based on two different sources. The first source is critical planning literature and strategic thinking in business, which will be used to broaden the scope of the concept. The second source consists of European strategic planning practices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In part 1 of our paper on the architecture of a component-based knowledge-based planning support system (KBPSS), we briefly introduced the ModelObjects model-management component and the KBSAgents knowledge-management component of the system. In this part we further examine the issues of model management and knowledge development in the ModelObjects and KBSAgents components. Model generalization and representation of ModelObjects are defined according to object-oriented methods and techniques. These procedures allow users to understand how planning models are processed in the system environment; and how the models in the system libraries can be reused to build more flexible domain models based on the users' problem definition and the interaction with the system interface. The model-retrieval and model-execution functions in ModelObjects can be further enhanced by KBSAgents from which model knowledge is constructed and managed; and models can be easily retrieved and selected on the basis of the user's request and the input to the system. To support model and model-knowledge development in KBSAgents, a frame-type object-oriented model-knowledge representation scheme is defined and constructed in the system. We discuss knowledge-based model selection by developing an Intelligent Model Selection System, an application subsystem in KBPSS which combines the functions of ModelObjects and KBSAgents and can be applied to assist users to select appropriate models from the model library for their problems. Throughout the paper, spatial interaction models are used as an example to illustrate the procedures and processes proposed in the system. </jats:p>",

This paper introduces for the first time a classification of towns and cities with regard to the composition of land use in their built-up areas. The analysis used for this classification process is based on a large and unique land-use database gathered from a wide sample of towns and cities in Israel. A combination of two multivariate procedures served the classification process. A hierarchical cluster analysis was employed to define groups of cities with similar land-use patterns, and a discriminant analysis was conducted to test the intervalidity of the adopted cluster solution and the statistically significant differences among the clusters. The proposed typology does not derive from the socioeconomic characteristics of the population residing in these cities. Rather, it relates to the location of the city and the function that the city fulfills in the region. </jats:p>",

This article provides a unifying conceptual framework, presents examples of the purchaser‐provider relationship in countries at different income levels, and identifies important supporting mechanisms for quality‐based purchasing. As countries become wealthier, a higher proportion of healthcare spending is channeled through pooled arrangements, allowing for greater involvement of purchasers in promoting the quality of service provision.</jats:p><jats:p>Global and line item budgets are the most common type of provider payment system in low and middle‐income countries. In these countries, improving public hospital performance through contracting and incentives is a key issue. In middle and high‐income countries, there are several documented examples of governments contracting to private or non‐governmental health care providers, resulting in higher perceived quality of care and lower delivery costs. Encouraging quality through employer purchasing arrangements has been promoted in several countries, particularly the United States.</jats:p><jats:p>Community‐based financing schemes are an increasingly common form of health financing in parts of sub‐Saharan Africa and Asia, but these schemes still cover less than 10% of national populations in countries in which they are active. To date, there is little evidence of their impact on healthcare quality.</jats:p><jats:p>The availability of information—concerning healthcare service provision and outcomes—determines the options for establishing and monitoring contract provisions and promoting quality. Regardless of the context, quality‐based purchasing depends critically on information—reporting, monitoring, and providing useful information to healthcare consumers. In many low and middle‐income countries, the lack of availability of information is the principal constraint on measuring performance, a critical component of quality‐based purchasing.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been much research over the past decade on aspects of bus-transit-system service and performance. Common to studies is the necessity that the population served by systems be estimated. Usually this entails delineating areas for which demand is covered through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), as well as deciding on how best to represent potential ridership spatially. However, little attention has been paid to spatial issues inherent in these choices. Research has emphasized the modeling of transit problems using GIS rather than giving explicit attention to the spatial considerations underlying analyses. To this end, we investigate issues of spatial representation in transit studies. A GIS-based analysis of bus transit for a small urban municipality is utilized to highlight that estimates of service coverage are sensitive to the choice of areal units representing ridership (scale), whether individual stops or routes are used to determine access, and how network versus Euclidean distances affect estimates. As such, spatial representation and modeling sensitivity are evaluated in the context of transit-service provision. The study results suggest that representation issues are critical in evaluating transit access in the context of planning and policy development using GIS. </jats:p>",

Previous work on the toll-design problem focused on the deterministic case, that is, it is assumed that travelers have perfect information on the cost of traveling on every route of the network and they always choose the one with the least cost. Limited literature is available on the stochastic case and most of it is focused on marginal social cost pricing with the underlying assumption that all links can be tolled. In this study, a toll-design problem based on stochastic route-choice behavior for multiple user groups is presented under a more realistic context—only a subset of links can be tolled. The methodology is tested with real-world network data. The performance of various algorithms is also discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although households' general preference for low-density residential environments is well documented in the literature, little research in geography and urban planning has explicitly investigated how many and which households experience a state of mismatch in terms of land-use patterns between their preferred residential neighborhood type and the type of neighborhood where they currently reside. Using data from 1358 commuters living in three communities in the San Francisco Bay Area, in this study we find that nearly a quarter of the residents live in a neighborhood type that does not match their land-use related preferences. The results of an investigation of the determinants of such dissonance are consistent with existing knowledge about residential preferences. It is shown that single suburban dwellers and large households and families in the city are more likely to be mismatched, or experience higher levels of mismatch in terms of neighborhood type. Further, the extent of mismatch is clearly related to automobile orientation, as well as to lifestyles and personality traits. The results suggest that policies aiming to attract a diverse market to neotraditional, high-density neighborhoods may not be as effective as decisionmakers and planners hope. If a broad range of households is artificially attracted to such new developments (for example, through providing financial advantages or other policy incentives), this might on average result in lower levels of residential satisfaction, higher residential mobility, lower sense of community, and enduring auto dependency. On the other hand, it is encouraging to see that there is also a substantial proportion of suburban dwellers preferring high-density environments. Relaxation of land-use laws in existing suburban communities might be successful in reducing residential neighborhood type dissonance for these types of suburban dwellers, but perhaps at the cost of increasing dissonance for the suburbanites preferring lower densities. It would be valuable to investigate whether there is a mix of densities and uses that would optimally satisfy both types of preferences. </jats:p>",

The model focuses on a study site in a region of the Amazon frontier, characterized by the development of family farms on 100-ha lots arranged along the Transamazon highway and a series of side roads, west of Altamira, Brazil. The model simulates the land-use behaviour of farming households on the basis of a heuristic decisionmaking strategy that utilizes burn quality, subsistence requirements, household characteristics, and soil quality as key factors in the decisionmaking process. Farming households interact through a local labour pool. The effects of the land-use decisions made by households affect the land cover of their plots and ultimately that of the region. This paper describes this model, referred to as LUCITA, and presents preliminary results showing land-cover changes that compare well with observed land-use and land-cover changes in the region. </jats:p>",

The restructuring of the coal industry involved large-scale population movement from declining areas to more productive areas including Cannock Chase. New housing estates were constructed to house these migrants. In this paper we review aspects of the location and design of these estates, and discuss a long-term study of the experiences of miners and their families in a new physical and cultural context. The long distance of their move led to cultural isolation, which was reinforced by the location and design of the estates. The lack of estate facilities persisted for years after their construction. Several of the estates are now problem estates requiring massive investment. But the cohesion of the mining community distinguishes these estates from other studies of migration to new suburban estates. </jats:p>",

The study compared the performance of the new Family Health Program (<jats:italic>Programa Saúde da Família</jats:italic> or PSF) with traditional primary care facilities using data from facility surveys and key informant interviews. The main results include: (a) the methodology was capable of distinguishing between the two types of primary care services in the municipality; (b) the PSF clinics scored higher on most dimensions of primary care, although in some areas the traditional health units had equivalent scores; and (c) data obtained from interviewing key informants was generally compatible with that obtained by conducting facility surveys. The results suggests that in spite of making important advances in primary care, the municipality of Petrópolis continues to face several challenges including the need to improve access, enforce the gatekeeper role of primary care, and improve the coordination and community orientation of both types of primary care services. The methodology could be used to set objectives and monitor progress towards improving the organization and delivery of primary care in Petrópolis and elsewhere.

The article is based on studies of seven lean production‐inspired projects in the Swedish health care sector, a sector already poor due to organizational slack. The projects were directed to develop ‘health care chains’, an organizational concept regarded as a way to rationalize health care organizations as well as to develop them, i.e. increase productivity, quality from a customer perspective and quality of working conditions. The article analyses the projects from an interpretative perspective and discusses how modern management models with ambitions to concurrently rationalize and develop organizations—e.g. lean production and health care chains—are used in a ‘meagre’ organizational field. As an outcome, a model is presented that explores what is beyond simple imitations and unique translations of ideas when a new concept is implemented in local organizations.

Simplifications are carried out by modeling natural events. Models give us the opportunity to input values representing the observed values of natural phenomena to see what the possible outcome would be. Water is one of the few natural substances without which human beings cannot survive. Water use, therefore, is much more complicated because it has to reconcile an irregular or random natural phenomenon and humans attitudes towards it, which is not less complicated than water in nature itself. Therefore, it has to be managed by employing complicated computer‐based mathematical models. The spatial and temporal dimensions of this complicated issue can then be handled. These modeling studies are generally referred to as water resources planning (WRP). WRP can be defined as matching future demands to potential resources, satisfying some preset objectives such as cost‐effectiveness or environmental quality. The end product of water resources planning is a development plan for some future period, normally 20 to 30 years. As such, WRP mainly encompasses three types of activities:\n            <jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n              <jats:list-item>\n                <jats:p>assessment of available water resources,</jats:p>\n              </jats:list-item>\n              <jats:list-item>\n                <jats:p>assessment of future water requirements, and</jats:p>\n              </jats:list-item>\n              <jats:list-item>\n                <jats:p>matching between available resources and forecast demands.</jats:p>\n              </jats:list-item>\n            </jats:list>\n          </jats:p>",

The data are from a survey of public sector health care providers carried out in January 2002 and repeated in August 2003 using an interviewer administered structured questionnaire. It is part of a continuous quality improvement (CQI) effort in the health sector in the Greater Accra region of Ghana. Workplace obstacles identified that caused dissatisfaction and de‐motivated staff in order of the most frequently mentioned were low salaries such that obtaining basic necessities of daily living becomes a problem; lack of essential equipment, tools and supplies to work with; delayed promotions; difficulties and inconveniences with transportation to work; staff shortages; housing, additional duty allowances and in‐service (continuous) training. Others included children's education, vehicles to work with such as ambulances and pickups, staff transfer procedures, staff pre‐service education inadequate for job requirements, and the effect of the job on family and other social factors. There were some differences in the percentages of staff selecting a given workplace obstacle between the purely rural districts, the highly urbanized Accra metropolis and the districts that were a mixture of urbanized and rural. It is unlikely that the Ghana Health Service can provide high quality of care to its end users (external customers) if workplace obstacles that de‐motivate staff (internal customers) and negatively influence their performance are not properly recognized and addressed as a complex of inter‐related problems producing a common result—dissatisfied poorly motivated staff and resulting poor quality services.

The surveys may include static and flowing bottom hole pressure measurements, pressure transient studies, production logging, pulsed neutron capture logging and flow rate measurements. The measured or interpreted values include reservoir pressure, productivity index, reservoir permeability, well efficiency, flow capacity, water saturation, fluid contacts and flow rates of oil, gas and water. These values, when appropriately grouped and mapped, indicate the reservoir performance and fluid flow movement. However, the asset needs to be managed with limited surveillance every year. This brings into focus the need to optimally select the candidate wells or completions. Surveillance is planned with an objective to minimize the uncertainty in the measured values. This results in maximizing understanding of the reservoir performance leading to sound reservoir monitoring and better business decisions. Continuity, productivity, probability &amp; uncertainty maps are regularly prepared using Kriging. Measurement errors are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. The maps quickly reveal the need to have surveillance in particular wells/completions. The important contributions of the value-driven surveillance planning include Data integration of well and reservoir performance including all the surveillance and well integrity data.Analysis and interpretation of surveillance data becomes a prerequisite for requisitioning surveillance. Mapping and analyzing interpreted data becomes an integral part of any surveillance process.Intuition and subjectivity in surveillance planning is substituted by an objective method based on robust geostatistics.Surveillance data becomes more visible to the team. This generates team involvement, better quality of information and a shared understanding of reservoir management needs.</jats:p>",

Public values for agricultural land preservation have translated into public support for establishing agricultural land preservation programs at the local, state, and federal levels. A mixture of both regulatory and incentive‐based approaches have resulted in the permanent protection of nearly 1.5 million acres of agricultural land from conversion to nonagricultural uses and the concentration of millions of more acres in agricultural production through zoning. The failure of land markets to reflect the social value of extensive land uses relative to intensive uses and the irreversibility of land‐use intensification decisions create a particularly fluid and pressing policy environment for lay people, land‐use practitioners, and researchers alike. We provide a brief overview of the issues and resources and ongoing programs directly influencing agricultural land protection and land‐use policy. We pay particular attention to resources and information available on the Internet, recognizing the rapidly changing environment in this policy arena.</jats:p>",

However, there is no evidence that approaches designed to address issues in a given organizational context have the same effect in another one where issues present differently.</jats:p><jats:p>Along the epistemological paradigm of realistic evaluation proposed by Pawson and Tilley, we use Mintzberg's organizational models to compare the configurations of European and African health care organizations and the trends followed by the quality management movement in both contexts. We illustrate how European health systems traditionally emphasize professional autonomy while African health systems are structured as command and control hierarchical systems. We illustrate how the quality movement in Europe emphasizes standardization of procedures, a characteristic of a mechanistic organization, while excessive standardization is part of the quality problem in Africa.</jats:p><jats:p>We suggest that instilling professionalism may be a way forward for the quality movement in Africa to improve patient focus and responsiveness of responsible professionals. We also suggest that our interpretation of broad trends and contrasts may be used as a useful departure point to study the wide contextual diversity of the African experience with quality management.

In this paper, the reliability and validity of one‐, two‐ and three‐component models of commitment are examined within a business‐to‐business context. The results indicate that the three‐component model incorporating instrumental, affective and normative dimensions is superior on both substantive and empirical grounds. It is subsequently argued that marketing planners need to demand that marketing researchers are more precise when incorporating commitment into conceptual and empirical studies, and account for these distinct components either by explicitly including or omitting them. It is also argued that marketing managers can enhance channel relationships if they are cognisant of the three distinct types of attitudinal commitments when formulating channel management tactics and strategies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>“Scripted behaviour” underpins many repetitive and routine tasks, such as grocery shopping, where it is observed that some shoppers take a list and others do not. The notion of “scripts” is used to examine the underlying reasons for the presence and absence of grocery shopping lists on major weekly or two‐weekly shopping trips to supermarkets. Little if any current information exists in marketing literature to fully explain the reasons for the presence or absence of lists, though it is known that such behaviour affects purchase activity in supermarkets. Set in New Zealand, this exploratory and preliminary study examines the shopping list being a moderator of purchase behaviour. It confirms previous research into the differences between list and non‐list grocery shoppers and suggests that far more planning occurs amongst all grocery shoppers than might be expected. The study reveals that some grocery shoppers, regardless of the presence or absence of a written shopping list, have a flexible approach to grocery shopping that is part of their overall shopping script. It is suggested that supermarket retailing planners could act on this intelligence in such a way as to support shoppers' pre‐planning, and thereby protect or increase their share of custom.</jats:p>",

We identify some of the major factors causing the observed change in marketing practice. We then describe a classification scheme that is based on transaction marketing and relationship marketing, each of which is characterised using five marketing exchange dimensions and four managerial dimensions. The two general marketing perspectives encompass five distinct types of marketing: transaction marketing, database marketing, e‐marketing, interaction marketing, and network marketing. We consider real‐life (mainly European) companies that have implemented these different marketing approaches. Finally, we deal with the pedagogical contributions including an examination of how it is possible for business schools to teach the subject of marketing from a relationship marketing perspective in such a way that the relevance and quality of teaching and research in relationship marketing is useful to students, faculty, and the business community.</jats:p>",

Small/family hotel businesses are characterised by a number of specific business processes which generate particular training and educational needs. It is increasingly clear that small businesses are not miniature versions of larger ones, but they have different structures, priorities and strategic objectives. This paper investigates a number of management areas, such as: planning, strategy development and behaviour in these enterprises, to determine skill and competency gaps. A survey of small family hotel businesses in Austria was carried out in 2003. Performance, growth and internal management procedures were assessed to analyse problem areas and to identify the lacking skills in the tourism industry. The results demonstrate areas of tourism training and education for family hotel businesses.</jats:p>",

Cross-cultural test design issues are illustrated by providing examples or by referring to research findings. Finally, some thoughts are provided related to who should develop the test plan when a multicultural test is to be developed.  Opsomming In die lig van die feit dat baie min toetse in Suid-Afrika ontwikkel is vanuit ‘n multikulturele perspektief, poog hierdie artikel om die stappe uiteen te sit vir die ontwikkeling van ‘n toetsplan vir ‘n toets wat in ‘n multikulturele konteks gebruik sal word. Die gebruiklike komponente van ‘n toetsplan word uiteengesit en uitgebrei in terme van aspekte wat in ag geneem moet word wanner ‘n toets vanuit ‘n multikulturele perspektief beplan word. Kruiskulturele ontwerp aspekte word geïllustreer deur gebruik te maak van voorbeelde of om na navorsing te verwys.

This approach recognizes the importance of both a healthy environment and access to natural resources. Each of these factors is an implicit element of human security, a political concept that promotes the protection of human lives and livelihoods. Ecosystem management acknowledges the role of humans as an integral part of the ecosystem; however, it does not define the ways in which humans and the ecosystem interact. This lack of definition makes the practical application of ecosystem management difficult.In this paper, we examine the application of ecosystem management principles in British Columbia's Clayoquot Sound. We propose that human security can act as an imperative for the expanded consideration of social networks and environmental pathways in the practice of ecosystem management. Theories from the social and natural sciences are supplied to support the science-based application of ecosystem management. These underpinnings enable managers to better define ecosystem boundaries and to integrate expanded social networks into management plans.</jats:p>"

A number of strategic aims based on major principles of territory transport planning have been formulated. The investigation made has shown that the operation of public transport is not closely connected with the main carcass of urban territories. This decreases the efficiency of public transport, making it less popular and competitive compared to automobiles. The creation of the strategy of public transport development for the period of its integration into the EU system requires the use of methods taking into account territory planning and social and economic development of the country. The integration of new territories into the existing transportation system, optimization of routes and the increase of transport service quality are aimed to provide higher living standards and better social and economic conditions for the inhabitants. The appropriate tactical decisions in planning the development of modern passenger transport may be made only if the harmonized and well‐grounded strategic aims are defined.</jats:p>",

PFP deserves academic recognition and additional academic research in the area. It would be extremely useful if a separate personal financial planning theory were articulated. The author presents building blocks for that theory. Furthermore, PFP coursework and textbooks should be elevated in academic content to place them on a par with the corporate finance and investments areas. With proper support, PFP is likely to achieve the greater prominence it deserves alongside other well-recognized academic financial areas and other professional disciplines. </jats:p>",

It leases thermoluminescent badges that record radioactive exposure over a prespecified time period. As each recording cycle ends, ABC must send refurbished (or new) badges to the customers before they return the old badges to ensure continuous monitoring. It then measures, recalibrates, and refurbishes the returned badges for future use. We developed an integrated system that could help ABC to manage its purchasing schedule for new badges so it can meet a target customer service level with minimal inventory. We ran our integrated system using the data ABC provided and found that our system could have helped ABC to reduce its inventory level by 17.7 percent and its costs by $820,000 within a six-month period. </jats:p>",

Work summarized here accounts for spatial autocorrelation by including latent map pattern components as covariates in a model specification. These components derive from the surface zonation scheme used to aggregate attribute data, to construct a geographic weights matrix, and to evaluate geographic variability. The illustrative data analysis is based upon field plot observations for the pathogen Phytophthora capsici that causes disease in pepper plants. Results are compared with pseudolikelihood and Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation techniques, both for the empirical example and for two simulation experiments associated with it. The principal finding is that synthetic map pattern variables, which are eigenvectors computed for a geographic weights matrix, furnish an alternative, successful way of capturing spatial dependency effects in the mean response term of a logistic regression model, avoiding altogether the need to use other than traditional standard techniques to estimate model parameters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cosmopolis is a concept that has a long history in many cultures around the globe. It is a mirroring of the ‘social’ and ‘natural’ worlds, such that in one is seen the order and the structures of the other—a mutual ‘mapping’. In this paper I examine how the presence of cosmopolis—a Christianised cosmopolis of the European Middle Ages—was made evident in the representation and formation of cities at that time. I reveal a dualism between the social and spatial ordering of both city and cosmos which defined and reinforced social and spatial boundaries in urban landscapes, evident for example in the 11th and 12th centuries. Recently, Toulmin (1992) has taken the idea of cosmopolis to argue that it has been a persistent presence in Western-Enlightenment science, philosophy, and religion—a ‘hidden agenda of modernity’. I contend that, as an idea, cosmopolis has a much earlier circulation in European thinking, not least in the Middle Ages. Locating cosmopolis in the medieval and the modern periods then begs a question of what is it that really makes the two distinct and separate? All too often human geographers have emphasised discontinuities between the ‘medieval’ and ‘modern’ age, locating the ‘rise of modernity’ some time in the Enlightenment period. However, what ‘mapping’ cosmopolis reveals are continuities, binding time and space together, which when looked at begin to help query the modernity concept itself. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Currently, treatment planning for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) usually disregards variations of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE). To investigate the potential clinical relevance of a variable RBE for beam scanning techniques, new strategies for the evaluation of radiobiological effects and for the incorporation of the RBE into the inverse planning process are presented. These strategies are based on a fast algorithm for three‐dimensional calculations of the dose averaged linear energy transfer (LET) as a measure of the local radiation quality, and on a simple phenomenological approach for the RBE as a function of dose, LET and tissue type. It was found that the biological effect depended strongly on the type of scanning technique used, mainly due to differences in the LET distributions. New objective functions that account for LET and RBE were integrated into an inverse planning software, which now allows simultaneous multifield optimization of the biological effect in a reasonable time. With these methods, unfavorable RBE effects can be identified and compensated for by direct optimization of the product of RBE and dose, which is demonstrated for several clinical examples. The proposed strategies are therefore valuable tools to evaluate and improve the quality of treatment plans in IMPT.</jats:p>",

It focuses in particular on the socioeconomic, political and administrative challenges and constraints facing the town planning office in enforcing building bylaws, encouraging land-pooling, developing roads and protecting public land, especially in the context of the proactive stance taken by the author. The paper concludes that a less proactive approach might achieve more in moving towards greater receptiveness to the concept and objectives of urban planning. </jats:p>",

One means of building up competencies and fostering innovation based on external resources such as knowledge is through the acquisition of technology‐based companies. However as literature and practice have shown, technologically motivated and intensive acquisitions are highly vulnerable to failure. One of the main reasons for this value destruction lies in the miscarried and inappropriate integration of the technology‐based company after the acquisition.</jats:p><jats:p>Based on eight in‐depth case studies on technology intensive acquisitions in multi‐national technology‐based companies this paper aims to identify the main causes of failure in internalizing external knowledge during the integration of technology intensive acquisitions. It was derived that a lack of integrative decision‐making, of systemic processes and of a holistic change of both companies during the integration hinders successful knowledge sourcing through acquisitions. Based on these findings, a concept for integration planning which is tailored towards the specific characteristics of technology intensive acquisitions is proposed. This concept is embedded in the acquisition process and encompasses the development of an appropriate integration strategy and the determination, assessment and planning of the required integration projects thus fostering successful knowledge sourcing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographical economics is a recent approach in economics aiming at introducing the ‘role of space’ into the mainstream of the discipline. Though interested in similar issues, economic geographers strongly criticise geographical economics. This paper puts such criticisms under scrutiny, taking Ron Martin's 1999 influential contribution as representative. A philosophically informed analysis of these criticisms brings forth possible misunderstandings in the dispute and hence assists both parties by making criticism and responses more incisive. If, as it seems at least in some geographers’ view, economic geographers are concerned with mechanisms and processes different from the abstract general economic mechanisms analysed by geographical economists, then complementarity between the two approaches turns out to be a possibility. This challenges both economic geographers and geographical economists because it asks them to go beyond methodological differences and establish whether the general and abstract mechanisms identified by the latter are compatible with those identified by the former. If so, further investigation on how they combine as to bring about real-world agglomeration is needed. </jats:p>",

It measured the deviation of actual supply and demand from their planned values and, using the historical profile of these deviations, determined the safety-stock levels Lucent needed to meet the desired service levels. In doing so, it quantified the relationships among the inventory drivers: supply intervals, demand and supply variability, desired service levels, and part proliferation. It used these drivers to identify and drive initiatives to improve processes to reduce uncertainty in the provisioning process. Several Lucent locations have used the IRP system to realign inventories and to improve service in various manufacturing and distribution facilities. The IRP system's value has been recognized through several awards. It also contributed to Lucent's receiving the Malcolm Baldrige Award in 1992 (as a part of AT&amp;T Corporation) and subsequently the INFORMS Prize in 1998. </jats:p>",

On the national level, 13.2 percent of students have identified disabilities. This translates to 6,195,113 students, a jump of 30 percent from 1990 to 2000 (National Center for Education Statistics 2001). The Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act of 1997 (IDEA) mandates that students with disabilities have access to the general education curriculum. This legislation has led to an increase in the number of students with disabilities who are included in regular education classes. Many classroom teachers feel overwhelmed by the challenges of responding to the learning needs of all their students. We often hear teachers say, “I want all my students to be successful in math, but I'm not sure what to do. I don't have training in special education and I don't have much support.”</jats:p>",

Markov decision processes and controlled Markovian dynamic systems are used in the models. Considering an inventory problem in discrete time and formulating it by a finite‐state Markov chain lead to a Markov decision process model. Using the policy‐improvement algorithm yields the optimal inventory policy. In controlled dynamic system modeling, the random demand and capacity processes involved in planning are described by two finite‐state continuous‐time Markov chains. Such an approach enables us to embed the randomness in the differential equations of the system. The optimal production rates that minimize an expected cost are obtained by numerically solving the corresponding Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equations. To overcome the so‐called curse of dimensionality, frequently encountered in computation, we resort to a hierarchical approach. Illustrative examples using data collected from a large paper manufacturer are provided. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 2877–2890, 2004</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental justice research in the United States has coalesced around the notion that visible-minority status, along with socioeconomic position (SEP), conditions exposure to environmental health hazards. In the context of long-standing debates over Canada–USA urban differences, we address the question of whether racial gradients exist in air pollution across Hamilton, Canada. Monitored air quality data are spatially interpolated with a kriging algorithm. These interpolated exposures are statistically correlated with 1996 data at the census tract scale, with the aid of multivariate and spatial techniques. The proportion of Latin-Americans in a census tract is positively associated with pollution exposure, even after control for many SEP variables. In contrast, Asian-Canadians are negatively associated with air pollution, and Black-Canadians show no clear correlation at all. Thus, the faces of environmental racism in Canada seem more varied and nuanced than in the USA. Given the immigrant basis of visible minorities in Canada, we argue that Hamilton (and the Canadian city generally) may represent new dimensions of environmental racism driven by economic status at time of entry. In drawing on similar findings in the USA and the United Kingdom, the authors conclude that environmental racism appears present in all jurisdictions, but that the nature and extent of disproportionate exposure differ between countries. </jats:p>",

Cluster analysis is employed to reduce the large size payoff matrix to a manageable subset for further use of the MCDM technique. ELECTRE-3, an MCDM technique of outranking nature, is employed to rank the alternative strategies.

It is argued that the strategy has changed during the period of study, shifting from a strong emphasis on the development of local institutions to an emphasis on the delegation of responsibilities from central government to local governing bodies. This new policy of delegation has been advanced at a time when municipalities are suffering from a weakened institutional capacity for environmental policy-making because of changes in the country's overall regulatory approach. The authors argue that this approach, which first and foremost has been motivated by national, macroeconomic objectives and the role of local government in service production, is inconsistent with the government's ambitions of a more important role for local government in environmental policy. The nature of environmental challenges, which often cut across political and administrative borders and often involve conflicts between different levels of government, suggests that local institutions are crucially important within the environmental policy domain. </jats:p>",

In this paper I focus on two straight girls' narratives to explore, first, how they sexualize space and thus make space heterosexual; and, second, how space and spatiality imbue their everyday social and sexual practices and thus exist as a central component of subjectivity. I argue that considering the spatiality of their sexual practices presents a theoretical advantage over current feminist conceptualizations that place girls in gendered relationships in which boys maintain control. Instead, I suggest that a close reading of the pleasures and proprieties of sex and sexuality in these two girls' stories illustrates how the girls become invested with and perform social-sexual norms and meanings through spatialized practices. </jats:p>",

A classical approach to solving these problems, which satisfies the strong soundness requirement, involves some quantifier elimination procedure such as Collins' Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition symbolic method. Sound numerical methods using interval arithmetic and local consistency enforcement to prune the search space are presented in this article as much faster alternatives for both soundly solving systems of nonlinear inequalities, and addressing the guaranteed tuning problem whenever the perturbation vector has dimension 1. The use of these methods in camera control is investigated, and experiments with the prototype of a declarative modeler to express camera motion using a cinematic language are reported and commented upon.</jats:p>",

In this paper I explore public perceptions of environmental change as active sense-making with respect to a particular aspect of the environment—sounds and noise. I use a case study of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) process for the planned extension of an airport in Sweden. I focus on how local citizens reacted to the issue of airport noise as discussed in the EIA, as well as on local perceptions of noise. Analysis of local peoples' perceptions of environmental change raises questions concerning the meaning of environmental protection versus individual rights, the population affected by a development, and the issue of financial compensation versus commitment to dialogue. These questions must be raised in order to assess whether EIA fulfils its goal of increasing dialogue and building more participatory structures within the planning process. </jats:p>",

A biblical scholar, encyclopedist, cultural anthropologist, and student of comparative religion, whose writings profoundly influenced figures such as Emile Durkheim, Sigmund Freud, and Bronislaw Malinowski, Smith's experiences in the Arabian peninsula were crucial in his efforts to understand the nature of early Semitic social life, particularly the role played by ritual sacrifice and kinship rules. In this paper I argue that Smith's tour must be read not as an exercise in the Occidental ‘othering’ of the Orient but as a project in self-understanding and as a set of investigations into the genealogy of the Christian West. As such it is used to engage with contemporary debates about orientalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Governance based on partnerships has become a characteristic of late capitalist societies. This paper explores how this new collaborative approach to environmental regulation creates challenges for existing technocratic policy networks, drawing on an organisational ethnography of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Our findings suggest partnership working is embraced for four reasons—to improve understanding of problems, to develop resource-efficient management solutions, to improve implementation of these solutions, and to improve communication and trust within the policy network. However, there appear to be three areas of difficulty. First, decisionmaking appears to be dominated by technocratic public servants; second, practical reasons for partnership, rather than embracing the normative arguments for discursive democracy, motivate most participants; and, third, participants are yet to experience the benefits of partnerships. We suggest three key areas which might address these problems and contribute towards a more successful implementation of the collaborative approach to regulation, namely to provide incentives for partnership working (demonstrating how the perceived benefits outweigh costs), developing interorganisational trust and providing organisational support (resources). We conclude with an analysis of the constraints that must be overcome to develop effective partnerships for environmental management, particularly the need to extend the network beyond the ‘usual suspects' and to embrace the normative dimensions of participatory democracy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes a planning approach based on the object representation. A planning domain in OAP (Object-oriented Approach for Planning) consists of a dynamic set of objects. OAP provides a language for planning problems modeling and implementation. This approach can evolve a domain model from a literal (predicative) representation to an object based representation, as well as enhancing the development of planning problems. The goal of OAP is to offer the possibility to design and develop planning problems as any other software engineering problem, and to allow the application of planning to a larger class of domains by using methods (functions) that can be implemented within the world objects. Planning systems using OAP as language can be integrated into any existing object-oriented software with a slight additional effort to transform the system to a planning domain model, which allows the use of planning to solve generic tasks in existing software applications (Business, web,…). Therefore planning in real world systems will be easier to model and to implement using all the software engineering facilities offered by the object-oriented tools. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>High dose rate brachytherapy is a promising radiation treatment modality that uses temporarily implanted catheters to deliver the curative dose directly in the tumor. A programmable robotic device (the afterloader) moves a single tiny radioactive source (192Ir) along the catheters using a flexible cable attached to the source. With this flexible system, a wide variety of dose distributions can be generated from a given implant simply by adjusting the length of time (dwell time) that the source dwells at any location within the implanted catheters (dwell position). The challenge is to select the optimal sequence of dwell times related to the unique clinical situation of each patient. This treatment‐planning problem can be formalized as a combinatorial optimization problem. The optimization algorithm presented in this thesis is conceived to perform this task. An inverse planning (IP) approach has been adopted to guide the optimization process. This means that the optimization is guided by clinical objectives described by means of dose constraints specified to each digitized anatomical structure. A simulated annealing (SA) optimization engine has been designed to solve this particular problem in a short time for clinical applications (about <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6111-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp6111:mp6111-math-0001\" />). This inverse planning by simulated annealing (IPSA) algorithm has been successfully implanted in four institutions: UCSF(1), CHUQ(2), NIH(3), CAV(4). At the moment of writing this thesis, more than 300 patients have been treated at these institutions for a wide variety of anatomical sites. Clinical studies performed by clinicians using IPSA demonstrated that the algorithm produces superior treatment plans from a dosimetric point of view than the conventional method using geometrical optimization. IPSA improves the target dose coverage while minimizing the dose delivered to organs at risk and provides consistent results from one patient to another. Both dosimetric indices and overall procedure time were improved with the clinical introduction of IPSA.</jats:p>",

Researchers have only started to examine the mutual compatibility of these agendas. The focus of this analysis is a cross-national comparison between Norway and Scotland, using ethnographic methods to chart how various actors have used strategic planning ( kommuneplan in Norway, community plans in Scotland) simultaneously to promote participation and integration. A study of local implementation practices reveals tensions between these agendas, but also the various contextually embedded ways in which local officers, politicians, and publics talk past, negotiate, or otherwise manage the problem. These are manifest in the balance between participatory and integrative activities in drawing up the plans; in the role of elected members; in combining steering and representative roles for partnerships; and in pressures for rationalisation. In the final analysis, we argue that these problems cannot simply be considered as local managerial muddles, but as reflecting deeper tendencies in ‘Third Way’ politics and the practical consequences of its emphasis on ‘what works’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is argued that J H von Thünen was a realist who deliberately used unrealistic assumptions to pursue a true account of a major aspect of the determination of agricultural land-use patterns. The assumptions of the simplest model of concentric rings are examined to show that this highly unrealistic model deserves a realist interpretation: the idealising assumptions serve the purpose of neutralising the impact of a number of factors on the land-use pattern and thereby help focus on the causal contribution of one major factor, namely distance from the market. It is von Thünen's conviction that this factor and its causal contribution are real rather than fictional, and that his basic model truthfully captured them. The potential truth of von Thünen's simplest model does not require that its assumptions are true nor that the representation of the resulting land-use pattern is true. This reading of von Thünen's theory is contrasted with the traditional fictionalist ‘as-if’ interpretation of Der isolierte Staat espoused by Hans Vaihinger, Peter Hall, and others. It is pointed out that economists and geographers both hold notions of realism that fail to accommodate von Thünen's realism. Although economists tend to conflate realism and realisticness and therefore fail to understand that realism is compatible with the use of unrealistic assumptions, human geographers have adopted highly specific ideas of realism that fail to do justice to von Thünen's theory. Because much of theorising in both disciplines follows the Thünian strategy, there is an important lesson to be learnt both for supporters and for opponents of that strategy. </jats:p>",

We compare estimates of the total commute person-miles traveled by telecommuters with those of nontelecommuters, on a quarterly basis. Key findings include the following. One-way commute distances were higher for telecommuters than for nontelecommuters, consistent with prior empirical evidence and with expectation. Average telecommuting frequency declined over time; several explanations are proposed, but cannot be properly tested with these data. The first two findings notwithstanding, the average quarterly per capita total commute distances were generally lower for telecommuters than for nontelecommuters, indicating that they telecommute often enough to more than compensate for their longer one-way commutes. We cannot say from these results whether the ability to telecommute is itself prompting individuals to move farther away, or whether telecommuting is simply more attractive to people who already live farther from work for other reasons. Even if the first is true, however, and telecommuting is the ‘problem’, it also appears to be the solution: that is, it enables people to achieve a desired but more distant residential location without a net increase in commute travel. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I interrogate the powerful brand of intimate nationalism that has permeated American political discourse since the initiation of the ‘war on terror’. I consider how a strategic collapse of scales in articulations of ‘domestic’ life simultaneously defines public cum national and private cum familial belonging, with material force. This scaled production of domestic intimacy entails a concurrent restructuring of the spatiality of social reproduction and of norms of desirous identification. My analysis draws on the combined insights of scalar theory and sexuality studies, and argues that in order to benefit from both fields of inquiry we need to return to and rethink class. Drawing on the work of Bourdieu, I posit class as embodied social-group relations of production, consumption, reproduction, and desire in order to highlight the scaled and strategic hinging of normative sexualities to modes of social reproduction. This approach questions how people become invested in, and desirous of, norms of sociality that constitute militarist imperial capitalism. It suggests that identification with, and desire for, this nation at this moment is fundamentally dependent on actual configurations of private, intimate life. A consideration of these shifting normative desires and geographies of domestic life, as manifest across a range of cultural, political, and economic terrains and at a variety of spatial scales, provides insight into why people continue to consume and be consumed by the American empire. </jats:p>",

In general, there has been no organized effort to promote male contraceptive methods, and vasectomy services are scarcely available. Selected governmental public health and family planning program managers were interviewed in 1993 to ascertain their knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about male involvement in the family planning program. Although a majority felt that a family planning decision was a joint one between wife and husband, and that male methods were effective, the vast majority of all managers suggested female rather than male contraception should be recommended for the general public. Two-thirds indicated that the public is not informed about the advantage of vasectomy. A majority felt that the lack of educational and IEC activities is a major reason for public inaction. Lack of political commitment and inadequate service provider training were cited as reasons why programs are not directed toward male involvement. Suggestions to increase male involvement were made, including private sector involvement, using community leaders, mass media, and expanding male service facilities. </jats:p>",

Concurrent planning aims to reduce the number of moves and the length of time before placement in a permanent family<jats:italic>.</jats:italic> In this study 24 young children in three concurrent planning (CP) projects and 44 from two ‘traditional’ adoption teams were followed for 12–15 months. Records were obtained of the number of moves between households and the dates of key events before the child's permanent family placement was confirmed by the courts. The CP children moved into permanent families significantly faster and with significantly fewer previous moves than the two comparison groups. Unexpectedly, the CP children were significantly younger than the children following ‘traditional’ adoption programmes, making direct comparison impossible. Among those birth parents who were interviewed, the majority saw advantages in the CP approach. Concurrent planning carers reported high levels of personal anxiety but positive views of the advantages for the children. We conclude that CP can be used to achieve earlier permanence and fewer moves between carers for young children from selected birth families. The success of a CP team is dependent on the support of other professionals involved in determining permanent placements, based on a shared acknowledgement of the damaging effects of delay for the looked after child.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Single Regeneration Budget, at its inception, was heralded as a breakthrough in English urban policy. It consolidated the emphasis on unified regeneration projects in which local authorities and communities played key roles. We examine empirical evidence of successful London bids from the programme to determine whether it lived up to its claims, in the city that gained the largest share of the budget. Drawing on headline funding and projected output data from all six annual bidding rounds, we conclude that the programme had disparate aims that were based more on contemporary political issues than on a coherent long-term strategy. Furthermore, the aims of individual projects were often unrealistic, so that monitoring and management were likely to fall short of what was planned. On the basis of this evidence, a wider discussion criticises the general drift of urban policy from the 1970s towards ‘locality managerialism’—a belief that problems of dilapidation and deprivation have predominantly spatial causes and can be tackled through area-based programmes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we study the extent to which first-generation ethnic entrepreneurs show a different motivation to start their own businesses from their second-generation counterparts. Our research project contains findings from empirical fieldwork among Turkish entrepreneurs in the Greater Amsterdam area. First-generation ethnic entrepreneurs appear to be more motivated by discrimination, problems with the transferability of their diplomas, and the goal of obtaining status, compared with their second-generation counterparts. The latter group derives more motivation from blocked promotion to start their own businesses. We found no other differences between these groups in their motives for starting up, that is, unemployment; need for achievement; making use of market opportunities; striving for independence; and using their own special talents. The reasons for finding fewer differences than expected between the two generations are discussed extensively in our paper. Having shown what the differences are between the two generations, we are able to sketch the contours for a new support policy for ethnic entrepreneurs. This new support policy is based on the need to pay attention both to the motives for starting up business and to the necessary preparatory activities. This lesson should be translated into a number of projects and programmes, as ethnic entrepreneurship is a multifaceted phenomenon with at least as many sides as there are ethnic groups. </jats:p>",

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study planning, an executive function, in moderately impaired MS patients. Methods: An fMRI version of the Tower of London (ToL) test was used to study patterns of brain activation in 23 MS patients and 18 healthy controls. The median score on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) for the MS patients was 4. fMRI data were analysed using whole brain random effects analysis as well as region of interest (ROI)-based methods to assess group effects. Within the MS group, associations with behavioural data and measures of disease severity (lesion load from structural MRI) were examined. Results: Test performance in MS patients was significantly worse than in controls. Group analysis for the MS patients and the controls showed for both groups globally the same areas of activation, located in the frontal and parietal lobes bilaterally and the cerebellum. Although visual inspection suggested a larger extent of activation in the MS group, no statistically significant differences between groups were found. In the ROI analysis, statistically significant larger extent of activation was only found in the cerebellum. No association between disease severity and brain activity could be determined in the MS group. Conclusion: In MS patients with moderate disability and structural damage, the pattern and extent of brain activation during planning were maintained despite poorer performance. In contrast to other studies showing increased activity, the failure to do so in our group may reflect exhaustion of adaptive mechanisms. </jats:p>",

Twenty‐five interviews were undertaken. Findings indicated that middle managers were strategically involved and that non‐clinicians perceived that they were more involved in strategy development than professional clinicians. Strategic involvement appeared to result from a higher level of strategic awareness and confidence by non‐clinicians in the process. Professional clinicians perceived that their expertize was not recognized or appreciated by non‐clinicians or by senior management. Agreement of strategy amongst both groups is critical, as exclusion will lead to demotivation and consequent deterioration in health care delivery.</jats:p>",

First, it argues that au pairs are distinctive from other migrants working in domestic service. Their positions have to be understood in terms of a particular regulatory framework, temporal restrictions, living-in conditions, and the blurring of rights and responsibilities. Second, there is a need to consider the full cycle of migration. Returned au pairs have been able to commodify many aspects of their UK experiences, despite the constraints of relatively short visits, and the household and care work allocated to them. Third, understanding au pair migration as being socially and spatially constituted provides greater insights into their experiences and outcomes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Issue linkage is often recommended as a strategy for enhancing cooperation. Lately it has been suggested that this strategy could also be applied to the management of transboundary natural resources. The authors examine the viability of this suggestion. They argue that in the case of natural resources such a linkage may have both short-term and long-term implications. Essentially, by constraining the options available to the various parties, such linkages limit ability to adapt management regimes to changes in the environment; thereby, they limit the ability to address environmental stresses and crises. These negative implications may be redressed by mechanisms that will allow the parties to adapt the linkage to new conditions and by tactics that reduce the political cost of a linkage strategy. The authors focus on the negotiation process concerning US–Mexico transboundary water, which was based on a long-term spatial linkage combining the waters of the Colorado River and those of the Rio Grande. This spatial linkage was advanced by a short-term issue linkage, in which the Mexican government supported the establishment of the United Nations in return for the US federal government's willingness to accept the spatial linkage. These linkages were found to have both short-term and long-term adverse implications. The short-term implications were delays in negotiations, inconsistency in the legal doctrines held by the different parties during the negotiation, and a threat to sovereignty. The main long-term implication identified is the current inability of Mexico to adapt the linkage in response to the ten-year drought along the Rio Grande, as manifest in the inability of Mexico to meet its water obligations to the USA along the Rio Grande. This has resulted in a controversy between Mexico and the USA, and between the Mexican federal government and the Mexican border states. It is suggested that flexibility provisions be included when linkages involving natural resources are advanced, so that the necessary adaptations in regimes management will be allowed for without necessitating a renegotiation of the treaty. </jats:p>",

A supervisory control system consists of one or more human operators interacting with highly automated components such as those seen in satellite ground control, flexible manufacturing systems, or nuclear power plants. Humans typically perform cognitively intense tasks such as monitoring, planning, real-time control, and troubleshooting, and are ultimately responsible for the safe and efficient operation of the overall system. Although developments on supervisory control have led to useful applications in interface design and automation, there is a scarcity of research that empirically evaluates human decision making in supervisory control through emulation of task performance using knowledge-based systems. In the context of dynamic planning involving simulated search and rescue missions using ground based autonomous robots and uninhabited aerial vehicles, we developed a knowledge-based system that mimics supervisory control performance. This paper describes the application domain, the details of the simulation model, and the implementation and assessment of a knowledge-based system that mimics human supervisory control performance.</jats:p>",

The following extensions of the transaction-cost framework are proposed: (1) introduction of care intensity and contest intensity as additional key attributes of transactions; (2) introduction of cooperative types of organization as a third governance structure besides market and hierarchies; and (3) introduction of natural resource characteristics, social capital, and state capability as contextual variables. The authors also discuss the possibilities for empirical application. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the end of 1996, we have treated more than 160 patients at PSI using spot‐scanned protons. The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, base‐of‐skull sarcomas, low‐grade gliomas, meningiomas, and para‐nasal sinus tumors. In addition, we have treated bone sarcomas in the neck and trunk—mainly in the sacral area—as well as prostate cases and some soft tissue sarcomas. PTV volumes for our treated cases are in the range 20–4500 ml, indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating lesions of all types and sizes. The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of fluence modulated Bragg peaks delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 000. With the current delivery rate of roughly 3000 Bragg peaks per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to 20–25 min. Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about 10% of delivered spots have a weight of more than 10% of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for optimizing the number of spots delivered per field. Field specific dosimetry shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9371-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9371:mp9371-math-0001\" /> (1 SD) orthogonal to the field direction and to within 1.5 mm in range. With our current delivery system the mean widths of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 mm (σ) for all energies, indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be made. In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg peaks shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg peaks over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of penetration. This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast re‐scanning on second generation scanning gantries.</jats:p>",

Incremental cost effectiveness ratios were estimated for each age group and clinical setting. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine the robustness of incremental cost effectiveness ratios to changes in the incidence of long term sequelae and costs.

This represents a net cost of £771.36 in preventing one major sequela. Selective screening of all women under 20 years and all patients attending abortion clinics were shown to be the most cost effective strategies. These results were relatively insensitive to changes in estimated parameters, such as uptake rate, probabilities and unit costs of all major sequlae averted. Prevalence (95% CI) of infection in the highest risk groups (those aged under 20 in both antenatal and abortion clinics) was 12.1% (8.6–16.7) and 12.7% (7.3–21.2), respectively. The majority (&gt;95%) of women agreed with a policy of regular screening for <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic>, and screening in the settings employed in this study was largely acceptable.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> A single episode of screening for <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic> does not result in net cost savings. Currently recommended strategies of screening for <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic> in women under 25 years of age in abortion clinics are supported by our data on prevalence and acceptability. These data also suggest that hospital‐based screening strategies should be further extended to include younger women attending antenatal clinics and all women of reproductive age attending colposcopy clinics.</jats:p>",
