Rev. A 40 (1989) 1045]. This allows us to establish clearly a temperature dependent length ξ* above which the mean-field glass transition picture has to be modified. We argue in favor of the mosaic state introduced by KTW, which leads to the Adam-Gibbs relation between the viscosity and configurational entropy of glass forming liquids. Our argument is a mixture of thermodynamics and kinetics, partly inspired by the random energy model: small clusters of particles are thermodynamically frozen in low energy states, whereas large clusters are kinetically frozen by large activation energies. The relevant relaxation time is that of the smallest “liquid” clusters. Some physical consequences are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Constructing rigorous models for analysing the behaviour of concurrent and distributed systems is a complex task. Our aim is to facilitate model construction. Scenarios provide simple, intuitive, example based descriptions of the behaviour of component instances in the context of a simplified architecture instance. The specific architecture instance is generally chosen to provide sufficient context to indicate the expected behaviour of particular instances of component types to be used in the real system. Existing synthesis techniques provide mechanisms for building behaviour models for these simplified and specific architectural settings. However, the behaviour models required are those for the full generality of the system architecture, and not the simplified architecture used for scenarios. In this paper we exploit architectural information in the context of behaviour model synthesis from scenarios. Software architecture descriptions give the necessary contextual information so that component instance behaviour can be generalised to component type behaviour. Furthermore, architecture description languages can be used to describe the complex architectures in which the generalised behaviours need to be instantiated. Thus, architectural information used in conjunction with scenario-based model synthesis can support both model construction and elaboration, where the behaviour derived from simple architecture fragments can be instantiated in more complex ones.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A multi-objective optimization model was created for medium-term forest development planning for an integrated forest products company located in the East Kootenay area of British Columbia, Canada. First, a set of sustainable forest management criteria and indicators were developed based on information that could be collected from regional geographic information sytem (GIS) databases and potential outputs from the model. Next, a new forest development planning unit was created (stewardship unit) in which adjacent forest polygons with similar indicator attributes were aggregated. The planning model was designed to determine appropriate harvest levels and management treatments on each stewardship unit to satisfy objectives determined in a participatory process. The mathematical model uses a fuzzy MAXMIN approach, where each indicator represents an objective in the model. Indicators are valued in the model using targets, thresholds, and triggers (called the 3-T approach). A case study is used to demonstrate the use of the model in a sustainable forest development planning context. The results of the case study show that the planning area is highly sensitive to visual quality, old-growth, and community watershed indicators. The paper concludes with a sensitivity analysis that determines the relative opportunity cost of various sustainable forest management indicators on company profits, employment, and tax revenues. </jats:p>",

The present investigation explores the efficacy of a sirolimus‐eluting stent to prevent restenosis in these lesions with a high risk of recurrence. In 22 consecutive patients with a recurrent and diffuse ISR, a sirolimus‐eluting stent was implanted to cover the restenotic lesion. All patients were followed clinically for at least 1 year and underwent a repeat angiography after 7 months. A quantitative coronary angiographic analysis was done. The target vessel failure was 14% in the sirolimus‐eluting stent group, with an angiographic late loss of only 0.39 ± 0.54. No subacute stent thrombosis was observed, and the 1‐year event‐free survival was 86%. The three cases with restenosis were all focal and could be successfully treated by additional drug‐eluting stent implantation. This study showed the efficacy of a sirolimus‐eluting stent for the prevention of restenosis in a worst‐case scenario of recurrent and diffuse ISR. The observed restenosis rate is lower than that reported after brachytherapy and suggests that sirolimus‐eluting stents are a promising treatment option for ISR.
