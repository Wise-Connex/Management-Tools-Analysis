      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Vaidya–Patel solution of a rotating homogeneous fluid in the presence of a Maxwellian source-free electromagnetic field is interpretated as an inflationary scenario with a gauge field with local U(1) symmetry, a vacuum energy, and a rotating perfect fluid. An explicit solution is found to be expressible in terms of known solutions representing the radiation filled Robertson–Walker universe with a cosmological term. In the case that the rotating fluid is radiation, the discussion of the model is considerably simplified. How the time scale of transition into a pseudo-de Sitter stage, as observed by an observer following the rotating fluid, is affected by vorticity is also studied.</jats:p>",
