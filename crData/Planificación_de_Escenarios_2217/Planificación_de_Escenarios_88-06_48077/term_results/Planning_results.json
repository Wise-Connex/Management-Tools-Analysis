The Low Income Housing Preservation Commission's report proposes ways to save two million units of privately owned and federally subsidized low-income rental units currently in jeopardy. The National Conference of State Legislatures report identifies a number of state strategies for making housing affordable to low-income families. The broad coverage, up-to-date analyses, and provocative suggestions make these reports an important resource for planners and policymakers. </jats:p>",

It also explores how well integrated manpower planning is in the strategic planning of organizations. A review of the planning and corporate planning literature is undertaken. A sample of 25 companies from the Financial Mail 'Top 100 Companies' was selected for analysis. Conclusions are drawn from the findings, and a list of recommendations has been drawn up which will enable companies to improve their manpower planning in a changing South Africa.Die doelwit van hierdie artikel is om ondersoek in te stel na die omvattendheid asook die deeglikheid van mannekragbeplanning in Suid-Afrikaanse maatskappye. Dit is verder 'n ondersoek na hoe geintegreerd hierdie mannekragbeplanning in die strategiese beplanning van hierdie maatskappye is en bied 'n literere oorsig van die veld aan. Vyf-en-twintig maatskappye uit die Financial Mail 'Top 100 Companies' is ontleed. Met die gevolgtrekkings wat uit die ondersoek voortgespruit het, is 'n lys van aanbevelings opgestel van wat 'n maatskappy kan doen om mannekragbeplanning op te knap in 'n veranderende Suid-Afrika.</jats:p>"

This process was confirmed in the Urban Policy Reports required of the President under the 1977 Housing and Community Development Act. President Carter's two reports (1978 and 1980) detailed specific national initiatives to deal with urban problems. President Reagan's reports (1982, 1984, 1986, and 1988) sublimated urban issues under macro economic and fiscal strategies. In 1988, complex urban issues identified by Moynihan are resurfacing with a new urgency, building demand for revitalized federal initiatives. </jats:p>",

The Wind Technology story recounts the rather commonplace process of developing a business plan based on, if you'll pardon the pun, pretty thin air. (We deliberately chose a low‐tech case so the business issues wouldn't be overshadowed by the complexities of a high‐tech process.) But don't be condescending when you critique the Wind Technology business plan. Who among us hasn't fallen prey—like its management—to “The Better Mouse Trap” school of marketing syndrome? The symptoms: You become infatuated with a product idea and write a ten‐year P&amp;L statement before you talk to 100 potential customers. And there's another trap to this case. It's the “I can't make a decision because I don't have all the facts” cop out. In the real world you never have all the facts, the ducks are never aligned, and the winds of business are fickle. As a treat for readers who “solve” the Wind Technology case on their own, we asked two experts to let us publish their commentaries as a coda. Compare your analysis with theirs and write us a letter if you think your insights are worth sharing with your fellow managers.</jats:p>",

Its impact on this process depends, to some degree, upon the intelligibility of its presentation. In policy analysis, however, one often tends to use specific language which is not (or not easily) understood by decisionmakers/politicians. This paper is based on the assumption that the use of every day language and of real-world examples would significantly improve the attention given policy analysis, and thus improve its impact on the decisions to be made. In order to achieve this an unusual approach has been adopted: A new Minister takes office in a hypothetical state and is immediately exposed to ‘conventional’ advice. His attempts to relate this advice to the real world fail all too often. Finally, he quits. </jats:p>",

A key issue in such implantation is the configuration of the radiation field in relation to the resected tumor. In particular, should radiation be provided to the area from which the tumor has been resected? To clarify this issue, we evaluated patterns of tumor regrowth into this resected area in 62 patients. Three patterns of computed tomographic scan-documented tumor regrowth were recognized: preferential (regrowth to refill the resected area only), circumferential (regrowth into the resected area and previously uninvolved contiguous brain) and away (local regrowth into noncontiguous brain, sparing the surgical bed). Regrowth of the tumor 6.3 to 6.8 months after resection was seen in 59 of 62 patients (95.2%). Preferential regrowth was seen in 32 of 62 patients (51.6%), and circumferential regrowth was seen in 27 of 62 patients (43.5%). Regrowth away was seen in 3 of 62 patients (4.8%). Radiation fields planned for interstitial brachytherapy must adequately include the resected area because of the high incidence of tumor regrowth into that area.</jats:p>",

Some themes from Caribbean history and social anthropology are brought together with some recent ideas from social geography concerning the territorial basis of British racism. The focus is on London's Notting Hill Carnival but it is argued that the significance of this contemporary British event can only be understood against the background of Britain's colonial interests in the Caribbean. In the empirical part of the paper an analysis of media representations of the Notting Hill Carnival is developed, concentrating on the disturbances associated with Carnival in 1976. Press reports of the Carnival riots signalled a significant shift in British ‘racial’ discourse and a marked deterioration in relations between black people and the police, involving a ‘criminalization’ of black people in general. The spatial constitution of symbolic resistance is described and the paper concludes with a discussion of the ‘carnivalization’ of society, challenging the conventional distinction between culture and politics. </jats:p>",

It is further suggested that landscapes can be seen as texts which are transformations of ideologies into a concrete form. This is an important way in which ideologies become naturalized. What is lacking in the radically relativistic theoretical perspective of much of twentieth-century literary theory, however, is a consideration of the sociohistorical and political processes through which meaning is produced and transformed. Examples of the relation between texts and landscapes from several different types of societies are then offered. </jats:p>",

At the level of the firm, technology is a tool to achieve and sustain competitive advantage but radical innovation is system oriented and involves infrastructure. The paramount role of information technology has to be emphasised. Two new concepts are emerging; Just in Time/Total Quality Control (JIT/TQC) and Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). So-called value-added-networks or VANs are catching on in Western countries. The bottlenecks are the costs, the externalities, the lack of standardization, and the system incoherence. Brief case-studies are developed: The new generation of metros, high speed trains, the motor industry, and intermodalism with utilization of High-Cube containers. The findings of these studies show that organizational innovation has to go along with technological innovation. </jats:p>",

This is no longer a particularly novel claim to make, of course; yet it is a claim interpreted in a peculiarly narrow way by current theorists of the locality and the local state, who see the influence of civil society on local politics wholly in terms of class. The author begins this paper by offering an alternative theoretical framework which unites locality, politics, and culture, In the second section the political beliefs and policies of the Labour Party in the cast London borough of Poplar in the 1920s are examined and it is shown how local cultural values and ways of understanding the world shaped those political commitments to a very large degree. In the third part the social power relations are explored which developed between the Labour-controlled local state and the institutions of its civil society and which sprang from those local Labour Party values, These power structures changed during the 1920s, shifting from a participatory form of mass politics in the early 1920s to a much more exclusionary and elitist mode later in the decade. It will be argued that both types of power relations can be linked very closely to Poplar's local culture, and in the final section some conclusions will be drawn from this about the politics of local culture. </jats:p>",

In particular, the returns to a seller who maximizes the probability of selling to the highest bidder are compared with the returns of a rank minimization strategy which is more conservative. The comparison reveals that the rank minimization strategy will generally lead to shorter waiting times, higher expected selling prices, and lower probabilities of receiving the worst bids. Both of these objectives assume that sellers have no initial information pertaining to the distribution of bid prices. This is in sharp contrast to the more usual assumption of complete information about the parameters of the distribution. The losses associated with not having a priori information on the number of bidders are also evaluated. Under such circumstances, sellers may adopt more conservative strategies, with the consequent result of shorter waiting times and lower expected prices. </jats:p>",

Recent researchers taking a ‘production of gentrifiers' perspective have focused on how restructuring of production and reproduction has generated a growth in the number of households which are most likely to benefit from inner-city living. That argument is extended with reference to cultural change, interweaving theoretical issues with an account of the postmodern landscape of a redeveloped neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. Connections are made between a number of practices, including planning and architectural design, advertising and marketing strategy, and the life-style of ‘New Class' gentrifiers. Dynamic relations between emergent and dominant cultures are traced in terms of their impact on the transformation of this landscape. Postmodern landscapes are ambiguous in their meaning; they have come to represent both a reaction against corporate visions of the city, and a confirmation of the vigour of the commodity form. This tension is examined in terms of the interplay between the construction of the postmodern landscape and the constitution of gentrifiers as a social group. </jats:p>",

Penalties, in the form of withdrawal of grant, were incurred if these targets were exceeded, and this suggests an incentive to reduce expenditure. However, targets were based on previous years' budgets, so there has been a simultaneous incentive to maintain high levels of reported expenditure in order to secure higher targets in the future. By use of dynamic programming, I explore in this paper the pattern of budgets required by local authorities in the years 82/83 to 85/86 in order to maximise grant receipts, whilst maintaining constant expenditure in real terms. It is found that increases in grant of up to 50% can be engineered by shifting reported expenditure between the years in question. </jats:p>",

Recently, central government has announced its intention to set up similar organisations elsewhere in Britain, and, therefore, a review of the impact of the London Docklands' initiative is appropriate. In this paper I outline the impact of the urban development corporation, in terms of economic regeneration and of the effect on local unemployment. It is argued that demand-led economic regeneration, based on the redevelopment of derelict land, has changed the nature of the local economy, although as yet it has not had any significant effect on the numbers of jobs in the local economy, because of continued decline in existing industries and because of pressures on firms to relocate. Local unemployment has gone on increasing, and evidence is presented to show that labour-market adjustment mechanisms and recruitment patterns severely limit the impact of economic regeneration on unemployment in Docklands. Even major developments, such as the proposed office complex on Canary Wharf, will have only a relatively small effect on local unemployment. Local labour-market intervention has been slow to occur, limited in its aims, and uncoordinated. Urban development corporations are useful policy devices for the encouragement of large-scale land redevelopment, but in their present form they do not represent a complete solution to the economic and employment problems of depressed urban areas. </jats:p>",

The thesis is considered that world's fairs are an instrument of hegemonic power.

Modifications to clearcutting most commonly used were block cuts (i.e., cut and leave) and linear reserves. Timing and communication are cited as serious problems in two cases and solutions are offered. Also, the logging companies in all three cases were concerned about the added expense of modified harvesting (e.g., higher road and layout costs, some loss of timber volume, and higher operating costs). Throughout, the need for more high quality moose inventory data and long-term follow-up study is made clear.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The study of systems of racial classification is not well developed in the social sciences. Within the liberal tradition of race relations research, race has more often been taken for granted than made an object of explanation itself. Marxist analysts, on the other hand, have tended to treat race, like other ideologies, as derivative of more decisive economic pressures under capitalism. Neither of these ‘idealist’ or materialist’ perspectives gives sufficient recognition to the contribution which ideological formulations about ‘race’ have made to the structuring of the society and space of Western countries. That challenge is taken up in this paper and the history of the race-definition process in Vancouver, British Columbia, is examined. Attention is paid to the social construction of the racial category, ‘Chinese’, which persisted in white European culture for a century, from 1880 to 1980. It is demonstrated how the racial category is structured at the local level through the nexus known as ‘Chinatown’, and legitimized through the institutional practices of the three levels of the Canadian government. In reconstructing the historically evolving relationship between racial discourse, place, and government policy in one setting, the workings of one of the most influential of socially based hegemonies are uncovered. </jats:p>",

Against this background a pilot study was undertaken to evaluate the strategic orientation of marketing planning by franchised motor dealers. The findings of this study seem to indicate that marketing planning by franchised dealers in the motor industry is not conducted in the manner suggested in the marketing literature. More specifically the findings of this study are that, with a few exceptions, respondents do not strategically plan their marketing effort, do not conduct their marketing planning in a formal, structured manner as suggested in the literature, and depend to a large extent on their manufacturers with regard to important aspects of their marketing planning. It furthermore appears as if the marketing efforts of manufacturers and respondents are not sufficiently co-ordinated and integrated.</jats:p>"

A framework for the investigation of changes in a continuing process of population redistribution is introduced in this paper, and is used to test hypotheses about the sources of change in the process of the redistribution over the states of the USA. Changes in migration behavior are the major source of change in redistribution patterns, and incremental logit models are used to test the hypothesis that changes in migration behavior are responsive to changes in the localization of employment and changes in the demography of the population. Models of changes in migration behavior are used to construct a series of models of the relocation of population, which are investigated by means of information statistics. The results support the hypothesis that patterns of population redistribution in the 1970s differed substantially from the patterns of earlier decades. Changes in migration behavior are associated with changes in the location of employment opportunities, and the employment-related changes in out-migration and destination choice account, in turn, for much of the change in population redistribution patterns. </jats:p>",

The organisation is considered as an intervening analytical level that bridges the gap between the effect of individual actors and that of the structure of society on the geography of public provision. Drawing on the literature of organisation theory, we analyse the effects of processes within organisations to help explain variation in public provision between authorities. The separate and combined effects of three major organisational concepts are examined: Scrutiny, conflict, and centralisation. These concepts are applied to policy innovation in four English local authorities, and specifically to their policies for the adoption of new technology in schools. Although the separate effects of the concepts help our understanding, it is their interaction which makes a significant contribution to the explanation of the timing and duration of policy innovation, as well as explaining the policy outcome, which was the aim of most previous work. Further understanding is gained when these concepts are set within the context of the overall structure and behaviour of the organisation. </jats:p>",
