High-risk zones are those defined as having both a high proportion of their population hypersusceptible to a particular pollutant and a high emission level of the pollutant. Enumeration of hypersusceptible populations in high-risk zones and the number of these zones, together with the total hypersusceptible populations contained within network corridors, the net emissions of individual pollutants, and the population-weighted mean emission levels for each pollutant for the complete study area, serve as rating indices for comparing a set of alternative transportation plans. </jats:p>",

This paper will outline some of the drilling problems that may be encountered in Southeast Asia; brief methods of anticipating these problems before they occur are developed. Techniques for dealing with various drilling problems through engineered drilling fluids program are discussed. In particular, the application of controlled salinity oil muds and the use of salt polymer mud systems for improved borehole stability, solids control, corrosion reduction, safety and economy, are emphasized.

The loss of a hole is not uncommon.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Historically, drilling fluid development saw improvements in controlling drilling fluid properties with little regard to effect on drilling.

There has also been a tendency in the past and even today to base the choice of mud system on only one to two criteria, such as low cost, availability, or ease of running, rather than on a scientific evaluation of all facets involved. In many cases the lowest cost drilling fluid system may not yield the lowest cost well drilled.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>If cost, environmental factors, and geological information were of no consequence, problem wells could be drilled with invert emulsion muds.

In this paper it is shown that failure to allow for the carry-over effect beyond the planning horizon can result in underallocation of resources and in biases in the timing pattern of resource expenditure. For a wide class of market planning models, a procedure is developed to take into account this long-term effect. The distortion and the procedure are illustrated in an example. </jats:p>",

The need for this change of emphasis is demonstrated by the results of an empirical study of a selection of nine spatial-interaction models. Not only do the theory-based models fail to achieve significantly better levels of performance than some empirically derived models, but both types of model fail to achieve satisfactory levels of descriptive performance. These models are shown to be sensitive to the choice of calibration procedure and various kinds of errors in the constant and independent variables. It is suggested that the use of these models should always be accompanied by estimates of confidence limits, and that there is an urgent need for the development of new model designs which can at least provide accurate descriptions of observed reality. </jats:p>",

While some design options can be found in operations research and management science, futures research projects in education are more likely to follow the directions for policy analysis initially suggested by Yehezkel Dror and re‐examined in Aaron Wildavsky. They note in policy analysis, 1. Much attention would be paid to the political aspects of public decision‐making and public policy‐making (instead of ignoring or condescendingly regarding political aspects) … 2. A broad conception of decision‐making and policy‐making would be involved (instead of viewing all decision‐making as mainly a resources allocation) … 3. A main emphasis would be on creativity and search for new policy alternatives, with explicit attention to encouragement of innovative thinking … 4. There would be extensive reliance on … qualitative methods … 5. There would be much more emphasis on futuristic thinking … 6. The approach would be looser and less rigid, but nevertheless systematic, one which would recognise the complexity of means‐ends interdependence, the multiplicity of relevant criteria of decision, and the partial and tentative nature of every analysis … (Wildavsky, Aaron, “Rescuing Policy Analysis from PPBS” <jats:italic>Public Administration Review</jats:italic> 29. 1969. pp. 189–202.

For farmers wishing to avoid large risks, the value of additional spring field capacity is high relative to the fall field capacity. Efforts to avoid problems in scheduling spring field operations are most critical. For farmers willing to accept more risk in anticipation of higher incomes, the value of additional field time is high relative to that of spring field time.
