Two\npanels were established for the purpose of this study. The first panel\nconsisted of key individuals in the local tourist industry. The second\npanel comprised an international group of executives participating in an\nexecutive development programme in Singapore. The panels were asked to\nexamine a host of events related to the tourism industry in Singapore\nand to provide their assessments on the likelihood of these events\nhappening in different time horizons. Based on the findings, events with\nhigher probability of occurrence and crucial to tourism development are\nidentified. Marketing implications of these events are discussed and\nstrategies for tourism planning suggested.</jats:p>",
