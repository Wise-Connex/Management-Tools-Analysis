Long‐term determinants include changing demographics and structural economic shifts, such as double‐digit inflation, abnormally high borrowing costs and Federal economic policies. Because of their collective effect on consumer spending, saving and borrowing habits, these developments foretell profound strategic implications for American business in the 1980s.</jats:p>",

Most bit selection techniques were mainly done by the trial and error method with varying degrees of success. Analysis of bit records from this area, in conjunction with electric log interpretation to locate geological formation tops, has resulted in a technique to correlate bit types to specific formations. This technique has been used with some success in bit selection planning. One particular well using this method is compared with actual performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1974 Champion International Corporation could be described as a company in search of an image. In spite of being the nation's fourth‐largest forest products company at the time, with net income just under $100 million, Champion was a relative stranger on Wall Street — the result of what the company concedes was a lack of corporate direction, coupled with a poorly managed publicity campaign accompanying Champion's switch from the U.S. Plywood‐Champion Paper title in 1972. As Champion spokesperson Sallie Vandervort explains, “A company that has no image has a negative image.” Owing in part to this perception and in part to the company's desire to project itself as a positive, forward‐looking company, Champion mounted a $6.8 million advertising program, beginning in 1979, that stressed the importance of the future. Says Ms. Vandervort, “Champion's goal was double‐edged. We wanted to conduct a viable and legitimate corporate campaign to improve our recognition in the business community. And, at the same time, we wanted to give the public a little food for thought.” Ms. Vandervort noted that, since Champion's resources take anywhere from 25 to 60 years to develop, the company wanted to demonstrate its concern for the future, while stimulating public thinking about some of the issues and trends that will command society's attention over the next 20 years. The following article is condensed from a booklet of the same title that is distributed nationwide as part of Champion's advertising program.</jats:p>",

But I will be happy to cooperate.” Within six months, with his help, I was able to construct a pricing model. If we knew his facts and used the model, we could predict with almost perfect accuracy what price he would set. Further, his intuitive procedures were highly imaginative, and we doubted that any economist could improve them.</jats:p>",

Environmental planning for changing organizations is concerned with organizational effective ness, destiny, and quality of the work environment. Solutions to the first two can be derived through the analysis of the organization and its determinant conditions. The third requires a more thorough examination of planning principles. Only partial static solutions to problems of human satisfaction and development can be reached through user needs analysis. To be responsive to organizational changes, user needs research and corporate space planning must be redefined to recognize the importance of \"freedom of choice\" in determining behavioral patterns and involvement in the planning and research process by individuals and work groups. </jats:p>",

In the second paper, the methodology was applied to one-dimensional spatial interaction models of the population density type, with some success; and here it is proposed to apply the methodology to two-dimensional spatial interaction models using the same data base, the Reading (UK) region. Accordingly, the methodology is first stated for linking information in data measured by spatial entropy to the parameters of models generated from spatial entropy. The family of four spatial interaction models due to Cordey-Hayes and Wilson is then derived, the canonical forms of their associated spatial entropy functions presented, and the analytic properties of such models explored. These four models are then fitted to spatial aggregations of the Reading region, and various empirical relationships between their entropies and parameters described. The results are not as regular as those of the models in the second paper because of more variable model performance, but nevertheless a means of approximating scale parameters from data based on the work of Kirby is outlined. This enables estimates of the dispersion parameters to be made through the canonical forms. Although the results are poor because of model performance, the methodology outlined here serves as a basis for the more fully fledged application to be discussed in the final paper. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has recently been argued by Damette that regional labour reserves have come to occupy a central role in the accumulation process as a source of surplus profits. Moreover, the State has increasingly become involved in creating such reserves via its spatial policies, often with unintended results in relation to the stated aims of these policies. These general propositions are explored in this paper via an investigation of some aspects of the development of Washington New Town, considering in turn the policy context in which the proposals for the New Town emerged, the mechanisms involved in producing labour reserves there, and the results of developing the town in relation to the employment objectives specified for it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This is the first of two papers examining housing market search in a Los Angeles market. In this paper, we derive and analyze utility functions for housing for each individual in two groups of subjects. The utility functions are derived from an experimental setting, in which house price, floor space, construction quality, and neighborhood quality are varied. The functions are found to be essentially compatible with a linear model. They are used to predict the ratings of real houses and the ratings of the expected value of future search. These ratings are compared with actual ratings obtained from subjects during search. The results suggest that the actual or predicted ratings may be employed in a direct test of a simple expected utility theory of search, and further research along these lines appears justified. </jats:p>",
