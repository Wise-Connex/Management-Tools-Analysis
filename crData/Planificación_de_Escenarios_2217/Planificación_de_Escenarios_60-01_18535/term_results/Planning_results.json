      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research planning and program development in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) have emerged over the past decade in a context of rising national interest, steadily expanding funds, shifting program emphasis, and constantly broadening scope of scientific inquiry. NIH basic philosophy seeks to maximize creative potential and regards research plan ning as a totality encompassing the limiting resources of man power and facilities as well as conduct of research itself. Planning has evolved as a continuous, flexible, adaptive process in which administrators and scientists possess considerable dis cretion within a framework of goals and priorities established by Congressional action. It represents a balance between the spontaneous interests of individual scientists and organized effort designed to meet needs and opportunities vital to the nation's health. Responsibility for over-all planning has grown as expenditures have increased, program interests have en larged, and NIH has become a more significant factor in sup port of university research and training of scientific manpower. The nature of the process requires further adaptation to deal more effectively with the problems of the future such as total impact of NIH programs upon an institution as a whole, strengthening the nation's research structure, and administering a co-operative research program on a world-wide scale. </jats:p>",

Methods evolved for its planning and control are based on voluntary co-operation be tween the states and Department agencies, with assistance from farmers, industry, and other groups. This system, nearly as com plex and diverse as agriculture itself, has been very successful. Today it involves some 13,000 scientists at hundreds of loca tions throughout the country. It is financed by nearly $238 million in public funds, about half from the states and half from the federal government. The work concerns all phases of pro duction, marketing, utilization, and consumption of farm and forest products. It is organized generally around specific prob lems and includes about 14,700 projects. However, more than a fifth of the federal funds support basic studies. Advisory committees, composed of members who represent users of re search results, aid extensively in planning. Control procedures, including thorough project review and co-ordination, permit a well-integrated and dynamic program. In the administration of this research, encouragement of creative contributions by individual scientists is a prime consideration. </jats:p>",
