In this paper we examine the planning process in Melbourne with respect to a recent retailing innovation in Australia, that of drive-in convenience stores. Resistance to the establishment of such stores, particularly their location in residential areas, has come both from residents and from local authorities charged with the administration of the Melbourne Metropolitan Planning Scheme. The conflicts have been adjudicated through a planning appeals body, the Victorian Planning Appeals Board. The nature of constraints placed on the interpretation of the planning scheme by the Appeals Board through Supreme Court decisions, and through the manner of operation of the Appeals Board itself, has meant that decisions have predominantly favoured the developers. Thus structure at the lower levels of the retail hierarchy is altering quite markedly, not as a result of conscious planning decisions, but as a result of the mechanisms to resolve conflict. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a critical discussion of the ‘bottom-upward’ school of regional studies associated particularly with the names of John Friedmann and Walter Stöhr. First identified is the key argument of what we may call neoregionalism, namely its advocacy of regional self-government coupled with policies of local economic protectionism. Whereas neoregionalism approaches the problems of spatially uneven development from the point of view of the individual region, I argue, adopting a ‘realist’ perspective, that these problems can only be interpreted and resolved within a national framework. In particular, the prospects for regional self-government must be assessed in the light of their implications for national economic performance, political integration, and interregional competition. Federal systems offer a fruitful field for study of the national and interregional implications of regional autonomy, particularly where that autonomy is used for protectionist ends. The comparative experience is briefly reviewed and cautionary lessons are noted about some potential disbenefits of decentralisation to which insufficient attention has been paid within the neoregionalistic perspective. Finally, conclusions are drawn about regional reform and what can realistically be expected of it. </jats:p>",

Within the State Department the record of attempts to establish systematic planning amply demonstrates the problems. Nevertheless, a number of key conclusions can be drawn from the few successful experiments in policy planning: An effective planning staff should combine the skills of both foreign policy specialists and scientists; planners should be closely familiar with, but not involved in, operations; the planning role requires consistent support from senior officials; the power to influence budgets significantly strengthens the planning function.</jats:p>",

This study found, in part, that (1) most metropolitan transportation planning organizations now are locally governed and staffed. (2) their planning is becoming increasingly isolated, less comprehensive, and shorter range. (3) some such organizations are experiencing strong pressure to decentralize or subregionalize, and (4) the desire for these organizations to exercise more effective areawide leadership is not matched with local approval of greater powers for them. The study concludes that informal coordination techniques or new powers granted by state legislatures are the two most likely facilitators of improved metropolitan transportation leadership in the 1980s.</jats:p>",

It is therefore unreasonable to expect such models to account adequately for observed market behaviour. For more realistic and operationally useful models, a probabilistic approach is required. Several probabilistic versions of the short-run (fixed housing supply) Herbert—Stevens model have been published in the literature, the models being derived by employing either entropy-maximising methodology and/or random utility theory. Limited empirical testing of the models has been reported. The aim of this paper is to consolidate the existing models into a general model structure using probabilistic random utility theory. The major departure from existing versions will be the recognition of within-dwelling-type attribute variability and the extent to which this variability is perceived by locators. This additional source of variability introduces another parameter into the model. When applied to a published empirical example, the proposed model results in greatly improved empirical performance. </jats:p>",

The value of cross-sectional models requiring a minimal amount of data is diminished due to (1) the difficulty in transferring cross-sectional results into cohort information, and (2) an assumption implicit in the structure of these models stating that the movement of an individual from one grade in the organization to another is independent of that person's organizational age. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, we present a cohort (longitudinal) personnel planning model solved using distributed parameter optimal control theory that requires only cross-sectional data.

It is uncertain what balance the Congress will strike between the long‐term, widely shared benefits of greater productivity and the immediate job losses from system consolidation. This risk can be included in the calculus of expected return through Monte Carlo analysis. When this is done, the expected return drops very close to the 10% hurdle rate that the government often uses for such projects.

Both of these phases in Olsson's thinking have been received, however, with scepticism by human geographers. An attempt is made here to allay some of this scepticism by demonstrating the relevance of Olsson's concerns, first to the critique of a positivist and functionalist human geography, and second to the emergent ‘agency-structure’ debate as this touches upon the concerns of human geographers. In the latter respect it is suggested that Olsson's focus on the internal dimensions of the meshing of individual and society can perhaps complement the structurationist focus on the more external dimensions of the meshing of agency and structure. </jats:p>",

First, in considering the relation of social capital to social services, the conventional ‘institutional’ definition and the simple ‘functional’ definition of social capital are criticised on the basis of their nonacademic and inconsistent interpretation. I propose instead a consistent definition of social capital based on an economic analysis of its external effects. Second, by separating the production side from the consumption side of public services in the public sector (and also in the private sector), four types of externalities of social capital (to the private sector) are distinguished. Finally, it is shown that these externalities can be taken as the theoretical bases for developing rules for cost sharing of social capital formation under the criterion of best allocation of resources. A forecast is then made of the size of these externalities, together with their feasibility of acceptance in actual public policy. </jats:p>",

The bulk of the theoretical and empirical analysis of the tax has been done in North America and is wholly within the neoclassical paradigm of tax incidence. The restrictive assumptions and partial equilibrium nature of the neoclassical approach limit its usefulness. In this paper the author shows how the short-period incidence of the property tax can be incorporated within a post-Keynesian model of tax incidence developed by Asimakopulos and Burbidge out of original ideas of Kalecki's. The results obtained from this post-Keynesian approach are compared with the neoclassical results. It is concluded that the post-Keynesian approach offers a more truly general equilibrium and logically coherent framework for the analysis of property tax incidence. </jats:p>",

In this study the author examines the ability of each of four approaches to generate industry groups (clusters) from a regional, survey-based input—output table. Specifically, the author deals with industry groups as generated by two graph-theoretic methods and by two multivariate techniques. The degree of similarity among the groups so generated is analyzed using measures of association. The composition of the groups depends on cutoff points. Nonetheless, the results suggest that one of the graph-theoretic methods and one of the multivariate techniques produce similar clusters. Further consideration indicates that these methods reveal more of the strongest interindustry linkages than their alternatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship between community and class has largely been neglected. In this paper, this relationship is focused upon, and a model is developed which allows the identification of significant aspects of locality and class relationships. The model identifies three sets of relationships, those based on propinquity, those based on property, and those based on kinship, and argues that the basis of communion within a locality can be found within any one of these three main sets of relationships. The research which stimulated this paper started with a focus upon the relationship between space and class as expressed in the pattern of landownership. Working from this beginning point, the analysis moves to examine the nature of boundaries and the structure of local organisations which constitute ‘latent’ community. A further dimension, which was pivotal in many traditional rural community studies, is then explored, namely kinship. For each of these three sets of relationships, it is possible to identify objective patterns based upon boundaries and upon local organisation, property ownership, and kin connections. The process by which these objective relationships acquire subjective meaning is similar in each of the three cases. The possibility both of contradiction and of reinforcement therefore exists in the development of communion within localities. The conditions under which propinquity produces community through the development of subjective consciousness are then explored. In the conclusions a number of issues are highlighted which are brought into focus by this approach. These are the interconnections of community and class, the relationship between transience and social structure, and between male mateship and egalitarianism, the role of gender within communities, and, finally, the relationship between localities and the wider society. </jats:p>",

Based on the locational behaviour of the headquarters of industrial companies, the possibility and usefulness of a decentralisation of management jobs is examined. In view of the location requirements and the mobility of those tertiary functions requiring highly qualified personnel, an increasing importance accruing to the leading locations for headquarters can be expected. The financial incentives to relocate have proven too weak. A policy of forced decentralisation, however, would not be useful, because of the already decentralised location structure in West Germany when compared internationally. A further decentralisation would detract from the function of the leading locations as national growth centres and would endanger their international competitiveness. A policy to activate the endogenous development potential of disadvantaged regions is therefore more suitable than long-distance relocations of service industries to the assisted areas. </jats:p>",

The study was initiated to help resolve more than a decade of controversy over a project proposed to control flooding and provide regulatory storage in the Phoenix, Arizona, area. The public was actively involved in the development of study goals and the specification of acceptable tradeoffs between multiple objectives. A wide range of structural and nonstructural alternatives was formulated and evaluated in relation to these objectives, and broad‐based support was developed for a new plan. Reasons for the successful outcome are discussed, as well as implications for water resources planning under the new Federal Principles and Guidelines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The ‘regulatory crisis’ has become a common paradigm on both sides of the Atlantic. It seems to be corroborated by economists pointing to inefficiencies of regulation. Political scientists have discovered implementation lags, and legal scholars complain about an overburdening of the legal system. </jats:p><jats:p> By reviewing some witnesses of the US discussion and by comparing this discussion with trends in Europe [European Economic Community (EEC) and member state level] I attempt to reshape the issues. Regulation has to be discussed with reference to perceived market failures and instruments used by the political system to cope with them. Pressure is put upon ‘social regulation’, that is, regulation of market deficiencies affecting ‘diffuse interests’ of consumers, environment, etc. Despite the rhetoric, the welfare state has not regulated too much but too little: It suffered from the reductionism paradox which is seemingly inherent in social regulation and becomes more apparent in federal (USA) or quasi-federal (EEC) vertically integrated political and legal systems. The modern discussion about ‘deregulation’, regulation ‘by incentives’, or regulation ‘by negotiation’ has not been able to overcome the structural deficiencies which limit attempts at social regulation. </jats:p><jats:p> The regulatory crisis is defined in terms of the dwindling legitimacy of the welfare state to keep markets both running and ‘clean’. The more people perceive this dilemma, the more the crisis will shift from ideology to reality. </jats:p>",
