      "abstract": "<jats:p>The collective dynamics of a quasi-two-dimensional suspension jet, of non-Brownian particles, confined in a thin cell and driven by gravitational force is studied both numerically and theoretically. We present a theoretical scheme aimed to describe such a system in the Stokes regime. We focus on the dynamics of the interface between the suspension and the pure fluid. Numerical simulations solving Newton’s equations for all particles show that the jet free surface becomes unstable: the fastest growing modes at small sizes coarsen up to the largest structures reaching the jet lateral scale. In the bulk, structural waves develop and travel at slightly slower speed than the jet average fall. An analytical model, based on hydrodynamic-like equations for the suspension, is derived and predicts the development of the interfacial instability. It captures in essence the collective effects driving the interface destabilization, i.e., the long-range hydrodynamic interactions coupled with the abrupt interface, and no relation to surface tension is found.</jats:p>",

Electron and atomic force microscopy have clearly shown the coexistence of ordered tori and disordered coil structures within a single DNA molecule. Motivated by these experimental findings, we theoretically investigated the collapse transition of a single polyelectrolyte chain driven by the addition of condensing guest molecules. We found that the transition behavior critically depends on the degree of the surviving charge inside the torus. When the torus is charged, even slightly, “rings-on-a-string” structures are expected for a sufficiently long chain, owing to the combinational entropy of segment state distribution along the chain and the unique property of the stability of charged torus.</jats:p>",
