      "abstract": "<jats:p> This annotated bibliography provides an overview of the literature on planning education addressing issues ranging from curriculum content to pedagogy and program accreditation to nation-specific planning education. Its focus is on academic, English language journal texts; however, some key books and Web sites with significant sections devoted to planning education were also included. It was compiled as part of the author’s work at the Subject Centre for Education in the Built Environment (CEBE) in the School of City and Regional Planning, Cardiff University with the principal goal to develop a subject-specific educational resource for academics. As such, the bibliography seeks to facilitate informed discussion, the identification of themes and knowledge gaps for further research, and to support the development of a research culture in planning education. Spanning a period of thirty plus years, the compilation offers an opportunity to link change in education to those in planning practice and higher education. </jats:p>",

In recent decades, planning historians have come to define planning ever more broadly, focusing on a great diversity of urban activities. But the design, development, and administration of public and private schools, from the preschool to university level, have yet to be incorporated into our discipline's debates and discussions to a significant degree. This introductory article frames the articles that follow within the broader history of American education and posits a variety of opportunities and questions to explore as we incorporate the history of schools into planning history. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we describe the developments of European building regulatory systems and place them within the context of general trends in the regulatory sciences, particularly with reference to Europeanisation studies. Within the regulatory sciences there is broad consensus about the trend towards deregulation and privatisation in recent decades. Studies conducted under the rubric of ‘Europeanisation’ analyse the effects of European policies on the policy frameworks of the member states in more detail. Are the systems converging or diverging? Although the history of this kind of research is short, most authors agree that European policies have had a profound impact on the policies of the member states, but that this impact has not been uniform. In this paper, we analyse privatisation and deregulation trends within the building regulatory systems of eight European countries, and we consider whether the systems appear to be converging or diverging. We focus on three elements: the scope of the technical requirements, the building-permit procedures and the division of control and inspection responsibilities. The analyses reveal no evidence that the scope of technical requirements in European countries is diminishing. Through its directives, the European Union exercises a convergent influence on the contents, scope, and formulation of these technical requirements. In addition, all member countries are taking steps to streamline their administrative procedures. The importance of the role played by private organisations in checking and controlling regulations is increasing across the board. Although they differ in pace and emphasis, these administrative deregulation and privatisation trends exhibit a number of parallel developments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The objective of this paper is to present the development of quantitative, spatially explicit, and alternative scenarios of future urban land use in Europe. The scenario-construction methodology is based on three steps: (1) an interpretation of four global-scale storylines describing in qualitative terms alternative urban-development pathways, (2) the development and application of a simple statistical model to estimate the future demand for urban land, and (3) the development of rules to allocate this urban demand geographically through the consideration of land-use planning goals. The qualitative part of the analysis is based on an interpretation of the four storylines of the Special Report on Emission Scenarios by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This interpretation describes the principal driving forces that are specific to the European region and to the urban sector on the basis of the theoretical principles of urban economy. The urban-demand model includes two driving forces: (a) the population, representing demographic trends and the demand for housing; and (b) the gross domestic product, reflecting the economic level and dynamism. A further three variables are used as drivers of spatial patterns: (c) accessibility to the transport network; (d) the degree of restriction arising from land-use planning policy, and (e) the relative attractiveness (in terms of residential-location choice) of small, medium, and large cities. Thus, the urban-land-use change model is based on a multilevel analysis, which integrates theory and empirical evidence. The results are original urban-land-use maps of Europe for each of the four scenarios on the basis of a 10′ (latitude and longitude) geographic grid. The comparison of these alternative views of the future and the transparency of the development of these views provide a rich and consistent method for understanding the relationships between driving forces, their intensity, and their consequence for geographic space. Scenario analysis is a useful tool to test incentives, measures, or planning regulations according to different policy objectives. </jats:p>",

In this study we develop a model for analyzing the spacing design of local streets. The model is designed as a multiobjective grey integer programming approach, which considers three objectives: accessibility, mobility, and safety. Constraints include travel demand, the passage of emergency vehicles, the evacuation of people, the influence of noise on residents, and dimension regulation of the architectural base. Because planning work is filled with uncertainties, the model parameters and decision variables are both grey numbers, which represent possible ranges rather than crisp values. Additionally, in this study we develop the grey integer TOPSIS approach for solving the developed model and other multiobjective grey integer programming models. A mixed-use block in the new town Dan-hai is explored as a case study to verify the applicability of the model to practical work. The case study is also used to analyze the influences of traffic-calming measures on spacing design in order to identify model characteristics. </jats:p>",

The research reported here rests on two premises. The first is the simple assumption that for planning to play an integral part in the economic development policy process there should be some empirical connection between local economic development goals—what officials want to achieve—and the economic development strategies they pursue. The second premise, based on extant literature, is that Canadian cities have different and more institutionally integrated planning traditions and practices than those in the USA, and hence should evidence a closer link between development goals and policies. Based on a survey of all of the municipalities in the USA and Canada with populations over 10 000, it is concluded that for US cities goals do not appear to correlate with discrimination among economic development policies; that is, planning is not related to the selection of activities. On the other hand, in Canada, cities' goals are related to specific policies in a more logical or rational fashion. In short, it appears that economic development planning is tied to the selection of policies to a greater extent in Canadian cities than in the USA. </jats:p>",

While most research has focused on aggregate effects, this article critically reviews evidence and arguments surrounding the role of transport infrastructure at the firm level. In addition to how transport investment affects firms’ transport decision directly, there are a number of mechanisms whereby transport investment can affect the location and spatial organization of firms. Such mechanisms can lead to increases of output and productivity and create firm-level benefits beyond the direct transport user benefits considered in traditional project evaluation. Transport project evaluation and transport policy more in general require an understanding of these micro-level transmission mechanisms to correctly guide investment decisions regarding the location and type of future transport projects. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of race versus class in shaping residential segregation patterns has been a contentious issue in segregation studies for decades. Despite the voluminous, interdisciplinary literature, scholars have reported conflicting evidence on the role of race versus class in residential segregations. We attribute the current inconclusive literature partially to the failure to consider scale explicitly in residential segregation measures, and partially to the growing complexity of a multiethnic melting pot in most cities in the United States. Inspired by new metrics employed by landscape ecologists to measure landscape heterogeneity, residential segregation is reconceived as a scale-dependent social phenomenon in this paper. We also present an alternative to existing structural or spatial segregation measures, considered as less efficient because most of the existing indices measure only a few dimensions of segregation at a single scale. We have developed a multiscale, lacunarity-based segregation measure, and have used it to examine the role of race versus class in residential segregation patterns in Houston, Texas. Using census-tract-level data from 1980 to 2000, we found that race is still the most important factor in explaining residential segregation despite the overall decline of segregation by both income and race. It was also found that the changing segregation patterns over time are contingent upon the scale as well as the race or income group considered. </jats:p>",

We examine two conceptions of success in plan implementation (conformance and performance), the effects of the implementation practices of planning agencies, and the capacity of agencies and permit applicants to bring about success. A key lesson from our New-Zealand-based evaluation is that implementation is somewhat weak. Another key point is that, if implementation is defined and measured in terms of conformance, plans and planners have an important influence on implementation success. Alternatively, if implementation is defined and measured in terms of performance, plans and planners are less influential in implementation. These lessons have broad implications for the theory and practice of plan implementation. </jats:p>",

A total of 884 sets of all cross-sectional statistics about planning applications arising from Comprehensive Development Area zones from December 1980 to August 2004 were used to test four hypotheses that evaluate the impact of shocks on the TPB through the use of a parametric technique, probit modeling. A total of 96 sets of all aggregate statistics on developers' applications for ‘consent to commence work’ from 1982 to 2004 were used to test yet another four hypotheses that evaluate the impact of shocks on developers using a nonparametric technique, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The inferences based on the statistical findings of the two sets of hypotheses, which satisfy the relevant goodness-of-fit tests, are (a) that the TPB was sensitive and responsive to these shocks in making its decisions; and (b) that developers were not sensitive to any of the shocks in terms of their readiness to build. </jats:p>",

Studying the construction of identities is important precisely because it offers our best hope for helping to undo their negative impact, while at the same time providing deeper insight into the role languages play in our interpretation of who does or doesn’t belong to which particular group. Djité, in a recent article in this journal (2006), argues that, in our multilingual world, linguistic identities are not the monolithic entities which people often take them for, with the result that individuals get misinterpreted based on the way they speak, provoking prejudice and discrimination. This is also, contrary to what Djité suggests, one of the principal thrusts of Joseph’s book <jats:italic>Language and Identity</jats:italic> (2004). The present article summarises the relevant arguments made in this latter book and attempts to clarify points of agreement and disagreement with Djité.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2002 the Russian parliament passed a law requiring all official languages within the Russian Federation to use the Cyrillic alphabet. The legislation caused great controversy and anger in some quarters, especially in Tatarstan, the Russian republic whose attempt to romanise the script for the Tatar language provoked the new law. This paper examines the background to these recent events in the former Soviet Union, showing how they provide a contemporary illustration of the ways that linguistic (in this case, orthographic) issues can interact with ideologies and discourses at the political and social levels. The paper takes an approach which treats orthography and script selection as social practices which are amenable to sociolinguistic analysis, even though they are more commonly modelled as autonomous systems (or “neutral technologies”) which can be detached from their social context (cf. Street’s “ideological” and “autonomous” models of literacy). The article begins with a very brief overview of the early twentieth-century changes of script from Arabic to Roman and then to Cyrillic, which affected most of the Turkic languages, including Tatar, and an account of the trend to return to the Roman alphabet in the immediate post-Soviet period. It goes on to describe the circumstances of the decision by Tatarstan to introduce the script change, and the resulting backlash from the government of the Russian Federation, in the form of a new language law. It then goes on to analyse the discourses which underlie this story of rebellion and reaction. In particular, the following discourses are identified and discussed: unity and membership (the discourse of belonging), technology and globalisation, cultural heritage (change and permanence), Cyrillic as “defective”/Cyrillic as a conduit for Russian lexis, romanisation as a threat to the integrity of Russia and its language. It is noted that many of the discourses present in the Tatarstan case are also found in other debates over orthographies elsewhere.</jats:p>",

Drawing on his experience of Ireland, the author examines the rich historical tradition of debate about the positive role which language can play in national development, and suggests a theoretical grounding for those arguments. The elaboration of such a theoretical basis is essential as a counterbalance to powerful and dominant global forces which engage in, as Stephen May puts it, “the denunciation of ethnicity”. Those pursuing these arguments have frequently used a form of economic Darwinism in order to justify the marginalisation or extermination of threatened languages or to oppose multilingualism generally. This paper lays out the foundations of an alternative approach which posits that all languages and cultures, regardless of their status or numerical size, can be integrated into processes of socio-economic development, and that none is inherently anti-development. It is hoped that the arguments presented here will also stimulate debate about the nature of the concept of development itself, and facilitate closer integration of the often distinct disciplines of language planning and policy and socio-economic development.</jats:p>",

Group sequential analysis in survival trials usually apply the error spending function approach due to the unpredictable amount of information available in an interim analysis. An alternative way is to apply adaptive methods where additionally the maximum amount of information and other designing parameters can be changed based on the information available at the interim stage. In this paper, it is shown how the inverse normal method can be used within a survival design using the log‐rank test for comparing two survival functions. This method allows for many kinds of design modifications. In case of no modifications, the inverse normal method coincides with the commonly used analysis strategy.</jats:p><jats:p>It is straightforward to specify effect estimates. Confidence intervals for the hazard ratio that can be calculated at each stage of the trial and intervals that can only be computed by the end of the trial are proposed. The latter also enables the calculation of median unbiased estimates. Overall<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐values can be defined analogously. Properties of the analyses techniques are investigated and compared with alternative approaches. It is shown that the proposed analysis technique might help to rescue an underpowered study and opens the way to other types of changes in design. The proposed technique is implemented in the software ADDPLAN Adaptive Design, Plans and Analyses (http://www.addplan.com). (© 2006 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim)</jats:p>",

Based on the strong locality of mutex constraints observed in many benchmarks of the Fourth International Planning Competition (IPC4), we propose to partition the constraints of a planning problem into groups based on their subgoals. Constraint partitioning leads to significantly easier subproblems that are similar to the original problem and that can be efficiently solved by the same planner with some modifications to its objective function. We present a partition-and-resolve strategy that looks for locally optimal subplans in constraint-partitioned temporal planning subproblems and that resolves those inconsistent global constraints across the subproblems. We also discuss some implementation details of SGPlan4, which include the resolution of violated global constraints, techniques for handling producible resources, landmark analysis, path finding and optimization, search-space reduction, and modifications of Metric-FF when used as a basic planner in SGPlan4.  Last, we show results on the sensitivity of each of these techniques in quality-time trade-offs and experimentally demonstrate that SGPlan4 is effective for solving the IPC3 and IPC4 benchmarks.</jats:p>"

The emergence of the port-operating TNC requires a fundamental epistemological shift in reconceptualising the port, from a single, fixed, spatial entity to a network of terminals operating under a corporate logic. This shift is twofold. First, because under port reforms corporate entry occurs overwhelmingly at the terminal level, the terminal rather than the port becomes the relevant spatial unit of analysis. Second, although spatial theories of the firm represent a longstanding stream in economic geography, such theories have yet to find general application in port studies. Consequently, in addressing the interface between transport and economic geographies, the authors suggest a geography of the port-operating TNC as a potential bridge. A decade of privatization in the port sector has rendered the industry an appropriate empirical ground for enquiry into spatial theories of the firm. Evidence from Asian port systems and business networks are put forward in sketching a new research agenda. </jats:p>",

The paper focuses on covert navigation where a mobile robot needs to plan a stealthy path to approach a designated destination in a cluttered environment. The aim is to minimize the robot's exposure to hostile sentries within the same environment. The approach can be adapted to work with different levels of initial knowledge the robot may have about both the environment map and the sentries' locations. The approach depends on estimating a cost value at each free-space location that presents the risk of being seen by any sentry. Based on the distance transform algorithm methodology, the minimum visibility–distance cost to a goal is calculated at each cell in the grid-based environment map. Moving along the steepest descent trajectory from any starting point generates an optimal covert path to a goal. The approach has been evaluated with both simulated and physical experiments. A number of test cases are presented. In each case, a path with considerable covertness, compared to a short path to the same destination, is generated. In addition to covert navigation, the approach is introduced briefly as a potential solution for other visibility-based path-planning problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVE. Global eradication of poliomyelitis may soon be achieved, but circulating polioviruses could reemerge years after eradication by reversion of live attenuated oral vaccine virus to a virulent form, laboratory stock mishandling, or bioterrorism. If a poliomyelitis outbreak occurs in the United States, access to a vaccine stockpile to interrupt viral spread will be necessary. Options for the stockpile include the inactivated polio vaccine and the live-attenuated trivalent and monovalent oral poliovirus vaccines. With differences in immunogenicity, adverse effects, availability, and other issues, the optimal vaccine choice for the stockpile is not clear. We sought to compare vaccine interventions for poliomyelitis outbreak control.</jats:p><jats:p>DESIGN. We applied decision analysis to 8 strategies for outbreak control: no intervention, 1 or 2 inactivated polio vaccine doses, 1 or 2 trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine doses, 1 or 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine doses, and sequential inactivated polio vaccine-monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine. Historical data from outbreaks in developed countries were used to estimate the risk of paralytic disease after a hypothetical reintroduction of circulating polioviruses. The outcome measure was cases of paralytic poliomyelitis.</jats:p><jats:p>RESULTS. Monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine provided optimal outbreak control in most scenarios because of high seroconversion rates with 1 dose. Control provided by trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine and inactivated polio vaccine was equivalent at high vaccine coverage rates. At low intervention rates, trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine produced fewer paralytic cases than inactivated polio vaccine in highly immune populations but more cases than inactivated polio vaccine in poorly immunized groups because of secondary transmission of oral poliovirus vaccine virus and vaccine-derived viruses.</jats:p><jats:p>CONCLUSIONS. This model suggests that monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine would be the most advantageous vaccine for outbreak control. If a monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine stockpile is impractical, the optimal vaccine choice depends on the previous immunity and the anticipated intervention rates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In today’s competitive environment, supply chain management is a major concern for a company. Two of the key issues in supply chain management are transportation and inventory management. To achieve significant savings, companies should integrate these two issues instead of treating them separately. This paper considers the problem of selecting the appropriate distribution strategy for delivering a family of products from a set of suppliers to a set of plants so that the total transportation, pipeline inventory, and plant inventory costs are minimized. With reasonable assumptions, a simple model is presented to provide a good solution that can serve as a guideline for the design and implementation of the distribution network. Due to the plant inventory cost, the problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming problem. The problem is difficult to solve because the objective function is highly nonlinear and neither convex nor concave. A greedy heuristic is proposed to find an initial solution and an upper bound. A heuristic and a branch-and-bound algorithm are developed based on the Lagrangian relaxation of the nonlinear program. Computational experiments are performed, and based on the results we can conclude that the performance of the algorithms are promising. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The study of a herd marks the point where ethnography and ethology meet. In the midst of this shared phenomenon, versions of ‘the social’ hinge on relations between herders and herd. In this paper I consider how our understanding of a herd might be extended by an awareness of its diverse geographies. This is achieved by reconstructing the entwined biographies of human and animal subjects dating from the reintroduction of reindeer to Scotland in 1952. The first transportation of reindeer from Scandinavia to the Cairngorm mountains was orchestrated by Mikel Utsi, a Lappish emigré from northernmost Sweden, and Ethel John Lindgren, a social anthropologist from Cambridge, of American–Swedish descent. What began as an ecological–economic experiment would occupy the couple until their deaths: Utsi's in 1979 and Lindgren's in 1988. I draw on a ‘make-do’ methodology undertaken in collaboration with past herders and the scattered company of the present herd: walking a sentient topography of traditional grazing grounds; renewing encounters with charismatic animals through photographic portraits; consulting an archive of herding diaries; and mapping a hidden ecology of landscape relics. These different registers of memory are used to explore how day-to-day engagements between herders and herd were rooted in unconventional systems of ecological and cultural knowledge. By reanimating a local landscape, the resulting narrative works at an intimate scale, while simultaneously gathering momentum from transnational movements of humans, animals, and traditions. Here, salvage and exchange are possible between geography's heritage of landscape and folk study and the sculpting of contemporary research. </jats:p>",

In most studies migration is viewed as a virus carrier and population mixer. In this paper I present a framework conceptualizing the link between temporary migration and migrants' heightened HIV risk behaviors. Data from a large and population-based survey conducted in 2003 in southwestern China are used to empirically test the proposed framework. Results suggest that temporary migrants are more likely to use drugs than nonmigrants; they are also more likely to have had unprotected casual sex and a greater number of casual-sex partners than comparable nonmigrants. Postmigration economic marginalization, social isolation, and lax social control contribute to migrants' elevated risk behaviors, so do migration selectivity and social influences from family and peers. Temporary migrants are at risk of HIV; intervention needs to target migrants' postmigration milieus and their social network of family and peers. </jats:p>",

The argument that intractable policy controversies result from internally consistent but incompatible normative – prescriptive scripts which name and frame problems differently is explored. Different waste-policy frames are identified and it is suggested that these frames do indeed contribute to the stubbornness of on-going debate on incineration versus waste reduction. However, the importance of interest, identities, and ineffectual communication in these controversies is also highlighted, and it is suggested that consensus building can result in practical agreements even in the face of seemingly incompatible frames. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I want to ask whether there is anything to be gained by taking seriously a posthumanist analysis of the relationship between humanity and the natural world, one that in fact extinguishes the dualism and produces only ‘naturecultures’. I will examine this question through a new analysis of the relationship between gum trees and Australia. Most humanist accounts, such as those developed in ‘traditional’ social anthropology and sociology, privilege the activity, agency, and representations of humans, and in so doing render the natural world and its individual species as passive and of interest only insofar as they provide a palette of meanings for essentially human symbolism, dreamings, and imaginaries. Such an approach has an impeccable track record from Emile Durkheim to Mary Douglas and it is not one I want to challenge here per se. What I do want to challenge is the implicit assumption that this is all there is to, or all we can say about, the relationship between nature and humanity. Rather than (only) ask what nature (or gum trees in this case) means, I want to ask (also) what nature does, and, importantly, what implications those actions have for the world, nature, humans, and ‘the social’. I argue that this approach takes us considerably further towards a more mature sociology of nature in Australia. </jats:p>",

The findings are that (1) Los Angeles residents may experience power outages lasting up to 10 days; (2) what we call the power rapidity risk (the joint probability distribution of restoration of a specified number of customers in a specified amount of time) varies throughout the area; (3) there is a relatively high likelihood that more repair materials than are currently available will be required if a large earthquake occurs; and (4) there are ways to reduce the expected duration of earthquake-initiated power outages and they should be subjected to cost-benefit analysis. These results should be useful to utilities and emergency planners in Los Angeles. The new simulation modeling approach could be used in other seismically active cities to gain insights into the restoration process that other modeling approaches cannot provide. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to take some steps towards a renewed understanding of landscape and the gazing subject. A first main section, ‘Depth, outlines Merleau-Ponty's final visual philosophy and its attempts to replace a spectatorial conception of vision with an embodied ontology that accords transcendance to the depth of the visual world. A second section, ‘fold’, engages with Deleuze's rendition of Leibniz's philosophy as a means of both critiquing and supplementing Merleau-Ponty's account. Through these analyses I seek to rewrite the visual gaze upon landscape by exploring the ontological processes (processes of depth, processes of folding) which afford its actualisation. I thus seek to produce an account of gazing as an eventful actualisation and distribution of selves and landscape, through attending to the depths and folds of an immanent plane, from which distinctive and durable selves and landscapes arise and with which they are always in relation. Here, landscape is not a way of seeing the world. Nor is it ‘something seen’, an external, inert surface. Rather, the term ‘landscape’ names the materialities and sensibilities with which we see. </jats:p>",

Six new interventions for clients were developed, including one‐to‐one facilitation. Where the latter occurred, a key aspect of client management and commitment adopted by HealthPartners was joint preparation of action plans by client and facilitator. Such action plans covered issues identified, stage of change, goals, actions and progress (the extent to which actions specified in a previous plan had been carried out by the time the plan was revisited). The paper provides an overview of the action‐planning process and its outcomes, and the results of an impact assessment of the programme as a whole. To be effective in changing behaviour, it appears important for many clients to participate in a group with peers in a relevant activity.</jats:p>",

How might such apparent coherencies be accounted for? The question calls for a shift not only in what we mean by representation but, more importantly, in how we ‘take’ representation—that is, how we engage, interact, or acknowledge the presentation of a stable, demobilised, and closed world. I argue that this shift can take place only if landscape studies jettisons its reliance on concepts such as culture to explain the presence of the landscape and begins to think about such coherencies as a performance of coherence rather than coherence itself. I draw upon Derrida's idea of ‘dreams of presence’ to describe these performances of coherence as well as to theorise more broadly how an always-already deconstructing world can often be presented to us as closed. </jats:p>",

This paper proposes an integrated corporate planning model, which extends the forecasting‐based discount dividend pricing method into an optimization‐based valuation framework to make production and financial decisions simultaneously for a firm facing marker uncertainty. We also develop an efficient algorithm to solve the resulting integer stochastic programming model with nonlinear constraints.

Moreover, he identifies themes which were to dominate the mainstream linguistic agenda, and sets out principles of change which would influence commentators throughout the twentieth century. However, Bollack’s article must also be seen in the context of his ambitions for Bolak, his own invented language, the underlying principles of which are seen — often wrongly — to drive change in natural languages.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Efforts to work towards the rematerialisation of landscape have recently been augmented by concerns for corporeal, nonrepresentational dimensions of landscape experience as well as for nonhuman agency. Increasingly, landscape is conceptualised as a never-finished product of processes and practices that are both material and symbolic. Although such trends are reflected to some extent in work on landscape in colonial contexts, in this paper I contend that a closer engagement with these new directions may offer a useful means of breathing new life into colonial landscapes that, in some scholarly work, appear to have little existence beyond European representations that were made of them. Arguing for a conception of colonial landscape as process, I suggest that there is a need not only for recognising the material and corporeal dimensions of European experiences of colonial landscapes but also for attending to the ways in which those landscapes were brought into being and given meaning through the frequently mundane and locally focused activities of everyday life. Following a brief review of recent work on colonial landscapes, these suggestions are explored in the context of Spanish encounters with landscape in early colonial Peru. Initially focusing on accounts produced between the eve of conquest and the mid-16th century, the analysis then shifts to a legal battle that was fought in the early 17th century between two priests who occupied neighbouring parishes in the highland province of Huarochirí. </jats:p>",

I examine how UK outdoor advertising companies remap that space, segmenting and pricing certain areas of cities, and routes to and around cities. I argue that, in this cartographic, taxonomising role, advertising constitutes one of the forces that continually makes and remakes city space. Using Lefebvre's concept of city rhythms, I argue that outdoor advertising acts to align the urban rhythms of travel and work with the commercial rhythms of product innovation, promotion, and the life cycle of the commodity. This creates an urban time–space of ‘commodity rhythms’ which has important implications for people's experience of cities whilst engendering new connections between commodities and people moving around cities. I argue that this constitutes an adaptation of Foucault's biopolitics where it is precisely the rhythmic connections between populations of people and populations (and life cycles) of commodities that are at stake: it is a mutation of the metabolism of city spaces. </jats:p>",

These increases are mirrored in Europe and North America. In Britain many of these cameras videotape town centres, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. How do CCTV systems account for the space of the town centres in which they operate? What theoretical sensibilities can we use to engage with CCTV spatial accounting? To what extent do terms such as ‘professional,’ ‘legal’, ‘sociotechnical’, and ‘mundane’ enable adequate renditions of spatial-accounting activity? In this paper I will argue that engagement with the accomplishment of mundane public flows and specific incidents of accountable otherness can initiate a discussion of these questions and initiate an alternative to panoptic renditions of CCTV. The discussion will seek to draw together a potentially tense and disruptive theoretical combination of ethnomethodology and science and technology studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the core concepts in transport and economic geography states that transportation is a derived demand, both for passengers and for freight transport alike. This assumption is reflected in the conventional literature which underlines that transport exists because it is the expression of a spatially differentiated function of supply and demand, and is thus considered to be ‘derived’ from other activities. However, recent developments in logistics and supply-chain management underline a paradigm shift in the consideration of freight transport as a derived demand. In many sectors of activity, the functions of production, consumption, and transportation have become embedded to the point that it is difficult to tell them apart. The author investigates the extent to which the concept of derived transport demand is being challenged by supply-chain management strategies. To overcome some of the inadequacies of the conventional perspective, it is suggested that several segments of freight-related activities should be considered as part of an integrated transport demand. Although operationally derived demand still applies to freight distribution, strategically—at the level of global commodity chains—integrated demand appears to be the emerging paradigm that is worth investigating further. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>  Traditional cost management systems adopted by construction firms have many problems, which are widely discussed in the literature: the information provided by them is usually too late, and tends to be too aggregated and too distorted to be relevant for production management.  The main objective of this research work is to propose a project cost planning and control model for construction firms. This model aims to support the development of production management systems, in which cost management and production planning and control can be gradually integrated, in order to overcome the existing limitations of cost accounting systems. The scope of the model was limited to building projects carried out by small and medium sized companies, involved in both product development and production. The development of the model was based on the literature review and also on the results of nine empirical studies conducted in four different Brazilian construction firms. The model suggests the integrated application of three fairly well known cost management techniques: operational cost estimating, S‐curves and target costing. By using this set of tools, it is expected that cost management will become more proactive, and able to deal with the dynamic, uncertain and complex construction environment that exists in most projects. The model was partially tested in two case studies, in which it provided key information for supporting decision making related to design, production planning and contracts with suppliers.</jats:p>",

This approach has stretched the boundaries of academic inquiry well beyond mainstream conceptualisations of economic agency as isolated from its setting. An assumption that underpinned research and policymaking in the new learning is that economic activity is typically socially embedded, which is generally taken to imply local embeddedness. In our paper, drawing upon the findings of extensive research in rural Cumbria, we question this assumption. We argue that in the context of rural Cumbria, the conceptualisation of locality may go beyond territorial notions. This argument does not support a return to the notion of the isolated economic agent, but advocates a move forward to the detailed exploration of the interface between agency and context. </jats:p>",

Ilustra-se como essas políticas, comuns no século XIX quando respondiam ao ideal de uma nação = um idioma, persistiram no século XX e se estendem até os dias atuais. Propõe-se que esses ideais são baseados em três princípios equivocados, a saber, que a língua materna de todo o território é o espanhol, que a presença do português no Uruguai é devida à influência do Brasil e que todos os uruguaios devem falar espanhol, ou não serão verdadeiros uruguaios. Finalmente, examinam-se as orientações das planificações lingüísticas propostas por Ruiz (1984) e conclui-se que o português uruguaio não deve ser visto como um problema ou um direito, mas como um recurso nacional do qual toda a nação pode se beneficiar. Para tanto, é necessário que se esclareça o status do português uruguaio como um dialeto do português tão legítimo como qualquer outro. Desta maneira, acredita-se que as planificações lingüísticas baseadas em ideais ultrapassados e discriminatórios possam atualizar-se e responder a necessidades atuais de integração regional e apelo multicultural.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article considers the supermarket manager's problem of forecasting demand for a product as a function of the product's attributes and of market control variables. To forecast sales on the stock keeping unit (SKU) level, a good model should account for product attributes, historical sales levels, and store specifics, and to control for marketing mix. One of the challenges here is that many variables which describe product, store, or promotion conditions are categorical with hundreds or thousands of levels in a single attribute. Identifying the right product attributes and incorporating them correctly into a prediction model is a very difficult statistical problem. This article proposes an analytical engine that combines techniques from statistical market response modeling, datamining, and combinatorial optimization to produce a small, efficient rule set that predicts sales volume levels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In a field of research about general reasoning mechanisms, it is essential to have appropriate benchmarks. Ideally, the benchmarks should reflect possible applications of the developed technology. In AI Planning, researchers more and more tend to draw their testing examples from the benchmark collections used in the International Planning Competition (IPC). In the organization of (the deterministic part of) the fourth IPC,  IPC-4, the authors therefore invested significant effort to create a useful set of benchmarks. They come from five different (potential) real-world applications of planning: airport ground traffic control, oil derivative transportation in pipeline networks, model-checking safety properties, power supply restoration, and UMTS call setup. Adapting and preparing such an application for use as a benchmark in the IPC involves, at the time, inevitable (often drastic) simplifications, as well as careful choice between, and engineering of, domain encodings. For the first time in the IPC, we used compilations to formulate complex domain features in simple languages such as STRIPS, rather than just dropping the more interesting problem constraints in the simpler language subsets. The article explains and discusses the five application domains and their adaptation to form the PDDL test suites used in IPC-4. We summarize known theoretical results on structural properties of the domains, regarding their computational complexity and provable properties of their topology under the h+ function (an idealized version of the relaxed plan heuristic). We present new (empirical) results illuminating properties such as the quality of the most wide-spread heuristic functions (planning graph, serial planning graph, and relaxed plan), the growth of propositional representations over instance size, and the number of actions available to achieve each fact; we discuss these data in conjunction with the best results achieved by the different kinds of planners participating in IPC-4.</jats:p>"

The ability to provide more-coherent data on workplace segregation, by religion, in Northern Ireland is crucial in terms of advancing equality and other social-justice agendas. I argue that a more-accurate monitoring of religious composition of workplaces is part of an overall need to develop a spatial approach in which the importance of ethnically territorialised spaces in the reproduction of ethnosectarian disputation is understood. </jats:p>",

Research suggests that such design changes often can be traced to earlier decisions involving endogenous adaptation or internal organizational change. Two such decisions are a firm's technology position and planning mode. This study examines the relationship between technology position and planning mode in predicting the magnitude of design change in process redesign projects. The conceptual frame applied in examining these relationships involves a synthesis of Miles and Snow's adaptive cycle with elements central to concurrent engineering. Our results indicate that the magnitude of design change is related to differences in technology position and planning mode. To effectively implement organizational change, firms must leverage their IT platform by carefully timing IT investments in accordance with their adopted technology position. Directing the trajectory of a firm's IT platform and deploying it so as to complement the firm's technology position reduces design uncertainty, promoting reengineering success.</jats:p>",

This paper explores to what extent and how environmental governance is changing under the conditions of the Information Age. On the waves of information and communication technologies and globalisation processes, a new informational mode of environmental governance—or informational governance—is emerging, in which environmental information gains transformative powers. Information generation, processing, transmission, and use become fundamental (re)sources of power and transformation in environmental reform. As illustrated by several examples, the conventional powers of (state) authority in environmental protection are partly replaced by informational resources, flows, and processes in new governance arrangements and networks. These new modes of informational governance not only point at innovative means of environmental reform, but also pose a series of more critical questions related to new power constellations, (information) access and democracy, and structural uncertainties following multiple knowledges. Hence, a new research agenda emerges for the environmental social sciences. </jats:p>",

The Census Bureau has implemented an on-going annual survey program, The American Community Survey (ACS), to produce the detailed transportation information traditionally gathered once a decade through the census long form. In May 2005, a conference entitled Census Data for Transportation Planning: Preparing for the Future was held in Irvine California. The main objectives of that conference were to: 1) demonstrate applications of 2000 Census data in transportation; 2) review the ACS and assess its usefulness for transportation; 3) recommend improvements to census products and methods; and 4) recommend actions that federal, state, and regional agencies and the Census Bureau can take to improve the use of census transportation products. This paper, summarizing and building on the conference, discusses census information from the perspective of the transportation community. It looks at uses of census data, presents key issues related to the efficacy of the ACS for transportation, presents possible solutions to issues with current data programs, and concludes with suggestions that should enhance the value of census data for transportation. </jats:p>",

We build upon previous work to assess the extent to which the outcome of the multi-modal study process is consistent with the government's original intentions, as specified in relevant policy documentation. Our findings are that, although the process led to substantial achievements in some areas, its main outcome has been the approval of a host of new road schemes and—apart from some potentially significant public transport investment in the West Midlands—very little else. Viewed in the context of other developments since Labour came to power in 1997, such an outcome would appear to indicate the further disintegration of the party's much-vaunted ‘integrated’ transport policy. </jats:p>",

As anecdotal evidence mounts in the business literature about revolutionary changes taking place in the distributive sectors of the economy, more analysis from a geographic perspective is needed. Among transport modes, air cargo is unique because it is one of the backbones of global trade for many commodities. The author analyzes the transformations affecting the transatlantic (USA–Europe) air-cargo market, focusing on the changing roles of the different types of firms in the industry in performing the functions necessary for the transportation of goods by air and for processing associated information. The importance of information handling, processing, and transmittal has been amplified relative to transportation functions, redefining the interrelationship between the physical space of goods flows and the virtual space of information flows. As a result, functional integration and consolidation have become the dominant processes for future industry development, leading to market concentration and the emergence of growing cargo-hub airports. </jats:p>",

The risk analysis paradigm provides a framework that brings together scientists and policy experts to make better decisions for both people and animals. Risk analysis is a multidisciplinary, science‐based process that provides an organized and logical approach for incorporating scientific information into policy development in the real world. By blending four specific goal‐oriented stages–hazard identification, risk assessment, risk management, and risk communication–one can logically assess the probability that an adverse event, such as the introduction of an emerging disease into a naïve population, will occur.

In the context of emerging paradigms of global production seeking to capture the outsourcing process with developing countries, the port–free-trade zone bundle is suggested as a valid intersect between spaces of production and spaces of circulation. Such zones act as interfaces between local and global spaces: they are spaces of global articulation. A case study of how such global articulation spaces are created in China is presented from the example of the Tianjin Economic Development Area (TEDA). Evidence suggests that, as the world factory, China purposely set up port–FEZs (free economic zone) in pairs and the use of containerized transport has been highly restricted to port-related production places; hence a dualism has been created in China's transport. It is found that TEDA consists of a continuum of customs-regulated spaces which act as a transition zone between domestic and international ‘status' commodities following a global production logic. At the same time, the creation of such enclaves consolidates a spatial ‘splintering’ effect that alienates such enclaves from their surroundings. </jats:p>",

The authors aim to discuss the latest methodological developments in the monitoring of complex spatial strategies by examining the monitoring framework for local development documents in England. They examine the concept of spatial planning, issues and challenges surrounding spatial policy monitoring, and some emerging views over policy monitoring and evaluation. They then discuss the relevance of these latest ideas and different design principles of indicator frameworks to underpin the development of a monitoring framework for local development documents. Six core design components are discussed: the structure – performance model; the objectives – targets – indicators approach; a nested hierarchy of indicators; a framework of indicators; the use of analytical indicator bundles; and analytical principles. The authors identify the gaps and challenges in the developing monitoring framework for spatial planning in England and the wider, transferable, lessons to be learnt for complex policy monitoring. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Japanese city planning, the effective floor area ratio (FAR) of land lots, or housing density, is delimited by zoning and restrictions on the form of buildings (shape controls). To evaluate this system comprehensively, the authors analyze how the maximum allowable FAR (effective FAR) of residential lots affects land prices with a hedonic approach. Based on data on Tokyo, the analysis reveals that lots with an effective FAR of less than 110%, or between 170% and 210%, were significantly cheaper than those with an effective FAR of between 110% and 160%. The result for the low effective FAR group was explained by restrictions on floor space, and the result for the 170% to 210% group applied to areas with relatively unattractive landscape. Further examination showed that the FAR currently specified by zoning is more often effective when it is low, and that restrictions in the form of shape controls are more often effective when the effective FAR is high. These analyses provided criteria for evaluating the current land use control system. Based on the results, concrete proposals are made for improving the regulation system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>China is inhabited by <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 20 percent of the world population, but has only 7 percent of global arable land and only 6.6 percent of global freshwater resources. These unfavourable relationships between population size and the basic resources for food production – soil and water – require careful food security and contingency planning by the Chinese authorities. The country has been remarkably successful in raising its food production since 1949 at a faster rate (400 percent) than the increase in its population (240 percent). This has basically been achieved by increasing the yields per unit area with enhanced fertilizer use, as the total size of arable land has been decreasing in recent years. Though China attempts to be largely self‐sufficient in food grain production, two possible contingency scenarios are suggested that might cause grave problems: (1) severe multi‐annual drought; (2) reduced chemical fertilizer manufacturing. If Chinese food production would drop as a result by, say, 33 percent, famine, the dreaded scourge throughout Chinese history, might recur. A shortage of <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 150 million tons of food grains cannot easily be buffered by the volume of food grains annually traded on the world market, <jats:italic>ca</jats:italic> 240 million tons. Much of this amount tends to be committed already to traditional buyers, as most countries in the world have to import food grains. Cash reserves, therefore, may not guarantee food purchases, because global grain reserves are limited and declining. The formation and maintenance of large internal food grain reserves in China, common in its tradition and ancient history, seem the only realistic contingency planning strategy to avert famine in case of a severe decline in its food production in future crisis years.</jats:p>",

In particular, we use a place-specific approach to test the displacement hypothesis that the migration behaviour of the less-well-educated native-born population is sensitive to the inflows of immigrants. Based on analyses of microdata from five consecutive censuses covering the period from 1981 to 2001, we find that the migration–immigration relationships are complex, often subtle, and inconsistent across the three cities. Growth in the immigrant population is correlated with an increased out-migration rate among the less-well-educated native-born population, but only in Toronto and Vancouver. This correlation, however, is not independent of changes in housing prices. We also find no consistent support for an alternative hypothesis that economic restructuring accounts for the net out-migration from immigrant gateway cities. </jats:p>",

The authors examine the process and content of two CSs in southern England as part of an ongoing project to understand their impact and explore ways in which CSs may be prepared in a meaningful and effective manner. They critically evaluate a number of dimensions of CS formulation, including: the important role of local political and cultural context; the extent to which they reflect and reproduce a shift from representational to participatory forms of democracy; the impact of national policy agendas; the role of place identity; the relative influence of local government officers and members; and the dynamics and implications of particular forms of conflict mediation and consensus building. They conclude that the process of CS formation studied illustrates the tensions and opportunities contained within the Labour government's modernisation agenda. Governmentalities of active citizenship and participatory democracy mingle with more representational and managerial modes of local governance, creating hybrid structures, processes, and outcomes that shape the process of strategy formulation. All this is set within a context of a dynamic and variable set of place identities and pervasive resource (inter)dependencies which both close down and open up the range of issues and interests that are drawn into the process of CS formulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> After a meteoric rise to prominence in the 1990s, the practice of conceptualizing the relationships between places in terms of networks has recently come under fire within economic geography. Its critics claim that networks are ‘fuzzy’, ‘anemic’, and ‘overendowed’. Others have criticized the network approach for its insensitivity to the way in which power is transmitted unevenly across networks. However, these are not necessarily failings of the network metaphor but, rather, of its employment to date within economic geography. Where most economic geographers have come to see the network metaphor as a way of representing connections between the nodes that they study (frequently cities or firms), transport geographers have long taken the network itself as the principal object of study. In the research of many transport geographers, networks appear as powerful agents shaping the places they connect. Incorporation of lessons drawn from transport geography into the burgeoning literature on networks in economic geography can overcome some of the growing criticism of network methodologies. The author uses an analysis of container flows to the West Coast of the United States to demonstrate the advantages of a network methodology based on transport networks. </jats:p>",

Interviews were conducted in Red Cross shelters in the greater Houston area. </jats:p><jats:p> Results. Many evacuees suffered physical and emotional stress during the storm and its aftermath, including going without adequate food and water. In comparison with New Orleans and Louisiana residents overall, disproportionate numbers of this group were African American, had low incomes, and had no health insurance coverage. Many had chronic health conditions and relied heavily on the New Orleans public hospital system, which was destroyed in the storm. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. Our results highlight the need for better plans for emergency communication and evacuation of low-income and disabled citizens in future disasters and shed light on choices facing policymakers in planning for the long-term health care needs of vulnerable populations. </jats:p>",

At the broadest level the paper contributes conceptually to research whose objective is to challenge the inevitability of global imaginaries. Situated in the specific context of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, such action as that of the North Harris Trust has the potential to disturb global narratives of enclosure and privatisation. In recounting the story, the argument centres on the political possibilities of the land. In parallel with arguments concerning ‘place’, I examine how the re-creation of a collective, place-based identity in the new political spaces afforded by the North Harris Trust is linked to the process of negotiating the meanings of the land. The meanings of the land relate both to the mediation of historically resonant collective rights to the land and to how ‘nature’ is constituted in the search for socially just and sustainable futures. The focus is on the principles and everyday practices through which land and community are coproduced. </jats:p>",

We compared planning performance between chess (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>=25) and non‐chess players (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic>=25) using a standard psychometric planning task, the Tower of London (ToL) test. We also assessed fluid intelligence (Raven Test), as well as verbal and visuospatial working memory. As expected, chess players showed better planning performance than non‐chess players, an effect most strongly expressed in difficult problems. On the other hand, they showed longer planning and movement execution times, especially for incorrectly solved trials. No differences in fluid intelligence and verbal/visuospatial working memory were found between both groups. These findings indicate that better performance in chess players is associated with disproportionally longer solution times, although it remains to be investigated whether motivational or strategic differences account for this result.</jats:p>",

Urban areas in Japan have always been threated by urban conflagrations due to the high number of wooden structures. The Tokyo metropolitan area which was previously known as Edo until the Meiji Revolution in 1864. Dramatic changes in power was successful but few urban structure reformation occurred, and Tokyo was damaged by urban conflagrations in the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa Eras. The fervent wishes of Japanese urban planners centered on construction of fireproof urban areas. Such wishes accounted for little in actual policy, however, as witnessed to by the failure of Tokyo officials to construct fireproof urban architectures following the massive destruction left by World War II. In September 1959, the Ise-Wan (Ise Bay) Typhoon caused tremendous damage and left over 5,000 dead. As measures against such disasters, the Japanese government enacted the Disaster Countermeasures Basic Act in 1961. Howevers, measure against Earthquake-induced disasters were yet far from sufficient although Japan experienced hit by the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923. In 1964, the Niigata Earthquake clearly demonstrated modern Niigata City's vulnerability to earthquakes despite its facilities for the National Sports Festival were equipped with modern technology, all of these facilities were destroyed. Reflecting such disasters, reexamination of measure against earthquake disaster began at coastal cities of Japan, which were constructed in post war time. This paper tracks developments in Japanese urban planning movement that the author took part in for about 20 years from 1964.</jats:p>",

Zero-tailpipeemission vehicles are compared. The battery electric vehicle has the highest electrical efficiency, but other requirements imply that plug-in hybrids or fuel cell hybrids might be a better option in some types of vehicles.

For conservation planning to be relevant, the impact of landscape configuration on population processes and the viability of species needs to be considered. We present a novel method for selecting reserve systems that maximize persistence across multiple species, subject to a conservation budget. We use a spatially explicit metapopulation model to estimate extinction risk, a function of the ecology of the species and the amount, quality and configuration of habitat. We compare our new method with more traditional, area‐based reserve selection methods, using a ten‐species case study, and find that the expected loss of species is reduced 20‐fold. Unlike previous methods, we avoid designating arbitrary weightings between reserve size and configuration; rather, our method is based on population processes and is grounded in ecological theory.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we developed models to infer the size and placement of geographical ranges of hypothetical non‐described species, based on the range size frequency distribution of anurans recently described in the Cerrado Biome, on the level of knowledge (number of inventories) and on surrogates for habitat suitability. The rationale for these models is as follow: (1) the range size frequency distribution of these species should be similar to the range‐restricted species, which have been most recently described in the Cerrado Biome; (2) the probability of new discoveries will increase in areas with low biodiversity knowledge, mainly in suitable areas, and (3) assuming range continuity, new species should occupy adjacent cells only if the level of knowledge is low enough to allow the existence of undiscovered species. We ran a model based on the number of inventories only, and two models combining effects of number of inventories and two different estimates of habitat suitability, for a total of 100 replicates each. Finally, we performed a complementary analysis using simulated annealing to solve the set‐covering problem for each simulation (i.e. finding the smallest number of cells so that all species are represented at least once), using extents of occurrence of 160 species (131 real anuran species plus 29 new simulated species). The revised reserve system that included information about unknown or poorly sampled taxa significantly shifted northwards, when compared to a system based on currently known species. This main result can be explained by the paucity of biodiversity data in this part of the biome, associated with its relatively high habitat suitability. As a precautionary measure, weighted by the inferred distribution data, the prioritization of a system of reserves in the north part of the biome appears to be defensible.</jats:p>",

The two patients with high VMAT expression and high <jats:sup>123</jats:sup>I‐MIBG uptake were treated with <jats:sup>131</jats:sup>I‐MIBG (2–3 × 8 GBq). <jats:italic>In vitro</jats:italic>, the VMAT antagonist, reserpine, and the membrane pump inhibitor, clomipramine, inhibited the uptake of <jats:sup>123</jats:sup>I‐MIBG into tumor cells equally well (48% and 53% reduction respectively, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). SSTR2 was the most abundant receptor subtype, but in the two malignant PGs its expression was only 110–260 copies/1,000 β‐actin. The transporters at the cell membrane and in the vesicular membrane both appear to be of importance for the uptake of <jats:sup>123</jats:sup>I‐MIBG into malignant PC/PG. Quantitative determination of VMAT expression may be helpful in selecting patients suitable for radionuclide therapy with <jats:sup>131</jats:sup>I‐MIBG. The present data indicate that SSTR‐mediated radionuclide therapy will not be effective treatment of malignant PC/PG.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",
