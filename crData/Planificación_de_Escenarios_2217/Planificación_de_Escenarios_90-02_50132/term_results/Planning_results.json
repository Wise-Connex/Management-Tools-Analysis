Few attempts have been made to formalize the structure of the planning knowledge for hierarchical planning. For a given domain, there is usually more than one way to define its planning knowledge. Some of the definitions can lead to efficient planning, while others may not. In this paper, we provide a set of restrictions which defines the relationships between a non‐primitive action and its set of subactions. When satisfied, these restrictions guarantee improved efficiency for hierarchical planning. One important feature of these restrictions is that they are syntactic and therefore do not depend on the particular structure of any plan. Along with these restrictions, we also provide algorithms for preprocessing the planning knowledge of a hierarchical planner. When used during planning, the preprocessed operator hierarchies can enable a planner to significantly reduce its search space.</jats:p>",

The marketing process is described in the context of its application in the wine industry and the environment in which it operates: changing consumption patterns in the industrialised nations, new distribution patterns, and different social and environmental issues. The segmentation of the wine market into two distinct areas, fine wines and beverage wines, each operating independently of the other, is described and the marketing mix factors which the wine marketer can deploy in order to maximise opportunities in these markets are detailed, utilising research into wine consumers' behaviour. The factors detailed are the product, its tangible and intangible benefits; the price — market skimming, market penetration, neutral pricing; the communication mix — word of mouth, journalism, sales promotion, advertising; branding and positioning; ranging, and the distribution channels. It is shown that marketing planning is essential for the winemaker, whether a one‐person boutique winery or a large multinational. The steps to take in preparing a marketing plan are described and guidance is given so that the winemaker can make it happen, both to satisfy consumers' needs and to make a profit.</jats:p>",

By the peak period of the war effort (1943/4) the military were using the output of 55 per cent of all manufacturing manpower, civilian consumption was about one-fifth below 1939 levels, and government was spending half the national income. In comparison with most belligerents, and especially the major Axis powers, this was an unparalleled level of devotion of resources to the war effort (Milward 1987, ch. 3). It necessarily involved a radical recasting of the instruments of economic policy, which, albeit to a contestable degree, left a permanent mark on the relations between the state and the economy. Parallel to this planning of the economy for war purposes was an increasing concern for planning the peace; and whilst much of this was only to reach fruition after 1945, it is in many ways as much a part of the history of the war as is the planning for war. Whilst the first half of this chapter deals with wartime planning, the second half outlines this planning for peace and its significance.</jats:p>",

The guidelines also emphasize the fundamentals associated with constant bottomhole pressure methods of well control. After the basic principles are reviewed, the characteristics of oil base mud are discussed. These characteristics are then related to all of the basic principles. Following this review, there is a practical example based on experiences Conoco had on a deep, high-pressure gas well drilled with oil base mud.

Such problems are frequently attributed to mud/shale chemical interaction, abnormal pore fluid pressures and excessive overburden or tectonic earth stresses. Problems experienced include 'lost time' due to tight hole, sloughing, and even loss of the hole. This paper attempts to evaluate the practical application of mechanical stability studies to directional well planning and emphasizes the importance of a 'combined approach' when tackling specific shales, where problem severity is frequently best understood in terms of both borehole stress and chemistry.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An analytical technique has been developed, which utilizes wireline sonic, bulk density and gamma ray data from offset wells, to estimate the mechanical integrity of the wellbore with depth and hence the mud weights required to support the borehole wall without fracturing weaker beds. Increasing hole inclination usually narrows the choice of safe operating mud weights. The log was evaluated in CONOCO's Ikan Pari development field in Block 'B', South China Sea Indonesia, where shale 'bridging' and 'sloughing' had plagued earlier drilling campaigns. These recent efforts to identify the causes of hole problems in Block 'B' demonstrate the cost saving potential of stability studies to development well planning and should be applicable to many other areas. A stability log from the vertical well in an offshore development field can be re-run at the planned well trajectories; this can provide valuable input to casing seat and mud weight selection, cement program design, fracture gradient calculation, drilling procedures through problem sections and directional well planning, (particularly high angle profiles).</jats:p>",

The United States pattern mainly revolves around the rise of high-technology districts like Silicon Valley and Route 128 which comprise dense networks of small entrepreneurial firms and other related institutions. Despite its tremendous innovative capabilities, this pattern generates significant costs (that is, high turnover of labor, chronic entrepreneurship, and an emphasis on breakthrough innovations at the expense of manufactured products) which are not sufficiently recognized by proponents of the flexible specialization or ‘simple flexibility’ thesis. The Japanese approach to restructuring is contrasted as one of ‘structured flexibility’ where large corporations perform important ‘system governance’ functions in the linking of manufacturing and innovation and act as focal points in just-in-time production complexes. Japan's pattern of ‘structured flexibility’ overcomes many of the limitations of high-technology organization in the USA. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Robots must plan and execute tasks in the presence of uncer tainty. Uncertainty arises from sensing errors, control errors, and the geometry of the environment. By employing a com bined strategy offorce and position control, a robot program mer can often guarantee reaching the desired final configura tion from all the likely initial configurations. Such motion strategies permit robots to carry out tasks in the presence of significant uncertainty. However, compliant motion strategies are very difficult for humans to specify. For this reason we have been working on the automatic synthesis of motion strategies for robots. In previous work (Donald 1988b; 1989), we presented a framework for computing one-step motion strategies that are guaranteed to succeed in the presence of all three kinds of uncertainty. The motion strategies comprise sensor-based gross motions, compliant motions, and simple pushing motions. </jats:p><jats:p> However, it is not always possible to find plans that are guaranteed to succeed. For example, if tolerancing errors render an assembly infeasible, the plan executor should stop and signal failure. In such cases the insistence on guaranteed success is too restrictive. For this reason we investigate error detection and recovery (EDR) strategies. EDR plans will succeed or fail recognizably: in these more general strategies, there is no possibility that the plan will fail without the exec utor realizing it. The EDR framework fills a gap when guar anteed plans cannot be found or do not exist; it provides a technology for constructing plans that might work, but fail in a \"reasonable\" way when they cannot. </jats:p><jats:p> We describe techniques for planning multi-step EDR strat egies in the presence of uncertainty. Multi-step strategies are considerably more difficult to generate, and we introduce three approaches for their synthesis: these are the Push-for ward Algorithm, Failure Mode Analysis, and the Weak EDR Theory. We have implemented the theory in the form of a planner, called LIMITED, in the domain ofplanar assemblies. </jats:p>",

The typical textbook distinction between the short‐run and the long‐run focuses upon the ability of the decision‐maker to adjust fixed factors. Indeed, the length of the firm's planning horizon may be identified with the degrees of freedom available to the firm; i.e. the number of factors that can optimally be adjusted to a changing economic environment. The purpose of this note is to illustrate use of the envelope theorem to recover a generalized Samuelson‐Le Chatelier principle in a simple and elegant manner. In particular, we will show how a monopolist's derived factor demand elasticities may be ordered by the length of the planning horizon. Thus the economically appealing and intuitive notion that the monopolist's factor demand decisions will be more responsive to price changes, the greater the flexibility in utilizing fixed factors will be given an analytically rigorous, though quite simple, demonstration utilizing duality theory and the well‐known envelope theorem.</jats:p>",

The proposed approach tackles path planning as an informed search process in dis crete configuration space. Three heuristics are proposed to guide this search process, all of them relying on a global path computed from the R-MAT model of free-space (a retraction of MA T defined specifically for path planning). One of the heuristics guides the evolution of the two Cartesian degrees of freedom of the mobile body along the search, while the remaining two guide the evolution of its rotational degree of freedom. The benefits derived from the use of the proposed heuristics are twofold: on the one hand, a speed-up of the search process as compared to noninformed search algo rithms is attained, and on the other hand, the features of the resulting solution path can be somewhat controlled. Other advantages and shortcomings of the proposed path planning approach are discussed, with the practical interest of the overall process being justified by the experimental results ob tained. </jats:p>",

The objective of this paper is to present and analyze the rail component of this strategic model of a national freight transportation system. We show how the rail model is integrated into STAN, as well as how this modeling framework may be used to represent a number of realistic scenarios. </jats:p>",

In the explanation it is contended that the migration turnaround represents only a temporary fluctuation in the general trend of urban economic and demographic spatial concentration, caused by the business cycle downturns of the 1970s. Our results show that the migration turnaround cannot be attributed exclusively to these business cycle fluctuations. For many of the countries tested, the business cycle operated simultaneously with other factors suggested as explanations for the turnaround. We conclude that several explanations should be combined to build a theory of the migration turnaround. </jats:p>",

In this paper, US Census data is used to examine further the importance of place of birth on migration streams and to trace the impacts of such ‘native dependence’ on age patterns of migration, multiregional life expectancies, and spatial population projections. </jats:p>",

ECG firms operate in an environment characterised by intense global competition, rapidly changing consumer demand, shortened product life cycles, and the pervasive impact of new technologies. In response to these pressures firms are forced to operate in both an efficient and a highly flexible manner. The corporate responses to these pressures are outlined in an industry-wide overview, with the resultant impacts on firm performance being described in a series of case studies. In conclusion, a discussion of the possible spatial implications of the findings is presented. This includes an assessment of the ramifications at both the international and intranational or regional scales. It is shown that the application of new manufacturing techniques within this sector has led to major changes in both the spatial and the aspatial organisation of its production processes. </jats:p>",

The techniques, which include a traffic simulation model, were developed to allow the evaluation of the impact of low-cost operational improvements such as passing lanes on the level of service. The traffic simulation model allowed the investigation of a wide range of highway alternatives in addition to changes in traffic flow, traffic stream characteristics, and vehicle performance characteristics. The passing lane designs described in the paper are based on the concept of incorporating passing lanes within the existing highway cross section. The design concept has evolved from the experimental passing lane project in Banff. In addition to geometric design, signing, and road marking guidelines, warrants for bicycle lanes on the Trans-Canada Highway are also presented. Key words: highway planning and engineering, two-lane highways, traffic simulation model, level of service, passing lanes, Trans-Canada Highway. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman's and Reason's classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior. </jats:p>",
