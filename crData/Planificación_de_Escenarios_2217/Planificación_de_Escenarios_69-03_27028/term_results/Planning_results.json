      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The need for a Federal role in the water resources development of the United States was recognized early in its history. The 20th century has seen a dramatic acceleration of activity in the water resources development field, with a concomitant increase in Federal participation. By 1960 the need for coordinating the many Federal programs in water planning and related resources development became apparent. A Senate Select Committee on National Water Resources was formed. The Committee's report was the basis for the Water Resources Research Act of 1964 and the Water Resources Planning Act of 1965. The objective of the Water Resources Planning Act is to provide for optimum development of water resources through the Water Resources Council and several River Basin Commissions, and by providing financial assistance to the States in order to increase State participation in water resources planning. A Council report on the Ohio River Basin will be published soon; this should be followed by the Missouri Rivet Basin report before 1970. The completion of reports for all major river basins has been scheduled for the mid 1970's. These framework studies include population, economic development, and water supply and water use data projected as far as the year 2020. The Water Resources Council also prepares a biennial assessment of the adequacy of supplies of water necessary to meet the requirements in each water resource region in the United States. For this purpose a river basin model is being prepared to determine probabilities of deficiencies and quality requirements in 300 basins, and economic concepts for determination of optimum water use alternatives are being incorporated in the model. Another assignment to the Council under Title I of the Water Resources Planning Act is the preparation of guidelines for all Federal participants in comprehensive regional water planning, and for the formulation and evaluation of Federal water resources projects of all types. The Council also is working on specific proposals for improved floodplain management. Title II of the Act authorizes the President to establish river basin commissions at the request of one or more States and with concurrence by the Council. Title III provides a basis for increased participation by the States in water planning by granting of matching funds. All but two States are now taking part in the State Grant program.</jats:p>",

This has been found in a planning procedure based on flow‐of‐funds accounts. The very comprehensive structure of these accounts is relied upon to provide to policy makers with quantitative indications as to policy goals and measures for their implementation, and at the same time, to ensure a consistent incorporation of monetary planning in general economic planning.</jats:p><jats:p>There are annual and monthly plans. Annual planning involves two stages. The first is projection of flow‐of‐funds accounts on the basis of appropriate relationships, historical trends, institutional changes, economic policy targets, etc. The final result of this stage of planning is a projection of the Monetary Sector transactions as residuals, including changes in money supply and in short‐term credits as key projections. The second is decomposition of the Monetary Sector account into the Central Bank Sector and the Other Banks Sector, which makes possible a projection of measures for the implementation of projected changes in short‐term credits and money supply.</jats:p><jats:p>Monthly planning has two objects: first, to check annual projections and, if necessary, to adjust them to actual developments; and second, to introduce seasonal components. Seasonal adjustment is made only for the Monetary Sector, its two subsectors, and credit policy measures. Monthly projections are made every month for three months in advance.</jats:p>",

The engineer's leadership role in water resources, as well as in many other planning activities, has been challenged by technical and scientific people as well as by the general public for insensitivity to social, aesthetic, ecological, and political problems created by planning. The paper draws attention to the fact that the engineer cannot continue to expect the role of leadership to fall to him unless he prepares himself properly for that role. However, it is brought out that the engineer, by his education and training, is still the best qualified among all the representatives of the various disciplines associated with water resources planning to lead the planning effort if he prepares himself for the task. The requirements for preparation for leading water resources planning are outlined.</jats:p>",
