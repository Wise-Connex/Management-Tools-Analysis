This evaluation was done with a special criteria because of the operational typical difficulties of this kind of project.

There was good compliance for using gloves (99%) and aprons (86%). There was poor compliance in using eye protectors (21%), face masks (18%), shoe covers (4%) and head caps (4%). Trainees applied universal precautions according to the level of risk they subjectively perceived.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the current decade, there has been a tremendous growth of ICT &amp; ITES industry worldwide and India has an impressive presence in the world trade of ICT &amp; ITES. Indian ICT industry is a fast growing industry in terms of its annual growth in production, domestic market share, export, offshore outsourcing and investment. As a result, Indian ICT industry requires a large number of well-qualified and well-trained ICT professionals of all categories. However, a huge gap between the demand and supply of manpower currently exists. In order to narrow down such a gap, ICT education &amp; training system needs to play a crucial role. Further, looking at the worldwide considerable growth of ICT/ITES demand, ICT training may be considered as a potential area to which India can diversify largely and where ICT can leverage to gain competitive edge over its overseas rivals. Though, India has all round favourable climate; system maturity and wide network for ICT education &amp; training; however, such a system suffers from the deficiencies like insufficient investment by the concerned stakeholders, shortage of competent core faculty, little collaboration between academics and user-industries, infrequently up-gradation of course-curriculum, focus on mass higher education with less consideration to quality, liberal evaluation of the academic institutions for quality accreditation, lack of initiatives on the part of the Indian corporates and institutional climate dominated by the dependency motive. This paper presents current status of ICT industry as well as of ICT education &amp; training (E &amp; T) system incorporating the issues mentioned above. It also gives future projections regarding the same, overviews the practices pertaining to E &amp; T in ICT, indicates towards the deficiencies in the said system &amp; practices. Finally, the paper ends with a few suggestions that are relevant for system improvement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Aim </jats:bold> Evolutionary theory predicts that levels of genetic variation in island populations will be positively correlated with island area and negatively correlated with island isolation. These patterns have been empirically established for oceanic islands, but little is known about the determinants of variation on habitat islands. The goals of this study were twofold. Our first aim was to test whether published patterns of genetic variation in mammals occurring on montane habitat islands in the American Southwest conformed to expectations based on evolutionary theory. The second aim of this research was to develop simple heuristic models to predict changes in genetic variation that may occur in these populations as a result of reductions in available mountaintop habitat in response to global warming.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Location </jats:bold> Habitat islands of conifer forest on mountaintops in the American Southwest.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold> Relationships between island area and isolation with measures of allozyme variation in four species of small mammal, namely the least chipmunk (<jats:italic>Tamias minimus</jats:italic>), Colorado chipmunk (<jats:italic>Tamias quadrivittatus</jats:italic>), red squirrel (<jats:italic>Tamiasciurus hudsonicus</jats:italic>), and Mexican woodrat (<jats:italic>Neotoma mexicana</jats:italic>), were determined using correlation and regression techniques. Significant relationships between island area and genetic variation were used to develop three distinct statistical models with which to predict changes in genetic variation following reduction in insular habitat area arising from global warming.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> Patterns of genetic variation in each species conformed to evolutionary predictions. In general, island area was the most important determinant of heterozygosity, while island isolation was the most important determinant of polymorphism and allelic diversity. The heuristic models predicted widespread reductions in genetic variation, the extent of which depended on the population and model considered.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Main conclusions </jats:bold> The results support a generalized pattern of genetic variation for any species with an insular distribution, with reduced variation in smaller, more isolated populations. We predict widespread reductions in genetic variation in isolated populations of montane small mammals in the American Southwest as a result of global warming. We conclude that climate‐induced reductions in the various dimensions of genetic variation may increase the probability of population extinction in both the short and long term.</jats:p>",
