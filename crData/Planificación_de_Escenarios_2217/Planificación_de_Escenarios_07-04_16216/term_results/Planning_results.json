      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) has been a part of geospatial sciences for over a decade. Most research activities so far have concentrated on either extending complexity theory to spatially explicit phenomena, or on designing computational models and software tools. Only a few of these activities have focused on using ABMS for spatially explicit modeling of real-world policy scenarios. In this paper we present a realistic application of ABMS to simulating alternative futures for a small community in Washington State, USA. We develop an ABMS assessment benchmark that comprehensively covers diverse aspects of a good operational agent-based model. Using an ABMS software tool-CommunityViz Policy Simulator-we generate future development scenarios in the municipality of Chelan, WA based on the County and the City Comprehensive Growth Plans. Simulation results are compared with Washington State projections for growth-management planning. The indication of the highest probability locations of urban growth in the studied community is crucial for environmental and economic planning and decisionmaking. Endangered salmon protection and recreational and retirement influxes of people from the Puget Sound metropolitan area have a direct impact on future growth of the region. The bottom-up microsimulation allows for interposition of individual decisions and actions into forecasting option generation. The ‘heterogeneity, adaptability, and tractability’ benchmark is instrumental in evaluating CommunityViz Policy Simulator and outlining possible challenges for future development of applied agent-based models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper is described a model of residential mobility, built to simulate individual households, their perception of and reaction to varying conditions across different scales of interaction, and their movements to occupy housing in a physical, social, and economic environment. The methodology underpinning the model is based on an automata core, which leverages the advantages it offers in terms of representing individual entities and their rule-based interactions. This methodology is extended, however, to incorporate geography-specific functionality, with advantages for the modeling of human systems. The applicability of the methodology is demonstrated through the development of a rich model of residential mobility, in which individual households interact with other households and real-estate infrastructure, dynamically in space and time, to form synthetic communities and artificial property submarkets. Use of the model for what-if experimentation is demonstrated with synthetic economic and sociodemographic simulation scenarios. </jats:p>",

The rubric of model evaluation is central both to understanding and to meeting these challenges. They include methodological issues such as sensitivity and complex scaling; the conceptual challenges of conflating pattern and process, and reconciling simplicity and complexity; and policy issues posed by the science–policy gap and postnormal science. The importance of these challenges and the centrality of model evaluation in meeting them are demonstrated through examples drawn from human-environment systems, with particular reference to global environmental change and land-use and land-cover change. Specific model-evaluation strategies are also offered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>During the last decade, as a response to the need for inter‐ as well as intra‐organizational integration, management models initially developed for industry have been spread to health care organizations. Based on 62 in‐depth interviews, this qualitative study aims at describing and analyzing the limited success of implementation of process orientation at a Swedish hospital and in doing so, the traditional and the critical approaches are combined. Applying a traditional approach, the limited success of the implementation of process orientation is explained in terms of difficulties to challenge deeply institutionalized organizational routines and the inter‐disciplinary boundaries. This might be condensed to the dilemma of how to maintain and develop the specialization of the medical profession while focusing process rather than function and how to enhance inter‐organizational integration without hampering intra‐organizational collaboration. Applying a critical approach, the limited success is explained in terms of a differentiated translation process and in terms of separation of talk and practice. This means that process orientation, notwithstanding that it might be an efficient tool for the type of integration needed, might be regarded as part of a change discourse, aiming at conveying a picture of an efficient and modern organization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> GIS has been welcomed worldwide for its potential production of accessible, timely, and accurate information for decision making. In recent discussions it has been presented as a condition for governance. The implementation of GIS in large and complex institutions like ministries or planning institutes, however, is still problematic. Therefore, attention has shifted from the mere ‘technical factors' to organisational and institutional problems of GIS implementation, looking for the right ‘fit’ of GIS for the organisation in question. This paper will sketch the importance of organisational culture for understanding GIS implementation, and draw some conclusions on the implications for the use of GIS in promoting good governance. The paper discusses a Costa Rican case study on the implementation of GIS for forest monitoring. This case shows the strengths and weaknesses of different organisational cultures in adopting GIS, and illustrates that the (inter)organisational complexity of monitoring forest resources requires more attention to the potential variety in data demands from different organisations. </jats:p>",

The growth history of large stores such as hypermarkets, superstores, and retail warehouses has thus been characterised by disputes between developers and planners. In this paper we examine the responses of large-store developers to UK government planning guidance that retail developments should be of a nature and scale suited to the physical environment of town centres. This goes against some retailers' preferences for large formats which are generally unsuited to town centres. We explain these two opposed views, devoting particular attention to the retail developers' case. We then use findings from two interview surveys with selected retailers to explore how far retail developers are prepared to go in compromising their preferred models of store development in line with government policy. Finally we discuss potential effects of recent changes in government policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agent-based models offer a promising framework for analyzing interactions between agents and a heterogeneous landscape. Researchers have identified a complex of factors that influence exurban development, including demographic shifts and location attractiveness of natural amenities as a magnet to amenity-seeking migrants. Attractiveness is often defined in terms of local or on-lot amenities, including scenic views, the availability of natural features, and low levels of noise. However, exurban-growth models have not fully incorporated a fundamental insight of this literature, that the location behavior of exurban residents is sensitive to fine-grained variations in their biophysical environment. In this study we evaluate how agents and households operate in exurban environments and respond to biophysical features. We simulate household decisionmaking in terms of preferences for features such as site accessibility, two-dimensional amenities, and three-dimensional scenic views. Our results show that, as we build two-dimensional and three-dimensional landscape layers, our model captures the characteristics of landscape change with increasing accuracy. This approach has considerable potential to improve our ability to describe development dynamics in heterogeneous land markets. </jats:p>",

We apply and evaluate the model using statistical and geographic data from Luangprabang Province, Laos, where rice and other crops are cultivated in various forms, including shifting cultivation. Our model explicitly incorporates socioeconomic dimensions of shifting cultivation in which villages are assigned the role of decision makers. We evaluate the model by comparing the simulation results with the existing statistical data and remote sensing images from the 1990s. Our model provides reasonably satisfactory estimates of aggregate area and volume of each crop type at the provincial level. We also evaluate the model across differing spatial resolutions for shifting cultivation areas. We find that the model has limited explanatory power at higher spatial resolutions of 0.5 km to 2.5 km grid cells, but can account for the spatial patterns fairly well at more aggregate levels with the resolutions of 5 km to 10 km. </jats:p>",

Coimbra is a medium-sized municipality of 320 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 150000 inhabitants located in the center-littoral region of Portugal. The planning problem addressed in the study consisted of defining the location, type, and size of the schools that should integrate Coimbra's secondary school network in 2015, given, first, the excess of aggregate school capacity that currently characterizes the municipality, and, second, the change in school typology that needs to be implemented as a consequence of a recent reorganization of the Portuguese educational system. This problem was analyzed with a discrete facility-location model and considers decisions both of closing existing schools and of opening new schools. The model is a variant of the well-known p-median model, which aims at maximizing the accessibility of students to schools, with constraints on maximum and minimum capacity occupation that make model solutions lose the single assignment and closest assignment properties. As these are desirable properties in a public-facility planning context, they are enforced with explicit constraints.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Habitat fragmentation and habitat loss are causing many species to become locally extinct. The need to restore or conserve biodiversity has initiated plans in Europe—and, more specifically, in the Netherlands—to create networks of nature areas for the improvement of spatial coherence. In this paper spatial coherence is measured by the total boundary length of all nature areas. Spatial optimization is used to optimize the spatial coherence, in order to evaluate the so-called Dutch 2003 plans. The goal of the optimization is therefore to minimize the total sum of boundary lengths for all nature areas, while increasing the total surface area. Potential configurations have been calculated and compared with the 2003 plans, with respect to boundary length and the size of nature areas. The calculations have been performed by allocating increasing amounts of new nature to test if smaller numbers of hectares could yield a comparable perimeter decline. Optimization has been carried out separately (per province) and collectively (for all the Dutch provinces together). So-called genetic algorithms were used to tackle this strongly nonlinear problem. An interesting feature of the method used is its ability to optimize more than half a million variables—that is, potential nature cells. Allocating only half the area allocated in the 2003 plans resulted in a boundary-length decline of 30% compared with the 2003 plans, and yielded many more coherent areas than are found in the 2003 plans. Compared with the optimization per province, the collective optimization resulted nationwide in larger nature areas, across provincial borders. Considering the original aims, we can conclude that carrying out the 2003 plans will not improve the overall spatial coherence in terms either of the boundary length or of the number of areas and total surface area in the largest surface class. An additional advantage of the heuristic method discussed is that slightly different configurations can be found with almost the same characteristics in a relative short time. This will allow the provinces to choose the most suitable configuration. </jats:p>",

It is well known that land markets reflect a variety of spatial factors that collectively influence market value, yet it is empirically difficult to sort out the relative contribution of overall and localized, the spatial and aspatial determinants of sales prices. Some of the classical assumptions about urban form that feed into hedonic analyses of land markets are explored. Then, three analyses are presented: simple visualization of single-family residential sales prices with regard to factors likely to influence land value, univariate and bivariate measures of spatial autocorrelation, and, finally, spatial econometric hedonic modeling. </jats:p>",

The Noble Amos Runner is a Noble EVA-4000? designed semisubmersible unit upgraded in 1999. Rated to operate in water depths up to 8,000 ft, the rig is equipped to drill wells up to 32,500 ft total depth. The Noble Amos Runner set this record using the rig's existing mooring system, as opposed to using pre-set mooring systems that require anchors or suction piles to be in place before the rig arrives. Using the rig's existing mooring system resulted in lower overall mooring costs and increased operational flexibility.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Conventional mooring at this depth required extensive project planning, beginning with a detailed mooring plan that considered site-specific winds, waves, and currents for the next six months. The rig was to be on site through the entire 2006 hurricane season, and the location is at the apex of the infamous GOM loop current that can produce surface currents of 3.5 knots for months.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Noble and Anadarko/Kerr-McGee commissioned numerous engineering studies by experts in mooring analysis and marine engineering to ensure the most optimum anchor pattern was used to combat strong currents, deep sea conditions, and anticipated hurricanes. Noble and Kerr-McGee held several pre-rig move meetings where their engineers, mooring and boat experts, rig personnel, and operational management teams discussed procedures, critiqued scenarios, and developed an optimum execution plan to address all issues that this deepwater location created.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper summarizes the planning and execution of conventional mooring in deep water in the GOM.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Noble Amos Runner is a semisubmersible drilling rig (Figure 1) currently outfitted for operations in water depths up to 8,000 ft. Its capacities and specifications are summarized in Table 1. When originally constructed, the rig was a submersible designed drilling unit rated for 80 ft of water and set on bottom to drill. In 1997, the rig was converted to a semisubmersible unit. Several modifications were added including three additional columns, three pontoons with ten mud tanks, nine anchor winches, a new drill floor and derrick, five EMD generators with new SCR controls, three mud pumps rated for 7,500 psi, 160-kip tensioners, an 800-kip crown-mounted compensator, and a new 15-ksi BOP stack with fourth-generation MUX BOP controls. These upgrades provided the capability for the rig to drill in water as deep as 6,600 ft.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In 2006, the rig was upgraded again with the addition of longer and stronger anchor cables, longer MUX BOP control cables, and several upgrades to the riser and riser-tensioning systems. These additions further increased the rig's water depth rating to 8,000 ft. The rig drilled 99,569 ft on six different wells in the GOM during 2006. On August 25, 2006, the Noble Amos Runner set a new world record for a conventionally moored vessel by successfully anchoring on location at Green Canyon Block 955 in 7,650 ft of water.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Although there is significant expenditure in both sectors for these groups, hospitalization on free public wards is associated with lower expenditure than other options. Factors linked with higher expenditure are: duration of stay; hospitalizations on paying public wards and in the private sector; hospitalizations for above poverty line households and hospitalizations for chronic illnesses.

The screening and ranking process used to select projects causes an optimizer's curse effect (Smith and Winkler, 2006). A portfolio's true outcome value will tend to fall below the forecast distribution mean. Stated another way, we should expect to be disappointed in the value of the eventual outcomes. This optimizer's curse effect can be huge: the true portfolio value might be half its forecast value when forecast in the usual way.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes a correction process based upon Bayesian inversion obtained with Monte Carlo simulation. Estimate/Actual distributions characterize component evaluation errors. The mean and standard deviation of the E/A distribution measures the quality of judgments and estimates. Examples demonstrate the value of better information in project or asset evaluation, portfolio optimization, and competitive bidding.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The premise of our approach to correct for optimizer's curse is straightforward enough, though implementing this method requires judging the population of evaluated projects—or at least assessing the shape of this population's distribution. We offer a process and guidelines for correcting for the optimizer's curse in both project and portfolio value calculations. Correcting estimates for systematic biases restores luster to the recommended expected value-maximizing decision policy. We also tie-back to the winner's curse (Capen, Clapp and Campbell, 1971) experienced in competitive bidding and how it affects bid optimization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The Mahogany field in Trinidad and Tobago was developed as a dedicated gas field with reserves of 2.6 TCF to supply gas to the Atlantic LNG Plant in 1999. The reserves are deposited in a number of stacked sands, all of which must be optimally produced in order to achieve a successful depletion of the field. To date over 1 TCF has already been produced through a rigorous depletion management system and a renewed effort has been made to ensure that the remaining reserves are not at risk as the field enters the mature stage of its development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the foundation processes that were used in the development of the field was that the right level of surveillance existed and maintained. Acquiring the right surveillance data was considered when designing the wells and facilities. In fact the field is operated in a manner that ensures surveillance data is collected when required, without compromising production or plant integrity. The result of this rigorous surveillance planning and the application of data collected have provided the assurance around delivering the remaining Mahogany reserves.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will discuss the importance of surveillance planning as it relates to maintaining the base production as well as the key issues that should be addressed when forming a surveillance plan. It will also highlight the successes of proper surveillance planning as well as the actions that can be taken to overcome the challenges faced when developing a surveillance plan.</jats:p>",

Wells are defined as deepwater when they are at least 15,000 feet deep and are considered HP/HT when they have bottomhole pressures of approximately 10,000 psi and bottomhole temperatures in excess of 300ÂºF. Several wells under these extreme environmental conditions have been tested in Brazil operations, and these attempts have verified the importance of the proper preliminary analysis of test parameters according to the specifications of the prospect, the requirements at surface, and the possible impact of testing on bottomhole conditions. Typical variables such as high hydrostatics and high temperatures are usually considered, but it is also important to assess the types of operations involved during the test that could increase the value of the different physical variables in such a way that the tool string could be damaged. Often, combined variables can surpass the design characteristics of the test tools and could result in loss of the test or even the well. Thus, it is critical that design specifications of the necessary equipment and operational limitations be considered with a detailed analysis of operations and alternatives in a HAZID/HAZOP.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Complete tables including equipment specifications and mechanical characteristics of the equipment to be used must be compiled in order to identify the limits for the entire operation. The electronic restrictions, where applicable, must be evaluated as well. Once, all the information is collected, a computer model can be built using several specialized software programs in order to properly analyze the different parameters that can not be visualized at first sight but can seriously affect equipment performance during performance of the job. That model then must be reviewed. Parameters such as flowing and static temperatures at surface, at sea bead, and bottomhole as well as flowing and static pressures must be analyzed since tri-axial forces acting on the string as a result of the operational sequence could change input specification parameters. Drag and torque models resulting from any rotation of the string (ex., setting mechanical packers) must also be analyzed. Simulation of any wireline or slickline operations also should be reviewed to ensure that these operations will be successful during gun correlation, realtime data acquisition, or setting of plugs needed to isolate any zone.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper focuses on the steps that should be followed to enable successful well-testing evaluations in HP/HT environmental conditions. With the planning described, it is possible to minimize the risks that can negatively impact testing operations. The planning, design criteria and tools required to perform successful well-testing evaluation in severe well conditions will be discussed in detail. The steps implemented for designing deepwater well-tests can provide a safety envelope for equipment and help assure that the operations will be successfully performed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Well tests have been conducted using different downhole tools and designs to work in extreme environmental applications.

However, ignoring the wrong details can lead agents into building plans that do not work, or into costly backtracking and replanning once overlooked interdependencies come to light. We claim that associating systematically-generated summary information with plans' abstract operators can ensure plan correctness, even for asynchronously-executed plans that must be coordinated across multiple agents, while still achieving valuable efficiency gains. In this paper, we formally characterize hierarchical plans whose actions have temporal extent, and describe a principled method for deriving summarized state and metric resource information for such actions. We provide sound and complete algorithms, along with heuristics, to exploit summary information during hierarchical refinement planning and plan coordination. Our analyses and experiments show that, under clearcut and reasonable conditions, using summary information can speed planning as much as doubly exponentially even for plans involving interacting subproblems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Youth are commonly referred to as important assets to society and as leaders of the future. In reality, they can be leaders of today, as well as an important component to decision-making at the family and community levels and critical to social, environmental, and economic viability. But this requires viewing them as partners in a shared process focused on their interest, knowledge, and abilities instead of as a token voice. This notion is sometimes contradictory to historical societal norms that may be based on seniority, class, or even gender. However, not only is it a right of youth to actively participate in society, it is important for building a generation of citizens who are able to be productive in a global economy and leaders of sustainable development. Ultimately, the success of youth and the success of communities are intertwined and best practice involves implementation of positive youth development and youth participation concepts in order for both youth and communities to thrive. Despite challenges, obstacles, and effort needed, the value of engaging youth in sustainable development shows promise for youth and communities. Not only is it an international policy declaration and a moral imperative, it is truly the right thing to do. The future of a society, and indeed the world, depends on adults working together with youth as representatives of the future. Utilizing a program development strategy and a logic model approach to jointly determine outcomes and impacts to be achieved can help guide the process for mutual benefit. This article explains potential challenges and barriers as well as recommendations of best practices identified in the literature for overcoming obstacles to achieving these outcomes through (1) positive youth development, (2) meaningful participation of youth at all levels, (3) youth-adult partnerships as a potential mechanism for sustainable development, and (4) a suggested planning process that makes it easier to evaluate how well results have been achieved.</jats:p>"

An example is given whereby the integrated approach to IM has been applied to early field planning for Chevron's Tahiti field in Green Canyon block 596/640 in the Gulf of Mexico.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The field is being developed with a truss spar, polyester mooring, SCRs and steel flowlines producing from two drill centers. Design and IM challenges include the riser and flowline design for HPHT, design of polyester mooring and provision for sour service. The Tahiti plan identified monitoring, inspection, analysis/testing and procedures necessary for maintaining the integrity of risers, flowlines, subsea equipment, hull and mooring. These were combined with the vessel and mooring inspection required by the MMS and Coast Guard to minimize expensive vessel mobilizations and ROV time.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The goal of the IM program, which involves extensive structural and environmental monitoring combined with a comprehensive hull and subsea inspection program, is to verify key design and response uncertainties early in field life and demonstrate continued fitness for purpose throughout the life of field.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The process involved in defining an outline IM plan for the subsea system has been performed in consultation with key stakeholders of the system. This identified synergies in the planning and scheduling of IM activities and achieved significant cost benefit through optimized mobilizations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Effective integrity management planning allows the operator of an offshore floating production development to reduce uncertainties associated with the design or response of subsea and floating systems and improve understanding of in-service response, thereby managing and controlling the risks associated with deepwater hydrocarbon production.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper presents an innovative approach to the development of a preliminary subsea integrity management plan (IMP) and associated costs for a full field development, including hull, moorings, risers, flowlines and subsea equipment.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A case study is presented whereby this approach has been applied to the early IM planning for Chevron's Tahiti field in the Gulf of Mexico.

The IM strategy is then typically conceived based on the level of risk assigned to key failure modes of the system. The final IM program for a field is then typically defined as a series of activities that may typically be subdivided into four functional areas:</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<p>Cognitive approach through the neural network “NN” paradigm is a critical discipline that will help bring about autonomic computing “AC.” NN-related research, some involving new ways to apply control theory and control laws, can provide insight into how to run complex systems that optimize to their environments. NN is one kind of AC system that can embody human cog-nitive powers and that can adapt, learn, and take over certain functions previously performed by humans. In recent years, artificial neural networks have received a great deal of attention for their ability to perform nonlinear mappings. In trajectory control of robotic devices, neural networks provide a fast method of autonomously learning the relation between a set of output states and a set of input states. In this article, we apply the cognitive approach to solve position controller problems using an inverse geometrical model. In order to control a robot manipulator in the accomplishment of a task, trajectory planning is required in advance or in real time. The desired trajectory is usually described in Cartesian coordinates and needs to be converted to joint space for the purpose of analyzing and controlling the system behavior. In this article, we use a memory neural network (MNN) to solve the optimization problem concerning the inverse of the direct geometrical model of the redundant manipulator when subject to constraints. Our approach offers substantially better accuracy, avoids the computation of the inverse or pseudo-inverse Jacobian matrix, and does not produce problems such as singularity, redundancy, and considerably increased computational complexity.</p>",

Developing countries focus on increase in production volume of milk and milk product, and developed countries do on enhancement of milk product, brand, and merger of dairy co-operatives. Dairy cooperatives have been getting various opportunities as well as facing different challenges. They are going to formulate different types of strategic planning to cope with these challenges and to get success. Strategic plans of dairy cooperatives in developing countries are, generally to increase production volume of buffalo milk, bring about the internal improvement in cooperative societies, reduce cost of production, provide quality service to consumer through skill, trained and educated manpower, and e-commerce. Strategic plan of developed countries is quite different from that of developing countries. Their strategic plans are to merge different dairy cooperative societies / institutions into a dairy cooperative, and compete in the global market with quality of products.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nJournal of Nepalese Business Studies Vol.2(1) 2005 pp.72-80</jats:p>"

Although geographers have carried out much interesting and insightful work in their studies of nationalism, we contend that the majority of authors have tended to focus on the way in which particular sites and landscapes come to represent nations. Less attention has been directed towards the geographical concepts and processes that inform the ongoing reproduction of nations. We elaborate on the potential for geographers to explore more systematically the way in which key geographical concepts such as place and scale are imbricated in the reproduction of nations. We do so, first, at a conceptual level before, second, discussing empirical evidence that is drawn from an oral history research project based in Wales. We conclude by arguing that geographers should be at the forefront of attempts to comprehend better the multiple places and scales of the reproduction of the nation. </jats:p>",

I seek to gain insights into the subtle operations of power between momentary enactments and stabilised manifestations of power. Central to this are the (invisiblised and unnamed) microlevel processes and the ‘common sense’ assumptions. In the empirical research I interrogate how twenty-eight nonheterosexual women discuss their experiences of eating in restaurant spaces to examine othering processes, rather than solely relying on categories of difference or named discriminations in theorising the (re)formation of spaces. From this it is possible to render the contingency of heterosexualised spaces visible, if reiterated and congealed in part (and para-doxically) through an absence of naming. I conclude by contending that focusing on (re)productive practices could expand our understandings of the hierarchical (re)construction of space. </jats:p>",

First, an attempt was made to determine whether the institution had a strategy, and if so, did it follow a particular model. Major models of strategy are the industry analysis approach, the resource based view or the RBV model and the more recent, relational model. The next step was determining whether the institution actually implemented the strategy by allocating resources. Finally an attempt was made to find out whether any of the models influenced the performance of one higher education institution and whether one model resulted in greater performance than another. Performance was defined as improvements in enrollment, operating surpluses, investments in physical assets and capital structure. The research design was the case study approach. The methods of analysis were qualitative, using content analysis, as well as quantitative. The results showed that there were significant differences in performance between the institution with the well-defined and implemented strategy and other institutions in the same religious and geographic classification. This research should add to the knowledge base in seeking to improve Higher Education.</jats:p>"

Continuous responding occurs when targets are separated by less than 60° of spatial angle, and discrete responding occurs when targets are separated by greater than 60°. Although these two modes are thought to reflect the operation of separable strategic planning systems, a new theory of movement preparation, the Dynamic Field Theory, suggests that two modes emerge flexibly from the same system. Experiment 1 replicated continuous and discrete performance using a task modified to allow for a critical test of the single system view. In Experiment 2, participants were allowed to correct their movements following movement initiation (the standard task does not allow corrections). Results showed continuous planning performance at large and small target separations. These results are consistent with the proposal that the two modes reflect the time-dependent “preshaping” of a single planning system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The environmental–racial order in northern New Mexico is maintained through a process of racial triangulation in which Anglos, Native Americans, and Hispanos are valued relative to one another along axes of environmental stewardship and victimization (Kim C J, 1999, “The racial triangulation of Asian Americans” Politics and Society 27 105–138). Both axes involve the juxtaposing of three long-standing images: (1) Spanish injustices to the Indians; (2) the inability of Mexicans to manage their land properly; and (3) Indians being preeminent environmental stewards. In contrast to Kim's formulation of racial triangulation, however, the axes also involve imagery that contradicts these images: the debauched, poverty-stricken Indian; and European culture as a despoiler of the environment. Also in contrast to Kim's formulation, racial triangulation can involve the creation of new identities. In the 1960s Hispano activists began claiming to be heirs to a hybrid culture that included elements of both Native American and Spanish cultures. While this claim to hybridity enabled the creation of new oppositional discourses, the reconciling of contradictory imagery by historicizing the discourses and by other means undermines the new Hispano oppositional discourses as well as Hispano identity itself. Racial triangulation is thus a fluid and contested process in which identity formation and the interchange between predominant and oppositional discourses are constitutive of power relations. Contradictory imagery in the discourse facilitates the maintenance of the environmental–racial order, even as it enables subordinates to challenge their racialized positions and to effect change in the distribution of material wealth, rights, and privileges. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is a growing understanding of the potential of spatial planning to constitute a co‐ordinating arena for sustainable development, and planning processes are expected to merge all dimensions of sustainability. Since the concrete manifestation of spatial planning takes place at a micro level, it all boils down to the need for bringing together stakeholders at municipal level in a well functioning planning processes. Alongside this viewpoint, there is also an increasing awareness of the need for a decentralization of such processes, bringing them closer to the grassroots. Communicative planning is a planning ideal and a theoretical stream that has developed from this new ‘paradigm’. It is based on citizen participation as a win–win situation, where the planning process builds a social sustainability, in turn enhancing the likelihood of the process to be successful. However, global and national visions of sustainability and local implementation are in many ways separate from one another. Bringing it further, to the individual level, the gaps are even wider. These gaps make the daily job for the planner increasingly complex and difficult. This article aims to contribute to understanding the characters of these gaps by describing them as four threats. The discussion is purely theoretical and based on the eight proposals of Goodin and Dryzek (2006) on possible pathways from micro‐level deliberation towards the macro political system. However, the seed of the discussion is based on the authors' joint experiences from a number of evaluations of planning processes carried out in a Swedish context.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To deploy broadband networks, service providers, such as competing local exchange carriers, need robust plans for providing various types, amounts, and locations of services at competitive prices. Broadband networks generally consist of an access component (wireless access), a concentration component (a wireless aggregation point or hub), a service routing or distribution component (a central office or metro switch), and various combined or separate distribution components (a long-haul backbone data or voice network). Because access, aggregation, and routing or distribution vary greatly in requirements, we developed a method and platform for planning the components of fixed-wireless-broadband (FWB) systems for local loop access. We have helped various service providers to analyze and design many networking scenarios using our methods. The service providers have used these scenarios and their predicted financial outcomes to plan FWB access networks tailored to meet their marketing and financial goals. By implementing our method, one service provider has improved its planning process, achieved a competitive advantage in its markets, and increased its annual service revenues by tens of millions of dollars. </jats:p>",

Rational expressions of those uncertainties are needed to satisfy the developing power market. In this paper, we present a new method for flexible transmission network planning by introducing the connection number. The connection number is used to represent the synthetic uncertainties of the random, fuzzy and grey ones in the transmission network planning. It can also describe information of both certainty and uncertainty simultaneously, which provides a good match for the reality. A new power flow model of the connection number is presented to obtain the line power flow, and a connection number model (CNM) is developed for the overload analysis, from which the reliable section of the network is obtained. The blind number is defined to describe the flexibility of each reliable section, which is combined with the economics by the cost‐benefit analysis method to evaluate the candidate schemes. In the last section of this paper, two examples are presented on the transmission networks in China to verify the efficiency and reliability of our flexible planning method.

Current representations of Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands as an Edenic wilderness are no different. What is unusual about conceptualizations of Bikini Atoll as a pristine wilderness is that it is the site of a recent history of colonial appropriation and massive landscape transformation through nuclear-weapons testing. Although people both outside and within the Bikinian community regularly represent the atoll as a kind of paradise, there are strong differences of opinion regarding what the future uses of the atoll should be. This is because there is a sharp division between representations of the atoll as a pristine wilderness with visually pleasing landscapes and seascapes that need to be preserved and locally produced representations of the atoll as an Eden with an abundance of useable natural resources. </jats:p>",

However, to date most of this research has focused on solitary rather than group planning. Furthermore, very few studies have investigated what actually happens during the planning time. This study, conducted in an EFL class in Vietnam, investigated the nature and impact of group planning on learners' subsequent individual oral presentations. The learners (n=17) worked in small groups preparing for oral presentations. At the end of the planning session, two learners from each group were randomly selected to give presentations. All group work and individual presentations were audio recorded and teacher observation notes were collected. Transcribed oral data were coded for idea units and language related episodes as well as salient features of group interaction. The study found that group planning dealt with the content rather than the language of presentations. Using a matching procedure, the study found that most of the ideas presented were generated during the planning time. However, there were variations between the groups. The group that seemed to be the most interactive and that focused on both content and language was a group composed of mixed proficiency learners. </jats:p>",

The results show that ethnic diversity increased from 0.533 in 1991 to 0.731 in 2001. Between 1991 and 2001 the share of diversity contributed by Inner London and the West Midlands declined and the share contributed by Outer London and the Outer Metropolitan Area rose. Decomposition of total diversity shows that regional and district differences in ethnic diversity increased between 1991 and 2001 but differences between wards declined in importance. Within-ward diversity contributed more than 75% of total diversity at each census. Between 1991 and 2001 there was a slight increase in the overall level of segregation. Decomposition of total segregation into between-district and within-district components for each region shows that the contribution of within-district segregation to total segregation fell between 1991 and 2001. However, the contribution of between-district segregation to total segregation remained important and increased significantly in Inner London. Across the area investigated wards have on average become more ethnically diverse but there remain significant differences in diversity and segregation between regions and districts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine pedestrian-motor-vehicle conflicts in US cities as competing forms of rationality based in particular values, techniques, and material forms. The kernel of dispute is the transportation engineer's focus on ‘traffic flow’ in allowing motor vehicles to move as efficiently as possible versus the pedestrian advocate's desire for ‘place’ as the intimate context of urban life. I consider the City of Oakland's Pedestrian Master Plan as a challenge to the mandate for traffic flow operationalized by the Transportation Research Board's Highway Capacity Manual. These values and techniques shape intersections, pedestrian crossings, street corners, and other taken-for-granted material forms in the urban built environment. Within the constraints of shared right-of-way, these competing rationalities are negotiated through spatial and temporal strategies that, historically, have resulted in the hierarchical ordering of the automobile over pedestrians in the US city. However, a growing emphasis on walking, bicycling, and public-transit-riding is reshaping the predominant values, techniques, and material forms to facilitate street design for multiple transportation modes. </jats:p>",

It is argued that a new rationality of governance, based on both localization and promotion of state authority, has been introduced during the era of economic reform. This dual process has reconstructed China's urban scale which was inherited from the prereform period. The implementation of city-led counties ( shi guan xian) in 1982 has provided a good example for illustration. Under this new system, cities have not only been institutionalized as administrative centers, their territory, bureaucracy, and power have also been expanded and hence a new relationship between cities and counties has been forged. These arguments are illustrated by reference to Jiangsu, one of the first provinces to initiate city-led counties. </jats:p>",

In this paper I interrogate Latour's project in relation to struggles that might be termed ‘subaltern political ecologies’. I argue that Latour's account of the political as bearing on the ‘progressive composition of the world’ offers insights for engaging with the inventiveness of subaltern political activity. I suggest that subaltern political ecologies offer both resources and challenges to the project of reworking the common sense of political ecology. To demonstrate this, I engage with the struggles against unequal social and material relations of the 18th-century Irish peasant movement, the Whiteboys. I follow the movement of their forms of political activity to London's dockside spaces. I suggest two skills that subaltern political ecologies ‘add’ to the politics of ‘heterogeneous associations’: the configuring of strategic arrangements of humans and nonhumans in antagonistic ways and the making of solidarities as ongoing interventions in the constitution of networks. This reworking of key political processes as active engagements in world-building activities seeks to foreground forms of political identity and agency which have often been marginalised, ignored, or dismissed. </jats:p>",

One way of accomplishing this is through meaningful public involvement in land-use planning efforts.

Both governments identified public participation as being an integral part of these processes. This paper examines how well these processes promoted participation by the general public, the vast majority of which resides in urban areas located outside the respective planning regions. It is determined that in both cases this was poorly done. Reasons are given for why and how increased participation by the urban public should be pursued.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In British Columbia, Canada, industrial sustained-yield forest regulation was embraced together with a system of forest tenures governing private access to public forest lands in the mid-19408. This approach has underpinned forest exploitation and regulation ever since, despite sometimes significant reforms over the years. Yet this approach to forest policy has also come under fire in recent years because of pervasive signs of economic, social, and environmental exhaustion. In this paper I analyze the political circumstances surrounding adoption of this particular approach to governing forest access and forest use in the province of British Columbia. In particular, I draw on historical documentation related to two key provincial Royal Commissions on Forestry conducted in the 1940s and 1950s. These commissions provided an arena for debating alternative approaches to forest regulation in the province, and resulted in a series of recommendations that were key influences on postwar forest policy. Drawing on the debate and particularly on the positions adopted by socialists and trade unionists, I link the politics of forest regulation to the politics of class struggle and class compromise in early postwar British Columbia. This serves the purpose of highlighting important, alternative ideas about forest use values and exchange values that contrast with those that underpin conventional, commodity-oriented forestry in the province, as well as with contemporary alternatives to mainstream forestry. It also serves the purpose of exploring the organization of political consent around industrial, sustained-yield forestry, treating this model of regulation not as something ‘natural’, but rather as something politically contingent and negotiated. And finally, I examine seldom explored links between the politics of producing and regulating nature, and the politics of class struggle under capitalism more generally. </jats:p>",

The tip of the robot while walking can often deviate from the desired trajectory as a result of the disturbances forced by unexpected outside factors. In our approach, though no prepared trajectory is specified a priori, the tip follows the artificial vectors designed in the workspace. Moreover, the prediction simulation is performed online. The simulator judges the stability under comparison with the present state and the prediction results, and then the gait parameters are adaptively improved in feedforward for the stable walk. The numerical and physical experimental results show the validity of the proposed method in a continuous walk. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

During the early Cold War, British political leaders and military officers struggled for a closer relationship with the U.S. Air Force in the hope of gaining greater insight into U.S. war plans, predicated as they were on nuclear strikes launched from bases in England. U.S. willingness to supply nuclear (and later thermo-nuclear) bombs for delivery by British bombers prompted bilateral talks from 1956 about their deployment in a joint air offensive. This prospective partnership raised difficult issues for the UK Air Staff, which was committed to the maintenance of an independent nuclear deterrent and countervalue rather than counterforce targeting. Nevertheless, the advantages of joint strike planning were such that by 1962 Bomber Command's planning had become fully integrated with that of Strategic Air Command. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the distribution of income inequality among the regions of the European Union from 1993 to 2000. The results obtained show that the levels of inequality vary considerably between regions. Nevertheless, we have detected a high level of positive spatial dependence in the distribution under consideration. However, 57% of the regions considered registered no statistically significant variations in the degree of income dispersion over time, though there was a reduction in 40% of them. The empirical evidence presented indicates the existence of a process of regional convergence in terms of inequality during the period considered, mainly as a result of the evolution of regions whose initial levels of inequality were relatively high. Moreover, our analysis highlights the important roles played by the national component, activity, and unemployment rates, gross domestic product per capita, and the weight of the agricultural sector in total employment in accounting for differences in the degree of income dispersion across the European regions. </jats:p>",

The idea is to introduce a set of way-points through which the spacecraft are required to pass, combined with parameterizations of the trajectories which are energy-optimal for each spacecraft. The resulting constrained optimization problem is formulated as a quasi-quadratic parameter optimization problem in terms of the way-points parameters. The mathematical structure of the problem is further exploited to develop gradient-based algorithms in which the gradients are computed analytically. The collision avoidance constraints are approximated such that closed form solutions are generated. This combination results in fast and robust numerical algorithms which work very well for scenarios involving a large number of spacecraft (e.g. 20). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Rural development has, in recent years, become a major area of EU policy, to the extent that the term has even begun to be overused in signifying a new shift in EU rural policy. The result has been a great deal of misunderstanding and numerous divergent interpretations of both the concept and the practice. Although rural development existed as a policy domain before the arrival of the accentuated ‘Second Pillar’ of the reformed Common Agricultural Policy, the fact is that an increasingly Europeanized approach to rural development funding, programming, and administration has developed in the post-1999 period. In this paper we argue that the study of rural development policy will gain a great deal from using a policy network approach to interpret the dynamics of evolving rural development policy within member states. Our main aim is to analyze and interpret the newly emerging Rural Development Policy Network in Greece, which aspires to separate itself from a strong and resistant Agricultural Policy Network. The example of Greece suits the purpose of the paper not only because of Greece's continuing reliance on agriculture and the centrality of the latter in sustaining rural livelihoods, but most importantly due to the institutional arrangements developed around it, which are characterized by a prevalence of agricultural interests at the expense of wider rural concerns. The concern of this paper is with the mechanisms of transition, and to a lesser extent with its outcome. One major finding is that the policy network approach to the study of rural development policy in Greece brings to light a certain transformation in policy structures, mechanisms, and administration. This transformation is not so evident at the level of policy style and/or policy outcome. Due to it having been labeled a ‘laggard’ member state, Greece has been affected by the Europeanization of rural development policy and has to some extent transformed its policy-making procedures accordingly. At the same time, the process of Europeanization has acted to empower civil society mechanisms and actors. </jats:p>",

The project included six sites in New York and Pennsylvania consisting of rural, suburban, and urban settings; children at those sites ranged in age between 3 and 18 years. Over a 2-year period, as part of the extension activity, sites were provided with consultation and written materials, a web site, and opportunities to attend a related workshop and conference. Interviews with adult leaders indicated moderate to high levels of participation at most of the sites, variation by age of participants and stage of project, the usefulness of a ladder of children's participation in raising awareness, barriers to participation, attitudinal and behavior changes, and positive impacts on the youth. Ongoing efforts are needed to assist sites/leaders, including strategies to expand thinking about the capabilities of children and youth, help children and youth adjust to new roles, and identity ways for younger children to increase their participation.</jats:p>",

In it I look at how they are formed and at the complex (and at times contradictory) cultural and political uses to which they are put. I examine the poetry of Basil Bunting, in particular his sonata Briggflatts as an example of a narrative of regional identity. Bunting's life and poetry are used to cast light on many of the important themes that can be identified in the literature on regionalism including the uses of history in identity formation, issues of landscape and language, and issues of universalism versus particularism in social–political practice. I draw on Bunting's subtle, complex, and pluralistic sense of his Northumbrian home-world to challenge those advocates of the ‘relational region’ who see places as simply the local articulation of global flows and who present any concern with local culture and identity as atavistic and archaic. I suggest that, by focusing on the enduring importance of dwelling, Bunting's poetry demonstrates the progressive potential of regional narratives while avoiding recourse to a crude metaphysics of scale. I show how poetry is a means of developing narratives of local and regional identity in ways which transcend the dichotomies with which social scientists in general—and geographers in particular—perennially struggle. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a preliminary assessment of the new scrutiny role performed by the assemblies. Our conceptual framework identifies five variables which might influence the effectiveness of regional scrutiny. Regional scrutiny is found to be quite distinct from that conducted by parliament, local government, and other devolved institutions. Analysis of qualitative data suggests that regional scrutiny has been limited by a lack of clearly defined powers, inadequate technical support, and an often ‘cosy’ relationship between assemblies and their Regional Development Agencies. We conclude that regional assemblies urgently require appropriate legitimacy, powers, and resources in order to prevent the accountability gap from widening. </jats:p>",

For example, A* approaches generate unnatural looking paths, potential field‐based methods are too slow, and sampling‐based path planning techniques are inflexible. We propose a new technique, the Corridor Map Method (CMM), which satisfies all the criteria. In an off‐line construction phase, the CMM creates a system of collision‐free corridors for the static obstacles in an environment. In the query phase, paths can be planned inside the corridors for different types of characters while avoiding dynamic obstacles. Experiments show that high‐quality paths for single characters or groups of characters can be obtained in real‐time. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

However, these operational modes cannot reflect all the ever‐changing operating conditions of a refinery. As a result, the CDU operation condition may be sub‐optimal and potential profit may be lost. This paper proposes a CDU model to decide the weight transfer ratio (WTR) ranges of CDU fractions from the operation modes. These WTR ranges are integrated into the refinery planning model to obtain the optimal CDU operation condition. Unlike the traditional linear CDU models that often omit the optimal solutions, or the rigorous simulation models that are time consuming to solve, the proposed CDU model can be easily solved with much higher accuracy than traditional linear models and better solution speed than the rigorous simulation models.

It also magnifies the impact of the institutional history of the regulatory body and the impact of the disciplinary commitments of those working within the regulatory body on the implementation process. It is shown that the result is that those involved in the implementation process are unable to consider all possible routes to implementation but, rather, only a relatively few ‘manageable’ options for the regulation of particular activities. The arguments are examined in the context of implementation of the Water Framework Directive 2000 (WFD) in Scotland. In particular the authors focus on the regulation of diffuse pollution under the WFD and on the role played by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in that regulation. </jats:p>",

Regarding social support, in an interval from 1 to 5, we found an average of 4.2+0.74 (interval of 1.92 to 5) for the emotional support and 4.2+0.6 (interval of 2.3 to 5) for the instrumental support, which indicate high satisfaction and availability of received supports. We found weak but statistically significant correlations between instrumental and emotional supports and the participants' age and between instrumental support and years of education. We did not find any differences in the perception of social support in terms of participants' gender and marital status.</jats:p>",

This framework of ideas is explored further with reference to the development of an integrated Appraisal Toolkit for the North West region of England. Ways in which integrated appraisal can retain its place within the suite of environmental assessment tools as a way of supporting more sustainable patterns of development, and at the same time contributing to good governance, are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the early 1990s, planning theory has focused on the issue of institutional change. Not only does institutional change have clear bearings on processes of spatial planning, it is also, increasingly, seen as an object of planning. A core concept in the literature is the juxtaposition of ‘institutional design’ and ‘institutional evolution’. Yet, in understanding processes and the role of institutional change, this dichotomy does not appear to be very helpful. We therefore propose a more encompassing perspective that includes both ‘design’ and ‘evolution’ dimensions, invoking various components from theories of policy change, inspired by the work of Kingdon. We try to unravel, in particular, why, under seemingly comparable conditions, some cases show substantive institutional transformations while others do not. We briefly discuss two cases from the Netherlands to illustrate this point, namely the thwarted process of establishing city regions within the scalar fabric of territorial governance, and some instrumental changes in land policy. </jats:p>",

Three different methods were used to identify current and historical patterns of caribou distribution and habitat preferences within the region to prioritize conservation areas. Two of the approaches focused on incorporating information on caribou distribution and migrations from scientific and local knowledge, while the third focused on identifying and mapping habitats suitable for supporting caribou. Local knowledge dating back to the 1930s and two decades of satellite telemetry data confirmed that most of the planning region is used by the Porcupine caribou herd and highlighted areas of concentrated use. Maps of suitable winter habitat derived from expert opinion ratings of habitat use did not agree with the other information sources. The local knowledge and satellite telemetry analyses were used to identify spatially explicit priority areas for caribou conservation and the results were applied to develop conservation recommendations for a draft regional land use plan. The plan will be submitted to government approval bodies for review in the spring of 2007. The success in implementing conservation strategies for the Porcupine caribou herd will be reviewed and evaluated following adoption of a final approved plan.</jats:p>"

Both CFC and STPI significantly moderated the intention–quitting behavior and past behavior–quitting behavior relationships.

With Kunshan, one of the most dramatically developed regions in Yangtze Delta, used as a case study, the aim is to understand how, under what circumstances, and by whom, locally initiated projects can be institutionalized and evolved in the context of China's transition. ‘Projects’ here refer to those reforms implemented by local governments initially without any permission from the centre. It is argued that the development of those projects can be understood as an evolutionary process, consisting of three mechanisms of local-central interactions: state's intention to connive; ex-post state endorsement, and ex-ante state adoption. Moreover, the innovations would be successful not only because of general contexts such as marketization, liberalization, and globalization, but also because of a particular process of economic decentralization to the local and political centralization under the party, or, as is proposed, asymmetric decentralization. Careerist local officials would like to utilize their decentralized resources to strive for more development opportunities, which could in turn become their ‘political capital’, enabling them to attract the attentions of upper level governments and hence gain promotion. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Immigration since World War 2 has been a primary engine of economic, social, and cultural change in Canada. Two of its important characteristics have been its ‘urban’ character and the non-European origins of immigrants since the 1960s. The Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) has been a major destination for those immigrants who have entered the self-employed sector of the economy in ever-larger numbers. The authors focus on the barriers and challenges experienced by the Polish, Portuguese, Caribbean, Korean, and Somali immigrants in the establishment and operation of their businesses in the Toronto CMA. With information collected through key-informant interviews, a questionnaire survey, and focus groups, it is found that, despite the Canadian commitment to multiculturalism at all levels of government, visible-minority entrepreneurs still confront more barriers in their business practice than do non-visible-minority entrepreneurs, with access to financing being a persistent problem. Given the increasingly multicultural nature of major Canadian cities and the acknowledged role of immigrants as an engine of economic growth, the authors identify barriers to entrepreneurship among immigrants as an area of clear concern both for policymakers and for scholars, and suggest solutions to address this concern. </jats:p>",

We argue that attempts to introduce New Public Management to policing have not proved as effective as in other public services. Most of the activities of the police have explicitly spatial consequences yet, we argue, the slow diffusion and adoption of geographic information systems (GIS) and other technical innovations has been a particular issue. The current round of political aspirations to reform policing depend in large part on a rapid increase in the efficiency and effectiveness of police management information systems and their deployment at strategic and tactical levels. Generic opportunities and constraints arising in the field of geographic information science are identified and summarised followed by a critical appreciation of current GIS deployment in policing. Direct practical experience in GIS policing applications is used to outline observed barriers to progress and also forms the basis for a number of strategic recommendations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Auto ownership is a critical mediating link in the connection between the built environment and travel behavior: the built environment presumably influences auto ownership, which in turn impacts travel behavior. However, the way in which individual elements of the built environment affect auto-ownership choices is far from understood. Further, residential self-selection may confound the interaction between the built environment and auto ownership. And the absence of panel data impedes our understanding of the causal relationships. Using a survey of 1682 respondents in Northern California, we applied ordered probit and static-score modeling techniques to investigate the causal link from the built environment to auto ownership in both cross-sectional and quasi-panel contexts. Through variable selection in cross-sectional analysis, we found that individuals' attitudes regarding residential neighborhood and travel are more strongly associated with their auto-ownership decision than is the built environment per se. Specifically, when general preferences for various neighborhood traits were allowed to enter the model, they drove out from the model the (perceived) measure of the same trait for the neighborhood of current residence, a pattern suggesting that the observed correlation between neighborhood characteristics and auto ownership is primarily a result of self-selection. On the other hand, the quasi-panel results indicate that some built-environment elements such as outdoor spaciousness and mixed land use are causes of auto ownership (remaining even after attitudes were allowed to enter the model), but their effects are marginal. In contrast, the strong influence of sociodemographics suggests that households' auto-ownership decisions are fundamentally based on their mobility needs and purchasing power. Given the mixed findings, we do not definitively confirm a causal relationship between the built environment and auto ownership. However, we provide encouraging evidence that land-use policies designed to reduce auto ownership and use will lead to a marginal reduction in auto ownership. </jats:p>",

However, often their work has been criticised for lacking analytical clarity and failing to explore the architectures of collective learning and the role of the knowledge produced in making firms in a cluster economy successful. In this paper I engage with these problematics and investigate how collective learning is facilitated in the advertising and law professional-service-firm clusters in London and New York. I explore the role of professional associations and investigate how they mediate a collective-learning process in each city. I argue that professional associations seed urban communities of practice that emerge outside of the formal activities of professional associations. In these communities individuals with shared interests in advertising and law learn from one another and are therefore able to adapt and evolve one-another's approaches to common industry challenges. I suggest this is another form of the variation Marshall highlighted in relation to cluster-based collective learning. I also show how the collective-learning process is affected by the presence, absence, and strength of an institutional thickness. I therefore argue that a richer understanding of institutional effects is needed in relation to collective learning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The assessment of the impacts of forestry activities on water quality is a critical component of forestry management and planning, especially when watersheds are being used for different water uses by different stakeholders. Traditional methodologies for assessing these impacts, while accurate, often do not take into account the intended use of water. Water quality data are inherently technical and are not conducive to communication to all stakeholders—especially the public. There is a need for a communications-based assessment tool that assesses the impact of forestry activities on water quality from the perspective of different water uses. This paper describes the development and application of such a tool, the Forestry Water Quality Index (FWQI). The FWQI has been developed specifically to capture, evaluate and communicate the impact of forestry activities on water quality to multiple stakeholders. Initially based on the Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment's Water Quality Index, the FWQI was specifically adapted for applications in forestry management. Details of this adaptation and its methodology are outlined. Case studies from Newfoundland and Labrador illustrate the use of the FWQI for communication, performance evaluation, and planning and technical data analysis. The FWQI tool has the ability to compare pre- and post-forestry water quality data (communication), determine the effectiveness of best management practices (performance evaluation), predict water quality after forestry activities (planning) and evaluate seasonal variations in water quality (data analysis). These components provide useful information for the evaluation of the effects of forestry activities on water quality and to ensure sustainable forest management. It can be utilized by both forestry and water resources management to ensure sustainable development of the forestry sector. Key words: FWQI, sustainable forest management, water quality, Newfoundland and Labrador </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A growing body of literature has examined the effects of neighbourhood characteristics on child health and well-being and the mechanisms through which such effects may operate. Research investigating neighbourhood effects on children is based on the notion that individuals and families who live in a neighbourhood collectively create a social context that influences the developing child. In this paper we investigate the relationship between individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic characteristics and kindergarten children's readiness to learn in Vancouver, Canada ( n = 3736), using multilevel modeling techniques and 1996 census data for Vancouver neighbourhoods ( n = 68). Findings suggest that although family-level characteristics carry the most weight in shaping children's readiness to learn, neighbourhood-level factors are independently associated with early developmental outcomes, particularly physical health and well-being, language and cognitive development, and communications skills and general knowledge. The strongest neighbourhood characteristics associated with readiness to learn were median income and the percentage of single-parent families. Also important were the percentage of the population who had not moved in the previous five years and the percentage of the population whose mother tongue was non-English. The latter neighbourhood characteristic was an especially strong predictor of communication skills and general knowledge. The findings suggest that neighbourhood-based policies to improve physical health and well-being, language and cognitive development, and communications skills may also meet with some success. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author explores the paradox of a burgeoning accepted definition of regeneration need together with a finite pot of money with which to fund it, and debates as to what consequently constitute the best funding-distribution structures and funding-allocation principles. This in turn provides the backdrop for an examination of aspects of the previously unresearched role of UK National Lottery funding in regeneration, as a potential variant in the contested-funding context. With the aid of results of an interview-based research project and a broader analysis of nationwide press reporting, it is concluded that Lottery funding plays both a qualitative and a quantitative role in regeneration. This is by enabling practical contestation of the status quo but also by supporting and complementing it, illustrating the validity of various dimensions of the debates. Such a capacity is explicable in terms of its unusual, part-independent, part-dependent (on government) governance configuration and positioning. However, Lottery funding is no panacea, for it exhibits as well as relieves certain tensions and trade-offs associated with the paradox. In terms of wider debates, the author demonstrates that governance and power are neglected in conventional discussions concerned with the formulaic assessment of funding need. It is also concluded that, in contrast to moves towards rationalisation and simplification, there is value in having a variety of funding streams (structures and distribution principles), albeit with consideration of how to make this work better. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Anisotropic Analytical Algorithm (AAA) is a new pencil beam convolution/superposition algorithm proposed by Varian for photon dose calculations. The configuration of AAA depends on linear accelerator design and specifications. The purpose of this study was to investigate the accuracy of AAA for an Elekta SL25 linear accelerator for small fields and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments in inhomogeneous media. The accuracy of AAA was evaluated in two studies. First, AAA was compared both with Monte Carlo (MC) and the measurements in an inhomogeneous phantom simulating lung equivalent tissues and bone ribs. The algorithm was tested under lateral electronic disequilibrium conditions, using small fields <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7314-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7314:mp7314-math-0001\" />. Good agreement was generally achieved for depth dose and profiles, with deviations generally below 3% in lung inhomogeneities and below 5% at interfaces. However, the effects of attenuation and scattering close to the bone ribs were not fully taken into account by AAA, and small inhomogeneities may lead to planning errors. Second, AAA and MC were compared for IMRT plans in clinical conditions, i.e., dose calculations in a computed tomography scan of a patient. One ethmoid tumor, one orophaxynx and two lung tumors are presented in this paper. Small differences were found between the dose volume histograms. For instance, a 1.7% difference for the mean planning target volume dose was obtained for the ethmoid case. Since better agreement was achieved for the same plans but in homogeneous conditions, these differences must be attributed to the handling of inhomogeneities by AAA. Therefore, inherent assumptions of the algorithm, principally the assumption of independent depth and lateral directions in the scaling of the kernels, were slightly influencing AAA's validity in inhomogeneities. However, AAA showed a good accuracy overall and a great ability to handle small fields in inhomogeneous media compared to other pencil beam convolution algorithms.</jats:p>",

It relies upon careful consideration of patient anatomy for both stent design and detailed procedure planning. Medical imaging data in the form of two-dimensional scans and three-dimensional interactive graphics offer only limited support for these tasks. The paper reports the results of an experimental investigation on the use of arterial models built by rapid prototyping techniques. An analysis of clinical needs has helped to specify proper requirements for such model properties as cost, strength, accuracy, elastic compliance, and optical transparency. Two different process chains, based on the fused deposition modelling technique and on the vacuum casting of thermoset resins in rubber moulds, have been tested for prototype fabrication. The use of anatomical models has allowed the cardiologist's confidence in patient selection, prosthesis fabrication, and final implantation to be significantly improved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            A 2-day forum was convened to discuss the current status and future implications of reducing\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids without increasing saturated fats in the food supply while maintaining functionality and consumer acceptance of packaged, processed, and prepared foods. Attendees represented the agriculture and oilseed industry and oil processing, food manufacturing, food service, government, food technology, and health and nutrition disciplines. Presentations included food science behind fatty acid technology, the health science of dietary fatty acids, alternatives to\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids, and the use of alternatives in food manufacturing and food service. The reduction of\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids in the food supply is a complex issue involving interdependent and interrelated stakeholders. Actions to reduce\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids need to carefully consider both intended and unintended consequences related to nutrition and public health. The unintended consequence of greatest concern is that fats and oils high in saturated fats, instead of the healthier unsaturated fats, might be used to replace fats and oils with\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids. Many different options of alternative oils and fats to replace\n            <jats:italic>trans</jats:italic>\n            fatty acids are available or in development. Decisions on the use of these alternatives need to consider availability, health effects, research and development investments, reformulated food quality and taste, supply-chain management, operational modifications, consumer acceptance, and cost. The conference demonstrated the value of collaboration between the food industry and health and nutrition professionals, and this conference model should be used to address other food development, processing, and/or technology issues.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The U.S. Air Force (USAF) uses the term Communication Navigation Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) for capabilities that allow its aircraft to use civil airspace and air traffic control services. The resulting ability to interoperate with air traffic control systems around the world supports the USAF's global, multi-faceted mission, but entails great expense in on-board equipage and training. It is important to understand the trade-offs that the USAF must make in assessing the value of specific CNS/ATM capabilities. In this paper, we describe a model-driven analysis to assess mission effectiveness. The analysis is accomplished via a five-step process involving military route generation, simulation of the civilian airspace activity, simulation of delay events for military flights, and evaluation of several figures of merit. The software modules used for these activities were a combination of existing packages and some newly-developed programs. The analysis accounts for planned USAF CNS/ATM capabilities by aircraft type, as well as any airspace and operational restrictions that might be encountered in specific geographic regions when the aircraft does not have the required capabilities. Two layers of interactions are investigated: first, within the USAF enterprise, specifically, between the fighter and tankers assets and, second, between the USAF and civilian ATM. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our goal is to use motile microorganisms as smart microscale robots for a variety of applications. As a first step, we have achieved microrobotic control of Paramecium cell movement using galvanotaxis (locomotor response to electrical stimulus). Previous studies based on simple empirical rules that did not consider cell dynamics had only limited control. To control cells more precisely as microrobots, we must deal with Paramecium cells in the standard robotics framework. This paper is, to our knowledge, the first attempt in trajectory planning of Paramecium cells under an electric field using a dynamics model for microrobotic applications. Based on the original dynamics model, we propose trajectory planning for cells using a common well-known Lyapunov-like approach and generate cusp-free trajectories. We discuss how to generate stable streamlined trajectories for living cells in a step toward actual control. Numerical experiments demonstrate the successful stable convergence of cell trajectories to the desired location and attitude, which should prove useful in the advanced guidance of cells.</jats:p>",
