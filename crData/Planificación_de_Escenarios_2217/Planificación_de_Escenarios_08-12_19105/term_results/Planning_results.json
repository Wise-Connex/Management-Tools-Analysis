      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a widespread opinion that planning theory is of little relevance to practitioners. This article tries to refute this view by showing the impact that planning theorists have had on the profession during the past 50 years. It suggests three ways that theorizing can contribute to the field, referring here to both practice and education primarily in North America. The first is by evolving a deeply considered humanist philosophy for planning and tracing its implications for practice. The second is by adapting planning practices to their real-world constraints with regard to scale, complexity, and time. The third is by translating knowledge and ideas generated in other fields into the domain of planning. The article concludes that planning theory needs to be perceived as a transdisciplinary endeavor involving a global community of scholars and that their contributions are vital to the profession. </jats:p>",

Research on hybrid courses is lacking, especially for discussion-oriented planning classes. This research evaluates a graduate planning theory course delivered in both hybrid and traditional formats, analyzing student performance, class evaluations and supplemental surveys, and instructor reflection. The findings are as follows: (1) performance of students in the hybrid class was no worse than the traditional class, (2) students were satisfied with online activities but class evaluations were somewhat lower, and (3) the instructor found student learning benefits, but hybrid teaching was more time consuming. The results suggest that planning educators should test and evaluate hybrid teaching for a wide range of planning courses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In addition to twelve recognized minority languages (Law no. 482/1999), Italy features a number of non-recognized so-called “dialects” that is difficult to state, but which renowned linguists like Tullio De Mauro and Giulio Lepschy calculate as ranging between 12 and 15. These languages are still spoken (and sometimes written) by slightly less than half of the Italian population and are the first languages of a significant part of it. Some of them even have a history of (semi)official usage and feature large and interesting literary traditions. An introduction on the linguistic situation in Italy, the classification of its “dialects” and their state of endangerment, is followed by discussion of the present (scant) legislation and action being taken to protect the seven language varieties chosen as case studies: Piedmontese, Western Lombard/Milanese, Venetan, Ligurian/Genoese, Roman, Neapolitan and Sicilian. These language planning strategies are discussed particularly in terms of graphization (corpus planning), status and acquisition planning, even when, as in most cases, this “planning” may be uncoordinated and even unconscious. The article closes with a few general considerations and with some suggestions on how these initiatives could be improved.</jats:p>",

STREET magazine, published from 1971 to 1975 by the Pratt Institute Center for Community and Environmental Development in Brooklyn, NY, offers a lens through which to examine the expansion of the profession to encompass a range of ideas associated with this paradigm. This article, drawing on an extensive review of STREET magazine's content within the historical context in which it was produced, as well as interviews with people involved with the publication, argues that STREET reflected the introduction of new modes of practice into the city planning profession, as well as influencing those modes in a particular place, New York City. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, the activity of protecting against and planning responses to the wide range of security challenges that threaten cities and urban areas—from natural disasters such as flooding and anthropogenic climate change to crime and terrorism—has been referred to as ‘urban resilience’. In this sense, urban resilience refers to both the design alterations (structural, architectural, land-use planning) and managerial and governance measures that seek to prevent or mitigate the physical and social vulnerability of areas, ultimately to protect life, property and economic activity. Against this background, this paper analyses attempts to embed physical and managerial resilience in urban areas to counter the risk from terrorist attacks. Specifically, it highlights the expanded role for the spatial planning system in meeting and mediating pressures for increased safety and security. Drawing on historical examples, but paying particular attention to the current UK context, the paper details how the planning profession is becoming more responsible for counter-terrorism; this is leading not only to requirements for further training but also to concerns regarding efficacy. This work also questions how proportionate the pressures to achieve counter-terrorism resilience are, particularly given the higher likely incidence and impact of natural disasters. </jats:p>",

One promising new planning strategy to encourage voluntary land assembly is graduated density zoning, which allows higher density on larger sites. This strategy can increase the incentive for owners to cooperate in a land assembly that creates higher land values. Graduated density zoning will not eliminate the incentive to hold out, but it can create a new fear of being left out. Holdouts who are left with sites that cannot be combined with enough contiguous properties to trigger higher density lose a valuable economic opportunity. This article examines the difficulty of assembling land for infill development, and explains graduated density zoning as a way to encourage voluntary land assembly. Finally, it presents the results of graduated density zoning in practice. </jats:p>",

This research was employed with the goal of improving students' transfer of GIS/ global positioning systems (GPS) skills to field settings, independent projects, and to future employment. This scaffolded instruction was evaluated by analyzing students' work and their perceptions of the field experience using GPS with GIS. Although GIS and GPS are increasingly used in concert by planners, little instructional research into the integration of these technologies in university urban studies or planning curricula has taken place. The evaluation of the active scaffolded learning field exercise showed that the urban studies and planning students demonstrated mastery and transfer of field-based GIS and GPS data collection and management. The evaluation supports a scaffolded instruction approach in a GIS curriculum, one that engages students and results in positive learning outcomes. </jats:p>",

But most representations of social space are significantly limited by the distinct purposes of discipline, expertise, and policy domain, while planning is expected to be participatory and inclusive of all kinds of interrelationship. The article presents a method, based on an interpretation of Lefebvre's conceptual triad, for building a more comprehensive understanding of planning situations that involves recognizing sociospatial differences and investigating their interrelationship. Examples from the author's teaching, research, and community service in planning demonstrate ways in which the physical, conceptual, and social aspects of planning situations are at work and accessible. </jats:p>",

Recently available online interfaces with maps and satellite imagery provide a potential source of up-to-date, free, and easy-to-use geographic information. This article evaluates one of these interfaces, Google Earth, as a tool for collecting data, illustrating the evaluation with two methodologies developed to study urbanization in Mexico. The first, used to collect data on road paving and housing density in informal settlements in Tijuana, is deemed successful, while the second, used to generate data on recent urban expansion in several Mexican cities, is not. The problem with the second methodology and primary limitation of the online tool is that satellite image data is presented without clear dates. Thus, its usefulness is determined by the time frame of analysis - as the period of time gets shorter, the uncertainty surrounding the end date becomes increasingly problematic. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To date, there have been relatively few studies of small-scale providers of water in developing countries, though they are seen to be important players in peri-urban water supply systems. This paper uses the case of small-scale providers in Can Tho, Vietnam, to examine competition in local water markets, and how piped water compares with a range of lower-quality traditional sources. Although previous studies have usefully employed contingent valuation to estimate the demand for low quality, the evidence provided here estimates demand based on actual household choices regarding water of differing qualities and prices. Using an original household survey, the paper assesses the comparative advantages regarding costs, uses, and perceived advantages/challenges of each source. Findings suggest that household demand for piped water exists, but not on a sufficient scale to obviate more traditional sources, even though it is surprisingly affordable when compared to what residents pay for natural sources. Findings also suggest that the main perceived advantage of the piped system is not for its hygienic quality, but for aesthetic characteristics such as taste, smell, and color. Scholars might continue to pursue research in situations where households are not limited in their ability to choose water sources of varying qualities.</jats:p>",

Backyards are also used more frequently and for a wider range of activities than are front yards, and alleys are sites of informal socializing with neighbors. These patterns, however, are not tied to rates of recreational walking or the use of the front yard as an intentional social space, something many residents clearly value. </jats:p>",

The objectives of this study are to (1) identify children's ideal community elements and (2) determine if there are any differences in rural and urban children's perceptions. Models of an ideal community are created by ninety-three rural children and fifty urban children in a design charrette. Model content is analyzed using multivariate statistics to identify element and pattern preferences. Principal component analysis of the resultant thirty-eight models reveals that for the rural children, six components are considered significant dimensions and explain 67 percent of the variance, with the first component accounting for nearly 27 percent of the variance. For the urban children, four components are significant and explain 51 percent of the variance, with the first component accounting for nearly 15 percent of the variance. Spatial diagrams indicate that there is a difference between the rural and urban models. Furthermore, discriminant analysis reveals that there is a statistical difference between the content of the urban and rural models at a significance level of .007. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cities have always been built in hostile and harsh environments. Technological advances have helped increase the safety and security of their inhabitants and, to a large extent, have divorced the urban area from local environmental constraints. However, the dominance of economic issues in the development of urban form has created a legacy of exposure and vulnerability to flood risk, and a growing recognition of the limitations of this methodology has led to a desire to manage flooding in a way more in harmony with nature. This paper contends that, with regard to flood risk management, there has been a transition from self-protection to engineered defence to the current ideology of natural management, which provides a driver for consideration of the nature of an idealised urban form that is more resilient to flood risk, designed to absorb water and minimise damage. The paper identifies reflexivity, knowledge and adaptation as the three underlying principles of a theoretical ‘absorbent city’ and aims to stimulate debate by describing the potential urban form of a flood-resilient urban area, according to geographical and climatic constraints. Adaptive measures needed to help increase resilience are also discussed. </jats:p>",

This paper analyses: (a) the key variables and their causal relations that underlie the complex system of risk and disaster occurrence in slums; (b) the impacts of disasters on slums; (c) the strategies used by local people to cope with risk and disasters; and (d) the reasons for weak coping. The views and knowledge of slum dwellers in El Salvador are the focus of this analysis. On this basis, five complementary ex ante risk-reduction measures have been identified and developed to match local needs, capacities and dimensions of risk—hazard reduction (or prevention), mitigation, preparedness, risk ‘financing’ and stand-by for recovery. The complementary measures provide a frame of reference that allows urban development actors to systematically search for and design potential risk reduction measures. It is concluded that keeping these measures compartmentalised and separate from each other during planning and implementation of urban development programmes helps ensure both sustainable poverty reduction and urban resilience. </jats:p>",

It involves all relevant aspects of sustainability such as defined by the Urban Water conceptual framework: health, environment (including use of resources), economy, socio-cultural aspects, and technical function. The Urban Water programme has developed a set of tools for the assessment of the aspects involved. Substance flow simulation models such as URWARE and SEWSYS deliver quantified data on emissions to air, water and land, and the use of energy. Data is interpreted by LCA methodologies, quantifying e.g. eutrophication, acidification, discharge of green-house gases etc.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>All information, whether quantitative or qualitative, whether delivered by professionals or laymen, are used in an iterative decision-making process, such as the SCA method (Strategic Choice Approach). The multi-criteria assessment involves a weighting mode and can be made using graphic computer programs or numerically.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The SCA approach and the Urban Water tools have been used for assessing the future sustainable system for handling wastewater and biowaste in Göteborg, Sweden. Among the results were that it was not found to be sustainable to abandon the existing principles and exchange the existing system for source separation systems. Systems that extract pure phosphorus (and nitrogen) fractions at the treatment plant, and systems that aim at producing a very clean sludge by reducing the pollutant sources in the city, got high scores in the assessment.</jats:p>",

Perceptual experience, on such accounts, is said to be enacted. This chapter argues that despite the important role of embodied action both in information pickup and in initially tuning the circuitry that supports perceptual awareness, strong sensorimotor models end up tying the contents and character of human experience too closely to the fine details of human embodiment. In so doing, they fail to accommodate the substantial firewalls, disintegrations, and special-purpose streamings that form the massed strata of human cognition.</jats:p>",

The second is a visualization tool that enables the navigator to assess collision risk in an encounter situation and choose a collision avoidance manoeuvre if necessary.

This paper reviews the role of civil engineers in disaster response with a focus on existing building assessment and marking systems and highlights various limitations of existing approaches. A mobile information technology (IT)-based collaborative framework is discussed to facilitate a coordinated disaster response and recovery operation. It enables engineers to assess building damage better and to make this information available to personnel more quickly and easily within the disaster area and thereby improve disaster response. The deployed architecture is composed of various components including radio frequency identification (RFID)-based structural assessment, a field engineer’s mobility and information support platform and geographic information systems (GIS)-based resource optimisation. Deployed infrastructure enables the on-site and on-demand information provisioning, data processing and computational support required by engineers in the aftermath of a disaster. </jats:p>",

Designed and conducted by AmericaSpeaks, Community Congress II brought together over 2500 New Orleanians, linked electronically across five different cities plus smaller satellite sites in 15 diaspora communities across the country. Table observations of 48 deliberative rounds, along with exit interviews, post-event focus groups with participants, and stakeholder interviews are used to address three central questions about the social processes of deliberation: What are the patterns of interaction at the tables across race and gender; how do the participants interpret the meaning of the event for themselves; and what were the outcomes in terms of legitimacy, influence, and social trust? The article contextualizes the event in the unfolding story of the recovery process and culls out the lessons learned for deliberative democracy. Community Congress II demonstrates that inclusive public deliberation does more than provide reasoned public input into difficult policy decisions. It does more than legitimate new public initiatives. It can foster social trust and social healing across the divides of race, culture, and wealth. But the benefits will be sustained only if they are reinforced by an institutional infrastructure of civic engagement.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, we develop two novel pricing methods for solving an integer program. We demonstrate the methods by solving an integrated commercial fishery planning model (IFPM). In this problem, a fishery manager must schedule fishing trawlers (determine when and where the trawlers should go fishing, and when the trawlers should return the caught fish to the factory). The manager must then decide how to process the fish into products at the factory. The objective is to maximise profit. The problem may be modelled as a single integer program, with both the trawler scheduling and production planning parts integrated. Inventory constraints connect the two parts of the problem. Production planning alone would result in an easy linear program, but due to the trawler scheduling aspect, the IFPM is a hard integer program in the sense that traditional solution methods result in computation times that are far too long to be practical. The two pricing methods developed in this paper are a decomposition-based O'Neill pricing method and a reduced cost-based pricing method. We demonstrate the methods by means of numerical examples for different planning horizons, corresponding to differently sized problems.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>Automated planning is a branch of AI that addresses the problem of generating a set of actions to achieve a specified goal state, given an initial state of the world. It is an active area of research that is central to the development of intelligent agents and autonomous robots. In many real‐world applications, a multitude of valid plans exist, and a user distinguishes plans of high quality by how well they adhere to the user's preferences. To generate such high‐quality plans automatically, a planning system must provide a means of specifying the user's preferences with respect to the planning task, as well as a means of generating plans that ideally optimize these preferences. In the last few years, there has been significant research in the area of planning with preferences. In this article we review current approaches to preference representation for planning as well as overviewing and contrasting the various approaches to generating preferred plans that have been developed to date.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

The content of this part is basically linguistic, with social implications, and mostly synchronic. The historical references, however, are never set aside. In the first place, it is important to make a distinction between the real melting languages and theoretical misinterpretations. English and Spanish are combined with social and literary implications in the diverse slang forms of the area: pachuco, caló, among others. Spurious interests, however, have given force to fantastic hypotheses brought to a climax by the invention of an allegedly “new” language, called Spanglish. This lexical choice is unfortunate, because it takes advantage of the existence of a more innocuous use of the word, simply referring to all forms of contact between the two languages. Four aspects are therefore mixed up and mistaken: the invention of an allegedly “new” language, in spite of a total lack of unification; the constant code-switching with different modalities and extent; the bad quality of certain translations; and the cultural relegation of Hispanics to speakers of a ghetto language. The set of two articles ends with a graphical presentation of a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats). The conclusion refers to Judeo-Spanish and the dangers of ghetto languages, as well as to the role of education.</jats:p>",

As a target value for water protection measures a nitrate concentration in percolation water of 50 mg/l as an average for a larger area defined by the groundwater bodies and their hydrogeological subdivisions has been defined. An integrative emission model is used to simulate the interactions between agricultural practice, nitrogen surpluses and the nitrogen flow through the soil and aquifer to the outflow into surface waters. The actual nitrate concentrations in percolation water are calculated for the entire Federal State of Lower Saxony considering site-characteristics, N-surpluses, water balance and denitrification in the soil. The tolerable N-surpluses needed to meet the environmental target are quantified as averages for each of the hydrogeological subdivisions by “backward” calculation using this model system. The required reduction of N-surpluses was estimated by comparing the tolerable N-surpluses with the actual state of nitrogen emission. For the evaluation of the amount and efficiency of water protection measures, the required reduction of N-surpluses to accomplish the environmental target is quantified, using the current status as a reference.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Educating an architect is as complex as any other professional. The student, apart from design itself, learns many other relevant things and composes all that knowledge in the design studio, which is the most tested pedagogical practice in architectural education. The design studio is dominated by the design tutor, and this power structure has resulted in a particular dynamics that makes the student to treat the designer-trained tutor as a mentor. This ‘guild-culture training’, in which the student is not free from the biases of the mentor, silences the creativity of the student. The observation of a lack of self-styled approaches to design among the students is a result of this silenced studio tradition, which is defined as the research problem. By testing the strength of critical educational theory as a way of resurrecting the mystique of designing, we aim at contributing towards the development of comprehensive pedagogical tools for architectural education. We, taking samples of students from different years, have used observation, participatory observation and unstructured interviews as methods to collect data. The students are encouraged to perpetuate the intellectual and cultural biases of their colleagues and tutors in the learning critiques, peer critiques, design workshops, lectures, and peer discussions. Facilitating the making of a reflective practitioner, who sets own norms and objectives, is our objective, and this has proven to be a neutral process of learning in order to reform design education.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article describes the procedures for correction of the modulator thickness and commissioning of the XiO treatment planning system (TPS) for modulator‐based intensity modulated radiation therapy (M‐IMRT). This modulator manufacturing system adopts a method in which the modulator is milled using a floor‐type computer‐aided numerical control milling machine (CNC‐mill) with modulator data calculated by XiO TPS. XiO TPS uses only effective attenuation coefficients (EAC) for modulator thickness calculation. This article describes a modified method for assessing modulator thickness. A two‐dimensional linear attenuation array was used to correct the modulator thickness calculated by XiO. Narrow‐beam geometry was used for measuring the linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) at off‐axis positions (OAP) for varying brass thicknesses. An equation for the two‐dimensional LAC ratio (2D‐LACR) can be used to calculate the corrected modulator thickness. It is assumed that the broad beam EAC of a small field varies with the brass thickness and the OAP distance in the same way as that of LACR, so the two‐dimensional EAC (2D‐EAC) is equal to the EAC corrected using the LACR. The dose distribution was evaluated for three geometric patterns and one clinical case on low energy x ray <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6285-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp6285:mp6285-math-0001\" /> with a large field size <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6285-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp6285:mp6285-math-0002\" />. The results using the proposed correction method of modulator thickness showed a good agreement between the measured dose distributions and the dose distributions calculated by TPS with the correction. Hence, the method is effective to improve the accuracy of M‐IMRT in XiO TPS. An important problem for the brass modulator is the milling condition, such as the drill diameter and the cutting pitch size. It is necessary to improve the accuracy of M‐IMRT for the “softening” and “hardening” effects of the beam to be considered in dose calculation in patients and the modulator profile design.</jats:p>",

In that context modeling aimed at production tasks allocation planning plays a crucial role especially at concurrently executed production orders. The introduced reference model employing constraint programming (CP) paradigm describes both an enterprise and a set of project-like production orders. Moreover, encompassing consumer orders requirements and available production capabilities, the model provides the formal framework allowing one to develop a class of decision support systems aimed at interactive production process planning subject to multiproject environment constraints. In that context our contribution is a knowledge-based and CP-driven approach to resource allocation assuming precise character of decision variables. The conditions sufficient for deadlock avoidance are the main goal. The conditions delivered provide formal framework for developing a task oriented Decision Support Tool for Project Portfolio Prototyping (DST4P, Banaszak 2006). The tool provides a prompt and interactive service to a set of routine queries formulated either in straight or reverse way.</jats:p>"

Consequently, the increased need for care and support for people living with Acquired Immune-deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), as well as orphaned and vulnerable children, is unprecedented. The response to combat the HIV epidemic has been evident in many areas as the country continues its fight against the HIV epidemic. However, efforts to provide care and support - including Anti-Retroviral Therapy (ART), management of opportunistic infections, and community home-based care - have, so far, largely stemmed from the health sector. Housing care and other non-medical support is continuing to lag behind. Lack of proper housing is one of the deprivations suffered by orphaned children and people living with AIDS, which predisposes them to attacks by opportunistic infections and other vulnerabilities and disrupts the continuum of care, whilst at times denying occupants the required privacy.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>This paper focuses on creating an understanding of why housing care and support for HIV and AIDS affected is lagging behind in Swaziland. It suggests cultural, economic, political and policy issues as the underlying reasons for this, and, therefore, concludes that there is need for bold policy reforms in these areas. In order to create a proper framework for such reforms, the paper reviews the following:</jats:p>\n<jats:p>1. The national housing policy's implications on the care and support for people living with HIV and AIDS and the orphaned and vulnerable children; and</jats:p>\n<jats:p>2. The current human settlements related responses to HIV and AIDS in Swaziland's rural, peri-urban and urban areas.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>In this context, urban development planning paradigms and the extent to which HIV and AIDS is being integrated into the development plans are discussed.</jats:p>",

The annual rainfall at Pusa was 1222.3 mm and coefficient of variability indicated that rainfall was more or less stable over the years. Monthly rainfall had unimodel peak, July receives maximum rainfall of 331 mm followed by August (298.5 mm). The stable rainfall period was of 9 weeks, which spread over 27 to 37th standard meteorological weeks (SMW) except 32nd and 34th SMW. The average duration of rainy season is from 26 to 40th SMW. The initial and conditional probability of receiving 10 mm and 20mm weekly rainfall revealed that dependable rainfall occurs between 25 to 37th weeks. At 75% probability level rainfall of 9.5 mm can be expected to occur during 25th week. These pre-monsoon rains at 75 % probability level can be utilized for seedbed preparation for raising rice seedlings. Since, at 50% probability level, rainfall during 22 to 24th SMW ranges from 8.8 to 13.8 mm, thus summer crops (cowpea, black gram, green gram, maize and direct sown rice etc) could also be grown successfully in this region with supplemental irrigation.</jats:p>"

By tracing the links between creativity and the values it provides towards the development of architectural concepts, relating this to the architect’s ability to recognise contemporary issues and problems linked to the built environment, the paper is able to analyse the relevance of traditional building and vernacular architecture in today’s architectural pedagogy. In order to do this, concepts of creativity, problem identification and tradition shall be defined within the confines of this paper and how these are used in the process for creating contemporary built environments which are culturally sensitive to people and place. This process will be supported by case studies wherein traditional building and all that it entails have been used by communities and individual architects alike to produce buildings and places that are appropriate to their cultural context whilst addressing relevant social, economic, environmental and political issues.</jats:p>",

From this sample, 75 (43.4%) responded within the five week time-frame stipulated. The questionnaire was constructed using four existing surveys and asked researchers for information about: geographical location, years of research experience, research funding sources, current plans to archive research data, awareness of archiving policies, attitude to mandated research data archiving, effect of mandatory data archiving policies on grant-seeking, attitude to making archived research data accessible, and use of research data collected by others. The questionnaire also included space for respondents to make comments.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nResponses to each question were analyzed, followed by a series of cross-analyses to investigate associations between findings. These cross-analyses include: whether attitudes to making data accessible differed according to length of experience, support for a national archive initiative, or agreement with a mandatory policy; and whether plans to archive research data were associated with awareness of policy, agreement with mandatory policy, or funding from government agencies other than SSHRC. Some cross-analyses were conducted between responses to questions and the comments provided by respondents. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMost of the questionnaire responses were analyzed as percentages in two categories only. For example, length of service responses were presented as “up to 20 years” and “more than 20 years,” and for responses relating to agreement with mandatory archiving “no” and “undecided” responses were combined into one category and compared with “yes” responses. &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nMain Results &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nPlans to archive research data&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOnly 41.3% of the respondent sample had current plans to archive their research data; plans that included filing materials in their office and destroying materials. A small proportion of this group (18.7%) planned to archive their research data in an established repository. Respondents who planned to archive their research data were more likely to have received funding from other government agencies (64.7%) than respondents who had not received other government funding (23.5%). Examination of the comments made by respondents indicated those who planned to archive their data were more likely to make comments on this issue.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nKnowledge of data archiving policies&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nRespondents’ awareness of data archiving policies, particularly that of the SSHRC, an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declaration, and that of their own university, was low. Less than a third of the sample (28%) was aware of the SSHRC policy and less than 10% of the OECD declaration or their own university’s policy. A sizeable proportion of the sample (65.4%) stated they were “uncertain” whether their university had a data archiving policy. Of the respondents who planned to archive their data only 42.4% were aware of the SSHRC policy, and a high percentage of respondents with no plans to archive their data (83.3%) were also unaware of this policy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nWhen asked if they agreed with a mandatory policy of data archiving being linked to grant funding the sample group was almost evenly split into agree (33.3%), don’t agree (28%), and uncertain (36%). Only 46.9% of the sample who planned to archive their data agreed with the policy.  &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSupport for data archives&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThere was strong support for a data archive at the home institution by respondents who agreed with mandatory archiving of research data (84%). However, when asked about allowing public access to this data the results were evenly divided across most of the sample group (66 respondents). Full open access to data was supported by 44% of this group and 44% thought access should be at the discretion of the depositing researcher. Agreement with open access to data was also associated with researchers who agreed with mandatory archiving policy (70.8%) and researchers with over 20 years experience (68%). The enforcement of a mandatory archiving policy would not alter most respondents’ future grant-seeking behaviour (86.7%). &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nSupport for a national data archive was solid across the sample group, with only 17.3% indicating they did not support an initiative of this type. Almost all respondents who agreed with public access to research data supported a national data archive (96.5%) and of the respondents who did not support a national archive 90.9% were undecided about data access or wanted restrictions in place. When asked about use of research data collected by others, 48% had used such data in the past and 49.3% had not analyzed research data collected by others.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nConclusion – While support for a national data archives strategy is strong, researchers’ attitudes and behaviour towards data archiving is less supportive and their plans to archive research data would not, in most cases, meet standards of archiving practice. The notion of open access to research data has less support, with researchers noting barriers relating to confidentiality, ethics, effect on academic career, and cost of archiving. Funding of data archiving raises particular concerns and the author recommends that SSHRC policy is clarified in this regard. Further, the author notes that differences between institutional requirements and national policies relating to research data require attention so that archiving policy objectives are coordinated. The decisions made in moving towards a national data archiving policy will enable Canada to contribute to the wider international discussion of standards for research data archives.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this study was to examine aspects of the instructional planning process that are taught to agricultural education preservice teachers. Survey research and content analysis of course materials was utilized to collect and analyze data. The population for the study was a census of agricultural education teacher educators who taught instructional planning to preservice teachers at land grant institutions during 2006-2007. This study found that the two most frequent instructional planning models being taught were the Allen 4-step and the Madeline Hunter direct instructional model. A majority of the instructional plan components being utilized were aligned with Searcy and Maroney’s (1996) literature review; however, notable exceptions pertained to estimated time required and reflection. Teacher educators were most frequently requiring Methods of Teaching Agriculture (Newcomb, McCracken, Warmbrod, &amp; Whittington, 2004) as a required text and a course Web site as a required student reading resource. This study concluded that while instructional plan requirements did not change at a number of institutions during student teaching compared with when taught during coursework, there were changes whereby a more succinct or more expanded instructional plan was required.</jats:p>"

These preexisting ideas interacted with c) the process, which contained the patient's experience of all of the interactions encountered in facilitated ACP. The relationship between the three categories left participants comfortable that they had addressed their concerns about living in a burdensome state for themselves or their families.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents an optimal path planning method of steerable electrode arrays for robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery. In this paper, the authors present a novel design of steerable electrode arrays that can actively bend at the tip. An embedded strand in the electrode array provides an active steering degrees-of-freedom (DoF). This paper addresses the calibration of the steerable electrode array and the optimal path planning for inserting it into planar and three-dimensional scala tympani models. The goal of the path planning is to minimize the intracochlear forces that the electrode array applies on the walls of the scala tympani during insertion. This problem is solved by designing insertion path planning algorithms that provide best fit between the shape of the electrode array and the curved scala tympani during insertion. Optimality measures that account for shape discrepancies between the steerable electrode array and the scala tympani are used to solve for the optimal path planning of the robot. Different arrangements of DoF and insertion speed force feedback (ISFF) are simulated and experimentally validated in this paper. A quality of insertion metric describing the gap between the steerable electrode array and the scala tympani model is presented and its correspondence to the insertion force is shown. The results of using 1DoF, 2DoF, and 4DoF electrode array insertion setups are compared. The 1DoF insertion setup uses nonsteerable electrode arrays. The 2DoF insertion setup uses single axis insertion with steerable electrode arrays. The 4DoF insertion setup allows full control of the insertion depth and the approach angle of the electrode with respect to the cochlea while using steerable electrode arrays. It is shown that using steerable electrode arrays significantly reduces the maximal insertion force (59.6% or more) and effectively prevents buckling of the electrode array. The 4DoF insertion setup further reduces the maximal electrode insertion forces. The results of using ISFF for steerable electrodes show a slight decrease in the insertion forces in contrast to a slight increase for nonsteerable electrodes. These results show that further research is required in order to determine the optimal ISFF control law and its effectiveness in reducing electrode insertion forces.</jats:p>",

One widely adopted approach is to use indicator taxa, i.e. a single taxon such as birds or butterflies, despite the ongoing debate regarding their usefulness as indicators of broader biodiversity. Here we assess several aspects, such as influence of species number, of indicator taxa for three extensive data sets to improve our insight into the effectiveness of indicator taxa.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Location </jats:bold> Denmark, sub‐Saharan Africa and Uganda.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold> First, we investigate to what extent variation in species number between indicator taxa (e.g. 488 mammal spp. vs. 210 snake spp.) is causing the differences in effectiveness between indicator taxa. Second, we investigate whether indicator taxa are capable of outperforming indicator groups composed of random sets of species chosen among all taxa. Finally, we assess the correlation of specific properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa to their effectiveness. We investigate these aspects of the effectiveness of indicator taxa through the separate analysis of three distinct distributional species data sets: sub‐Saharan Africa (4,039 spp.), Denmark (847 spp.) and Uganda (2,822 spp.).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> We overall found that indicator taxa comprising a greater number of species tend to perform better than indicator taxa with fewer species (e.g. 488 mammal spp. outperform 210 snake spp.), although there are some exceptions. Second, we found most indicator taxa to perform worse than indicator groups consisting of a comparable number of species selected among all taxa. Finally, the effectiveness of indicator taxa was seen to correlate poorly with selected distributional properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa, suggesting that it is difficult to predict which taxa are efficient biodiversity indicators.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Main conclusions </jats:bold> Overall, these findings might suggest that focus should simply be on increasing the number of species among all taxa as basis for priority setting, rather than striving to obtain the ‘perfect’ indicator taxa.</jats:p>",

At plan completion, the patient record is moved to the completed list.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> Since September 2003, patient numbers through treatment planning steadily increased from around 90 a month to about 130 currently. Planning times decreased from 11 to 7 workdays.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> Workflow through treatment planning is indirectly managed and the approach allows for day-to-day staffing fluctuations and competency levels. There is instant information on planning status for all patients throughout the department, building up a record as part of the work process.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Algorithms for planning quasistatic attitude maneuvers based on the Jacobian of the forward kinematic mapping of fully-reversed (FR) sequences of rotations are proposed in this paper. An FR sequence of rotations is a series of finite rotations that consists of initial rotations about the axes of a body-fixed coordinate frame and subsequent rotations that undo these initial rotations. Unlike the Jacobian of conventional systems such as a robot manipulator, the Jacobian of the system manipulated through FR rotations is a null matrix at the identity, which leads to a total breakdown of the traditional Jacobian formulation. Therefore, the Jacobian algorithm is reformulated and implemented so as to synthesize an FR sequence for a desired rotational displacement. The Jacobian-based algorithm presented in this paper identifies particular six-rotation FR sequences that synthesize desired orientations. We developed the single-step and the multiple-step Jacobian methods to accomplish a given task using six-rotation FR sequences. The single-step Jacobian method identifies a specific FR sequence for a given desired orientation and the multiple-step Jacobian algorithm synthesizes physically feasible FR rotations on an optimal path. A comparison with existing algorithms verifies the fast convergence ability of the Jacobian-based algorithm. Unlike closed-form solutions to the inverse kinematics problem, the Jacobian-based algorithm determines the most efficient FR sequence that yields a desired rotational displacement through a simple and inexpensive numerical calculation. The procedure presented here is useful for those motion planning problems wherein the Jacobian is singular or null.</jats:p>",

The Plan for the City of Vancouver, first published in 1928, devoted significant attention to the Kitsilano and Musqueam reserves. In the decades that followed, municipal officials drew upon the plan in their descriptions of the particular problems created by reserves in the city. Municipal officials came to think that the reserves harmed the rest of Vancouver and that modern urban areas presented a special case for dispossession. Marshalling the theories and methods of city planning in their attempts to control and acquire the reserves from the 1930s to the 1950s, city officials fashioned a distinctively municipal colonialism. </jats:p>",

A key challenge for water managers is how to incorporate highly uncertain information about potential climate change from global models into local‐ and regional‐scale water management models and tools to support local planning. This paper presents a new method for developing large ensembles of local daily weather that reflect a wide range of plausible future climate change scenarios while preserving many statistical properties of local historical weather patterns. This method is demonstrated by evaluating the possible impact of climate change on the Inland Empire Utilities Agency service area in southern California. The analysis shows that climate change could impact the region, increasing outdoor water demand by up to 10% by 2040, decreasing local water supply by up to 40% by 2040, and decreasing sustainable groundwater yields by up to 15% by 2040. The range of plausible climate projections suggests the need for the region to augment its long‐range water management plans to reduce its vulnerability to climate change.</jats:p>",

All patients were treated at the authors' institution between June 2007 and March 2008. The patients' treatments were replanned in 2 different ways. In the first plan, hybrid shots were used such that the steepest dose gradient was aligned with the junction between the target and the critical structure(s). This was accomplished by placing low-value collimators in appropriate sectors. In the second plan, no hybrid shots were used. Sector blocking (either manual or dynamic) was required for all plans to reduce the critical structure doses to acceptable levels. Prescribed doses ranged from 12 to 30 Gy at the periphery of the target. The plans in each pair were designed to be equally conformal in terms of both target coverage (as measured by the Paddick conformity index) and critical structure sparing.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The average number of shots required was roughly the same using either planning technique (16.7 vs 16.6 shots with and without hybrids). However, for all patients, the number of blocked sectors required to protect critical areas was larger when hybrid shots were not used. On average, nearly twice as many blocked sectors (14.8 vs 7.0) were required for the plans that did not use hybrid shots. The number of high-value collimators used in each plan was also evaluated. For small targets (≤ 1 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), for which 8 mm was considered a high value for the collimator, plans employing hybrids used an average of 2.3 times as many 8-mm sectors as did their nonhybrid counterparts (7.4 vs 3.2 sectors). For large targets (&gt; 1 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), for which 16 mm was considered a high value for the collimator, hybrid plans used an average of 1.4 times as many 16-mm sectors as did the plans without hybrids (10.7 vs 7.7 sectors). Decreasing the number of blocked sectors and increasing the number of high-value collimator sectors led to use of shorter beam-on times. Beam-on times were 1–39% higher (average 17%) when hybrid shots were not allowed. The average beam-on time for plans with and without hybrid shots was 67.4 versus 78.4 minutes.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The judicious use of hybrid shots in patients for whom the target is close to a critical structure is an efficient way to achieve conformal treatments while minimizing the beam-on time.

This paper argues that, although markets are adequate instruments to achieve an efficient allocation of resources and to promote private initiative, the resolution of the sustainability challenge cannot be left only to market forces, but requires other complementary instruments, among which we highlight indicative energy planning. We discuss the role of indicative energy planning in the future of liberalized energy markets, and propose a general methodology for its implementation, as well as the identification of the major issues to be addressed. </jats:p>",

Using field data collected from 568 married men aged between 15 and 59 years, the paper shows that men’s knowledge of contraceptives in Mbeya region was highest for male condoms and lowest for the diaphragm. The study also found that men’s current use of modern contraceptives is significantly associated with age, education, number of living children, and desired number of additional children. However, when the effect of these variables was tested through a logistic regression, only education and number of living children were found to be significant predictors of current use of modern contraceptives.</jats:p>"

Discrete choice experiments (DCEs) are a quantitative technique for eliciting preferences that can be used in the absence of revealed preference data. The method involves asking individuals to state their preference over hypothetical alternative scenarios, goods or services. Each alternative is described by several attributes and the responses are used to determine whether preferences are significantly influenced by the attributes and also their relative importance. DCEs are widely used in high-income contexts and are increasingly being applied in low- and middle-income countries to consider a range of policy concerns. This paper aims to provide an introduction to DCEs for policy-makers and researchers with little knowledge of the technique. We outline the stages involved in undertaking a DCE, with an emphasis on the design considerations applicable in a low-income setting.</jats:p>",

It juxtaposes the contrasting visions of city planners and youth workers for Alexanderplatz, a controversial square in Berlin's eastern centre. I argue that the notion of “robustness” is helpful in understanding an important contemporary shift in thinking about planning and the social. In a sense, both planners and youth workers accused each other of taking insufficient notice of “the social.” While planners spoke of robustness as a technical, economic and aesthetic quality to which public space needs to aspire, the youth workers' vision for Alexanderplatz was a proposal for a kind of “social” robustness where the social is, quite literally, built into the urban design. These ethnographic observations need to be understood in a context where city planning has been one of the most critical domains in which the tensions provoked by German unification are played out. Taking such socio‐cultural specificities into account will lead to a more nuanced understanding of forms of neoliberal city planning.</jats:p>",

In the past decade, this research effort has slowed down, while strategic planning has gained greater popularity among managers. However, some academics dispute the usefulness of strategic planning, particularly in turbulent environments. This paper examines the following key research questions that are relevant to both practice and theory. First, the relationship between the formality of strategic planning (conceptualised by considering whether firms have written strategic plans and the level of correspondence between the written strategic plan and the normative planning process) and a wide range of performance measures. Second, the relationship between three contingency factors – size, sector and environment, in addition to the incidence of formal planning and the level of formality. Of great interest are the effects of munificence and turbulence. The results suggest that the link between strategic planning formality and performance is tenuous. Nevertheless, managers tend to deploy strategic planning widely in difficult market environments. The conclusion is that strategic planning is perceived to enhance a firm's survival chances, but not necessarily its short-term performance. </jats:p>",

Despite its importance these estimates are not available since reliable field estimates are either expensive or difficult to obtain. Based on the relationship between a species’ local abundance and distribution, some authors propose that abundance can be obtained through spatial distribution data from maps plotted at different scales. This has never been tested over the entire geographical range of a species. Thus, the aim of this study was to estimate global abundance of the Neotropical primate<jats:italic>Brachyteles hypoxanthus</jats:italic>(northern muriqui) and compare the results with available field estimates.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Location </jats:bold>From southern Bahia to Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states, in the Brazilian Atlantic rain forest.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold>We compiled 25 recent occurrence localities of<jats:italic>B. hypoxanthus</jats:italic>and plotted them in grid cells of five different sizes (1, 25, 50, 75 and 100 km per side) to evaluate the performance and accuracy of abundance estimates over a wide range of scales.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> If current trends of declining fertility rates and increasing abandonment of rural land as a result of urbanization continue, this will signal a globally significant transformation with important consequences for policy makers interested in conservation planning. This transformation is presently evident in a number of countries and projections suggest it may occur in the future in many developing countries. We use rates of population growth and urbanization to project population trends in rural areas for 25 example countries. Our projections indicate a general decline in population density that has either occurred already (e.g., Mexico) or may occur in the future if current trends continue (e.g., Uganda). Using both temperate and tropical examples we present evidence that this process will lead to ecological homogenization as a dominant habitat (e.g., forest replaces a mosaic of human-maintained landscapes), resulting in declines in biodiversity at the local scale. Building on this information, we consider research programs that need to be conducted so that policy makers are prepared to effectively manage depopulated rural areas. </jats:p>",

We investigated the neural correlates that mediate planning of goal-oriented actions by asking 10 healthy subjects to prepare either a goal-specific movement toward a common object (a cup), with the intent of grasping-to-pour (liquid into it) or grasping-to-move (to another location) the object, or performing a non-object-oriented stimulus-response task (move a finger). Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation was administered on 50% of trials to the supramarginal gyrus (SMG), anterior intraparietal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus opercularis (IFGo), and triangularis during motor planning. Stimulation to SMG and IFGo caused a significant delay in planning goal-oriented actions but not responses to an arbitrary stimulus. Despite the delay, movement execution was not affected, suggesting that the motor plan remained intact. Our data implicate the SMG and IFGo in planning goal-oriented hand–object interactions.</jats:p>",

It is argued that a further institutionalisation of the integration of local (public) values into interactive decision making is needed. This requires an institutional design that embeds local values in the use of valuation methods and rules and guidelines relevant to regional planning. Existing procedures of valuation and weighing may still be used but in a context of co-valuation. However, co-valuation is characterized by its multi-actor approach towards valuation that assesses different and sometimes competing values. A case study was conducted to experiment with the combination of deliberation and weighing in local/regional spatial development concerning water systems and related infrastructures. Based on the case study and related research, some first steps towards the involvement of local values in decision making are proposed. </jats:p>",

As the nation’s largest integrated health care system, the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) could be a key component of community planning.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To identify issues relevant to VA–community pandemic influenza preparedness.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> As part of a VA–community planning process, we developed and pilot-tested a series of tabletop exercises for use throughout the VA system. These included exercises for facilities, regions (Veterans Integrated Service Networks), and the VA Central Office. In each, VA and community participants, including representatives from local health care facilities and public health agencies, were presented with a 3-step scenario about an unfolding pandemic and were required to discuss issues and make decisions about how the situation would be handled. We report the lessons learned from these pilot tests.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Existing communication and coordination for pandemic influenza between VA health care system representatives and local and regional emergency planners are limited. Areas identified that would benefit from better collaborative planning include response coordination, resource sharing, uneven resource distribution, surge capacity, standards of care, workforce policies, and communication with the public.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The VA health system and communities throughout the United States have limited understanding of one another’s plans and needs in the event of a pandemic. Proactive joint VA–community planning and coordination—including exercises, followed by deliberate actions to address the issues that arise—will likely improve pandemic influenza preparedness and will be mutually beneficial. Most of the issues identified are not unique to VA, but are applicable to all integrated care systems. (<jats:italic>Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness</jats:italic>. 2008;2:251–257)</jats:p>",

House of quality (HOQ) is used to translate customer requirements (CRs) into each stage of a product development in QFD. In the conventional QFD model, constant coefficients are employed to present the relationships between “What matrix” and “How matrix” and among “How matrixes\". In order to break the hindrance of the representation of simple linear function in the structure of HOQ, an integrative approach considering Kano model into QFD planning are employed, and processes are performed in uncertain and vague environments. Therefore, a fuzzy multi-objective model (FMOQFD-Kano) is proposed to reconcile the tradeoff between customer satisfaction and cost. Not only customer satisfaction is taken into account, but also cost is considered in the proposed model. Moreover, a fuzzy solution approach is applied to solve the model for preferred solutions under different alpha-levels, which can give decision-maker more choices to cater for uncertain environment. An example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model. </jats:p>",

Registration of planning images with daily images is thus an important component of ART. In this article, the authors report their research on multiscale registration of planning computed tomography (CT) images with daily cone beam CT (CBCT) images. The multiscale algorithm is based on the hierarchical multiscale image decomposition of E. Tadmor, S. Nezzar, and L. Vese [Multiscale Model. Simul. 2(4), pp. 554–579 (2004)]. Registration is achieved by decomposing the images to be registered into a series of scales using the (BV, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6602-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp6602:mp6602-math-0001\" />) decomposition and initially registering the coarsest scales of the image using a landmark‐based registration algorithm. The resulting transformation is then used as a starting point to deformably register the next coarse scales with one another. This procedure is iterated at each stage using the transformation computed by the previous scale registration as the starting point for the current registration. The authors present the results of studies of rectum, head‐neck, and prostate CT‐CBCT registration, and validate their registration method quantitatively using synthetic results in which the exact transformations our known, and qualitatively using clinical deformations in which the exact results are not known.</jats:p>",

The review aims to demonstrate the information value of registry data. While renal registry provides a useful data resource for epidemiological research, there are severe methodological limitations in its application for analytical or therapeutic research. However, it is the use of renal registry data for public health and health‐care management purposes that registry really comes into its own, and it is primarily for these that governments have invested in national patient and disease registries. We apply data from several renal registries in the Asia–Pacific region to illustrate its wide application for planning dialysis services, for evaluating dialysis practices and health outcomes, with a view to improving the quality of dialysis care. In the course of preparing the review, we have found that the quality and accessibility of renal registry data were highly variable across the region. Given the value of renal registry, every country in the Asia–Pacific region should establish one or should ensure that their current registries are better resourced and developed. Greater data sharing and collaboration among registries in the region could help advance the nephrology to serve our patients better.</jats:p>",

A significant example is unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), regularly being called upon to perform tasks in the military theatre.

In this case it will be necessary to ensure that the decisions enable the progression of the platform objectives and also the overall mission objectives.</jats:p><jats:p>The motivation behind the work presented in this paper is the need to be able to predict the failure probability of missions performed by a number of autonomous systems working together. Such mission prognoses can assist the mission planning process in autonomous systems when conditions change, with reconfiguration taking place if the probability of mission failure becomes unacceptably high.</jats:p><jats:p>In a multiplatform phased mission a number of platforms perform their own phased mission that contributes to an overall mission objective. Presented in this paper is a methodology for calculating the phase failure probabilities of a multiplatform phased mission. These probabilities are then used to find the total mission failure probability. Prior to the mission the failure probabilities are used to decide if the original mission structure is acceptable. Once underway, failure probabilities, updated as circumstances change, are used to decide whether a mission should continue. Circumstances can change owing to failures on a platform, changing environmental conditions (weather), or the occurrence of unforeseen external events (emerging threats). This diagnostics information should be used to ensure that the updated failure probabilities calculated take into account the most up-to-date system information possible. Since the speed of decision making and the accuracy of the information used are essential, binary decision diagrams (BDDs) are utilized to form the basis of a fast, accurate quantification process.</jats:p>",

The overall aim of this study is to verify the correlation of the coronal suture and the structures of the central lobe in 32 cadaver hemisphere brains and the importance of this information in surgical planning. The measurement of the nasion to the coronal suture ranged from 11.5 to 13.5 cm. The distance between the coronal suture in the midline to the central, precentral and paracentral sulcus ranged from 5.0 to 6.6, 2.5 to 4.5 and 1.3 to 4.0 cm respectively. Particularly in the normal cortex these measurements can be used to guide the surgical access. However, the identification of the central sulcus is not easy when the anatomical pattern is distorted or displaced by a lesion or edema. In cases such as these the use of other tools becomes crucial for good surgical planning and cortical mapping or awake craniotomy for a safer resection of the lesion as well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment plans optimized for intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) may be very sensitive to setup errors and range uncertainties. If these errors are not accounted for during treatment planning, the dose distribution realized in the patient may by strongly degraded compared to the planned dose distribution. The authors implemented the probabilistic approach to incorporate uncertainties directly into the optimization of an intensity modulated treatment plan. Following this approach, the dose distribution depends on a set of random variables which parameterize the uncertainty, as does the objective function used to optimize the treatment plan. The authors optimize the expected value of the objective function. They investigate IMPT treatment planning regarding range uncertainties and setup errors. They demonstrate that incorporating these uncertainties into the optimization yields qualitatively different treatment plans compared to conventional plans which do not account for uncertainty. The sensitivity of an IMPT plan depends on the dose contributions of individual beam directions. Roughly speaking, steep dose gradients in beam direction make treatment plans sensitive to range errors. Steep lateral dose gradients make plans sensitive to setup errors. More robust treatment plans are obtained by redistributing dose among different beam directions. This can be achieved by the probabilistic approach. In contrast, the safety margin approach as widely applied in photon therapy fails in IMPT and is neither suitable for handling range variations nor setup errors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The past post-disaster recovery process had many difficulties in planning. The importance of residents participatory urban planning is true of post-disaster planning and ordinary planning; however, there are difficult problems as follows: time-scale conflict between desire of affected households for swift recovery of their individual lives and enough consideration of urban planning to avoid speed-before-quality planning, unsmooth discussion and consensus building because of mutual conflict of their interest in the residents, and a shortage of professionals in the case that an earthquake disaster hits wide and high-density urbanized region. The concept of \"pre-disaster planning\" has been propounded as measures to deal with these serious situations after 1995 Hyogo-ken Nambu Earthquake in Japan. Actual measures including \"neighborhood community-training program for post-disaster recovery\" of Tokyo Metropolitan have been implemented in various approaches. This study has pioneering approach in this context. We focus on planning support technologies based on a geographic information system (GIS) and establish planning support system for post-disaster community-based urban planning, which will smooth discussion and increase efficiency of planning work. An introduction of the system will result in reduction of total time needed on the planning process and supplement of professionals. Though there are some problems that we identified, they will be solved in accumulated experiences such as the training program in the near future.</jats:p>",
