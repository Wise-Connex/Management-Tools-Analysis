This study determined the asthma‐specific QOL and autonomy preferences of a population of asthmatics in a developing country and their association with relevant sociodemographic and clinical characteristics.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods: </jats:bold> A cross‐sectional study using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Asthma Autonomy Questionnaire was performed on a population of stable asthmatics recruited from a tertiary care centre in India. Severity of the disease was assessed by spirometry.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> The study population comprised 80 asthmatics. The mean (SD) overall QOL score was 5.04 (0.97). This was significantly associated with history of hospitalization during the previous year for an asthma attack (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and with FEV<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) on univariate analysis; on multivariate analysis, only history of hospitalization was significant. Autonomy preferences of the patients showed higher scores for information‐seeking (mean (SD) = 78.95 (16.35) ) than decision‐making (mean (SD) = 38.21 (14.6)). The information‐seeking preferences had a negative correlation with age (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and a positive correlation with education status (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.01) and decision‐making correlated with education status (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). A minority of patients (19%) indicated a preference for a greater say in decision‐making than their physicians. There was a lower tendency for decision‐making when given a ‘severe exacerbation’ scenario than in ‘mild exacerbation’ (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) or ‘stable disease’ (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> Hospitalization history and FEV<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> values are the parameters having the most significant impact on the QOL of asthmatics. There is a clear desire to obtain more information about the disease but most patients do not endorse the idea of making independent disease‐related decisions.</jats:p>",

The authors perform a longitudinal analysis, using correspondence analysis of square asymmetric matrices, on data generated from three different postcrisis time periods. The first period encompasses data during the 2 weeks after the crisis occurred, the second period assesses data 1 year later, and the third period refers to 5 years later. The results from the first and second periods both indicate the growing importance of credence attributes rather than search attributes compared with during the precrisis period. The third-period analysis indicates a reversal and greater importance of the search attributes that were important in the precrisis period. The results also reveal correlations with the type of banking organization. These findings point to important managerial implications; bank management's inability to realize the shift in consumers' attitudes failed to facilitate and expedite a resolution to the crisis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cyathostomes (Nematoda, Cyathostominae) cause colic, decreased performance and growth, peripheral edema, and dysorexia in equids. Also, the synchronous emergence of cyathostome larvae encysted in the colon and cecal wall causes larval cyathostominosis, which is characterized by protein‐depriving enteropathy, chronic diarrhea, edema, weight loss, colitis, and may be fatal. In the past few decades, drug resistance in cyathostomes has become widespread, especially for benzimidazoles. Resistance to tetrahydropyrimidines is still confined to a few areas, and the recent reports of reduced efficacy in macrocyclic lactones are of great concern. Although cyathostomes are widely distributed in Italy, with a prevalence up to 100%, information on the presence of drug‐resistant cyathostomes is scarce. The first study investigating drug resistance was conducted on a few farms in 1992 and showed the presence of cyathostome populations resistant to the (pro)benzimidazoles in northern Italy. A second survey was carried out 14 years later, with the focus on farms in central and southern regions. Cyathostomes resistant to fenbendazole and pyrantel pamoate were found, while macrocyclic lactones remained 98–100% effective. Recently, the efficacy of oxibendazole (97%) and moxidectin (100%) in removing fenbendazole‐resistant cyathostomes in Italy has also been demonstrated. These few studies indicate that drug‐resistant cyathostomes are present in multiple regions of Italy, but geographically and numerically broader investigations of farms are necessary. Finally, there is the undoubted need to use the remaining fully effective drugs (such as moxidectin) in a proper way to preserve their efficacy as much as possible.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Audio rendering is generally used to increase the realism of virtual environments (VE). In addition, audio rendering may also improve the performance in specific tasks carried out in interactive applications such as games or simulators. In this article we investigate the effect of the quality of sound rendering on task performance in a task which is inherently vision-dominated. The task is a virtual traffic gap-crossing scenario with two elements: first, to discriminate crossable and uncrossable gaps in oncoming traffic, and second, to find the right timing to start crossing the street without an accident. A study was carried out with 48 participants in an immersive virtual environment setup with a large screen and headphones. Participants were grouped into three different scenarios. In the first one, spatialized audio rendering with head-related transfer function (HRTF) filtering was used. The second group was tested with conventional stereo rendering, and the remaining group ran the experiment in a mute condition. Our results give a clear evidence that spatialized audio improves task performance compared to the unimodal mute condition. Since all task-relevant information was in the participants' field-of-view, we conclude that an enhancement of task performance results from a bimodal advantage due to the integration of visual and auditory spatial cues.</jats:p>",

The demand of each product is assumed with a geometric Brownian motion and approximated by a finite discrete set of scenarios. A two‐stage stochastic programming model is developed based on scenarios and solved by a deterministic equivalent large linear programming model. The model explicitly considers the objective to minimize the total cost of C/D wafers. A real‐world example is given to illustrate the practicality of a stochastic approach. The results are better in comparison with deterministic linear programming by using expectation instead of stochastic demands. The model improved the performance of control and dummy wafers management and the flexibility of determining the downgrading policy. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this work, we present a new design for prebiotic‐chemistry experiments in ice matrix. Using this design, a mixture of products including PAHs, polar aromatic compounds, and hydrophilic acetylene‐based polymers was obtained. We propose that acetylene generation in a methane/nitrogen atmosphere and subsequent polymerization to PAHs and polyynes could be a favored pathway in the presence of water freeze–melt cycles. These results shed light on the processes involved in PAH synthesis in icy environments and on the physical factors that drive the different competing pathways in methane/nitrogen atmospheres.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes our general framework for the investigation of how human gestures can be used to facilitate the interaction and communication between humans and robots. Two studies were carried out to reveal which “naturally occurring” gestures can be observed in a scenario where users had to explain to a robot how to perform a home task. Both studies followed a within-subjects design: participants had to demonstrate how to lay a table to a robot using two different methods — utilizing only <jats:italic>gestures</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>gestures and speech</jats:italic>. The first study enabled the validation of the COGNIRON coding scheme for human gestures in Human–Robot Interaction (HRI). Based on the data collected in both studies, an annotated video corpus was produced and characteristics such as frequency and duration of the different gestural classes have been gathered to help capture requirements for the designers of HRI systems. The results from the first study regarding the frequencies of the gestural types suggest an interaction between the order of presentation of the two methods and the actual type of gestures produced. However, the analysis of the speech produced along with the gestures did not reveal differences due to ordering of the experimental conditions. The second study expands the issues addressed by the first study: we aimed at extending the role of the interaction partner (the robot) by introducing some positive acknowledgement of the participants’ activity. The results show no significant differences in the distribution of gestures (frequency and duration) between the two explanation methods, in contrast to the previous study. Implications for HRI are discussed focusing on issues relevant for the design of the robot’s communication skills to support the interaction loop with humans in home scenarios.</jats:p>",
