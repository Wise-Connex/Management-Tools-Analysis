The proposed system explicates such crucial but elusive research dis tinctions as: self-selective versus forced exposure and nonexposure, treatment stimuli versus spontaneous stimuli, randomized groups versus matched groups versus other non- randomized group comparisons, \"natural\" versus true experiments, laboratory versus field experiments, blackout versus treatment-control experiments, and other equally important research variations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The formal practice of forecasting and planning (F&amp;P) has risen to prominence within a few decades and now receives considerable attention from both academics and practitioners. This paper explicitly recognizes the nature of F&amp;P as future-oriented decision making activities and, as such, their dependence upon judgmental inputs. A review of the extensive psychological literature on human judgmental abilities is provided from this perspective. It is argued that many of the numerous information processing limitations and biases revealed in this literature apply to tasks performed in F&amp;P. In particular, the “illusion of control,” accumulation of redundant information, failure to seek possible disconfirming evidence, and overconfidence in judgment are liable to induce serious errors in F&amp;P. In addition, insufficient attention has been given to the implications of numerous studies that show that the predictive judgment of humans is frequently less accurate than that of simple quantitative models. Applied studies of F&amp;P are also reviewed and shown to mirror many of the findings from psychology. The paper subsequently draws implications from these reviews and suggests reconceptualizing F&amp;P through use of decision-theoretic concepts. At the organizational level this involves recognizing that F&amp;P may perform many, often conflicting, manifest and latent functions which should be identified and evaluated through a multi-attribute utility framework. Operationally, greater use should be made of sensitivity analysis and the concept of the value of information. </jats:p>",

Wastewater from all use sectors, along with fresh water, are considered as candidate sources or origins of water for other elements within the use sector and also for elements of other use sectors. Quality parameters of various sources of flows are explicitly considered. The model allows for economies of scale in treatment and transportation through the use of a nonlinear objective function and consists of both linear and nonlinear constraints. The model is solved using a large‐scale generalized reduced gradient technique. The analysis of hypothetical examples shows how the model can evaluate various planning scenarios, allowing the planner a broad spectrum of solutions to choose from.</jats:p>",

One outcome of the policies referred to as deinstitutionalization is an overall reduction in the social and geographical distance between members of the public and the mentally ill. For deinstitutionalization to be successful, it is important that residents in impacted communities become more accepting, both in a passive and in an active sense. A survey was made of residents in two neighborhoods of the city of Norman, Oklahoma, one of which was adjacent to a large mental health facility. In a causal model framework, the relationship between proximity and public attitudes is investigated; and the results suggest an important and significant relationship. The implications of the study for public education campaigns about mental illness, and for facility location strategies, are discussed. </jats:p>",

Previous authors who have responded to this query have supplied an indifference curve analysis that examines the trade-off individuals face between income and urban size (environmental goods). This paper instead provides a general equilibrium model that explicitly incorporates urban agglomeration economies to examine the conditions under which out-migration and those economies may simultaneously exist. Under the assumption that the elasticity of substitution between the outputs of large and small cities is unity, four cases can be distinguished. Our conclusion is that labor will unambiguously migrate from large cities with an increase in agglomeration economies only if large city goods are income-inelastic and large cities are relatively capital-intensive. The more reasonable hypothesis, that out-migration is a result of shrinking productivity advantages of large cities, can also be investigated by means of this general equilibrium framework. </jats:p>",

It is shown that the Alonso model is equivalent to one of Wilson's four standard models depending on the assumption at the outset about which of the total outflows and/or inflows are known. This result turns out to supersede earlier findings—inconsistent only in appearance—which were derived independently by Wilson and Ledent. In addition to this, an original contribution of this paper—obtained as a byproduct of the process leading to the aforementioned result—is to provide an exact methodology permitting one to solve the Alonso model for each possible choice of the input data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The results of two questionnaire surveys of migrant owner-occupiers in Northampton, England, are reported. The major focus of interest is the importance of changes in the family life cycle in promoting mobility as a consequence of changing housing needs. It is demonstrated that demographic changes did not necessarily predispose households to move to acquire more space. Households which moved because of increased pressure on their housing space were significantly less well provided with space, but they had not experienced greater demographic change. They had always been relatively less well provided. It is suggested that this is because they opted to substitute either a newer or a more detached house for more space when they purchased the property. The behavioural model of residential mobility is reassessed in the light of these findings. </jats:p>",

Alternatively, the correspondence for each city could be separately assessed and the individual city indices aggregated. The stage at which aggregation takes place affects the size of the final measure of confirmation as well as its significance, but, unfortunately, in opposite ways. Preliminary data aggregation typically leads to larger summary statistics and larger significance levels. The conflicting notions of size and significance are first formalized in detail when the basic data are single numerical values obtained for each object-attribute pair. Extensions are presented to multigroup concordance, hierarchical aggregation schemes, and to object data defined by pairwise proximities between the attributes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a reply to two recently published critiques of our finding of a discontinuity in the recent internal migration patterns of Europe, Japan, and North America. Using data from the HAS A Human Settlements Systems Task, Hall–Hay and Gordon both fail to detect any significant narrowing in the differential between the growth rates of metropolitan areas and the growth rates of rural areas in Europe and Japan over the period 1950–1970 (they concede that this difference has disappeared, and has even been reversed in the United States). Our rejoinder here consists simply of a clarification of our own independent research on regional population change in these same countries. Unlike the IIASA project, this research has been confined, in the case of Europe and Japan, to a study of the trends in net internal migration to their politically and economically dominant core regions, for which data are available for the post-1970 period as well. Most of the disagreement over the presence or absence of a discontinuity in the regional population trends in the countries of western Europe and Japan can be explained by this simple difference in the principal orientations of the two studies, the first towards all metropolitan areas in these countries for the period 1950–1970, and emphasizing the total population growth of these areas, the other towards their densest, richest, and generally most important regions for the longer period 1950–1980, and emphasizing net internal migration to these regions rather than their overall population growth. For there is little doubt, as we demonstrate here, that there has been an abrupt and precipitous reduction in net internal migration towards the core regions of many countries in the developed world in the 1970s, though a comparable reduction may not have taken place to all metropolitan areas in the aggregate. Gordon's and Hall–Hay's claim to have rebutted our thesis is thus seen to be based on a misconception of the subject of our study. </jats:p>",

Although a Federal Appelate Court recently rescinded part of the district court decision, Milwaukee must still upgrade its metropolitan sewage system to a level beyond that required by federal and state regulations. The improvements must be completed with or without federal aid. The case points out the apparent inability of the Clean Water Act, the most comprehensive federal legislation affecting the nation's water quality, to deal with certain interstate water quality conflicts. The Milwaukee decision could set a precedent for similar settlements elsewhere which may in turn affect the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's water quality clean up program. A more integrated, ecosystem conscious approach to management of shared water resources (e.g., the Great Lakes) would help reduce the need for court decisions like <jats:italic>Illinois v.

These models have proved useful in choosing from among several potential river basin configurations, since they can rapidly evaluate each configuration's expected performance. However, when dealing with large scale river basin development projects, in which over 50 or 100 alternative reservoirs, irrigation areas, and other components must be considered, it is sometimes quite difficult to effectively use a simulation model to rapidly identify those combinations of projects which best satisfy the development objectives. The purpose of this paper is to describe how a simulation model was used in the analysis of a complex river basin development project in Eastern Europe, and how the problems of scale were confronted and solved. The author's experience on this projet is used to derive a set of general guidelines which may be helpful in other simulation studies.</jats:p>",
