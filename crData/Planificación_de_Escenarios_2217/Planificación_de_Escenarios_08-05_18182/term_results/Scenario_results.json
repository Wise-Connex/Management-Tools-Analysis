Based on mathematical computer models for dynamic real-time analysis of the well behavior, critical limits for operational parameters like drilling fluid pump rate, trip velocity and optimal process parameters are calculated. The result of the calculations is applied directly to control drilling equipment in real time. The Drilltronics system has been field tested on the Statfjord C platform. Combining the Drilltronics system with wired pipe, decision support programs, and continuous measurements of drilling fluid parameters give synergy effects that in future may allow remote operated drilling systems.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To handle drilling through sections with large pressure variations between individual layers or between the overburden and the reservoir future drilling practice will change. Rotary steerable liner drilling systems will be available primo 2008. StatoilHydro and one of StatoilHydro's suppliers are developing a 9 5/8?? and a 7?? system. A full drilling tool package can be included in the system. By combining steerable liner drilling with the expandable pipe technology and managed pressure drilling methods, lot of to-days drilling challenges can be solved.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>StatoilHydro has identified Automated Drilling Systems (ADS) as one of our major technological efforts in a relatively near future. The technology as such is to a large extent at hand. It is a matter of taking the technology into operation. Our experience is that many of the drilling problems are related to human error or rather; slow response wrt corrective actions. ADS has the capability, if designed correctly, to eliminate this type of misbehaviour. It is mandatory to design the Automated Drilling Systems such that the general progress in operation is not slowed down.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The regional response of the global ocean to low-frequency changes in atmospheric pressure loading, ηib, is analyzed as it occurs in the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology (MPI-M) coupled ocean–atmosphere climate model in response to increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Results suggest that long-term changes in ηib can lead to increases in high-latitude sea level by up to 5 and 10 cm, respectively, after doubling and quadrupling the atmospheric CO2 content. At low latitudes, sea level will decrease simultaneously between 2 and 4 cm through the combined effects of changes in the atmospheric circulation and through the increase of its moisture content. In subpolar regions, associated rates of sea level increase are of the order of 0.4–0.6 mm yr−1 for quadrupled atmospheric CO2 concentrations, while in mid- and low latitudes, sea level will decrease at a rate of 0.2 mm yr−1. Differences between doubling and quadrupling CO2 concentrations indicate regionally dependent nonlinearities in the changing climate system. The analysis suggests that in some regions (including the coasts of northern Europe) low-frequency ηib changes could be as large as 10%–20% of a global sea level increase anticipated over the next 100 yr. While not being a dominant effect, amplitudes of long-period ηib changes are large enough to be included in future estimates of climate-related regional sea level change. Increasing the vertically integrated atmospheric CO2 content by 4 and 12 kg m−2 (on global average), in response to doubling and quadrupling atmospheric CO2 concentrations, suggests associated reductions of global sea level by 0.6 and 1.7 cm, respectively. The differences between two different model solutions are significant, especially in the Southern Ocean, where they show significantly different atmospheric mass and pressure distributions, and at low latitudes, where differences resemble the contribution of increased moisture content added to the inverted-barometer (IB) effect in the MPI-M solution.</jats:p>",

Scenario planning helps organizations to increase their capacity to learn and adapt as the future unfolds and results in strategies that more effectively help organizations prepare for an uncertain future. Because organizations are complex, multilevel systems, scenario planners must also focus the complexities of learning across multiple levels of analysis. Fostering the learning processes that support effective implementation of strategy across multiple levels of analysis requires attention to the elements and relationships that drive learning from one level to the next. Few strategies for learning fully articulate and integrate the characteristics of learning at different levels of analysis.This article identifies key elements and relationships constituting learning at multiple levels of analysis—individual, group, organization, and industry—and provides an integrated view of multilevel learning in organizational settings to guide and support strategic planning and implementation. </jats:p>",

An experiment performed on the Volve field in the North Sea with pairs of nodes planted side by side clearly confirmed the high degree of stability in the coupling and the repeatability of the measurements from all components.

Given the participation of higher-level organizational members, a question arises as to whether the scenario planning process is useful in developing leadership capability and capacity within an organization. The implied link between scenario planning and the development of leadership capability must first be described, understood, and substantiated before it can be assumed to be of strategic utility to organizations and fields of practice. This article presents the outcomes of an exploratory inquiry into the association between scenario planning and leadership. Initial discoveries suggest that the development of leadership capability and capacity are reasonable expected outcomes of scenario planning and tentatively positions scenario planning as a strategic tool in human resource development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On December 8, 2004, the <jats:italic>Selendang Ayu</jats:italic>, a Malaysian‐flagged freighter, ran aground off Unalaska Island in Alaska's Aleutian chain. Despite rescue efforts by the United States Coast Guard, six of the <jats:italic>Selendang Ayu's</jats:italic> crew members died. In addition to the deaths, more than 300,000 gallons of heavy bulk fuel oil spilled into the sea. Much of the oil washed onto the island's shores, into areas providing cultural, recreational, subsistence, and commercial fishing resources for residents of the renewable resource community of Dutch Harbor/Unalaska. The purpose of this article is to identify and examine different dimensions of risk, based on qualitative research conducted in 2005. We use a contextual constructionist approach to understand risk, which conceptualizes risk as an objective hazard, threat, or danger that is mediated through social and cultural processes. Research methods included 31 personal interviews, participatory observation, and a review of media coverage. Findings revealed several dimensions of risk perceived by residents: the incident in relation to Dutch Harbor/Unalaska as a high‐risk community and more general current events; threats to the community's annual $1 billion seafood industry; threats to Alaska Native subsistence culture; and issues of future risk and uncertainty. Interviews and observations support our conclusion that the <jats:italic>Selendang Ayu</jats:italic> incident represented a “shot across the bow” that could have been a “worst case” if oil had contaminated commercial fish processing. Residents believe that it is only a matter of time before another, more damaging accident occurs. Given this general perception, it is important to more clearly assess risk in Dutch Harbor/Unalaska and help the community increase resilience to the multiple hazards it faces. More broadly, Dutch Harbor/Unalaska serves as an example—all communities could benefit from better risk assessments and increased attention to resiliency.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Previous papers pointed out the influence of long-term service exposures on the thermal-mechanical behavior of Zr alloys in LOCA conditions and, especially, the impact of in-service hydrogen pick-up on post-quench mechanical properties. Moreover, the oxide layer grown under in-service conditions was occasionally expected to have a protective effect against high temperature oxidation. Finally, the oxygen and hydrogen distributions within the prior-β layer appear as a key parameter with regard to the residual ductility of the alloy, especially as a function of the cooling scenario. The objective of the study presented here was to further investigate the influence of these parameters on the post-quench mechanical properties. Unirradiated Zircaloy-4 and M5® cladding tubes were consequently hydrided up to different concentration levels, then oxidized at high temperature (1000–1200°C) up to at least 10 % measured equivalent cladding reacted (ECR) and directly quenched to room temperature (RT). Ring compression tests (RCT), 3-point bending tests (3PBT) at RT and 135°C, as well as impact tests at RT were then performed to determine the evolution of the post-quench mechanical properties of Zircaloy-4 and M5® alloys with H content. Similarly, specimens preoxidized out-of-pile were also submitted to high temperature oxidation and direct quench, as well as to post-quench ring compression tests. Along with calculations of oxygen diffusion in the metal, results from those tests allowed us to estimate the assumed protective effect of the pretransient oxide layer. Finally, using specimens in the as-received condition or hydrided to typical end-of-life H contents, the effect of temperature history after oxidation at 1200°C was studied, i.e., at the end of the high temperature isothermal oxidation, samples were either submitted to direct quenching to RT or to slow cooling to different final quenching temperatures. It was thus demonstrated that the cooling scenario has a significant impact on the post-quench mechanical properties. All test samples were investigated by means of fractographic examinations to assess the type of failure mode. Moreover, a deep metallurgical analysis has been performed: SEM and image analysis were used for accurate phase thickness measurements, nuclear and electron microprobes for quantitative mapping of hydrogen and oxygen. It proved that the oxygen and hydrogen contents and their distribution in the prior-β layer have a first-order influence on the residual ductility. From all the results obtained on as-received and hydrided samples directly quenched from the oxidation temperature, it was then possible to derive a relationship between structural parameters, i.e., oxygen and hydrogen contents and thickness of the prior-β layer, and the post-quench impact properties at RT.</jats:p>",
