        "PROCEEDINGS OF CITTA 1ST ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON PLANNING RESEARCH: EVALUATION IN PLANNING"
      ],
      "type": "edited-book",

      "subject": [],
      "abstract": "<jats:p>This book contains a fair selection of the papers presented at the 1st CITTA’s annual conference. In line with our initial intentions and, indeed, with the programme of the conference, the four parts of this book present a mixed and balanced picture of a wide and diverse range of research contributions coming both from our centre and from other Portuguese research centres with a particular interest in planning.  The title - Planning Evaluation - reflects the general theme of the conference. As a research topic, the evaluation of planning activities already has a long history and yet, it is still a rather difficult and controversial issue to address. The first contributions date back to the 1960s. At that time, a number of evaluation methodologies appeared in the planning literature as refinements of the classical Cost Benefit Analysis.  Their general conceptual framework was very much in accordance with the then dominant rational comprehensive planning model. However, those early days left very few records of practical applications, at least documented in the international planning literature.  With the subsequent evolution of planning theories, from the mid 1980s through to the turn of the century, and the emergence and steady dissemination of the collaborative planning paradigm, new and more complex methodologies have been proposed but, again, very few contributions can be traced in the planning literature of systematic applications in local planning departments or in independent planning research units.  Everyone seems to agree that evaluation is an essential component of the planning process and an indispensable instrument to (re)design responsive planning policies. But, actually, very few invest their time and resources in systematic planning evaluation exercises geared towards the preparation and implementation of a particular land use plan or planning policy document, or towards the assessment of the role and overall performance of a particular regional or local planning department.  In this respect, the reader can find in the first part of this book a number of contributions coming from different CITTA’s research units and also from elsewhere, trying to bridge, albeit modestly, this most noticeable gap between theory and practice. The other three parts of the book group several contributions under the general themes of CITTA’s research units, namely Planning and Environmental Assessment, Urban policies and Housing and Transport Planning and Logistics. Each part starts with a brief introduction written by the chair of the respective session.</jats:p>",

This study draws on ethnographic fieldwork in Degollado, Mexico, to describe generational and social‐contextual differences in how women interpret and use religious doctrine to achieve their fertility desires without jeopardizing their standing as devout Catholics. Contrasting the family planning beliefs and practices of young Mexican women with those of older women (many of whom are the younger women's parents and in‐laws), in a rural town in which the religious regulation of everyday life is pervasive, reveals how a common set of religious teachings and principles can be used to guide two different generational strategies for fertility regulation. The ethnographic data presented here highlight the creativity with which people use religious frameworks to justify their behavior. Research exploring how religion—and culture more broadly—influences fertility and contraceptive use should give greater attention to the dynamic interplay between cultural beliefs and institutions, social context, and interpretive agency.</jats:p>",

In course of discussions, valid questions are raised with an intention to cover social, economic and also spatial aspects of city rebuilding. The book is divided into three parts. The first part covers world view on urban regeneration and discusses city rebuilding processes in United States, United Kingdom and Europe. It further discusses transportation system and urban form of cities with focus on new urban centers. Classic examples of efficient town planning decisions of new cities around London and also new towns developed in India post independence are covered. The second part focuses on drawing regeneration strategies for Allahabad, a historic city of India. An established centre of administration, education and culture, and once the capital of the province, Allahabad has been an integral part of our history. The city has contributed immensely towards the building of modern day India. University of Allahabad, also known as the ‘Oxford of the East’, imparted quality higher education. The third part suggests various regeneration strategies for Allahabad and also for other similar historic cities in India. The regeneration strategies are based keeping in mind the educational and cultural aspect and also aims at strengthening the key historic nodes which are a vital part of our history and culture.</jats:p>",

Projections typically assume that this trend will continue until replacement level is reached. Recent evidence suggests, however, that ongoing fertility declines may have slowed or stalled in a number of countries in transition. This study examines the pace of fertility change in developing countries that have multiple Demographic and Health Surveys to determine whether ongoing transitions are decelerating or stalling. The main findings are that in sub‐Saharan African countries, the average pace of decline in fertility was lower around 2000 than in the mid‐1990s and that more than half the countries in transition in this region have stalled.</jats:p>",

Empirical evidence reveals that more diversified land use in neighborhoods, more extensive provision of public transit service, and decreasing accessibility to freeway interchanges were associated with fewer choices of driving alone, while making settlements compact via the urban growth boundary and transit-oriented developments has no clear relationship with reducing the choice to drive alone. Empirical analyses also suggest that provision of public transit service and mixed land use implemented at residential zones (origins) were more effective in reducing automobile dependence than those implemented at places of work (destinations). </jats:p>",

The article examines Australian Indigenous participation in a national environmental management program— the Natural Heritage Trust. This program emphasizes regionally scaled implementation and community engagement and ownership. The management of Indigenous lands is of increasing importance in Australia because of the size of this estate, its environmental value, and its role in Indigenous community and economic development. Programmatic efforts to assist Indigenous landowners manage their lands have been largely unsuccessful. This research is concerned with understanding whether regionally scaled, civic approaches to environmental management enable improved levels of Indigenous participation. Results show that this regional environmental management program achieved poor levels of Indigenous participation. This finding, the authors suggest, has important implications for the optimistic claims made about regional environmental management. </jats:p>",

No official data on the abortion rate in Iran have been collected, however. This study uses the 2000 Iran Demographic and Health Survey to estimate the abortion rate for the country as a whole and for specific regions, and to explore the role of contraceptive use and religiosity in explaining regional variations in abortion rates. We estimate the total abortion rate for the country to be 0.26 abortions per married woman, and the annual general abortion rate to be 7.5 abortions per 1,000 married women aged 15–49. We find that the negative effect of modern contraceptive use on the abortion rate is 31 percent greater than the negative effect of religiosity, and we highlight the implications of these findings for policies on reproductive health and family planning.</jats:p>",

The authors find that although this active, learner-centered method helps enable flexible, self-directed study for those learning new content, there is a strong need for leadership in heterogeneous learning networks to help participants overcome problems created by social position and structuration within the network. New knowledge formation within learning networks ultimately challenges some of the planning profession's fundamental assumptions about the validity of “moving knowledge into practice” in contexts with uncertainty. </jats:p>",

This study tested the validity of a proposed 3‐factor structure of the measurement model of intention, action planning, and coping planning and for its invariance across gender. A survey was conducted in three Norwegian counties, and 1,509 out of 8,000 randomly selected individuals completed questionnaires assessing the constructs of action planning and coping planning related to daily flossing. A random subsample of 500 participants was followed up at 4 wk with a telephone interview to assess flossing. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the proposed 3‐factor model after respecification. Although the chi‐square test was statistically significant [χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 58.501, degrees of freedom (d.f.) = 17), complementary fit indices were satisfactory [goodness‐of‐fit index (GFI) = 0.99, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.04]. Multigroup CFA provided evidence of complete invariance of the measurement model across gender. After controlling for previous flossing, intention (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic> = 0.08) and action planning (<jats:italic>β</jats:italic> = 0.11) emerged as independent predictors of subsequent flossing, accounting for 2.3% of its variance. Factorial validity of intention, action planning and coping planning, and the validity of action planning in predicting flossing prospectively, was confirmed by the present study.</jats:p>",

Planning has occurred throughout the history of early cities, but it was not until the early twentieth century that city planning emerged as a distinct discipline. Like the early urban sociologists, early planners sought to address the physical and social problems that had arisen in the rapidly growing industrial cities. By the mid‐1950s, city planning had become a discipline that focused primarily on land‐use planning (Hall 1996). Today planners often take a more holistic approach, combining land use, transportation, and financial dimensions. Most city governments house a planning board or agency. Still, the emphasis of planning is primarily the physical structure of the city and the task of balancing social concerns and economic realities often falls on city and regional governments.</jats:p>"

This study presents the findings from a survey of all medium to large cities carried out in April 2006. The findings indicate that, instead of adopting sustainable development as a development framework, cities are adopting sustainability initiatives in a piecemeal, ad-hoc manner. A broader level commitment to the concept, as evidenced by presence of sustainability plans, indicators project measuring progress toward sustainability goals, or an office and staff devoted to sustainability activities, is exhibited by very few cities. Finally, there is little evidence that cities are connecting sustainability to equity and social justice issues. </jats:p>",

It examines how the spatial concentration of office uses and their combination with other land uses affects the assessed value of office properties. The goal is to measure the spatial clustering of office uses and the clusters' physical characteristics to quantify their association with office property values. The characteristics of interest include cluster size, regional location and relationship to transportation infrastructure, internal land use mix, and transportation network. The study revealed that recent office development has continued to benefit economically from agglomeration. Office property values seemed to be most positively affected by, in order of importance, the intensity of office development, a central regional location, and the clustering or agglomeration of office parcels. </jats:p>",

For ones, the revival of strategic planning offers hopes for a third way between comprehensive and incremental planning. For others strategic planning is actually a fuzzy concept and rather “old wine in new bottles”. The main aim of the paper is to construct a new model of strategic urban and regional planning and to prove this by empirical analysis of approaches and problems in application. Therefore the first part of the paper tries a positioning of strategic planning within theoretical discourses: some definitions from international planning theories are presented, and differences between incremental and comprehensive planning models are pointed out. Part 2 provides a normative model of strategic planning with main elements: how should strategic planning be to fulfil different demands? Part 3 describes contexts, approaches and some experiences of the application of strategic visions and projects in the management of spatial changes of cities and regions in decline. Finally in part 4, the model of strategic urban and regional planning will be reflected in a critical way.</jats:p>"

Among those others than husbands who were identified, mothers‐in‐law were the most frequently mentioned, followed by the respondents' mothers and sisters‐in‐law. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders in determining whether each of the three measures of intimate partner violence (physical violence, sexual violence, and controlling behaviors) was significantly associated with having an increased risk of experiencing interference, as were several sociodemographic variables: nonconsanguineous marriage, residence with in‐laws, and rural residence.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Expanding oil development and global transportation of oil has greatly increased the potential for impact on wildlife. This paper will focus on key elements for developing a wildlife response plan as an integral part of an overall spill response plan and will delineate how a well planned and organized wildlife response can be cost effective, can substantially increase the likelihood of saving animals, and can increase regional response capacity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A Wildlife Response Plan as an integral component of an overall spill plan includes professional oiled wildlife responders; current and effective oiled wildlife protocols; knowledge and understanding of standard oil spill response plans, wildlife risk assessments, background information on both the geographic area the plan covers and baseline data on wildlife in the area; and promotes a clear strategy with realistic goals for wildlife response. Just as with an overall spill response plan, a wildlife plan must incorporate safety as an overarching theme and have an action plan including notification systems and action cards showing an overview of each positions responsibilities and decision-making keys.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The incorporation of the wildlife response team under the Incident Management (whether an Incident Command System is being used or some other management structure) is critical to the success of any wildlife response because it increases information and resources available to the wildlife group and provides for increased communications between the management team and the wildlife group. In addition, pre-planning for an animal event allows for equipment and other resource procurement prior to spill time. Having a plan that calls for activation and integration of a professional, trained and experienced animal care team into response objectives and activities provides for the care of impacted animals and allows for the most efficient and effective response without the duplication of effort and wasted resources. A professional animal management team with experience in triage and emergency management can make time critical decisions which will allow for the best care for the most animals, thus limiting net wildlife impacts from a spill.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Once a wildlife response plan is developed, training to the plan and participating in regular exercises is critical to the success of the plan, just as with all other areas of spill response specialization. Pre-planning for oiled wildlife response - including the use of knowledgeable and trained professionals - greatly increases the likelihood of success of this increasingly visible aspect of oil spill response.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Outside of the United States and a few other countries, oiled wildlife has historically not been included as part of spill response for many reasons. Some of those reasons include financial constraints, lack of experienced and trained personnel, and relative unlikelihood of success. In the past, with little pre-planning, few resources for oiled wildlife response, and no clear mandate to respond, oiled wildlife have ended up being at the mercy of well-meaning but often misguided attempts by volunteers and others to treat them. Too often, these efforts have resulted in failure and, ultimately, merely prolonged the suffering of the impacted animals. As with any part of spill response operations, wildlife response can only be successful when properly planned for and resourced.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In recent years, it has become evident that with strong preplanning, trained personnel, equipment and other resources, oiled wildlife response can be successful, cost effective, and can pave the way for saving world populations of threatened or endangered animals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Today, there are excellent examples of oiled wildlife response plans which are integral components of overall oil spill plans and include wildlife risk assessments, management structures, access to trained personnel and equipment stockpiles, as well as familiarity with current and effective protocols for treating animals. These plans are dynamic and integrated into the safety and work culture of the plan holders and allow for on-going training of personnel to the plan. Additionally, a strong wildlife response plan will provide for pro-active and immediate action with regard to oiled wildlife which results in greatly increased overall spill response success.</jats:p>",

Once a fully contagious virus emerges, its global spread is inevitable. During the last century Spanish Flu took 6 months to go around the globe since most international travel at the time was via ship. Today, with the speed and volume of international air travel, the virus could spread in as little as 3 months. The potential loss of life is conservatively estimated at 2 million to 7.4 million deaths globally, and hospitalisation cases at 8.1 million. The predicted high rates of illness and worker absenteeism will contribute to social and economic disruption. Organisations, including oil spill response entities, need to develop response strategies and create plans in advance of the problem.</jats:p>",

We discover novel problem fragments for which such optimization is tractable, and identify certain conditions that differentiate between tractable and intractable problems. These results are based on exploiting both structural and syntactic characteristics of planning problems. Specifically, following Brafman and Domshlak (2003), we relate the complexity of planning and the topology of the causal graph. The main results correspond to tractability of cost-optimal planning for propositional problems with polytree causal graphs that either have O(1)-bounded in-degree, or are induced by actions having at most one prevail condition each. Almost all our tractability results are based on a constructive proof technique that connects between certain tools from planning and tractable constraint optimization, and we believe this technique is of interest on its own due to a clear evidence for its robustness.</jats:p>"

Distributed gradient consists of multiple stochastic search algorithms that start from different points in the solutions space and interact with each other while moving toward the goal position. Swarm intelligence theory is a derivative-free approach to the problem of multi-robot cooperation which works by searching iteratively in regions defined by each robot's best previous move and the best previous move of its neighbors. The performance of both approaches is evaluated through simulation tests.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surgical repair of the mitral valve results in better outcomes than valve replacement, yet diseased valves are often replaced due to the technical difficulty of the repair process. A surgical planning system based on patient-specific medical images that allows surgeons to simulate and compare potential repair strategies could greatly improve surgical outcomes. The system must simulate valve closure quickly and handle the complex boundary conditions imposed by the chords that tether the valve leaflets. We have developed a process for generating a triangulated mesh of the valve surface from volumetric image data of the opened valve. The closed position of the mesh is then computed using a mass-spring model of dynamics. In the mass-spring model, triangle sides are treated as linear springs supporting only tension. Chords are also treated as linear springs, and self-collisions are detected and handled inelastically. The equations of motion are solved using implicit numerical integration. The simulated closed state is compared with an image of the same valve taken in the closed state to assess accuracy of the model. The model exhibits rapid valve closure and is able to predict the closed state of the valve with reasonable accuracy.</jats:p>",

To accomplish this requirement, the Ministry of Environment (MMA) opened a public hearing process to collect comments and suggestions for changes. One main contributor in this hearing process was the Brazilian Petroleum and Gas Institute (IBP), which represents the oil and gas industry. IBP created an internal workgroup which discussed proposals for changes in CONAMA Resolution 293 that were subsequently sent to MMA.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>After the public hearing process, MMA invited a number of institutions to join a workgroup to discuss the received comments and proposed changes. In general, these institutions were mostly the same which participated in the CONAMA Resolution 293 workgroup five years before: IBAMA (federal environmental agency), Maritime Authority, Ministry of Transportation, Ministry of Mines and Energy, AN? (oil &amp; gas activities regulatory agency), IBP and some state environmental agencies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Proposed changes to CONAMA Resolution 293 were sent from the workgroup to one of the CONAMA technical chambers, which approved the proposal with minor amendments. The aim of this paper is to present and discuss the relevant changes in this regulation that will affect facility oil spill response plans in Brazil.</jats:p>",

Generalized noise and land use planning guidelines are no longer sufficient. Specific attention must be given to the development of guidelines and policies that address \"smart growth\" in and around urban and suburban transportation corridors, residential and agricultural interactions, mixed-use developments, industrial-to-residential conversions (e.g., the gentrification of traditionally industrial areas like ports). A new soundscape vocabulary must be introduced to describe the acoustical environments in these settings to facilitate other goals in land use planning. Examples are presented of specific communities where planning goals and traditional noise and land use compatibility guidelines were in conflict and how these were resolved.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the project is to restore portions of the wetland ecosystem of the Bolsa Chica lowlands. The project area covers about 1,247 acres and will restore tidal influence from the Pacific Ocean to about half of this area to reinvigorate the wetland ecosystem. To achieve the biological benefits of tidal restoration, a direct connection to the Pacific Ocean was reestablished through the creation of a new tidal inlet that cuts through Bolsa Chica State Beach and under the Pacific Coast Highway near the Huntington Mesa. Construction began in October, 2004 and was completed in 2006, and minimizes impacts to fish and wildlife resources, coastal traffic, and beach recreation. The challenges for the oil production company include planning for a significant change in operations. Portions of the field were abandoned to construct the tidal basin. Continued surrounding operations of the oil field required preemptive spill response planning and preparation to ensure operational integrity at a high level. A Tactical Response Manual was developed in response to the changing conditions at the facility. This paper details the pre-planning for response to an active project. Unlike many spill response planning efforts, real time conditions could not be monitored to provide accurate information critical to developing the plan. In this case planning was required before the construction of the tidal basin was completed. The paper also details lessons learned from the process and evolving tactical response strategies based on changing conditions at the site.</jats:p>",

Coastal communities are especially vulnerable and those that have been hit by large spills, like in the Philippines, have borne the brunt of its force to its livelihood, resources and habitat. And most often than not, especially in remote areas, they are at the frontlines of combating the spill, whether it be clean up or other response strategies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The problem is that local communities are rarely formally integrated into the response planning framework such as in oil spill contingency plans. With more than half the world'S population living along or near the coastline, this is a valuable human resource that is untapped.

Combine multiple downed and damaged production platforms with the need to intervene and secure production, and the risk of an oil release is increased.

Both shoreline and economically sensitive areas are within 12 miles or less of the downed production platforms.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To accomplish the no impact goal, a three phased approach was used to create a supplemental response capability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Phase 1: A risk matrix was created to address the multiple potential sources and impacts while evaluating the potential for environmental and economic impact.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Phase 2: Utilizing the existing response plan, which met or exceeded regulatory compliance, evaluated the effective ability to respond to the potential risk in the varied prevailing weather conditions and provide the best opportunity for preventing impact to environmental and economic priorities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Phase 3: Developed a fiscally responsible plan to address the short-comings of the existing plan and secured resources based on the evaluation that would provide the best opportunity to meet the BP goals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper will provide a discussion of the technical processes used during each phase and present practical means for assessing multiple risks and scenarios.

Mix-resolution Br-SDM consists of two separate Br-SDM of different resolutions: a high-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with more samples to capture the detail deforming variations in the main deforming regions of interest, together with a low-resolution Br-SDM which is trained with a smaller number of samples to capture the major variations of the remaining facial points. The experiments have shown that the mix-resolution Br-SDM is able to significantly reduce the predicting error compared with the corresponding Finite Element Model, while giving a low computational cost which is characteristic of the SDM approach.</jats:p>",

This paper describes a new method for kinematic 3D enveloping grasp planning. A new idea for grading the 3D grasp search domain for a given object is proposed. The grading method analyzes the curvature pattern and effective diameter of the object, and grades object regions according to their suitability for grasping. A new approach is also proposed for modeling the fingers of the dexterous hand. The grasp planning method is demonstrated for a three-fingered, six degrees-of-freedom, dexterous hand and several 3D objects containing both convex and concave surface patches. Human-like high-quality grasps are generated in less than 20 s per object.</jats:p>",

This is the received view. But what exactly are emotion and will? True to its title, this article begins by providing a firm grounding on emotions. Next, it considers conscious will: Is it a force or a feeling or is it an illusion? Moving on, this article briefly examines the complex concept of consciousness and its role in decision making from the Euro-American and the East Indian perspectives. Is there a little man, a homunculus, who makes decisions? It then considers an existing theory of planning as a cognitive process. The context for discussion is provided by a case history of an entrepreneur. It examines and highlights the infusion of emotional determinants at each step of the decision-making process. The final section of this article describes tests of executive functions that are biased towards analytic or synthetic aspects of planning. </jats:p>",

However, it appears that input-output tables have not been instructed and regularly impeded and expanded as part of the planning scenarios that have been gen-erated on the contested demand, which is to assume constant energy intensity in future years. The basis for projecting energy demand in the industrial sector is to estimate the likely changes in energy consumption intensity and the ratio of ener-gy consumption to value added. It is considered expedient and pragmatic to use a scenario for con-structing an optimal level forecast, projecting a desirable energy equilibrium pattern for the year 2010.</jats:p>"

Through an initial scoping process, the Trustees determined that more information was needed to select the most appropriate locations and techniques to implement the large scale oyster restoration project. The Trustees identified 3 general locations with potential for larger scale oyster reef creation. A portion of settlement funding was used to contract for construction and monitoring of an oyster reef pilot project to examine the efficacy of oyster reef construction at the three locations using 4 different cultch materials. At each of the locations, 4 small reefs (approximately 75’ × 20’) were constructed and monitored for spat set, oyster survival and growth as well as subsidence. A baseline construction report and final monitoring report detailed the results. In addition, a separate report was completed that outlined the feasibility of constructing a 4 acre oyster reef in Hillsborough Bay, FL. This report included several construction considerations such as local sources and costs of cultch materials, shipping/transport, staging areas, construction equipment as well as potential local contractors.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reports the results of the oyster pilot project and feasibility report as well as lessons learned from each approach.</jats:p>",

At a minimum, the agency must publish a notice explaining the proposed rule, request comments, and state the basis and purpose of the final action. This paper provides examples of instances where an agency has revised the rule as a result of comments received or has otherwise been responsive to the commenter'S argument. For example, with regard to oil pollution planning and preparedness policy, commenters on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency'S proposed revisions to the Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan rule raised the idea of a minimum container size for applicability of the SPCC rule and EPA included such a minimum for the first time in the final rule, thus reducing the burden of the rule for many facilities. Federal agencies are required to request public comments on the issues presented in their proposed rules to enable the agencies to evaluate the new or revised provisions. With agencies now accepting electronic comments through web sites, regulated parties can easily participate in this process. As this paper shows, many agencies that regulate oil pollution planning and preparedness are very responsive to suggestions, and members of the regulated community have an opportunity to influence public policy decisions in this area.</jats:p>",

First, the manipulator is introduced and its inverse displacement problem discussed.

Thereafter, the dexterous workspace is geometrically obtained and compared with the non-redundant 3-<jats:underline>P</jats:underline>RR planar parallel manipulator. Finally, based on a geometrical measure of proximity to singular configurations and the condition number of the manipulators' Jacobian matrices, actuation schemes for the manipulators are obtained. Different actuation schemes for a given path are obtained and the quality of their actuation schemes are compared. It is shown that the proposed manipulator is capable of following a path while avoiding the singularities.</jats:p>",

Scenario planning helps organizations to increase their capacity to learn and adapt as the future unfolds and results in strategies that more effectively help organizations prepare for an uncertain future. Because organizations are complex, multilevel systems, scenario planners must also focus the complexities of learning across multiple levels of analysis. Fostering the learning processes that support effective implementation of strategy across multiple levels of analysis requires attention to the elements and relationships that drive learning from one level to the next. Few strategies for learning fully articulate and integrate the characteristics of learning at different levels of analysis.This article identifies key elements and relationships constituting learning at multiple levels of analysis—individual, group, organization, and industry—and provides an integrated view of multilevel learning in organizational settings to guide and support strategic planning and implementation. </jats:p>",

Some 13,000 to 14,000 vessels with all types of cargo use it every year. In fact, commercial transportation activities through the Canal represent approximately 5% of the world trade. This waterway is managed by the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) and, consistent with sound emergency preparedness actions, the ACP has developed a comprehensive contingency plan to provide the organization with a response system to minimize the consequences of adverse scenarios. The plan includes operational, strategic, and information toolbox components. It also uses the Incident Command System (ICS) and the Planning “P” model as a methodology to conduct a proactive response. The ICS allows responders to be organized with a common terminology, with clear hierarchy and functions, and with a modular and flexible structure. In this way, it adjusts to the needs of an incident, instead of trying to adjust the incident or responders to the normal structures of their agencies. The Planning “P” aids the process for the ICS to manage the incident by objectives and to elaborate concrete actions to mitigate all aspects of an incident, not just tactical matters. During the planning process, the need to increase oil spill response capabilities was recognized. Consequently, the ACP presented to its customers a program known as the Panama Canal Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plan (PCSOPEP) that went into effect on January 1, 2005, after ample consultation and modifications with the international maritime community. The successful implementation of the PCSOPEP involved several stages. The Regulation on Navigation in Panama Canal Waters was updated, establishing the responsibility of vessels during spills, the presentation of an oil spill plan specific for the Canal as a transit requirement, the application of tariffs to cover the costs of maintaining equipment and training, and the designation of the ACP as the sole oil spill removal organization in Canal waters. The implementation of these policies also involved the development of strategies, outlining investment projects, and increasing the baseline number of employees with training in oil spill response. Initially, response strategies focused on mechanical recovery, but the program considered the evaluation and incorporation of alternative countermeasures as response protocols at the level of a national contingency plan.</jats:p>",

The ways that airport neighbors challenge noise maps reflect the critical cartography literature, which does not take the truth of maps for granted but instead considers the political and other subjectivities behind their construction. At the same time, work in science and technology studies shows that conflicts between local residents and state officials and/or scientists are in part based on their different types of knowledge about a place, with state-centered scientific knowledge generally considered to override local knowledges. This paper brings together these two literatures in an analysis of conflicts over airport noise at Minneapolis–St Paul International Airport to show how members of the public construct their own critical cartographies. </jats:p>",

Methodological examination of intervention validity has become more important as intervention methodologies have become part of federal legislation. However, current practice and federal guidelines often implicitly portray a dichotomy between individualized norm-referenced testing and intervention methodologies. This dichotomy is reified in the literature for various reasons. Consequently, it is not clear how information from individualized norm-referenced measures can be used within a treatment or intervention context. This article briefly addresses the perceived dichotomy between traditional psychoeducational assessment and behaviorally oriented assessments and discusses the importance of a multidimensional view of intervention that integrates multiple sources of information to guide intervention planning, implementation, and monitoring. Some practical applications of a hypothesis-testing model that integrates multiple sources of data with intervention-focused practices are used to integrate various assessment strategies for intervention purposes. </jats:p>",

Therefore, in this report, a numerical technique is presented to plan a singularity-free trajectory of the PPM for minimum actuating effort and reactions. By using the parametric trajectory representation, the singularity-free trajectory planning problem can be cast to the determination of undetermined control points, after which a particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to find the optimal control points. This algorithm ensures that the obtained trajectories can avoid singular points within the workspace and that the PPM has the minimum actuating effort and reactions. Simulations and discussions are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

The impacts are more significant if the oil reaches the coast and contaminates the shoreline. An oil spill contingency plan (OSCP), which prescribes the actions to be performed under emergency conditions, can greatly reduce the damage to the environment and the disruption in human economic activities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>However, due to the lack of resources, countries in Asia do not always have developed and up to date OSCPs. This paper proposes the use of pre-impact site assessment (PISA) as a strategy to overcome some of the problems arising from such a situation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Combined with a stochastic and trajectory modeling which are used to predict the locations that are likely to be oiled, the pre-impact site assessment allows the collection of essential information, such as shoreline profile, site accessibility and sensitive resources, within a short period of time to aid the decision making for response planning. This rationale approach can be very useful during salvage operations when there is a risk of having the casualty spilling more oil, or for sunken ships with oil onboard. Oil Spill Response and East Asia Response Limited (OSRL/EARL) has been engaged to conduct PISA in a few incidents of the above condition. These incidents showed that a very quick action was required in order to greatly influence the outcome of the response.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors will share the operational experience and the lessons learnt from the few recent case studies mentioned above to demonstrate the significance of this methodology for emergency oil spill response planning.</jats:p>",

Spatial decay (expressed through rate of spatial decay per doubling of distance, DL2) is preferred to temporal decay (expressed through reverberation time, RT). The complexity of open plan office acoustic design results from the fundamental contradiction of communication and concentration. DL2 reflects better the challenges of sound control in such rooms, which is basically sound propagation control. Beyond, this contradiction, specific space analysis models and tools can help to visualize the acoustic interactions between workstations, teams and departments accommodated in the same room. These models are now ready to be included in standardization work. International technical standard for field measurements of DL2 integrates new descriptive models for open plan office acoustics, taking into account geometric proportions, presence of screens and furniture as well as group behaviour and speech characteristics, such as increased energy contents at low frequencies, voice levels, raised hearing sensitivity at high frequencies. Also, normative guidelines from Netherlands and France integrating this approach will be presented.</jats:p>",

This method is applicable to a group of tasks, commonly known as push–pull tasks, in which a redundant mobile manipulator subject to non-holonomic constraints moves slowly while exerting a set of forces against the environment. In practice, this occurs when the manipulator is pulling against an object such as when opening a door or unearthing a buried object. Torque is computed in a quasi-static manner, mainly taking into consideration the effect of multiple external forces while neglecting dynamic effects. The formulation incorporates a criterion for optimizing a starting configuration, and special considerations are made to account for non-holonomic constraints. The application to an existing mobile manipulator is described.</jats:p>",

In particular, the possible tensions between pressures for transformation and the potential obduracy of social, cultural, and institutional interrelationships are highlighted by reflection on the broad body of work termed the ‘new regionalism’. Four issues are raised and then are integrated to develop an approach to researching the tensions between pressures for transformation and the obduracy of old industrial regions. The paper examines a case study of the early stages of a particular technologically informed innovation—a hydrogen economy development—in an old industrial ‘region’: Teesside in northeast England.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The current guidelines, ICH E14, for the evaluation of non‐antiarrhythmic compounds require a ‘thorough’ QT study (TQT) conducted during clinical development (ICH Guidance for Industry E14, 2005). Owing to the regulatory choice of margin (10 ms), the TQT studies must be conducted to rigorous standards to ensure that variability is minimized. Some of the key sources of variation can be controlled by use of randomization, crossover design, standardization of electrocardiogram (ECG) recording conditions and collection of replicate ECGs at each time point. However, one of the key factors in these studies is the baseline measurement, which if not controlled and consistent across studies could lead to significant misinterpretation. In this article, we examine three types of baseline methods widely used in the TQT studies to derive a change from baseline in QTc (time‐matched, time‐averaged and pre‐dose‐averaged baseline). We discuss the impact of the baseline values on the guidance‐recommended ‘largest time‐matched’ analyses. Using simulation we have shown the impact of these baseline approaches on the type I error and power for both crossover and parallel group designs. In this article, we show that the power of study decreases as the number of time points tested in TQT study increases. A time‐matched baseline method is recommended by several authors (Drug Saf. 2005; 28(2):115–125, Health Canada guidance document: guide for the analysis and review of QT/QTc interval data, 2006) due to the existence of the circadian rhythm in QT. However, the impact of the time‐matched baseline method on statistical inference and sample size should be considered carefully during the design of TQT study. The time‐averaged baseline had the highest power in comparison with other baseline approaches. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the processes of fiscal decentralization may contribute to a more balanced distribution of resources across space, making up for the central government's loss of redistributive power. In fact, this result is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables in the analysis, and to the choice of the measure used to quantify the degree of dispersion in the spatial distribution of per capita income. </jats:p>",

In this paper ATM is applied in retail modeling using choice data in a novel way. The approach permits flexibility with regard to model assumptions about flow constraints; that is, the model is neither attraction constrained nor production constrained. Data aggregated to the census ‘block-group’ scale, with network-based travel distances, have been examined to estimate model parameters by pairwise comparisons and ordinary least squares. The expenditure flow is related to the store properties (attractiveness, relative accessibility) and the spatial separation between origins and destinations. Based on our empirical estimate of a key parameter, and assuming that sales increase at a decreasing rate with respect to store size, we deduce that accessibility is inversely related to store size. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>QinetiQ North America, Technology Solutions Group (QNA) and Wyle Laboratories have integrated two mature, proprietary technologies into a prototype Acoustic Footprint Mission Planning System. Wyle's Noise Model Simulation (NMSim) uses validated linear noise propagation routines in combination with ray-tracing algorithms based on weather data provided by QNA's Precision Airdrop System (WindPADS) to predict the time history of spectral noise levels from a flying aircraft at any number of user-defined receptor locations. Through interpolation over a ground-based receptor grid, the impact of noise propagated through a stratified atmosphere may be quantified in terms of audibility at any point inside the acoustic footprint. Weather data for the NMSim ray-tracing routines is extracted from the WindPADS three-dimensional forecast of wind, pressure, temperature and humidity in the atmosphere as a function of time. The three-dimensional field is the result of physical and dynamic assimilation of forecast and measured atmospheric data, with wind-forcing by the underlying terrain. This paper describes the results of a validation test performed at Yuma Proving Ground, AZ. It is shown that the noise propagation model predictions agree satisfactorily with the measurements of a C-130 cargo plane. [Work supported by Natick Soldier Center.]</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyse the impact of density on labour markets when firms and workers are heterogeneous. Using the results of a survey carried out in the French Midi-Pyrénées region, we show that, for comparable sizes and sectors, recruiting firms in low-density areas experience more difficulties in finding workers meeting the requirements of the jobs, especially since being usually located far away from large urban agglomerations, they appear to hold little attractiveness for potential migrants. As a consequence, they recruit less and the competition between firms on the local labour market is reduced. This, in turn, contributes to lessen the hiring difficulties for firms that do post vacancies in low-density areas. The labour market density therefore has opposite effects on the causes of hiring difficulties, but we show that its overall impact on the frequency of those difficulties for firms which hire is negative. Finally, because they are less likely to find a better match than their current job, employees living in low-density local labour markets have a lower tendency to resign than other workers do. As a consequence, turnover increases density. </jats:p>",

Drawing on poststructuralist feminist theory we examine some of the ways in which New Zealand dolphin tour operators and others represent dolphins in relation to sex and gender. Three sets of data inform this research: (1) promotional materials, such as postcards, brochures, Internet websites, and advertising; (2) participant-observation on dolphin swim tours; and (3) interviews with tour operators. We argue that dolphins are constructed paradoxically as sexually polyamorous and promiscuous—sexy beasts— and as loving and maternal—devoted mums. These seemingly contradictory narratives about dolphins and nature perform different functions. The discourse of dolphins as sexy beasts can be read as an attempt by tour operators to use sex to enhance the quality of a product. Tourists are offered an opportunity to experience ‘wild nature’ as sexualized ‘other’. The discourse of dolphins as devoted mums can be read as an attempt by tour operators to anthropomorphize dolphins and offers tourists an opportunity to experience ‘domestic nature’. Fostering a connection between humans and dolphins helps to highlight the need for environmental protection to ensure the continuation of the species and ‘tourist dollars’. </jats:p>",

A CERA workshop is a spill drill in which participants, especially resource trustees, learn and practice a risk-based method for assessing the relative benefits and impacts of alternative response actions, including no response, open water cleanup, dispersion, in situ burning, and shoreline cleanup. Most CERAs have been sponsored by the US Coast Guard and all have been co-facilitated by ERD.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since 1998, 15 regional CERA workshops and four national spill drills have involved more than 700 people from about two dozen nations. While anecdotal information indicates that the workshops have prompted some changes in spill response and response planning, ERD'S research project is the first directed effort to systematically investigate the nature and extent of these changes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>ERD'S inquiry is designed to answer three questions: (1) What has been the importance of the ERA process to people who have participated in them? (2) What has been the impact of the CERA process on spill response and spill response planning in the US? (3) How can the CERA workshop format be improved? ERD'S evaluation process relies on two primary methods widely used by social scientists: (1) surveys and unstructured interviews of CERA participants, and (2) qualitative analysis of participant comments and recommendations captured during past workshops.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Initial results of ERD'S research will be reported</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although there has been rapid recent growth in the volume of research on both whiteness and childhood within geography, these literatures have only infrequently intersected explicitly. In this paper, I argue that a focus on narratives of childhood and child rearing can significantly enrich current understandings of how imaginative geographies of American (non)whiteness are sustained and reproduced. I develop this argument using a case study of recent narratives concerning one well-known program for children living in New York City, the Fresh Air Fund, which arranges for ‘inner-city’ children (most of whom identify as black or Latino) to spend portions of their summers living with host families (most of whom are white) in rural and suburban areas. The activities of the fund generate regular media coverage in both New York City and many of the destination communities, contributing to a wider public narrative concerning what white families and spaces have to offer ‘inner-city’ children. Drawing on journalistic accounts produced over the past two decades within one important destination site for the program, the US state of Vermont, I examine the racialized imaginative geographies of city, country, and suburb mobilized and reproduced within these stories of the Fund and its effects. I specifically argue that these accounts (re)script whiteness such that it becomes a solution to, rather than a source of, inequalities. </jats:p>",

The implied link between scenario planning and the development of leadership capability must first be described, understood, and substantiated before it can be assumed to be of strategic utility to organizations and fields of practice. This article presents the outcomes of an exploratory inquiry into the association between scenario planning and leadership. Initial discoveries suggest that the development of leadership capability and capacity are reasonable expected outcomes of scenario planning and tentatively positions scenario planning as a strategic tool in human resource development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is increasing political concern over the issue of empty dwellings in England. Not only are they perceived as a waste of valuable housing resources—at a time when housing demand greatly exceeds supply—but they are associated with social and environmental problems in the neighbourhoods in which they are situated. This concern has culminated in the enactment of the Housing Act 2004 which allows local authorities to force empty dwellings into use as a way of addressing housing need. But although there are national estimates for the number of empty dwellings in England there is a lack of systematically published data on empty homes at the subdistrict level. This paper describes a method of obtaining detailed information about empty dwellings that makes use of council-tax records. A case study for Leeds was undertaken and the results are reported and compared with residential vacancy statistics that are currently available. The results show that this data source is capable of producing statistical information on vacancy at various geographical scales and revealing the nature of empty dwellings at the local level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The population of many regions in rural areas declines as mainly young adults leave. Simultaneously, only few people move into these areas if processes like suburbanisation do not play a substantial role. In this situation, young adults must be regarded as a crucial group for the future of any region. Demographic, economic, and societal prosperity depends on them to a large extent. At the same time, school graduates are increasingly forced to be more and more mobile by changing and more volatile labour markets. The article focuses on the motivations of graduates while making their decisions to leave their home district or to stay. Based on this analysis, it asks which political instruments are appropriate in these regions beyond ‘commuter-belts’. Considering the local context, the authorities have to combine policies and instruments including family policy, regional marketing and educational aspects. The empirical findings are based on a case study in the Haßberge district in Northern Bavaria.</jats:p>"

TNO is developing a decision support system for noise mitigating measures. The proof of concept of such a system for road noise is presented here. On the basis of a detailed noise map, for each road segment an indication is given for the amount of negative effect (e.g., number of people being highly annoyed) per meter it is causing. On the basis of the characteristics of the road segment, the system suggests possible noise mitigation measures. The effect of the measure chosen by the user, such as the application of silent road surface types or lowering speed limits, can be interactively explored with the system. It directly shows the updated detailed noise contour maps as well as indicators describing the impact after a measure has been applied though the interactive interface.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Noise action planning following the European Directive on Environmental Noise is for many cities a new, additional task. It will probably be not very successful when considered as mere duty separated from other urban policy areas. Today, noise does not rank high on the local political agenda. Human and financial resources provided for noise abatement tend to be low. Furthermore, looking at concrete noise abatement measures it becomes clear that most effective measures also impact on other policy areas (air quality, mobility, etc.). Therefore it is advisable to link noise action planning closely with other urban plans like development plans, mobility plans, clean air programmes, etc. This requires a strong involvement of the relevant stakeholders as well as knowledge about the potential impact of noise abatement measures on other policy areas. To support local authorities in this complex task the SILENCE project developed a guidebook which comprises recommendations on organisational settings, on the involvement of stakeholders and the public, the action planning process as well as on a range of noise abatement measures. The description of these measures refers not only to their noise abatement potential but takes also into account their - positive or negative - impact on other policy areas.</jats:p>",

The adaptable protocol includes technology and cost assessment of feasible (pre-screened) nutrient removal technologies that are being successfully implemented at full scale. The information collected from the full scale nutrient removal plants to develop this protocol includes design, operational, performance, and cost data through a direct survey of plants, and published data. The protocol includes a “technology threshold” approach consisting of Tier I (TN &amp;lt; 5.0 mg/L; TP &amp;lt; 0.5 mg/L) and Tier II (TN &amp;lt; 3.0 mg/L; TP &amp;lt; 0.1 mg/L) effluent nutrient levels for different plant sizes.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Since 1992, the Canadian and U.S. Coast Guard, Province of British Columbia, State of Alaska, OSRO'S, and several other organizations and authorities have joined together in a unique annual exercise program held near Dixon Entrance, a remote waterway marking the U.S./Canadian border at the southern tip of the Alaskan panhandle. Following a continuous improvement philosophy, a growing number of participants from both nations have made great strides in improving preparedness and response at the trans-boundary. Conducted over a 4 day period, CANUSDIX is an innovative combination of spill scenarios, training workshops, equipment deployment, and coordinated multi-year planning. Unlike conventional exercises, CANUSDIX is a year-round program with continuous effort directed toward achieving goals outlined in a formal 2-year workplan. Multi-year efforts include communications and logistics planning and evaluation of web-based information sharing systems. Canadian and U.S. OSRO'S also conduct a periodic review of equipment inventories and jointly plan future capital purchases to ensure equipment compatibility and avoid redundancy. Coordinated planning and exercising by partner agencies is a necessity for Dixon Entrance, an extremely remote, environmentally sensitive, region with severe weather, limited infrastructure, and a sparse road system. Resource trustees on both sides of the border are also key participants, due to crucial subsistence fisheries and numerous historical resources such as culturally important archeological sites. Innovation is a hallmark of CANUSDIX. For example, logistics skills were robustly tested by the “logistics board game,” debuted at CANUSDIX 2003 in Prince Rupert, BC. Resembling sophisticated tabletop war games, the board game employs tokens representing different types of oil spill cleanup equipment and personnel. Tokens are deployed on a board based on a chart of the response area. The logistics game required players to confront realistic equipment mobilization time constraints, while simulating the uncertainties associated with all spill responses. Other significant milestones of CANUSDIX include publication of Geographic and Wildlife Response Guideline Annexes to the Canada-United States Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan, a landmark bi-lateral planning, preparedness and response agreement. Embracing innovation while fostering teamwork and continuous improvement, CANUSDIX is a modern, goal driven, exercise regime and a model for international cooperation.</jats:p>",

The question addressed here is to what extent neighbourhood characteristics (percentage of rented dwellings, low-income households, and ethnic minorities in the neighbourhood) influence different categories of residents to wish to leave their neighbourhood. The answer to this question can enhance our understanding of residential mobility and of the mechanisms causing segregation by income and ethnic groups. We use data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey, enriched with neighbourhood characteristics. Whether or not people wish to leave their neighbourhood is estimated using a multilevel logistic regression model with cross-level interaction effects between individual and neighbourhood characteristics. The main result shows that, with an increasing percentage of people from an ethnic minority in the neighbourhood, more people have the wish to leave the neighbourhood. However, this is to a lesser extent the case for members of ethnic minorities themselves. </jats:p>",

Analytical knowledge creation refers to the understanding and explaining of features of the (natural) world.

An online survey was advertised through a newsletter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Qualitative analyses yielded four areas of caregiver concern: health of the care recipient over time, ability of caregivers to sustain support, social support available for the care recipient, and financial burden of care. Despite these concerns, few caregivers reported completed plans for future caregiving. One fourth of the caregivers had made no plans, nor had they discussed future caregiving with others. Although most would prefer other relatives to assume care in the event they could not sustain support, these expectations may not be communicated openly. Generating discussion on this pertinent topic has implications for the aging society regarding how best to care for those with SMI and their caregivers. </jats:p>",

This paper reports the results of an inductive, empirical study of rostering practices in the UK National Health Service with a view to developing a shared understanding of roster planning processes and of what constitutes rostering effectiveness. A survey of rostering practices in 50 wards, followed by five in-depth, longitudinal case studies, revealed the complexity of rostering activities, and identified the main design parameters, which were used to specify rostering systems and to prepare periodic rosters. Rostering activities were perceived to directly impact upon service delivery, resource utilization and nurse retention. A number of poor rostering practices were identified, which could lead to dysfunctional behaviour. This analysis points to a clear managerial imperative to improve local competencies in roster planning and control, recognizing their strategic significance in contributing to hospital effectiveness. A ‘Strategic Roster Planning and Control (SRPC)’ model is proposed, which may provide a framework for evaluating rostering effectiveness, and a platform for the sharing of best practice, in order to stimulate organizational learning and achieve nationwide improvements in hospital performance. </jats:p>",

This paper summarizes the content of a larger report developed by an IOSC Workshop Subcommittee and refined during an IOSC Special Workshop: Assessment of Oil Spill Response Capabilities held on 3 December 2007 in Gamboa, Panama.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Each nation and industry sector has different interests and areas of knowledge with respect to spill response priorities and capabilities. As personnel change jobs, their knowledge departs with them. Consequently, expectations for response capability and the manner by which it should be attained can vary. Requirements for levels of response competency may change over time, may not be balanced by the risk of spills, and may not support long-term readiness to meet actual spill risks.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There have been few attempts in the spill response community to prepare generic checklists or comprehensive guides for the assessment of response capability. Most guidance is focused on the content of OSR contingency plans. The current IOSC effort aims to be as comprehensive and as detailed as possible encompassing an entire OSR system or program. The IOSC Workshop Subcommittee prepared a broad suite of planning and readiness assessment elements to encourage improved response capacity by aiding development and maintenance of response management systems from a site level to a multi-national level and to reach beyond OSR contingency planning. This approach turns the document into a powerful management tool for evaluating oil spill response capacity at different planning levels, from local, to regional, national and multi-national.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Government and industry representatives from Latin America and the Wider Caribbean Region met in Panama on 3 December 2007 to review and discuss the preliminary IOSC Guidelines. This paper and its companion report are intended to advance best international practice for OSR planning and readiness assessment. It is hoped that this IOSC Guide can be maintained as an evergreen tool by consistent use and feedback from within the spill response community.</jats:p>",

Using a land cover database with high uncertainty as input for emission inventory analyses can cause propagation of systematic and random errors. The objective of this study was to analyze how different land cover representations introduce systematic errors into the results of regional N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emission inventories. Surface areas of grassland, ditches, and ditch banks were estimated for two polders in the Dutch fen meadow landscape using five land cover representations: four commonly used databases and a detailed field map, which most closely resembles the real landscape. These estimated surface areas were scaled up to the Dutch western fen meadow landscape. Based on the estimated surface areas agricultural N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions were estimated using different inventory techniques. All four common databases overestimated the grassland area when compared to the field map. This caused a considerable overestimation of agricultural N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions, ranging from 9% for more detailed databases to 11% for the coarsest database. The effect of poor land cover representation was larger for an inventory method based on a process model than for inventory methods based on simple emission factors. Although the effect of errors in land cover representations may be small compared to the effect of uncertainties in emission factors, these effects are systematic (i.e., cause bias) and do not cancel out by spatial upscaling. Moreover, bias in land cover representations can be quantified or reduced by careful selection of the land cover database.</jats:p>",

Although research identifies factors that affect electoral participation, we still know little about how electors in a specific location respond to opportunities to vote for different kinds of local, national, and supranational institutions. This paper addresses this issue by analysing the relative rates of turnout at local, parliamentary, and European elections within three time periods for the London Borough of Brent. It uses turnout data for individual polling districts to investigate whether relative differences in turnout are sustained across time, whether polling districts perform consistently or not for different types of elections and whether variations in turnout are related to marginality. The results indicate that turnout at different types of elections is not stable even within tightly constrained time periods and that there are statistically significant differences in the relative rates of participation between polling districts. Geographically, the differences in relative rates of turnout appear to be spatially clustered, particularly with respect to local elections and this may reflect an increase in the concentration of party campaigning in marginal wards. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective: Dental professionals with proper training and integration into existing protocols for mobilization can be one additional re-source during catastrophic events. A pilot project on training of dental school faculty in telephone triage in the event of an avian flu pandemic is described. A partnership was established with a grant from the Department of Justice/Department of Homeland Security, between the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, and New York University to initiate a pilot program to increase the manpower resources available to the health agency should an overwhelming public health event be present in the New York City area.Methods: Eight faculties from New York University College of Dentistry were selected to receive telephone triage training consisting of 15 hours of formal presentations. This training was specifically designed to give participants a background in “outbreak investigations,” and included a mock influenza outbreak. Also, a “phone triaging” training during a surge event was practiced.Results: The training resulted in enabling alternative healthcare providers as capable personnel and one alternative source for a surge manpower pool. This was the innovative use of dental school faculty to bolster critically understaffed and overwhelmed areas in the NYCDOHMH infrastructure, such as call centers and for telephone triage, in their disaster scenarios, particularly in their response to avian flu.Conclusions: The established public health systems and medical community must understand the need to preplan for medical surge events and accept that a potential source of additional manpower could be the dental profession or other nontraditional healthcare personnel.</jats:p>"

The systems proposed in several researches have been able to plan the walking motions of a humanoid on an uneven terrain. In this paper, we aim to design a planning system that can generate various types of motions for a humanoid with a unified planning approach. Based on our previous work, we add two additional motion abilities: leaping and moving obstacles into the system. In previous work, the order of moving obstacles is determined first, and then the corresponding paths for the pushing/pulling motions are generated. In this work, we take a unified approach that accounts for all types of motions at the same time. We have implemented a planning system with this unified approach for a humanoid moving in a layered virtual environment. Several simulation examples are demonstrated in this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of the system.</jats:p>",
