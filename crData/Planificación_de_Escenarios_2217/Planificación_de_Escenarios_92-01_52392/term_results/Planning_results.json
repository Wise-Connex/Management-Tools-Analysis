The paper examines the course content, required readings, and class assignments for 67 Master's courses, 17 undergraduate courses, and 6 Ph.D. courses offered by 69 Amencan and Canadian universities during the 1989-90 academic year. Like the previous study, it reveals a remarkable diversity of views on the appropriate course content and required readings for a \"planning theory\" course. It also indicates that while many of the most widely used readings are extremely old, there is also an increased interest in planning history, professional ethics, and alternative perspectives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since planning is a normative activity one would expect public planning to be based on moral foundations. Unfortunately, post-WWII mainstream planning theory became divorced from ethical theory. Ironically, this cleavage reflected an erroneous shared premise‚Äîthat each discipline was technical in nature and should eschew value questions. This fallacious premise is now largely rejected. Contemporary planning theory fully recognizes the inherently normative nature of public planning processes. However, it still makes little use of normative ethical theory to illuminate the issues raised by this recognition. In this article we will present a spectrum of five normative ethical theories and show how these theories provide the underlying normative foundation for six theories of planning. Thus many debates about planning theories can be understood as debates about underlying normative ethical theories </jats:p>",

La nature fortement normative de la grammaire traditionelle est compar√©e au relativisme linguistique qui caract√©rise une grande partie des √©tudes sociolinguistiques r√©centes. Un compromis est consid√©r√© comme indispensable car la planification linguistique ne peut pas √™tre enti√®rement libre de jugements de valeurs. Le besoin d'une modernisation rapide dans les nations √©mergentes exige que le comportement linguistique ne soit pas laiss√© enti√®rement √† des forces naturelles. Les linguistes descriptivistes ont un r√¥le √† jouer dans ce processus √† condition qu'ils ne s'associent pas √† des projets gouvernementaux moralement r√©pr√©hensibles. Il est √† la fois possible et n√©cessaire d'atteindre un √©quilibre entre la promotion d'unit√©s √©conomiques viables et la pr√©servation de la diversit√© linguistique. En collaboration avec les chercheurs en sciences sociales et les autorit√©s gouvernementales, les linguistes sont les plus a m√™me de mener √† bien la t√¢che de planification linguistique.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingva priskribo, lingva preskribo kaj lingva planado\n\t\tLa a≈≠toro konsideras la sajnan paradokson malanta≈≠ la celoj de lingvistoj, kiuj penas influi, intence kaj sisteme, la lingvan konduton de komunumo, dume klopodante eviti akuzojn pri preskribismo. La artikolo komparas la normigan karakteron de tradicia gramatiko kun la lingva relativismo, kiu karakterizas multajn lastatempajn socilingvistikajn esplorojn, kaj taksas kom-promison neevitebla car lingvoplanado ne povas kaj ne devas esti sen valoroj. La bezono de rapida modernigo en evoluantaj nacioj postulas, ke oni ne lasu lingvan konduton pure kaj nure al naturaj fortoj. Priskribaj lingvistoj havas sian rolon en la procedo, kondice ke ili ne ligu sin al morale kondamnindaj registaraj projektoj. Oni devas trovi ekvilibron inter apogo de viv-kapablaj ekonomiaj unuoj kaj konservado de lingva diverseco. Kunlabore kun socisciencistoj kaj registaraj instancoj, lingvistoj estas unike kvalifikitaj al sukcesa plenumado de la lingvo-plana tasko.</jats:p>",

Although this strategy appears to have contributed to improvements in selected health outcomes, changing circumstances in many developing countries may now require a more flexible and country‚Äêspecific approach to health care programming. This article argues for the development of a <jats:italic>pragmatic</jats:italic> framework: to articulate problems which should be addressed in the development of national health programs; and, to organize concepts and methodologies to address these problems. Such a framework should enable an assessment of currently implicit value judgments, and enable strategies to be considered that assess several input and output variables simultaneously. Moreover, this framework would, we believe, further the goal of improved health delivery at a national level, and serve as a guide for further methodologic and conceptual development.</jats:p>",

In many ways, natural disasters pose many of the same threats to such structures as does war. Earthquakes impose horizontal loads on structures, their weak direction, tornadoes and hurricanes impose large substantial over pressures on walls and roves, just as ground shock and air blast from explosions do. Fire spreads when there is both fuel and ignition, regardless of whether the ignition is purposeful or accidental. A clear message from the natural hazards literature is that you cannot do anything during the emergency period that you have not carefully thought through before the emergency. This paper reviews approaches to protection of cultural properties and the existing Hague Convention. It is proposed that a concerted effort be mounted by the professional conservation community to: 1) prepare guides on how to identify and document cultural properties important to the community; 2) descriptive manuals on how to protect cultural properties using easily available materials and techniques; 3) distributed them to the local communities likely to be impacted; and 4) provide limited technical resource teams to stabilize or repair after hostilities.</jats:p>"

El art√≠culo delinea los antecedentes de la discusi√≥n actual y trata algunas de las propuestas m√°s significativas respecto a una politica ling√ºistica en Sud√¢frica despu√©s del \"apartheid\". Todas estas sugerencias concuerdan en que las lenguas negras desempe√±ar√°n un papel m√°s importante mientras que el africaans (actualmente una de las lenguas oficiales) perder√° hasta cierto punto su estatus. Es probable que el ingl√©s se convierta en el principal idioma oficial. El art√≠culo concluye con una breve discusi√≥n sobre proyectos similares en otros campos, como el de los medios de comunicaci√≥n y de las letras.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingvoplanaj modeloj en Sudafriko post la rasapartigo\n\t\tLa politikaj reformoj nun okazantaj en Sudafriko speguligas en novaj ideoj pri eblaj estontaj lingvaj politikoj por tiu lando.

The basic hypothesis of the research is that the 1981- 82 recession, coupled with technological changes and changes in government policy, led to rather remarkable changes in the spatial structure of many industries in the United States over a very short penod of time The research results confirmed these changes. In addition, many of the changes in locational relationships between industries are consistent with central place theory while others are consistent with profit cycle theory Both government action and technological developments caused the disintegration of some agglomerations and the emergence of others. </jats:p>",

That factbook began a series of 12 editions produced through 1993. The data in that series were consolidated and updated in another publication, and the present volume is now issued, based partly upon a 1989 questionnaire inquiry to over 100 developing countries. A range of maternal and child survival data were added to the family planning information. The relationships among fertility behavior, infant and child mortality, and maternal health are closely interwoven; moreover, many programs address all three issues rather than any one alone. The current volume provides the principal statistical indicators that are available for most developing countries. Some data are drawn from the questionnaire, whereas other data are taken from agencies that specialize in particular topics. We have limited this edition to the period since the mid-1980s. New data are included for large-scale family planning programs, together with closely related indicators on child survival and reproductive health.</jats:p>"

These changes may be analysed by examining the financing and provision of services and subsidization of the purchase of the factors of production. The public sector and not‚Äêfor‚Äêprofit and for‚Äêprofit elements of the private sector must be viewed as separate entities in such analyses due to their differing objectives, motives and form of operation. The issues to be dealt with by countries in finding the public/private mix which is appropriate for their health system and achieves their objectives include efficiency, quality, regulation, equity and consumer choice and satisfaction. The recommendations for action for countries include: promoting collaboration between private and public sectors; testing different public/private mix models; identifying appropriate expansion paths for private sector services; improving information for policy and planning decisions; enhancing management capacity; and, reviewing programme and project support. International agencies also have a role in this process by supporting countries through the provision of technical assistance, financial aid, promoting policy reviews, and facilitating the sharing of information and experiences among countries concerning these public/private mix issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two books have recently appeared which present very different views on planning. They are Bruce McClendon and Ray Quay's Mastering Change and Norm Krumholz and John Forester's Making Equity Planning Work. Each offers a perspective on planning practice, on American society and local government, and on the planner's roles in that context which, sometimes explicitly and often by implication, seem to be the polar opposite of the other. Both books are open about promoting their positions saying that this is how planners ought to practice, this is how we should teach would-be planners to plan successfully. </jats:p><jats:p> For the planning profession in general and for planning educators in particular the implicit models of society, and planning practice in that society, which these books contain present profound implications for planning theory, education, and practice. To stimulate an open discourse on these different approaches, this review symposium adopts an unusual format, but one which is clearly warranted by the presence of such a rare juxtaposition of views. </jats:p><jats:p> Each pair of authors compares the two books in a critical review that focuses on the differences between their approaches and their meaning for planning education and practice. Two commentators were chosen as discussants of this dialogue because they combine theory and practice: academic-practitioner John Bryson, Professor at the University of Minnesota, who has extensive practice and consulting experience in strategic planning; and practitioner-academic Paul Farmer, Deputy Director of Planning in Pittsburgh, who was on the faculty of the Universaty of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and now teaches at Carnegie-Mellon University. </jats:p><jats:p> Though these books are products of the eighties they are important. And the discussion below deserves our attention for its implicatzons for planning practice and education through the nineties and beyond. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Many developing countries are considering insurance as an option for increasing resource availability in the health sector in order to alleviate financial crisis. In addition to its impact on revenues, however, an insurance program also affects the efficiency and equity of health service delivery. This article examines these consequences of health insurance by reviewing a number of critical institutional characteristics of insurance programs in four developing countries‚ÄîBrazil, China, Korea and Zaire‚Äîand assessing their impact on the efficiency and equity of the health sector. The characteristics highlighted in the article are: the system for reimbursing providers; the services covered by insurance; the role of the insurer; the extent of beneficiary cost‚Äêsharing; and, the extent of the population covered by the insurance program. Indicators of health sector efficiency and equity affected by these characteristics reviewed are: cost escalation; resource allocation; the use of specific medical technologies; and, equity of access to services. Efficiency and equity problems are found to arise from the financial incentives facing providers coupled with their powerful influence over both the supply and demand for personal health services. Experience suggests that these problems are magnified when an insurer serves merely as a financial conduit for reimbursing providers. Efficiency and equity goals can be more effectively promoted by an insurance institution which actively organizes the entry of consumers into the health system and removes the financial incentives that encourage providers to increase the volume and cost of services.</jats:p>",

Computed tomography (CT) data files were used to construct a three‚Äêdimensional eye phantom representing the anatomy of a child's orbit. Dose distributions in sagittal, transverse, and coronal planes were predicted with 1‚Äêmm resolution. Study of these distributions led to an optimal treatment plan consisting of an anterior‚Äêlateral pair, with the anterior field being a 10‚ÄêMeV, 30‚Äêmm‚Äêdiam circular field, centrally blocked by a 10‚Äêmm‚Äêdiam lucite lens shield and the lateral field being a 16‚ÄêMeV, 30√ó25‚Äêmm D‚Äêshaped field. The anterior field delivers a therapeutic dose to the ora serrata, but it underdoses the posterior retinal surface behind the lens shield; the lateral field provides the necessary boost dose to the posterior retinal surface. An equally weighted combination of the two fields produces a dose distribution in which the entire retinal surface receives a therapeutic dose, with less than 10% of that dose being delivered to the lens, brain, and the contralateral orbit.</jats:p>",

This article presents an instrument to measure a new concept of tenant participation. The instrument is based on a model within which tenant values, goals, and understanding influence both participation behaviors and perceptions. Nineteen scales were tested on a sample of 153 tenants from housing projects in two midsized Canadian cities. Results indicated that tenant communication was the most important predictor of housing satisfaction. The number and age of children were related to some of the participation scales. Path analysis indicated intriguing differences between the determinants of participation behaviors and housing satisfaction. </jats:p>",

Zu diesem Zweck werden die wesentlichsten ‚ÄúBausteine‚Äù des Kaufkraftbegriffs, insbesondere dessen Preis- und Einkommenskomponente, auf die Verf√ºgbarkeit hinreichend regionalisierter und aktueller statistischer Informationen hin untersucht. Als Ergebnis zeigt sich, da√ü der Anspruch einer verfeinerten regionalen Tiefengliederung, ausgehend von Bundes- √ºber Landes- auf Kreis- und Gemeindeebene, gleichzeitig mit einer Verminderung spezifischer Strukturdaten verbunden ist und der Begriff Kaufkraft inhaltlich sehr bald nicht mehr abgedeckt werden kann. Dies liegt vor allem daran, da√ü auf tieferer regionaler Ebene die M√∂glichkeiten einer Preisbereinigung fehlen und damit Realeinkommensgr√∂√üen schlechthin nicht darstellbar sind. Andererseits ist auch f√ºr die Quantifizierung der vielf√§ltigen Umverteilungsvorg√§nge, welche auf die Prim√§reinkommen einwirken, nur eine unzureichende Datenbasis vorhanden, so da√ü auch das verf√ºgbare (Nominal‚Äë)Einkommen lediglich in sehr begrenzter regionaler Differenzierung ermittelt werden kann. F√ºr kleinere Gebietseinheiten verbleibt als fundierter statistischer Einkommensindikator allein das im Rahmen der 3j√§hrigen Lohn- und Einkommensteuerstatistiken erfa√üte ‚Äústeuerbare Einkommen‚Äù. Diese Daten sind jedoch als einzige wesentliche Basis f√ºr Kaufkraftuntersuchungen als unzureichend anzusehen.</jats:p>"

Sin embargo, la lucha hist√≥rica de los negros en general, y en torno al vern√°culo negro en particular, puede ser una fuerza importante en la lucha pro los derechos linguisticos de los grupos minori-tarios. Se investiga la perspectiva negra a trav√©s de un breve repaso de los amplios beneficios sociales de la lucha afro-americana - por medio del lente del liderato negro - y a trav√©s de una encuesta de afro-americanos residentes de grandes ciudades. La conclusi√≥n destaca la necesidad de activar y educar a los afro-americanos en cuanto al \"ingl√©s solamente\".\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tAfrikaj usonanoj kaj la movado \"Nur-Angla\"\n\t\tLa nuntempa movado \"Nur-Angla\" (kiu celas oficialigi la anglan lingvon en Usono kiel solan oficialan lingvon) kutime ne estas karakterizata kiel demando por afrikaj usonanoj, car gi foku-sigas je hispanparolantoj kaj azianoj.

Dementsprechend sollte von Landschaftsverbrauch nur gesprochen werden, wenn drei Komponenten vorliegen: Freifl√§chenverbrauch als Versiegelung vorher freier Fl√§che, Landschaftsbeeintr√§chtigung als Sinken der Diversit√§t oder des Integrationsniveaus von √ñkosystemen und Landschaftsentwertung als Verarmung der Landschaft hinsichtlich kultureller Standards. Nur auf diese Weise wird der Begriff dem vielschichtigen Ph√§nomen des Verbrauchs der Landschaft gerecht.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\t\"Immigrant Languages\" and the French School System\n\t\tThe situation of children who continue to be called \"immigrant\" in France, even though most of them were born or raised there, is paradoxical to say the least. On one hand, the government seeks to integrate the foreign communities established in France, and this would tend to relegate language maintenance to the sphere of private life. But at the same time, education experts have since 1970 imposed the idea that a foreign child will only learn his or her second language well (French in this case) only if he or she first learns to speak, read and write his/her \"mother tongue\" or \"language of origin\". Such culturally determined notions have dictated specific policies in the public schools which in fact often serve to create segregation.\n\t\tThis article attempts, in sociolinguistic and historic perspective, to analyze a situation which concerns a large fraction of the school population in France, in four parts: (1) The status of foreigners and their languages in France and the social representations surrounding them; (2) Government policy concerning foreign pupils and languages in public schools since 1970; (3) Volunteer associations and \"mother tongue\" maintenance; (4) Family strategies.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\t\"Enmigrulaj lingvoj\" : kaj la franca lerneja sistemo\n\t\tLa situacio de tiuj infanoj, kiujn, kvankam naskitaj kaj edukitaj en Francio, oni da≈≠re nomas \"enmigrintoj\", estas, minimume dirite, paradoksa. Unuflanke, la registaro celas integrigi la eksterlandajn komunumojn establitajn en Francio, kaj tio emus al sovo de lingva konservado al la sfero de la privata vivo; sed aliflanke edukistoj ekde 1970 trudas la ideon, ke eksterlanda infano bone lernos sian duan lingvon (ci-kaze la francan) nur se li/si unue lernos paroli, legi kaj skribi sian \"denaskan lingvon\" au \"lingvon de origino\". Tiaj kulture determinitaj nocioj diktis specifajn politikojn en la publikaj lernejoj, kiuj ofte kreas izoligon.\n\t\tLa a≈≠toro celas, la≈≠ socilingvistika kaj historia perspektivo, analizi situacion, kiu tu≈ùas grandan nombron de lernejanoj francaj, en kvar stadioj: la statuso de eksterlandanoj kaj iliaj lingvoj en Francio, kaj la sociaj prezentiƒùoj, kiuj ƒâirka≈≠as ilin; registara politiko pri ekster-landaj lernejanoj kaj lingvoj en publikaj lernejoj de post 1970; volontulaj asocioj kaj konservado de \"denaskaj lingvoj\"; familiaj strategioj.</jats:p>",

C'est une langue qu'il a m√™me construite des mots et formes de mots issus des langues principales et secondaires nig√©rianes.\n\t\tBien que l'auteur reconnaisse l'id√©e d'une telle langue, il rejette cependant son acceptabilit√© comme langue codifi√©e, reconnue et utilis√©e par les Nig√©rians.\n\t\tIl est sugg√©r√© que la tentative de construire de fa√ßon d√©mocratique une lingua franca indig√®ne √† partir d'environ quatre cents langues reconnaissables au Nigeria sans aucun appui scientifique revient √† une sur-d√©mocratisation.

Provo konstrui demokrate indigenan interlingvon el proksimume kvarcent rekoneblaj lingvoj en Nigerio sen gvidaj prin-cipoj au sciencaj metodoj konsistigas trodemokratigon.

The Conference Board and the Hay Group's conferences ‚ÄúSatisfying Internal Customers‚Äù held in New York and recently in San Diego, explored how enhancements in internal systems, processes, and activities can support improved external customer service. The presentations offered different perspectives on how companies manage the relationship between internal and external customer service. For example, some innovative companies focus on one internal customer relationship or core process, while others recognize numerous internal customer relationships and core processes to which each department or function must respond.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Traditionally, most industrial robots are programmed by teaching. Automatic planning of robotic tasks has many potential benefits for flexible automation. It allows the user to describe a task to the robot programming system in a formal and natural manner, and reduces the time required to generate and update robot programs. Two main levels of abstraction in describing robot tasks can be identified.<jats:italic>Robot-level</jats:italic>programming is based on robot movements and actions, as detailed by the programmer.<jats:italic>Object-level</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>task-level</jats:italic>programming allows the user to describe assembly tasks in terms of operations performed on objects being manipulated instead of specifying the individual motions of the robot end-effector. However, commercially available robot-level programming languages still fall short of the robot user's need to programme complex tasks and consequently are not widely used in industry. There is an increasing need for integrating sensors feedback into the robot system to provide better perception and for improving the capacity of the robot to reason and make decisions intelligently in real-time. Task-level programming represents the highest level of abstraction and is the most attractive, as it uses reasoning capabilities provided by Artificial Intelligence. To date, no system of this class has been completely implemented in industry. This paper reviews the progress made in robot programming and task planning systems in the last twenty years, and discusses the current research trends.</jats:p>",

Les tirailleurs s√©n√©galais et les premiers intellectuels de ces sous-r√©gions se seraient inspir√©s de ces id√©aux pour la lib√©ration de leurs peuples.\n\t\tCet article examine le rapport entre les id√©aux de la r√©volution fran√ßaise de 1789 et l'expansion et la promotion de la langue fran√ßaise. Il montre, par une analyse des donn√©es sociopolitiques et historiques que ces deux ph√©nom√®nes se tiennent, et que la francophonie n'est que la suite logique de la politique linguistique en France apr√®s la r√©volution.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa franca revolucio kaj la franca lingvo: ƒâu paradokso?\n\t\tLa historio de la sendependigo de la iamaj francaj kolonioj en la fruaj sesdekaj jaroj sugestas, ke la politika vekigo kaj emancipigo de la popoloj de okcidenta kaj centra Afriko ƒâefe ≈ùuldiƒùas al la idealoj de la Franca Revolucio. La \"tirailleurs s√©n√©galais\" kaj la unuaj intelektuloj de tiuj regionoj la≈≠supoze trempis sin en la idealoj de la jaro 1789 kaj, poste, utiligis ilin por liberigi siajn popolanojn. La artikolo esploras la rilaton inter tiuj revoluciaj idealoj kaj la posta disvastigo kaj anta≈≠enigo de la franca lingvo. Gi montras, per lingva kaj socipolitika analizo de la historio de la Franca Revolucio kaj la franca lingvo, ke ne ekzistas malkongruo inter la du, kaj ke la frankofonia movado estas kontinuigo de la lingva politiko de Francio de post la Revolucio de 1789.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tThe Russian Language in the New Relations of the European Space Agency\n\t\tThe recently signed Framework Agreement between the European Space Agency and the Soviet Union opens the door to an intensified cooperation between the two space powers in a variety of areas of common interest. Whereas ESA-financed industrial project and research work, both with the USA and within the 13 member-states of the Agency, is usually conducted in English (English and French being the two official languages of ESA), the Soviet Union has its own long history of international space activities with Russian used as the unique means of communication.\n\t\tThe linguistic aspects of the new Agreement and its first implementation are placed in the context of the totally different organizational structures represented by the two parties. Many of the communication problems on the executive level appear to be caused by Western concepts of project management and control which are difficult to translate into meaningful Russian equivalents. The linguistic interaction, which is a natural consequence of joint project work, has caused the first loan words to cross the borders from both sides.\n\t\tSOMMAIRE\n\t\tLa langue russe dans les nouvelles relations de VAgence Spatiale Europ√©enne\n\t\tL'Accord Cadre sign√© r√©cemment entre l'Agence Spatiale Europ√©enne (ASE) et l'Union Sovi√©tique ouvre la porte √† une coop√©ration accrue entre les deux puissances spatiales dans une vari√©t√© de domaines d'int√©r√™ts communs. Alors que les travaux de d√©veloppement industriel et de recherche, financ√©s par l'ASE, sont conduits habituellement en langue anglaise, non seulement avec les √âtats Unis d'Am√©rique, mais √©galement √† l'int√©rieur des treize pays-membres de l'ASE (l'anglais et le fran√ßais √©tant les deux langues officielles de l'ASE), l'Union Sovi√©tique a une longue histoire d'activit√©s spatiales internationales pour lesquelles la langue russe √©tait le moyen unique de communication.\n\t\tLes aspects linguistiques du nouvel accord ainsi que sa premi√®re mise en application sont plac√©s dans le cadre de deux partenaires ayant des structures totalement diff√©rentes. Il semble qu'un grand nombre de probl√®mes de communication qui apparaissent au niveau d'ex√©cution soient caus√©s par des concepts occidentaux de la gestion et du contr√¥le de projets qui sont difficiles √† traduire en √©quivalents russes significatifs. L'interaction linguistique, cons√©quence naturelle du travail autour d'un projet commun, a provoqu√© le transfert, d'un c√¥t√© comme de l'autre, des premiers mots d'emprunt.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUME\n\t\tCet article traite d'un probl√®me langagier commun √† ceux des autochtones du Canada qui parlent toujours leur langue et conserve encore leur culture. Ceux-ci ressentent actuellement deux urgences: d'une part, de pouvoir gagner leur vie √† un niveau comparable au standing des populations allochtones, et d'autre part, de pouvoir travailler chez eux au sein de leur propre culture et dans leur propre habitat. L'auteur observe, en outre, ce qui tend √† arriver √† l'autochtone qui essaie de s'assimiler au mode de vie allochtone, afin de partager un niveau de vie plus √©l√©v√©. On observe que la langue autochtone, bien que parl√©e et √©crite, n'a jamais √©t√© am√©nag√©e, unifi√©e, ou normalis√© au Canada comme elle l'a √©t√© au Groenland ou au Paraguay, o√π la langue autochtone est officielle. On examine les caract√©ristiques d'un dialecte autochtone, d'une branche de la langue inuktitut, la langue des inuit. Par la suite, l'auteur propose quelques applications de la traductique √† la r√©solution des probl√®mes √©conomiques et sociaux. Les solutions propos√©es sont: la cr√©ation d'une interface entre les dialectes de la langue autochtones par truchement de la traduction automatis√©e vers plusieurs dialectes √† la fois (la \"pluriductique\"); et l'emploi, √† cette fin, d'un m√©talangage normalis√© provenant du calcule de la forme moyenne des dialectes. Aussi propos√©e, est la cr√©ation d'une interface entre la langue autochtone et la langue allochtone (l'anglais ou le fran√ßais). L'interface qui fait le pont entre langues autochtones et allochtones, permettra de se servir de l'ordinateur comme station de travail √† distance (la t√©l√©matique). Enfin, en passant, on traite de l'application de la traduction distribu√©e dans la modification stylistique pour objectifs p√©dagogiques, soit l'interface entre le style d'apprentissage de l'individu et la biblioth√®que source du savoir.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa indigenaj popoloj de Kanado, kiuj da≈≠re parolas sian lingvon kaj vivtenas sian kulturon, havas du urgajn bezonojn: perlabori siajn vivbezonojn sur nivelo komparebla al tiu de la loƒùantoj en la resto de la lando, kaj trovi eblecojn labori restante en sia kulturo kaj en sia logregiono. Eblas, ke anoj de tiuj popoloj, kiel kulture neagnoskitaj individuoj, ensimiligas en la \"ƒâefan\" socion, sed ofte ill pagas por tio per soleco en la nepersona pluralisma socio kaj per la bezono batali kontra≈≠ la tento de droga kaj alkohola dependigo. Kontraste al la guarania en Paragvajo au la gronlanda en Gronlando, la kanadaj indigenaj lingvoj, kiuj estas en parola kaj skriba uzo, ankora≈≠ ne estis unuigitaj au normigitaj. Estas traktataj la karakterizajoj de unu el la indigenaj lingvoj, branƒâo de la inuktituta, la lingvo de la inuitoj (eskimoj), kaj estas proponataj diversaj aplikoj de tradukteknologio al la solvado de la ekonomiaj kaj sociaj problemoj. Precipe estas proponata uzo de Distribuita Lingvotradukado (DLT) kiel konektilo inter la malproksimaj dialektoj de la indigenaj lingvoj unuflanke, kaj inter la indiƒùenaj kaj la oficialaj lingvoj de Kanado (angla kaj franca) aliflanke. Tia ponta komunikado ebligus perkomputilan distanclaboradon en la indiƒùena lingvo en la tradicia logregiono. En tia sistemo, oni ricevus datenojn el anglaj au francaj fontoj kaj konektus ilin al la loka lingvo. Prilaborinte la datenojn per la indigena lingvo, la distanclaborantoj resendus la ƒùisdatigitajn datenojn al la dunganto post retraduko al la angla au franca. Estas krome diskutataj edukaj aplikoj de DLT en prilaborado de tekstoj por specifaj celgrupoj en biblioteka≈≠tomatigo kaj perkomputila distancinstruado.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Siedlungsschwerpunkten sollen Dienstleistungen und Wohnungen konzentriert sein, und sie sollen an leistungf√§hige Linien des √ñPNV angebunden sein. Ihnen kommt innerhalb der Siedlungsstruktur eine besondere Bedeutung f√ºr die Versorgung der Bev√∂lkerung zu. Die Darstellungen der Siedlungsschwerpunkte der Ruhrgebietskernst√§dte werden verglichen und in ein dreistufiges System gebracht. Die Grundversorgung wie auch weitgehend die Versorgung im Bereich des mittelfristigen Bedarfs ist fl√§chendeckend gew√§hrleistet. Siedlungsschwerpunkte mit oberzentralen G√ºtern und Dienstleistungen finden sich dagegen prim√§r in den Oberzentren auf der Hellwegachse. Weitgehend best√§tigt wird diese Einsch√§tzung durch einen Vergleich des Systems der Siedlungsschwerpunkte mit der Verteilung der Standorte bedeutender Einrichtungen. Allerdings geht die Verteilung der bedeutenden Einrichtungen oft √ºber den idealtypischen Radius eines Siedlungsschwerpunktes von 1 km hinaus. Auch die geforderte Anbindung an leistungsf√§hige Linien des regionalen √ñPNV ist vielfach nicht gegeben. Hieraus werden Forderungen insbesondere nach einer st√§rkeren Kooperation der Ruhrgebietskernst√§dte abgeleitet.</jats:p>"

A new division of labor is presented, which includes the United Kingdom as a prime host country for reasons of language and low labor costs. Ireland, Catalonia, and some East German Lander may be the exception to the rule that investments are made in the core regions. A shift was seen in FDI during the 1960s to the Pacific Rim, the USA being a prime host country for FDI during the 1970s. </jats:p>",

But despite the increasing and rapid expansion in the education system, the rising figures for enrolment and well-equipped buildings, the country still suffers from acute shortages of the well-qualified and skilled human resources that should meet the country's socio-economic development and transformation plans, and run the increased number of large industrial establishments like the oil industry, where a large number of foreign personnel still occupy core functions.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper shows that a number of practical and theoretical problems are responsible for inaccurate manpower planning, and also for the retardation of the development of Libya's manpower education and training, needed to ensure the country had the necessary well-qualified personnel who would perform their employment duties properly in order that the country achieves its planned socio-economic development targets.</jats:p><jats:p>For real control of Libya's natural resources, mainly oil and gas, the paper calls for urgent action to be taken for a well-planned and properly executed Libyanisation policy and more effective use of the most necessary non-Libyan personnel. It outlines the scientific and practical factors needed to improve labour productivity, describes the procedure and methodology of manpower forecasting currently in use, and calls for action to correct its deficiencies.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper also attempts to point out the major role that the university and other educational institutions have to play in the education and training of the country's people. It also suggests that more effort should be made to link and involve the educational institutions, and the university in particular, with the industrial and other economic sectors in the country. Also required is a variety of good services which can be employed in consultative work and collaborative involvement, based on a thorough understanding of the requirements both of industry and the university as a consultative and research centre, in addition to its educational functions. These and other aspects are fully discussed and a call is made for better planned and strategic reform of the education and training systems in Libya, so that the country can truly adjust to changes in its students and the workforce.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Writing instructors often assign collaborative writing activities as a way to foster reflective thinking; many assume that the very act of explaining and defending ideas in the presence of a responsive audience actually forces writers to take critical positions on their own ideas. This article questions this assumption by examining the role of critical reflection in one particular writing context‚Äîthat of collaborative planning. The authors' observations address three questions: (a) When students collaborate on plans for a paper do they necessarily reflect critically on their own ideas and processes, as many advocates of collaboration might expect? (b) If and when students engage in reflection, does it make a qualitative difference in their writing plans? And finally, (c) how do student writers engage in and use reflection as they develop plans? Twenty-two college freshmen audio-taped themselves as they planned course papers with a peer. Transcripts were coded for reflective comments and were holistically rated for quality. The analysis revealed a significant correlation between amount of reflective conversation and the quality of students' plans. Students used reflection to identify problems, to search for and evaluate alternative plans, and to elaborate ideas through the process of justification. This problem solving was most effective when reflection was sustained over many conversational turns. Collaboration did not guarantee reflection, however. Some sessions contained no reflective comments and some students used collaboration in a way that undermined reflective thinking. This study suggests that how students represented collaboration and the writing assignment itself determined whether and how they reflected on their own ideas. </jats:p>",

In order to speed convergence, the relaxation parameter is made to vary, with its value based upon a measure of deviation from feasibility.

The Hectometric Information Grid or Hectaraster consists of a database, covering all of Switzerland according to 12 Level-I landcover/land-use categories. In this study Level-I and Level-II ‚Äúbuild-up‚Äù and ‚Äúforest‚Äù classes are computed using Landsat-5 TM spectral data of the study area of Switzerland. A procedure has been developed that automatically determines the dominant land-cover/land-use inside each hectare or ‚Äúhectel‚Äù of the Hectaraster. The newly created Hectaraster results in a more accurate representation of the actual land-cover/land-use situation in the Nyon test area, as compared to the traditional 1972 Hectaraster. Also, more detail is available, since Level-II categories have been added to the Level-I land-cover/land-use categories.</jats:p><jats:p>The study indicates how classified Landsat-5 TM images can efficiently contribute to the management and planning of low density build-up zones. The integration of classified remote-sensing data into a geographic information system (GIS) allows the extraction of new land-use categories by examining their spatial relationships. Thus, in addition to built-up categories, computed from automated classification procedures, potential construction sites and nonused construction areas have been determined through GIS operations.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods are presented, which allow the classification of forest stands according to their surface and their shape. The perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) is computed for deciduous and coniferous forest stands. Deciduous and coniferous forests are studied separately. Coniferous forests revealed essentially low PVI values. Dense deciduous forest had the highest PVI values, while open deciduous and deciduous/coniferous stands had intermediate PVI values.</jats:p>",

Their financial power together with their control of key knowledge and information assets, in the form of R&amp;D and sales and marketing networks, has been a central element in their survival and growth.

Dies um so mehr, um in Zukunft nicht lang anhaltende regionale Disparit√§ten zu schaffen. Grundlage daf√ºr kann auf kommunaler Ebene die Erarbeitung eines Kreisentwicklungsprogramms sein, das als gemeinsamer Orientierungsrahmen f√ºr die politischen Entscheidungstr√§ger dient. Die Schritte dabei sind neben eingehenden Struktur-Analysen, der Feststellung der St√§rken und Schw√§chen des Untersuchungsgebietes, der Entwurf von Visionen, die Ausarbeitung konkreter Strategien und Ma√ünahmen. Alle Untersuchungsschritte sind dabei von einem hohen Partizipationsgrad der Betroffenen gekennzeichnet, um die Akzeptanz des Programms zu erh√∂hen und somit seine Realisierung zu erleichtern.Als Instrument der Problem- und Zukunftsbew√§ltigung in den neuen Bundesl√§ndern ist ein Kreisentwicklungsprogramm durchaus geeignet, diesen Anspruch zu erf√ºllen, besonders deshalb, weil derzeit die Regionalplanung sich erst im Aufbau befindet. Die Konzeption einer Entwicklungspolitik auf Kreisebene am Beispiel des Kreises Eilenburg n√∂rdlich von Leipzig soll den politisch Verantwortlichen Mut f√ºr einen eigenen Weg der regionalen Entwicklung machen.</jats:p>"

Um die Frage in der rechten Perspektive zu betrachten, wird versucht, sie in einem mehrdimensionalen Kontext zu sehen. Zu diesem Zweck werden die Sprachensituation in Indien, der Proze√ü der Neuordnung der indischen Unionsstaaten nach Sprachgesichtspunkten und die ethnische, religi√∂se und demografische Zusammensetzung Manipurs er√∂rtert. Daneben werden auch die Sprachenprobleme, mit denen die Gesellschaft in Manipur zu k√§mpfen hat, sowie bestimmte Faktoren, durch die die Dringlichkeit der Forderung nach Eintragung des Manipurischen ged√§mpft wird, ausf√ºhrlicher besprochen. Am SchluB wird die These aufgestellt, daB derartige Forderungen (Bewegungen und Initiativen) ihren Ursprung in bestimmten amtlichen Erlassen, gesetzgeberischen Entscheidungen und in solch anachronistischen Vorschriften wie der Achten Sprachenliste haben.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tCu enlistigi a≈≠ ne:\n\t\tprovo de studo de la lingvokonflikta situacio en Manipuro\n\t\tCi tiu artikolo, sen ambicia analizo de teoriaj sekvoj sur vasta tereno, provas ƒâefe priskribi sinkrone kaj diakrone la postulon, ofte esprimigantan lingvomovade kaj agitade, ke oni aldonu la manipuran lingvon al la Oka Lingvolisto de la bharata (hinda) konstitucio.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Western Europe is the world's largest automobile market and also the major region of automobile production. Until 1986, with the arrival of Nissan, the automobile industry in the region was shared between a mixture of US transnational producers and indigenous European producers, some of which also operate plants outside Europe. It is an industry in which, although a substantial degree of corporate integration has occurred, the impact of historical circumstances is still evident in its current locational structure. The creation of a Single European Market after 1992 will remove at least some of the internal barriers to full transnational integration by the European-based automobile producers. The purpose of this paper is to explore the strategies of the three major groups of volume automobile producers in Europe in the context of the changing European situation. A basic question to be posed is whether the Single European Market is likely to stimulate major strategic changes amongst automobile manufacturers or whether we are more likely to see a continuation of existing strategies. The potential implications of the recent political upheavals in Eastern Europe add further complexity to the situation. </jats:p>",

Using behavioral analysis and explanatory models, project results show that the effectiveness of nutrition education can be facilitated by (1) recognizing the family as the unit of service, (2) focusing on solutions rather than problems, (3) using a two-stage promotional message strategy to encourage better child caretaking, and (4) viewing potential new practices as behavioral processes, rather than single entities aimed at a specific outcome. Program planning should also include the successive construction and analysis of community-based explanatory models which justify people's nutrition and health behaviors. The ultimate aim is to identify differences between explanatory models held by community members and health/nutrition educators, negotiate this conflict, and thereafter develop more practical and realistic methods for modifying behavior. </jats:p>",

A framework is developed for explaining this, as well as other aspects of the source, nature, host country, and subnational location of foreign-owned and foreign-affiliated bank offices. In the Canada-US context, the posited relationships are complicated by the two economies' proximity and intensive interaction, and by regulatory changes within and between the countries. The paper refers to published data and personal interviews to note the influence that proximity, ultimate ownership, and market segmentation have on banks' decisions to engage in correspondent relationships versus agencies, branches, or subsidiaries across the border. From the interviews and by using the hypothesized framework, the author also explores relationships between existing bank strengths and changes resulting from the bilateral Free Trade Agreement. </jats:p>",

Of these species, 133\n(mostly reptiles) are restricted to this region. Reptiles (and especially endemic species) characteristically\nhave small ranges in this area. For all three groups, diversity is highest in coastal, high rainfall areas\n(especially of Arnhem Land and the northern Kimberley). Such areas are relatively well represented in\nthe existing nature reserve system. Assemblages of species are mapped, on the basis of classification\nof the 123 lo latitude by lo longitude cells in the region. For both mammal and bird species, four\ndefined assemblages were distributed in high rainfall coastal areas, inland low rainfall areas and two\ntransitional zones, all extending over a broad east-west span. Reptile assemblages show a similar\ninitial (wet-dry) division, but then split into east and west subdivisions. For all three animal groups,\ntransitional and inland assemblages are poorly reserved (&lt;0.25% of land area).\nA total of 58 reserves occur in the region. Most are small (median 24km*2) and concentrated around\npopulation centres. Biological information is lacking for most reserves. Largely because of the dispersion\nof existing reserves, almost one quarter of the species considered (and about the same proportion of\nendemic species) are not known to occur in any conservation reserve in the region. Priorities are\nassigned for the placement of future reserves. The most significant additions should be in the north\nKimberley, south-west Kimberley, northern fringe of the Tanami Desert, Gulf of Carpentaria hinterland\nand eastern Arnhem Land.\nThe conservation of this fauna is not dependent solely on the provision of a park network, but\ndemands also informed management of reserves and adequate environmental protection of land\noutside reserves. </jats:p>"

The outcome literature indicates highly varying outcomes associated with goal planning to increase skills acquisition. No experimental studies were identified which attempted to evaluate goal planning procedures to increase the diversity of opportunities and change people's lifestyle. The quality of this outcome literature was rather disappointing. There were few studies which included control groups, placebo conditions, comparison intervention procedures, social validation or follow‚Äêup data. Staff training in goal planning has received considerable attention. However, many studies have focussed only on staff keeping documentation rather than on staff teaching skills. Staff training methods which include an <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> training component and a planned maintenance procedure show considerable promise. Areas for the future development of goal planning are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Leaf area development is an important determinant of the proportion of the incident radiation intercepted and consequently of stem yield for paper pulp production in kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.). Relationships were developed describing the component processes of node production, leaf area per node and leaf area senescence, to predict green leaf area of non-branching plants of kenaf during the period from sowing to flowering. Data were collected on cultivar Guatemala 4 grown under irrigation at a range of plant population densities at three sites in tropical Australia. The thermal time required for production of new nodes remained constant from sowing to flowering at 36.3ÔøΩC days node-' at a population of 50 plants m-2. Leaf area per node was described quantitatively in terms of three phases where, as node number increased, leaf area per node at first increased linearly, reached a plateau and finally declined linearly. The rate at which the leaf area at old nodes was senesced was found to be equivalent to the rate of production of new nodes, such that the number of nodes bearing green leaves was relatively constant; at a population of 50 plants m-2 there was green leaf area at 7 nodes plant-1 over time. Empirical functions describing the effects of plant population on rates of node production and senescence and on maximum leaf area per node were developed. In limited testing, these functions predicted leaf area development of crops of kenaf grown under optimal conditions. The functions developed here, when combined with others in this series of papers, provide algorithms to be used in the development of a crop simulation model of kenaf for use in the semi-arid tropics of northern Australia.</jats:p>"

It is a case study which demonstrates the problems and effects of informal language planning in public education systems such as Arizona‚Äôs. The study focuses on the initial specifications of the mandate and the efforts of individual school districts to comply in a timely manner. The difficulties encountered by one school district as it considers ways to implement the mandate are examined in detail. The data for this study was gathered from official documents, personal interviews, videotapes, newspaper articles, public meetings and independent research related to language policy in the state of Arizona. The study suggests that a greater awareness of language planning skills at this level could lead to the development of more effective language programs.</jats:p>",

If the number of installed VAR sources is fixed, the overall problem can be reduced to independent subproblems.

This paper considers the lessons to be learnt from the Welsh strategy for the development of needs-led services as promulgated by the White Paper. Similarities and differences between the two policy initiatives are first identified before considering the conceptual basis of needs-led services. Attention is drawn to two interdependent dimensions of needs-led services, user participation and management delegation, as a means of depicting three underlying models, each with different value stances. By drawing from a case study of one area in Wales, an attempt is made to test the expectations for needs-led services in terms of local planning and management requirements of the three models against the experiences of those charged with putting them into practice. Implications for the White Paper are explored in connection with user involvement strategies and assessment and care management processes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>NTKENAF (Version 1.1) is a computer model which simulates the growth of kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) under rainfed conditions in tropical Australia. In daily time-steps, the model simulates the phenology, leaf area development, biomass accumulation and partitioning, soil water balance and dry matter yields of kenaf plants based on climatic and management inputs. The model assumes adequate nutrition and no effect of pests and diseases. The model uses daily maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation and rainfall. The duration from sowing to flowering is predicted using temperature and photoperiod. Leaf growth is described as a function of node production (as determined by temperature), leaf area per node and leaf area senescence. Potential daily biomass is predicted from leaf area index, the light extinction coefficient and radiation use efficiency, and partitioned to the economic stem yield. Soil evaporation is predicted using a two-stage evaporation model, and plant transpiration is predicted from the daily biomass accumulation, a transpiration efficiency coefficient and predicted daily vapour pressure deficit. Plant extractable soil water is dependent on the available soil water range for each depth increment, the extraction front velocity, and the extent of water extraction at each depth. Daily transpiration and leaf growth are decreased below potential values once the fraction of available soil water declines below a threshold value. NTKENAF V1.1 has been validated against observed data from kenaf experiments conducted at two sites (lat. 13ÔøΩ48'S. and 14ÔøΩ28'S.) in northern Australia. The predictive accuracy of the model was good over a range in above-ground biomass up to 25 000 kg ha-1 (n = 40, r2 = 0.94, root mean square deviation = 1716 kg ha-1). Validations were also undertaken for predictions of the core and bark stem components, leaf area index and plant extractable soil water contents. The development of NTKENAF has provided a tool which can greatly aid assessment of the feasibility of a fibre industry based on kenaf in northern Australia.</jats:p>"

Because of the significant electron multiple scatter, there is no unique solution to the problem of bolus design. However, using a sequence of operators, a bolus can be designed that attempts to meet three important criteria: adequate dose delivery to the target volume, avoidance of critical structures, and dose homogeneity within the target volume. Initial calculation of bolus shape was based upon creation operators forcing either the physical or the effective depths of the distal surface of the target volume to a specified value. Modification operators were then applied to the bolus to alter the shape to better meet the design criteria. Because the operators each address a single dosimetric issue, they can often adversely affect some other attribute of the dose distribution. In addition, an extension operator is used to design the bolus thickness outside the target volume. Application of these operators is therefore carried out in certain sequences and each may be used more than once in the design of a particular bolus. The effects of these operators on both the bolus and the resulting dose distribution are investigated for test geometries and patient geometries in the nose, parotid, and paraspinal region.</jats:p>",

Using queuing theory, the solution gives special attention to the different hierarchical dependencies. Lufthansa has implemented the model for its repair shops of electronic parts.

Thus the recent Canada‚ÄîUS Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will likely have less short-term impact on restructuring in the auto industry than it will in most other industries. The paper begins with an analysis of the significant restructuring that occurred within the North American auto industry during the 1980s in response to the globalization of production and dramatic changes in competitive conditions. The future prospects of the industry as it enters the 1990s are examined with regard to three issues: the likely impact of the implementation of the automotive-industry provisions of the FTA; the consolidation of the significant auto-manufacturing presence in North America established by Japanese automakers during the 1980s; and the fact that, with or without the negotiation of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it appears likely that Mexico during the 1990s will become fully integrated into a truly North American automotive industry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The scale, sectoral composition, and regional economic impact of recent Canadian direct investment in Western New York are examined. Empirical perspectives on the role of the Canada‚ÄîUnited States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) are presented, notably with regard to Western New York's growing absorption of Canadian industrial capital. Data from a postal survey of Canadian investors are described. The results suggest that the FTA has not been a strategic factor in recent investment patterns. Instead, the data reveal an important role for locational and market considerations, few of which pertain to official regulations of bilateral commerce. Some of the empirical results suggest an economic synergy between southern Ontario and Western New York. Specifically, both regions appear to have captured significant commercial benefits from recent cross-border investment. The paper concludes with a brief research agenda for future geographical work on the economic impact of more liberal investment relations between the two countries. </jats:p>",

Conceptually, these implications are discussed within a progressively more focused series of trade-relations contexts based on principles of political economy and which are represented by the concepts of complex interdependence, continentalism, and bargaining. Empirically, it is found that the dispute led to an unanticipated and undesirable outcome for the lumber industry of British Columbia. Paradoxically, the dispute provides further encouragement for the lumber industry to diversify its operations, a trend which can be considered beneficial. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The feasibility of utilizing kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) as a fibre crop and potential source of paper pulp is being investigated. This paper is the first in a series which develops and validates a simulation model of kenaf, and applies it to assessing the potential for dryland production in regions of tropical Australia. The duration from sowing to flowering is an important determinant of fibre yield in kenaf. Accordingly, the effect of temperature and photoperiod on the phenology of kenaf was examined. Data were collated from sowing-date experiments on kenaf cultivars Guatemala 4 and Everglades 71 at six locations in tropical Australia, ranging in latitude from 12ÔøΩ 54'S. to 19ÔøΩ 32'S. Data from one site, Kununurra, W.A. (15ÔøΩ 39'S.), was used to develop a model which described the duration from sowing to flowering in kenaf based on four stages: (1) sowing to emergence; (2) emergence to the end of the basic vegetative phase (BVP); (3) a photoperiod-induced phase (PIP) which ends at floral initiation; and (4) a flower development phase (FDP). Both kenaf cultivars responded as qualitative short-day plants where flowering did not occur above a critical photoperiod of 12.9 h. Assuming a base photoperiod of 12.0 h, the thermal time required to complete the BVP for the two cultivars was similar. However, photoperiod sensitivity during PIP, and the thermal time required for FDP, were greater for Guatemala 4 than for Everglades 71. Validation of the model against independently observed data for both cultivars at other sites resulted in close predictions in the thermal time required for flowering. This phenological model for kenaf can be used to assess the effect of sowing date on phenology at different locations in tropical environments, and is a key component of a crop growth simulation model to assess the environmental constraints to productivity in these regions.</jats:p>"
