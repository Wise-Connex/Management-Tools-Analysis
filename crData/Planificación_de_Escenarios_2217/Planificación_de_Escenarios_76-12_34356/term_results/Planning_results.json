In this paper, a theory of interaction preferences is proposed in which actors implicitly discount potential opportunity interactions in terms of these perceived distances. This form of implicit discounting behavior is shown to be characterized by three general axioms of observable preference behavior. The special case of exponential spatial discounting is also characterized explicitly. In addition, conditions are established under which discounted preferences are representable by utility functions. Finally, the dependence of discounted preferences on the underlying configuration of distances is examined in depth. </jats:p>",

The system has its characteristic features: first of all, the targets of the plan are to be brought into conformity with the acute needs of the society, there also must be taken into consideration the existing material conditions necessary to carry out the research plan, and finally, the research planned or the results achieved by other research institutions in the respective fields, and that not only in the Soviet Union, but also abroad. The research plans worked out in the library schools for one-year and five-year periods have to be founded upon these general and fundamental trends and targets of the development of research, as they are defined in the long-term (fifteen-year) plans.The process of working out the research plans begins within the respective departments of the school.The plans have to reflect the versatile research activities of the department, not only the individual research works carried out by each member of the faculty, but also the works carried out through a postgraduate thesis or done on the basis of a contract with other institutions, and even the research activities of the students’ research societies. But the departments, in spite of this diversity of the research activities, have to avoid a waste of research efforts and to swing all these efforts towards the solution of actual complex problems.Great importance for a rational planning of research has the establishment in the USSR of a centralized state system of registration and control of research works. An important step towards the creation of an analogical world system is the establishment by UNESCO of the ISORID.</jats:p>"

The theory predicts that local mobility is most likely to occur among households whose actual housing consumption deviates the most from their utility-maximizing levels and whose monetary and psychic costs of moving are least. Two separate models are used in applying the theory to data obtained from a national household survey in the USA. The inclusion of variables designed to capture the needs of families to adjust their housing adds little explanatory power compared with more conventional predictors of mobility, although the housing-consumption variables generally have plausible effects on household mobility. Not all local moves are motivated primarily by housing considerations—nearly a third of all local moves are associated with new household formation, marriage, or divorce. </jats:p>",

A social practice model of experimental learning is proposed as an alternative to current research styles. The difficulty remains, however, how to apply successfully the results of learning obtained in one experiment to other situations, and how new learning can be made more generally effective. Conditions for resolving this problem are identified as (1) a commitment on the part of the policymaking institution to the idea of social experimentation, practice, and learning as the principal methods for public intervention; (2) the formation of central services in support of local experiments; and (3) expansion of lateral channels of communication for the diffusion of new experiences and learning among the multiple experiments themselves. </jats:p>",

Nearly all these programmes are recent, difficult to evaluate and carry on them the imprint of political and religious pressures stretching back over many decades. On the whole the initial results of governmental planning in the private, individual domain of fertility have been dis­appointing. The range of fertility regulation options needs to be widened and management skills and philosophy improved both nationally and internationally. There is a need and opportunity for continued non­governmental activity. The demand for family planning services outruns supply in nearly every country. The resources currently invested in family planning at a world level, if reallocated, are probably sufficient to meet latent demand. But it will require political will, some straightforward technical insights and the elimination of redundant activities to achieve this goal. Once the basic human right of men and women to control fertility has been realistic­ally extended to the world’s population, further review will then be necessary to determine if additional motivational and educational efforts are necessary to achieve desired demographic goals. There are many uncertainties on the road ahead, but the immediate choices that need to be made are obvious.</jats:p>",

A combination of these provides a quantitative framework for characterizing probabilistically the environmental impact of a given facility.

Those cuts which partition the vertices nontrivially—that is, into two sets each of cardinality greater than unity—are of interest. The set in each such pair with the fewer vertices is regarded as a nodal region. It has the attractive property that fewer people migrate into (from) it, as a whole, than into (from) its node. Prominent features of Spanish internal movements are revealed through the presentation of the nodal regions that are found by means of a multiterminal analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because of the shortage of medical manpower in the developing world future family planning programmes will increasingly be supplemented by the use of non-clinical resources through what is known as community-based distribution (c. b. d.) programmes. Currently the c. b. d. resources being mobilized range from church groups to the commercial marketing industry. The use of marketing techniques in this way to distribute contraceptives at subsidized prices is an example of social marketing. This approach has the advantage of being able to use the world’s ubiquitous shop system and of being highly cost-effective. Fragmentary data suggests that in most countries there is one store for every 25 to 120 fertile couples. Evidence on the number and distribution of stores in various countries is discussed. Cost-effectiveness figures for the Preethi and Nirodh condom c. b. d. programmes are presented. These show that in 1973 the Nirodh programme was providing a couple-year of protection for $1.78. Comparable evidence on cost performance figures for clinic programmes suggests that c. b. d. marketing programmes are substantially more cost-effective in purely quantitative terms. Finally, the most important future development in this field is the recognition that an appropriate managerial environment for c. b. d. programmes would have a greater demographic impact than any foreseeable development in contraceptive technology.</jats:p>",

Effects of the ‘review and comment’ (R&amp;C) process spawned by this requirement are assessed in the context of water resources planning in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) and the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). The assessment, which relies on data from questionnaires administered to personnel in all Corps districts and SCS state offices in 1974, concerns the extent to which increased coordination and information transfer brought about by the R&amp;C process have influenced decision making. Obstacles serving to impede the functioning of an effective R&amp;C process are also noted.</jats:p>",
