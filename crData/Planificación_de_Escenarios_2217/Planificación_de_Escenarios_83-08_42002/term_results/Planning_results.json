Part 1, Theory of River Basin Planning, is led by an introductory chapter from the editors emphasizing the major human component in the complex sociotechnical attributes of river basin development. They present a forceful argument for a truly interdisciplinary approach to river basin planning. (The appendix subsequently suggests curriculum development for courses in river basin planning.)</jats:p><jats:p>Part 2, River Basin Planning: Environmental Issues, is supported by two chapters: one with a focus on soil conservation, the other on ecosystem protection. The soil conservation chapter by I. Douglas illustrates that slow, inadvertent changes may be more damaging in the long run than immediate, direct effects. It postulates that planning for people perforce will require planning for soil conservation as an ongoing activity. The case for environmental protection is somewhat weak because of the singular example chosen for illustration. The Gunung Mulu National Park in Sarawak, Malaysia, is in a fragile, humid, tropical forest region where any change per se is interpreted as being detrimental.</jats:p>",

The equity of such provision is conceptualised in terms of the institutional setting of supply; the distribution of inherent demand; the distribution of supply units; and spatial differentials in response performance. This conceptual framework, being directly related to the supply/demand process, has far greater power than those adopted in most previous research. Although the present distribution of fire stations in Sydney is relatively dispersed, ‘poorly’ served areas may be found on the urban fringe and in the southwestern sector. With a rapid growth in alarm rates in these areas, a conflict has arisen between the need for centralised services focused on high-demand inner-city areas and the need for dispersed services satisfying minimal service requirements for all. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are only a few studies of business service activities and most have concentrated on the behaviour of these activities in large cities. By taking a wider cross section of urban areas, this study explores some possible sources of variation in the role of business services in local economies with particular reference to the location and control of these services. Low-growth cities with a large proportion of their business services under external control show a limited amount of new-firm formation since indigenous firms are outnumbered by about two to one. Nonindigenous firms are significantly more likely to set up new branches or to relocate existing ones. The ratio of indigenous to nonindigenous business services in each urban area is significant for the location, status, function, and other changes reported by establishments. Many of these changes are a response to market adjustment or a need to ‘colonize’ new areas. The types of change, particularly of location, are also significantly related to office function. Provincial business services have shown a propensity to expand their employment, but this may only reflect the general trend since 1975. The role of London as the location of headquarters controlling provincial business services is far from dominant. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of voluntary sector service provision in local communities has been largely overlooked, but is increasingly critical to the quality of urban life. This paper provides an exploratory analysis of questions about the distribution of voluntary activity within metropolitan regions and the determinants of voluntary service provision levels. A variety of hypotheses concerning the distribution of voluntary resources in the social welfare and community services (SWCS) sector are tested utilizing data on nonprofit organizations and local jurisdictions within the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Results indicate that cities within this region with relatively abundant SWCS resources tend to be older inner-ring working-class suburbs, in contrast to the significantly reduced scale of SWCS activities found in outlying affluent communities, industrial enclaves, and cities with large minority and service-dependent populations. </jats:p>",

The model combines dynamic cost functions, consumer fuel demand equations, and a demographic model, all within the context of a regional econometric model. The model is used to estimate the effects of a graduated fifty-cent gasoline tax on the New York State economy. The gasoline tax revenues are rebated to users in the form of reduced State taxes. The results suggest that this policy would lead to higher State output and income if the inflationary impacts of the tax are minimal. </jats:p>",

This paper is mainly concerned with distributed-lag models, in particular the use of spectral estimators developed by Hannan. A number of previous studies have used the phase statistics from the cross-spectrum as an indication of lead/lag relations between unemployment series, but it is shown here that this is likely to lead to incorrect conclusions. As an empirical example, lead/lag relations between local unemployment in Severnside and the national series are investigated. The correspondence between time-domain (regression) and frequency-domain (spectral) methods of estimating relations between time series is also discussed, using empirical material from both parts of the paper. </jats:p>",

The paper begins by reviewing those aspects of information theory that are pertinent to quadrat analysis, and then a series of results are described which relate the behaviour of the redundancy index to variations in the number of cells used to census the pattern. In particular, it is shown how critical cell sizes correspond to limiting values of the redundancy index, which enables the index value to be interpreted as a pure scale-effect. Last, these methods are illustrated with reference to changing factory-location patterns on Merseyside between 1966 and 1972. </jats:p>",

However, records show that the results of such planning in the last three decades have fallen short of expectations because of various complex factors. Most of the limiting factors are administrative, political, legal, and philosophical, involving premature comprehensive planning, arbitrary selection of plan targets, administrative “red‐tape,” ineffective coordination among water resources related departments, and water ownership conflicts among various states and with neighboring countries. Other constraints are related to a lack of adequate dependable data, the inadequacy of project feasibility studies, and a lack of social and political discipline necessary for adequate mobilization of financial resources.</jats:p>",
