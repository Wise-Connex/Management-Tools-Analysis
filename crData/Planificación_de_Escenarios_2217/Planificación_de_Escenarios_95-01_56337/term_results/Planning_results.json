Ischaemic heart diseases and cancers are the main causes of death for adults in most developed countries. Partly, these diseases are related to diet and other life style variables. The purpose of this article is to discuss some prevention possibilities related to health practices. Empirical data were collected by means of a questionnaire on health status and ‘life style’ among long‐standing members of a Swedish popular movement for physical culture. The principal question was what could be learned for health planning and management. Genetic factors have lately come more in focus as an explanation of untimely death and disease while, for example, life style has been de‐emphasized. There is a risk, thereby, that a purchaser—provider approach, where short‐sighted returns are in focus, will give too low a priority to health promotion.</jats:p>",

The paper then explores how the planning systems of France, Britain, and Hong Kong— representing regulatory, discretionary, and hybrid systems, respectively——cope with uncertainty. It notes that France has developed several ways of circumventing regulations, while Britain has recently placed a new emphasis on plan making in order to reduce uncertainty. The Hong Kong government, as landlord, has had to reconcile its desire to provide long-term security for its developers with a need to respond to change. The paper concludes by suggesting that there needs to be agreement on what level of certainty is required and how decision making may be made accountable. </jats:p>",

Part of the reason for this has been the lack of systematic understanding of the functionalities provided by HTN planning over and above that of partial order planning. In this paper I will describe a generalized algorithm template for partial order planning based on refinement search, and extend it to cover HTN planning. I will use this framework as a basis to (\n            <jats:italic>i</jats:italic>\n            ) discuss the similarities and differences between the HTN and the partial order planning methods, (\n            <jats:italic>ii</jats:italic>\n            ) critically examine the claims regarding the efficiency and expressiveness of HTN planning, and (\n            <jats:italic>iii</jats:italic>\n            ) shed light on several of the less understood features of HTN planning.\n          </jats:p>",

The course condenses material from urban design, planning history, and urban and historical geography. In order to practice urban design and planning, students must be prepared to intervene in an ongoing urbanization process which is not altogether in their or anyone's control. The goal of the course is for students to acquire 1) substantive knowledge of processes of city building—an understanding of the evolution of city form, of the historical basis of the contemporary city, and of the cultural differences between cities—and 2) analytical skills to measure and interpret urban form as it affects access to services, life style, and, eventually, quality of life. The morphogenetic approach serves as the theoretical basis of the course. Its strength lies in its explanation of the characteristics of urban form as the product of city-building processes. Students gain fluency in the vocabulary of forms. They are trained to visualize and measure actual elements of form and to compare their performance. </jats:p>",

It has sponsored training workshops and funded OR studies on issues of priority to both national and local program managers. The program’s recent activities, culminated in the National Research Utilization Conference held in September 1994, were designed to assist in the institutionalization processes. However, more needs to be done to determine how these processes will actually work in specific national and local government agencies and academic and research institutions, and how to support and sustain the processes that do work. The proposed study is intended to form a basis for determining ways to promote and sustain OR in the Philippines. As stated in this report, the study aims to review the experience of recent research activities with attention to the institutionalization process and identify specific issues to be addressed and concrete steps to be taken in the process both at the national and local levels.</jats:p>"

This article examines provider incentives as well as administrative costs, and institutional conditions for successful implementation associated with provider payment alternatives. The alternatives considered are budget reforms, capitation, fee‐for‐service, and case‐based reimbursement. We conclude that competition, whether through a regulated private sector or within a public system, has the potential to improve the performance of any payment method. All methods generate both adverse and beneficial incentives. Systems with mixed forms of provider payment can provide tradeoffs to offset the disadvantages of individual modes. Low‐income countries should avoid complex payment systems requiring higher levels of institutional development.</jats:p>",

Una vision de conjunto de la naturaleza de lenguas de serial se presenta, seguido por una description de la creation y propositos de côdigos manuales de señal y un anâlisis de côdigos tales como lengua planeando. Es sugerido que el desarrollo de côdigos manuales de senal se puede ver como un esfuerzo descarriado que desconoce ambos las bases lingüísticas de lenguas naturales de senal y los derechos de lengua de la sorda como una comunidad cultural y lingüística.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tNek facile komprenebla, nek agrabla vidajo: la evoluo de gestolingvo kiel lingvoplanado\n\t\tLa artikolo diskutas la evoluon de gestolingvoj uzotaj en la edukado de surdaj infanoj kiel ekzemplon de lingvoplanado.

The first two sections describe the key features of the Israeli health care system before the reform, and their strengths and weaknesses. A State Commission of Inquiry, established by the government in 1988, proposed in its 1990 report two different reform strategies, respectively developed by the majority and the minority in it. The Commission diagnoses, recommendations and strategies are assessed and explained in the next sections. Legislators and policy makers opted for the incremental, evolutionary reform strategy, proposed by the minority in the Commission. The essence of the reform strategy being implemented as from 1995 is presented and examined in the penultimate section. In the concluding part, the Israeli experience with the formulation and implementation of a health care reform is discussed.</jats:p>",

While achieving these goals, the IFPS project will support service innovations in the public and nongovernmental sectors, and contraceptive social marketing mechanisms. Baseline information being sought includes desired family size and sex preference among mothers, utilization of health services and immunization of mothers and children, maternal and child health care and delivery practices, contraceptive information and services and satisfaction with health providers, contraceptive use and unmet need, and media exposure and the role of the media in promoting small-family norm. The Operations Research Group, at the request of SIFPSA, has carried out the present baseline survey in the district of Sitapur.

Conducting baseline surveys in 15 selected districts of Uttar Pradesh was the first step in the project. The Uttar Pradesh baseline survey provided critical input by generating important demographic and family welfare program data at the district level. Over and above the 15 districts surveyed, it was decided that a baseline survey would be conducted in Agra district. In Agra, interviewers collected information from 2,864 ever-married women aged 13–49 in urban and rural areas of the district. As noted in this report, the primary aim of the baseline survey was to provide information at the district level for urban and rural areas separately.</jats:p>"

Several measures have been taken to contain the growth and bring a rapid decline in the fertility rate. The Government of India and USAID began the Innovations in Family Planning Services Project under the management of the State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency. The goal was to reduce the fertility rate in Uttar Pradesh by expanding and improving family planning (FP) services. Since there has been differential impact of FP services over the years in the state’s different districts, it was considered desirable to take up the district as a unit and develop an adequate data base for generating suitable intervention programs. Baseline surveys were conducted in 14 districts in different regions of the state. The Centre for Development Research and Training, Madras, conducted the surveys in Ghaziabad and Tehri Garhwal.

The socioeconomic profile is characterized by relatively low levels of per capita income and literacy. Further, assessment of the family planning program and the demographic status as measured by Couple Protection Rate (CPR) and Mortality/Fertility rates marks UP as one of the country’s more demographically disadvantaged states. UP has a relatively higher infant mortality rate, crude death rate, birth rate, and total fertility rate than the country as a whole, whereas CPR is much too low. The district of Gorakhpur falls in the Eastern Region of the state, which on the whole is more disadvantaged than the Western Region. As noted in this report, no systematic surveys have ever been done to provide district-level estimates of fertility and mortality or CPR except in a few districts. The present survey is designed to provide valid estimates of vital rates and CPR at the district level and to fill gaps in the available information on several aspects related to the demographic situation and family planning program.</jats:p>"

It is in this context that the Government of India and the United States Agency for International Development reached an agreement to begin the Innovations in Family Planning Services Project (IFPS) under the management of the State Innovations in Family Planning Services Agency (SIFPSA). In this context, it has been decided to take up baseline surveys in 15 districts spread over the different regions of the state. The work of conducting the surveys in Ghaziabad and Tehri Garhwal districts has been entrusted to the Centre for Development Research and Training, Madras. This report contains the details of the survey conducted in the district of Tehri Garhwal.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, the increasing number of organizations that have studied quality of care in international family planning (FP) programs demonstrates the importance the topic has acquired. To define quality of care in FP, the Bruce–Jain framework of six elements of care (choice of methods, information given to clients, technical competence, interpersonal relations, continuity and follow up, and appropriate constellation of services) have been used as the standard. However, what has been overlooked in this approach is the clients' perspectives of service quality. This study sought to narrow the gap in knowledge about the comparability and consistency in views between clients, providers, and researchers. Thus, this study’s main objective was to define the laypersons' and providers' dimensions of quality of care and compare them with the Bruce-Jain elements. The study was conducted in Kenya between July and September 1994. It was the first part of the Kenyan National Situation Analysis Study (conducted in 1995), and results will provide a guide in the methodology and formulation of the study instruments.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study involved secondary analysis of a substantial set of 1987–88 focus group data from Bangladesh’s Matlab Thana, where the Family Planning and Health Services Project was underway since 1977. The project was highly successful in increasing family planning (FP) acceptance and provided a rich research base for studying the diffusion of FP and its effects. The study involved 36 focus groups with fieldworkers, community women, husbands, educated women, and community leaders. The intent of the present study is to examine the effect of FP on women's status in Bangladesh, and to prepare papers on that topic. Following leads in the data itself, two papers were prepared under this subcontract. One concerns the effect of the FP fieldworkers on the knowledge and attitudes of young, unmarried women toward fertility and FP; the other presents a qualitative analysis of the fertility transition in Bangladesh, contributing to the ongoing debate on whether fertility decline is caused by demand-side or supply-side factors. This report reviews both documents.</jats:p>"

Unfortunately, this will be done in the context of enormous ignorance about most of those species, with limited resources, and with continuing developments that contribute to species’ extinction. In this chapter, I review the role that categorizing species according to their perceived risk of extinction can play, and outline some of the practical advantages and disadvantages of this approach. In particular, I shall focus on the fact that categorizing risk levels is only a first step. Deciding what to do next and developing rational methods for setting priorities will be just as important, and presents additional challenges.</jats:p>",

Helping students to understand death and loss is part of assisting them to become resilient, proactive individuals. Age-appropriate curriculum materials are provided for educating children and teenagers on issues of health, emotional depression, grief, and death. Ways of counseling in schools following the death of a student, teacher, or staff member are explored in detail. Signs of depression and at-risk behavior among teenagers are described as part of a comprehensive approach to prevention, intervention, and postvention concerning death, violence, and self-destructive behavior. The authors share strategies that have proved effective in helping students to focus away from self-destructive, violent single-path solutions to developing positive social skills and alternative plans. Developing a comprehensive school plan in anticipation of a death occurrence and training staff in its implementation greatly reduces emotional stress.</JATS1:p>"

Impressive gains in contraceptive use have been made since 1980, and the contraceptive prevalence rate increased from 24 percent in 1980 to 47 percent in 1992. Egypt’s National Population Policy addresses the nation’s population growth through multiple interventions designed to reduce fertility, including family planning (FP) services. FP accessibility is promoted through a network of public and NG0 FP clinics. A number of years ago, the Egyptian Family Planning Program began using the Raidats Rifiats program to extend services into rural communities. There is concern regarding the program’s ability to recruit women for the clinic-based program. Senior policymakers and program managers need to assess the role Raidats has played within their communities and their contribution to the FP program. The present research provides a comprehensive assessment of the various subsystems functioning in this program. Six governorates were included to represent Egypt’s major four sectors: West and Middle Delta, East Delta, Middle of Republic, and Upper Egypt. Overall, the study highlighted gaps in the existing Raidats system that should be strengthened to improve system performance.</jats:p>"

In Maseru, Lesotho, hospital congestion led the Ministry of Health to decide to build reference centres. To delineate precisely how these centres should operate, research was carried out on the existing system comparing utilization, quality and cost between health centre and hospital outpatient care. The study showed that throughput per clinician at the hospital and the city health centres was similar; that the hospital service saw a greater proportion of adults and more men; that the technical care quality was similar; and, that health centre staff took longer with patients and had higher interpersonal consultation scores. Average costs at the hospital were 39 per cent greater, but, the calculated net costs to the provider at the hospital and at government centres were very similar once user fees had been taken into account. The results questioned the assumptions underlying the decision to build reference centres in Maseru, and also the relevance of a new tier to solve health service delivery problems in the city. The study highlights the need for national and municipal planners to examine carefully existing health services with respect to utilization, quality and cost before adopting urban reference centres as a standard solution to congested hospitals.</jats:p>",

The focus is on understanding why these two countries adopted high-risk offensive strategies during an international confrontation rather than a defensive military stance. The decision to attack or defend did not occur in a political vacuum. The leaders of Austria-Hungary and Germany adopted offensive strategies as a way to achieve their political ambitions. The offensives undertaken by Austria-Hungary and Germany in 1914 thus reflected their political goals as well as the strategic doctrines of war planners. The concluding chapter of this study explores why deterrence failed in 1914.</JATS1:p>"

This paper suggests a decision-theoretic approach to evaluate planning systems that generalizes the role of planning in intelligent systems. The planner is viewed as a source of information that is used by an execution architecture in order to select actions. A planner is only as good as the effect it has on the performance of an operational system. Our approach calls for a clear separation between the planning component and the execution architecture and for evaluation of planning systems within the context of a well-defined command, planning and execution environment. The evaluation is based on the expected utility of the domain histories that are induced by the planning component.</jats:p>",

CBD activities in Kenya are coordinated by the National Council for Population and Development, with support from USAID and other donor agencies. Kenya’s CBD program has been widely publicized because of its success in improving access to FP information and services, and its diversity of organizational structures. USAID would like to review the current situation and possible future directions before designing its CBD strategy for the next five-year bilateral project. The Africa OR/TA II Project was requested to assist in preparing its CBD strategy because of its experience with CBD activities throughout Africa. Following this review, the Africa OR/TA II Project will be coordinating a large-scale field research study to evaluate the impact of CBD in terms of a variety of indicators. This review has provided the first step in preparing for this research study by identifying what is known about CBD in Kenya and highlighting key issues that need addressing. This report presents a wide-ranging review of data currently available on a number of aspects of CBD in Kenya.</jats:p>"

Neither the traditional view of planning as search nor the formalization efforts have been able to provide a basis for a classification scheme.This article explores the idea that a perspective based on Newell's knowledge level can be useful for this task. We present a knowledge-level analysis of classical planning systems in terms of models of the problem-solving methods they used. Rather than reengineering these systems in detail, however, our goal is to show how this type of analysis can help define which roles knowledge may play in planning tasks, and how these roles can be used to compare planning methods in terms of (i) which types of knowledge are used, (ii) how they are structured in what we call\n            <jats:italic>domain models.</jats:italic>\n            As a tool to analyze and represent planning methods we use the KADS methodology.\n          </jats:p>",

However, at the stage when the Act became law, Northern Ireland existed not as an entity but only in name and on paper. Not only had Northern Ireland no parliament and no government: it had no civil service to support and serve it, no police or defence force to enforce whatever laws it might make, protect its people, or defend its territory from possible (and indeed likely) attack, nor had it a judiciary to uphold its laws and administer justice. The problems involved in the creation of Northern Ireland must have seemed daunting, and the sheer size of the task to be undertaken almost overwhelming. Yet within six months of the passage of the Act, a government of Northern Ireland had been formed and had taken office.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tDie Siraiki-Bewegung in Pakistan\n\t\tDer Artikel beschreibt die Entstehung der nationalen Bewegung der Volksgruppe der Siraiki im südlichen pakistanischen Pandschab. Das Gebiet ist wirtschaftlich unterentwickelt, und seine politischen Fuhrer fühlen sich kulturell und wirtschaftlich benachteiligt. Seit den 60er Jahren dient ihnen die Sprache Siraiki als Symbol zur Mobilisierung der offentlichen Meinung gegen diese als ungerecht empfundene Lage. Viele von ihnen meinen, daft die Einrichtung einer selbstandigen Siraiki-Provinz ihnen Gerechtigkeit bringen könnte.\n\t\tWahrend intellektuelle Siraiki die Unterschiede zwischen dem Siraiki und dem Pandschabi betonen, bezeichnen die Pandschabi sie als Dialekt ihrer Sprache und die Siraiki-Bewegung als eine Verschwörung zur Schwächung des Pandschab. Da die Pandschabi die Mehrheit der herrschenden Elite des Landes stellen, kann man die Siraiki-Bewegung als ein Beispiel für einen Machtkampf zwischen Protoelite und Elite infolge ungerechter wirtschaftlicher Entwicklung betrachten.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa sirajka movado en Pakistano\n\t\tLa artikolo priskribas la estigon de la etna-nacia movado de la sirajkoj en la suda pakistana Panĝabio. La regiono estas ekonomie subevoluinta, kaj ĝiaj politikaj gvidantoj opinias esti kulture kaj ekonomie malavantaĝe traktataj. De la 1960-aj jaroj ili uzas la sirajkan lingvon kiel simbolon por direkti la publikan opinion kontraŭ tiu situacio sentata maljusta. Multaj el ili kredas, ke la starigo de memstara provinco Sirajkio povus forigi la maljustecon.\n\t\tDum la sirajkaj intelektuloj emfazas la diferencojn inter la sirajka kaj la pangaba lingvoj, la pangaboj konsideras gin dialekto de la pangaba kaj la sirajkan movadon konspiro por malfortigo de Pangabio. Car la plejmulto de la elito de la lando estas pangaboj, oni povas konsideri la sirajkan movadon kazo de potencolukto inter protoelito kaj elito sekve de maljusta ekonomia evoluigo.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This report contains descriptions of 13 family planning (FP) projects recently implemented in Bangladesh. The results in terms of the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) are analyzed to investigate the degree to which improved FP service delivery in Bangladesh can increase contraceptive use in the present status of demand, investigate the programmatic factors most associated with increased prevalence, and make these projects more widely known. Criteria for inclusion included coverage of a geographic area where household distribution of contraceptive supplies was available, and where at least one measurement of CPR has been made through credible survey efforts since July 1988. The projects varied in design, intensity, programmatic focus, geographic area, implementing agency, and evaluating agency. All were rural or largely so. Primary conclusions are that improvements in the national program can be expected to lead to substantial increases in contraceptive prevalence; increased visitation rates, and greater efforts in basic training, density of fieldworkers, and use of NGO fieldworkers may be particularly effective in meeting unmet demand; although direct provision of services by NGOs seems most associated with high performance, the implication of this for the national program requires careful analysis.</jats:p>"

En la Comunidad Valenciana hay dos pareceres tocante al idiomo autóctona: los catalanistas, que admiten que esa lengua no es otra cosa que el catalan hablado por los vecinos al norte, con las normas lingüísticas del habla de Barcelona, y los valencianistas, que no quieren su propia norma lingufstica y, además, creen que el término apropiado es \"valencià\" y no \"català\" para su idioma. A pesar de esta polemica, a veces violenta, el valenciano no ha llegado a disfrutar de la normalidad lingüística del catalan hablado en Cataluna y en las Islas Baleares. Muchos lingüístas creen que, dado el poco prestigio del valenciano entre los valencianos y la preponderancia del castellano en la región, es bien probable que la lengua deja de ser hablada en Valencia dentro de unas pocas generaciones.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa daŭranta malkonsento pri la Valencia lingvo\n\t\tLa referaĵo esploras la ankoraŭ daŭrantan malkonsenton pri la nomo de la regiona lingvo parolata en la hispana aŭtonoma provinco Valencio. Ekde plej fruaj registroj, oni nomas la varianton de la kataluna lingvo tie parolatan au \"la kataluna\" au \"la Valencia\". Depost la restarigo de demokratio en Hispanio en 1977 kaj la sekva relegigo de la tielnomataj regionaj lingvoj, la malkonsento farigis iom amara, kaj fojfoje gin akompanis perforto. Spite la varman debaton ĉu la norma kataluna de Barcelono au la forte kastiliigita varianto parolata en Valencio farigu la loka normo, la lingvo estas endangerigata en Valencio kaj povus morti.</jats:p>",

The papers in this special issue represent several different approaches to evaluation. The first two papers present detailed analytic and experimental comparisons of particular plan generation algorithms (\"planners\", for short). The third and fourth papers develop formalisms for categorizing planners and the plans they produce; these formalisms are intended to provide a vocabulary for further comparative work that can bridge the gap between formal planning research and planning applications. Finally, the fifth paper argues that planners and plans can only be evaluated in the context of the planning agents that execute the plans, and presents a decision-theoretic approach to evaluating planning agents.</jats:p>",

Analgesics, antibiotics, antimalarials, antihistamine or decongestant preparations (or both), bronchodilators, and scabicides were the 10 most commonly used drugs. Orthopedic, respiratory, gastrointestinal, dermatologic, and ophthalmic conditions, malaria, sexually transmitted diseases, and parasitic infestations were encountered most frequently. Recognition and early treatment of xerophthalmia, trachoma, and onchocerciasis, which are rare in more developed countries but common at tropical latitudes, can prevent the blindness that results from untreated disease progression. Pulsetemperature relationships and fever patterns may offer diagnostic clues to physicians deprived of laboratory support. Important logistic considerations, disease incidences, and selected topics and idiosyncrasies of humanitarian aid missions to tropical communities are discussed in hopes of aiding providers who are planning future relief missions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tThe Equilibrium of Languages in Switzerland\n\t\tThe peace between the different language groups of Switzerland is essentially based on the fact that the majority does not derive advantage of its preponderance. Sometimes it even concedes privileges to the smaller groups, most evidently in the allocation of the budgets for radio and television and in the subsidies for the cultivation of Rhaeto-Romansch and Italian. It is a benefit that the borderlines between the different language units are rather well defined. There are only two bilingual towns, Bienne and Fribourg, and the emergence of linguistic enclaves is prevented. Only in the Grisons is there a strong infiltration of Swiss-German speaking people in traditional Romansch territories. The last census (1990) which did not reveal appreciable changes in the proportion of the major languages, showed a considerable deterioration in the situation of Romansch, a symptom that afflicts the fellow-citizens in other regions very much.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa ekvilibro de la lingvoj en Svislando\n\t\tLa paco inter la diversaj lingvaj grupoj en Svislando cefe bazigas sur la fakto, ke la plimulto rezignas profiti de sia superpezo. Kelkfoje gi ec privilegias la pli malgrandajn grupojn; tio plej frape evidentigas en la distribuo de la bugeto por radio kaj televido profite al la pli malgrandaj lingvoj kaj en la federaciaj subvencioj por la kulturado de la romanĉa kaj itala lingvoj. Estas avantago, ke la limoj inter la lingvaj unuoj estas sufice klaraj. Nur du dulingvaj urboj ekzistas: Biel/Bienne kaj Freiburg/Fribourg. Nur en Grizono infiltras svisgermane parolantaj personoj en tradicie romancajn regionojn. La lasta popolnombrado (1990), kiu generale ne montris notindajn sangojn en la proporcio de la lingvoj, malkasis konsiderindajn malbonigojn en la situacio de la romanĉa lingvo, simptomo kiu tre cagrenas la kunfederacianojn en la aliaj regionoj.</jats:p>",

Apresenta-se inicialmente um apanhado historico-social da padronizaçâo e expansão do português, da distribuiçâo da lingua no mundo atual e do desenvolvimento de suas normas grâficas. O exame do Acordo e do debate do mesmo é feito a partir da análise das diversas posiçôes tomadas por autores/as de artigos jornalísticos e acadêmicos sobre a questâo e dos argumentos por eles/elas usados. Tais argumentos sâo contrastadados com aqueles apresentados por Geerts, van den Broeck e Verdoodt (1977) em anâlise de um caso semelhante. Conclui-se que, apesar da maior parte do debate tratar de questões relativas à eficiência lingüística, o Acordo e seus proponentes sâo guiados primordialmente por critérios relativos à eficiência política e diplomática.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa debatebla ortografia interkonsento lusobrazila\n\t\tOni ci tie prezentas kazon de lingvoplanado laû korpusa kultivado: la Ortografian Interkonsenton Lusobrazilan por portugallingvaj landoj, subskribitan en 1990 de reprezentantoj de ciuj sep landoj, kies oficiala lingvo estas la portugala. Oni priskribas la socihistorian fonon rilate la normigon kaj disvastigon de la portugala lingvo, la hodiaûan mondan distribuon de la lingvo, kaj la evoluon de giaj literumaj normoj. La aûtoro diskutas la Interkonsenton kaj la postan debaton per analizo de la prenitaj starpunktoj kaj la argumentoj uzataj de aûtoroj en elektitaj kleraj kaj popularaj artikoloj. Tiujn argumentojn oni kontrastigas kun tiuj prezentitaj de Geerts, van den Broeck kaj Verdoodt (1977) en ilia raporto pri simila kazo. La aûtoro konkludas ke, kvankam la debato rilatas demandojn de lingva efikeco, la Interkonsento kaj giaj proponantoj cefe interesigas pri politika kaj diplomata efikeco.</jats:p>",

The scheme is based on an intermediate representation called the view graph, whose nodes correspond to the views whereas the labeled edges represent the movements leading from one view to another. By means of a graph theoretical reconstruction method, the view graph is shown to carry complete information on the topological and directional structure of the maze. Path planning can be carried out directly in the view graph without actually performing this reconstruction. A neural network is presented that learns the view graph during a random exploration of the maze. lt is based on an unsupervised competitive learning rule translating temporal sequence (rather than similarity) of views into connectedness in the network. The network uses its knowledge of the topological and directional structure of the maze to generate expectations about which views are likely to be encountered next, improving the view-recognition performance. Numerical simulations illustrate the network's ability for path planning and the recognition of views degraded by random noise. The results are compared to findings of behavioral neuroscience. </jats:p>",

Environmental planning control cannot hope to resolve issues of global resource usage, but should address issues of the efficient use of the resources at local and national levels, the minimization of environmental damage and the effective reuse of sites. Market‐led central government policy generally avoids issues of resource management, but some new policy guidance does aim at alternative depletion strategies. The operational phases of mineral extraction can be made more sustainable if there is the political will to enforce high standards of environmental protection. The restoration of worked out sites presents major opportunities for sustainable development ideas. A major current problem lies in old, inadequate mineral permissions; their updating is an urgent priority. The relationship between mineral extraction and sustainability as a model of planned resource use and replacement is redefined.</jats:p><jats:p>The Sustainability Research Centre at the University of Central England (UCE) has been established, with pump‐priming finance, to provide a framework for a focused research effort into the theory and practice of sustainability as a fundamental criterion for the planning and implementation of land development proposals. It has been formed by a team of lecturers from the Schools of Planning, Architecture, Housing and Estate Management at UCE; it is intended to promote an interdisciplinary approach to the research. Immediate objectives include: publication of the proceedings of the recent conference entitled ‘Struggling with Sustainability’; the establishment of a sustainability database; and extending support for an established research project into policy–action relationships in minerals planning. This current paper is one product of the latter initiative.</jats:p>",

It was not simply rhetoric. As the years passed, we committed a growing portion of our foreign aid to that end. The decision to link U.S. foreign-policy objectives with the subsidy of family planning and population control was truly exceptional in that it explicitly aimed at altering the demographic structure of foreign countries through long-term intervention. No nation had ever set in motion a foreign-policy initiative of such magnitude. Its ultimate goal was no less than to alter the basic fertility behavior of the entire Third World! Whether one views this goal as idealistic and naive or as arrogant and self-serving, the project was truly of herculean proportions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although most managers and researchers believe planning is beneficial for organizations, many research studies have failed to prove these benefits are significant. Methodological problems have certainly detracted from researchers' abilities to show a planning-performance linkage.</jats:p><jats:p>The article deals with definitional issues about planning and five planning modes. Contingency propositions are developed to link the planning modes with several strategic and contextual situations. For example, it is argued that, while (1) prospector-type strategies are best implemented with externally oriented planning systems like longer-range planning or strategic planning, (2) defender-type strategies are better with internal orientations, like comprehensive planning or implementation-oriented planning. In addition to strategy, other contingency variables examined are user sector, purchase frequency and the stage of product life cycle in which the planning is undertaken.</jats:p><jats:p>Planning has adherents as well as detractors among managers and academics. Both sides of the debate can be seen in Mintzberg's (1994a &amp; 1994b) recent publications on the “rise and fall” and “fall and rise” of strategic planning. Many have pointed to planning's benefits to organisations (eg Ansoff, 1977; Bryson, 1988; Langley, 1988). Yet research studies have failed to prove that these benefits are significant (eg Fredrickson &amp; Mitchell, 1984; Fulmer &amp; Rue, 1974; Grinyer &amp; Norburn, 1975; Powell, 1992; Robinson &amp; Pearce, 1983; Pearce, Freeman, &amp; Robinson, 1987). Pearce, et al. (1987) noted a lack of attention to contextual influences; inconsistencies in operationalisation of planning; measurement validity problems; ignoring implementation factors, time frames, and size effects as the methodological problems in this area of research that may have affected researchers' chances of finding the expected link. Rhyne (1986: 423) also argued that some ambiguous findings were attributable to “the manner in which planning was actually carried out, rather than to planning itself”.</jats:p><jats:p>Another possible weakness in the “planning” research is that it has not discriminated between modes or approaches to planning. The assumption seems to have been that “more planning is better,” or that longer-term, strategic planning should work in all or most contexts (Bryson, 1988; Eadie, 1983; James, 1984). The present article questions this view and suggests that less sophisticated planning may be better suited to some contexts and more elaborate approaches to others. Robinson and Pearce (1983) support such an approach, suggesting that less formalised planning may be preferable in certain situations.</jats:p><jats:p>The article builds on Hofer's (1975) “contingency theory of business strategy,” as well as on Hambrick and Lei's (1985) “prioritization of contingency variables.” From a theoretical standpoint, a contingency approach is particularly well suited to strategy-related research (Galbraith &amp; Kazanjian, 1986; Hofer, 1975) and this approach could hold the solution to an understanding of the elusive planning-performance link. Although past planning research has failed to provide conclusive evidence that a given planning system helps performance in all situations, certain planning systems may work well in some contexts but not in others.</jats:p><jats:p>This article begins with a brief discussion of planning and some definitions of different planning modes. A number of contingency propositions are then developed to link these planning modes with variables that are of interest to contemporary management researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Strategic collection planning is a relatively new concept for zoos. Until recently, personal preference, availability, and competition determined which species or subspecies were acquired. In the last few years, however, there have been attempts to employ systematic criteria for taxon selection that better serve conservation objectives. Planning currently occurs at three levels: global, regional, and institutional. The current planning process is reviewed and recommendations are made for ways the process might be improved. An efficient, economical, and effective collection planning process is critical if modern, professionally managed zoological institutions are to make a significant impact on wildlife and ecosystem conservation. Rather than selecting taxa solely on the possibility of a future reintroduction, serious consideration should be given to the ability of a species or subspecies to contribute to more immediate conservation goals, including public education, fund raising to support field conservation, and scientific research. Because resources are limited, perhaps zoos should focus their long‐term breeding programs primarily on flagship species—that is, those that have the potential to excite public attention and help to protect habitat and other taxa—rather than on a broad array of species that are currently endangered. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ARCO Marine currently operates ten tankers which move crude oil from Valdez, Alaska to West Coast ports of the United States. These tankers range in size from 70 000 to 265 000 dwt and operate throughout the year in the harsh environment of the North Pacific Ocean. All of the ships have experienced fatigue and slamming related structural damage. Fatigue damage of structural details occurs from cyclic loading as the ship hull girder flexes in response to the seaway. Damage to local bow structure results from slamming, which is a high magnitude impulse load that induces a high frequency response in the hull girder. Because of this high frequency response, slamming also contributes significantly to fatigue damage. With the goal of minimizing this structural damage, ARCO Marine initiated the Hull Monitoring Program with Ocean Systems Inc. in mid-1992 to develop an onboard computer-based Decision Support System (DSS) that conveys information to the shipmaster to aid in avoiding encounters with ship damaging seas. There are three basic sources of information to the DSS: weather forecasting, analytic and empirical seakeeping computations, and instrumentation feedback. An instrumentation package was installed on the ARCO California and continuously recorded ship motion and hull girder responses throughout its five 1992/93 winter voyages. Analysis of the recorded data resulted in several significant findings that validate the need for an onboard DSS. The Hull Monitoring Program built on the success of the 1990 ARCO Tanker Slamming Study [1] and has resulted in the conceptual design of a prototype DSS ready for implementation during the 1993/94 winter voyages. This paper describes the 1992/93 instrumentation package and data acquisition process, presents many of the significant findings, introduces the concept of improved passage planning, and discusses plans for the onboard implementation of the prototype system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tWhich Language First? For a European Community Experiment Using Esperanto\n\t\tIn view of the European Community's attempts to encourage its citizens to learn each others' languages, the authors have taken a new look at Europe-wide experiments on the role of Esperanto in facilitating language learning.\n\t\tThey review all experiments carried out this century on the use of Esperanto as a preparatory aid in language learning. A critical examination of the results obtained shows that in only a few cases, for instance in Halloran's experiment, were these achieved by accurate scientific methods. In that example, however, the value of Esperanto in facilitating language learning was not clearly proved.\n\t\tBesides this, the authors discuss the assumptions on which those experiments were based, and argue that it is necessary to set out from a different theoretical starting point. They refer particularly to the ideas of I. Szerdahelyi, which were formulated in the 1960s. They argue that the degree of difficulty in learning a second foreign language after Esperanto depends on linguistic affinities between the mother tongue, Esperanto, and the language concerned.\n\t\tOn the basis of this hypothesis they present a plan for a possible experiment to be carried out on a European scale, which would measure when and to what extent Esperanto could genuinely aid language learning. In this way they hope to avoid the oversimplification which has unfortunately been all too frequent in earlier experiments.\n\t\tFinally they emphasize the importance of this experiment as a step towards the desirable goal of a multilingual Europe.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tKiun lingvon unue? Por tuteŭropa eksperimento kiu utiligu Esperanton\n\t\tLa aûtoroj enkadrigas la ideojn pri tuteŭropaj eksperimentoj pri la lernfaciliga rolo de Esperanto en la nuntempajn klopodojn de la Eŭropa Komunumaro instigi la civitanojn de la membraj statoj pli bone lerni pli multajn lingvojn de aliaj eŭropaj landoj.\n\t\tIli rekonsideras ciujn eksperimentojn faritajn dum ci tiu jarcento pri la lernfaciliga rolo (propedeŭtikeco) de la internacia lingvo Esperanto kaj kritike ekzamenas la rezultojn, kiuj en nur kelkaj kazoj (ekzemple en la eksperimento de Halloran) estas sciencnivele tre akurate atingitaj. En tiu kazo, aliflanke, ili ne estas nete por la lernfaciligaj ecoj de la internacia lingvo.\n\t\tHi, krome, diskutas la teorian bazon de tiuj eksperimentoj kaj la neceson ekiri de alimaniere formulita teoria bazo, kiu cefe apogigas sur la ideoj de I. Szerdahelyi eldiritaj jam en la 60-aj jaroj. Temas esence pri la lingvo-tipaj rilatoj inter la gepatra lingvo, la internacia lingvo kaj la poste lernota fremda lingvo, kiuj respondecas pri pli granda au pli malgranda lernfaciligo.\n\t\tSurbaze de tiu teorio ili reformulas eblan planon por tuteŭropa eksperimento, kiu povus mezuri kiom kaj kie la internacia lingvo efektive estas lernfaciliga, preter la tro generalaj asertoj, kiujn oni de tempo al tempo renkontas.\n\t\tLa graveco de la rezultoj por la estonta laŭdezire multlingva Eûropo estas fine substrekata.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The AI planning field has a long history of introducing yet another search algorithm that is believed to be the best in all domains. Some recent examples are NONLIN, TWEAK and SNLP. In this paper we show, by directly comparing the above three planners, that the quest for an overall winner is doomed to fail. We first argue that these three planners differ in a variety of ways, including methods for termination check, causal-link protection, and subgoal selection. These differences entail different search behaviors in terms of factors such as the branching factor, the search depth and the time spent by the algorithm on each search node. Furthermore, the search behavior is closely related to the characteristics of the problem domain in which a planner is operating. In this paper we identify one such domain feature, expressed as the ratio of the number of negative threats to the number of positive threats. We present an artificial domain where we can control this ratio and show that in fact the planners show radically different performance as the ratio is varied in this domain. The implication of this result for someone implementing a planning system is that the most appropriate algorithm will depend on the types of problems to be solved by the planner.</jats:p>",

La analogio, kvankam instrua, estas serioze mankohava. Malgraŭ fruaj klopodoj en Suda Koreio anstataŭigi ideogramojn per sistemo plene hangul, kontraŭuloj de la reformo sukcesis reenkonduki la ĉinajn ideogramojn per montro al la senintencaj konsekvencoj de la reformo, kaj per argumentado, ke la rolo de la registaro estas sekvi, ne gvidi, la socion. En Norda Koreio, kie la publika opinio estas malpli décida faktoro, oni nuligis similan reformon, kun malpli videblaj efikoj. Kvankam nordkoreaj eldonajoj aperas tute lau hangul-sistemo, la utiligo de la skribsistemo estas apogata de plena edukado pri cinaj ideogramoj.\n\t\tEl la korea ekzemplo la lerninda leciono ne estas, ke la cina lingvo povas au ne povas esti skribat a per fonetika skribo, sed ke por sukcesigi la reformon oni devas solvi certajn lingvajn problemojn.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Although most managers and researchers believe planning is beneficial for organizations, many research studies have failed to prove these benefits are significant. Methodological problems have certainly detracted from researchers' abilities to show a planning-performance linkage.</jats:p><jats:p>The article deals with definitional issues about planning and five planning modes. Contingency propositions are developed to link the planning modes with several strategic and contextual situations. For example, it is argued that, while (1) prospector-type strategies are best implemented with externally oriented planning systems like longer-range planning or strategic planning, (2) defender-type strategies are better with internal orientations, like comprehensive planning or implementation-oriented planning. In addition to strategy, other contingency variables examined are user sector, purchase frequency and the stage of product life cycle in which the planning is undertaken.</jats:p><jats:p>Planning has adherents as well as detractors among managers and academics. Both sides of the debate can be seen in Mintzberg's (1994a &amp; 1994b) recent publications on the “rise and fall” and “fall and rise” of strategic planning. Many have pointed to planning's benefits to organisations (eg Ansoff, 1977; Bryson, 1988; Langley, 1988). Yet research studies have failed to prove that these benefits are significant (eg Fredrickson &amp; Mitchell, 1984; Fulmer &amp; Rue, 1974; Grinyer &amp; Norburn, 1975; Powell, 1992; Robinson &amp; Pearce, 1983; Pearce, Freeman, &amp; Robinson, 1987). Pearce, et al. (1987) noted a lack of attention to contextual influences; inconsistencies in operationalisation of planning; measurement validity problems; ignoring implementation factors, time frames, and size effects as the methodological problems in this area of research that may have affected researchers' chances of finding the expected link. Rhyne (1986: 423) also argued that some ambiguous findings were attributable to “the manner in which planning was actually carried out, rather than to planning itself”.</jats:p><jats:p>Another possible weakness in the “planning” research is that it has not discriminated between modes or approaches to planning. The assumption seems to have been that “more planning is better,” or that longer-term, strategic planning should work in all or most contexts (Bryson, 1988; Eadie, 1983; James, 1984). The present article questions this view and suggests that less sophisticated planning may be better suited to some contexts and more elaborate approaches to others. Robinson and Pearce (1983) support such an approach, suggesting that less formalised planning may be preferable in certain situations.</jats:p><jats:p>The article builds on Hofer's (1975) “contingency theory of business strategy,” as well as on Hambrick and Lei's (1985) “prioritization of contingency variables.” From a theoretical standpoint, a contingency approach is particularly well suited to strategy-related research (Galbraith &amp; Kazanjian, 1986; Hofer, 1975) and this approach could hold the solution to an understanding of the elusive planning-performance link. Although past planning research has failed to provide conclusive evidence that a given planning system helps performance in all situations, certain planning systems may work well in some contexts but not in others.</jats:p><jats:p>This article begins with a brief discussion of planning and some definitions of different planning modes. A number of contingency propositions are then developed to link these planning modes with variables that are of interest to contemporary management researchers and practitioners.</jats:p>",

E1 autor utiliza el voto por condado a favor del inglés (variable dependiente) para defender cinco hipôtesis: la racial (los anglos contra los latinos), la étnica (los negros contra los latinos), la económica (la clase de menores ingresos contra los latinos), la politica (los republicanos contra los latinos), y la cultural (el indigenismo contra los latinos). Como variables independientes el autor incluye por cada estado los porcentajes de poblaciôn latina, negra, con education universitaria, por debajo de la línea oficial de pobreza, y rural, el ingreso medio familiar y el total de poblaciôn de cada una de ellas, además del voto por Ronald Reagan en 1984. Las hipôtesis racial y cultural no son validas; la rivalidad étnica emerge solo en Alabama; la hipôtesis de clases esta sostenida por relaciones negativas con el nivel cultural. Pero es la hipôtesis politica la que ofrece la explication mas convincente, ya que el apoyo a Reagan da el pronóstico mas seguro para el voto por la oficialización del inglés a través de los cinco estados.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tVoĉdonado en kvin statoj en referendumoj pri oficialigo de la angla lingvo:\n\t\tkia reago kontraŭ hispanparolantoj?\n\t\tVocdonantoj en Alabamo, Arizono, Florido, Kalifornio kaj Kolorado aprobis referendumojn, kiuj igis la anglan ilia oficiala lingvo. La aûtoro uzas la laûprovincan vocnombron subtenan al la angla (dependa varianto) por provi kvin hipotezojn: rasa (angla kontraŭ hispana), etna (nigra kontraŭ hispana), ekonomia (malaltklasa kontraŭ hispana), politika (respublikana kontraŭ hispana), kaj kultura (indigenisma kontraŭ hispana). Kiel nedependajn variantojn la aŭtoro enmetas: la procentaĵon en ciu provinco kiu estas hispana, nigra, universitatnivele klerigita, sub la nivelo de malriceco, kaj kampara; la mezan familian enspezon; la kompletan nombron de enloĝantoj; kaj la nombron de vocoj por Ronald Reagan en 1984. La rasaj kaj kulturaj hipotezoj ne validigas; etna rivaleco aperas nur en Alabamo; la klasa hipotezo estas apogata de negativa rilato kun la kleriga nivelo. Sed la politika hipotezo proponas la plej konvinkan klarigon en tio, ke subteno al Reagan estas la plej konsekvenca prognozanto de vocdonado por oficialigo de la angla trans ciuj kvin statoj.</jats:p>",

The new evidence, however, both supports and conflicts with previous work. This paper represents the first stage in a series of numerical experiments designed to explore the nature and extent of scale and zonation effects. Results from a series of carefully controlled statistical simulations are reported. It is concluded that there definitely are aggregation effects separate from effects that can be attributed to changing the definition of the spatial process. These effects, however, vary with the statistic calculated. Means and variances are resistant to aggregation effects, whereas regression coefficients and correlation statistics exhibit dramatic effects. In summary, the world of spatial analysis as it relates to the modifiable areal unit problem is not entirely well-behaved, but neither is it completely random and ill-defined. </jats:p>",

How each technique can be applied to logistics strategy studies is discussed and a new integrated modeling framework is proposed.\nThe authors have been involved in the development of STRATOVISION, a Decision Support and Modeling System for Logistics Strategy Planning (known in Coopers &amp; Lybrand as LSS‐Vision). Geographic information, object‐oriented philosophy and advanced visual interactive modeling capabilities allow the user to represent a strategic scenario and interact in an intuitive and friendly way. The system includes “what‐if” simulation, heuristics, optimization algorithms and analytic models, which provide visual feedback and interaction to analyst and decision maker.</jats:p>",

The model parameters were correlated by a power law model. A numerical simulator was developed for linear flow to predict changes in core properties due to acidizing. Values from the simulator were verified by experimental results. This simulator was subsequently extended to radial flow, and therefore can be used to simulate field acid jobs of sandstone formations.</jats:p>"

Three operating factors—Master Production Schedule (MPS) volume variation, MPS mix variation, and setup time/lot size—clearly affect system choice. All systems performed well under Justin‐Time (JIT) conditions; there was no advantage to Kanban. Under the mixed conditions of high MPS variation, but small setup time/lot sizes, PBC produced superior performance compared to Kanban and MRP. Under non‐JIT conditions, MRP was seen as clearly more effective. Finally, the results indicate that when conditions permit very small lot sizes relative to requirements, Kanban may perform best, even when MPS variation is high.</jats:p>",

Students showed improvement in the two primary target behaviors of planning time and holistic (quality) score following instruction in the web technique, but showed inconsistent results for the other target behaviors of number of words, thoughtunits, density factor, sentence types (fragments, simple, compound, compound/complex), and mechanics (spelling, capitalization, and punctuation). analysis of data included both visual-graphic and mean-to-mean comparisons across phases and individuals. Research to further develop and define the effectiveness of the story web technique as well as other writing instruction strategies is recommended. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The mantra of health care reform in hospitals in the United States and elsewhere, the spiralling costs of health care, and the development of diagnostic‐related groups (DRGS) that define health services as “products” are influencing the strategic role of operations planning and control in hospital delivery systems. We developed a new operations planning and control system that we call “Hospital Resource Planning” (HRP). This system is based on the concept of DRGS and the familiar concept of manufacturing resources planning (MRP‐II). TO determine the potential feasibility of HRP, we gathered longitudinal data from two hospitals, one 300‐bed community hospital and one 1,100‐bed teaching hospital. Our exploratory study indicated that while the concept of MRP‐II can be transferred to hospitals, the traditional MRP logic has shortcomings. HRP advances prior research in three ways: (1) consideration of DRGS as products with a bill of resources structure that simultaneously incorporates both capacity and materials resources, (2) implementation of a hospital‐wide (versus a functional) planning and control'system, and (3) gross‐to‐net requirements logic based on notions of treatment staging. Other feasibility issues that we addressed pertain to a stochastic bill of resources, trends toward hospital product standardization, and the coordination of a central planning system with decentralized decision making. The paper concludes with a description of areas for future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on Fordism, industrial districts and flexible specialisation all emphasise a new role for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and an increasing globalisation of the marketplace. Special focus has been directed towards the increasing externalisation of tasks and a corresponding increase in cooperative arrangements or networking. This paper reports from a Scandinavian empirical study of the internationalisation of SMEs, their use of external resources, and in what sense local resources are mobilised in the process of internationalisation. Relevant literature is surveyed and a conceptual model on internationalisation is developed. In this model local business environment, the internal resources of the firm, the quality of the manager, and the ability of the firm to make use of external resources explain the export behaviour of the firm. Four different regions were included in a quasi-experimental design, each including their population of SMEs in the mechanical and wood product sector. The empirical part of the paper is mostly descriptive and includes analyses of the structural differences between the SME populations in the four regions and a report on their involvement in subcontracting, interfirm relations, and their use of producer services. Next the export behaviour is analysed and a simple analysis of the model ends the paper. </jats:p>",

The passage of this act spawned the creation of the Endangered Species Program of the US. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). Under the Act, the USFWS has responsibility for implementing many provisions of the Act: listings, consultations, enforcement of prohibitions and recovery planning. Recovering threatened and endangered species, as well as other declining species yet to be listed, is accomplished through many of the activities that occur under the auspices of the Act, not only through the formal recovery planning process. The Act is fundamentally an instrument for ecosystem conservation, although this aspect of the Act is often over‐looked. Planning and implementing an ecosystem approach to conservation activities is a priority for the USFWS, not only for threatened and endangered species but for all wildlife. The recent emphasis on regional habitat conservation planning and the development of regional and multi‐species recovery plans are indicative of the priority placed on sound ecosystem conservation planning. All of these processes are implemented with the participation of the potentially affected communities and state wildlife management agencies through a public review process. State conservation agencies are part of the process through a special grant programme.</jats:p>",

However, rapid and often unpredictable change has contributed to the inequity, inefficiency, and rising cost of health care. This paper outlines why a needs-based approach to assessing any new technology in the health sector is essential. To respond to changing needs, capacities within the health care system, several of which are described here, must be strengthened. Needs-based technology planning and implementation is affordable and feasible and is crucial in order that both health as a basic human right and good health at low cost can be attained.</jats:p>"

Traditionally, planning in orthopaedics is carried out in 2D, which means that a surgeon may draw directly onto an X-Ray, thus neglecting the third dimension totally. The IAO, together with the Orthopaedic University Clinic Heidelberg (OUK), has developed an application for the planning of osteotomy operations. The surgeon, with the aid of tracked shutter-glasses and a 6D input device, is able to view and rotate the femur and the hip joint. The user can view a simulated X-Ray of the bones, determine the 2D-CCD angle, and allow the computer to perform the osteotomy automatically. The user is also able to view a section through the hip joint and thus offer an opinion on the gap in the joint. After entering the relevant angles and height for the osteotomy, the computer carries out the simulation and displays all the data on the screen.</jats:p>"

It is found that even though the use of OR techniques in current standard MPC packages is rather restricted, there is a potential for utilizing more OR techniques in computer‐aided MPC systems, at least in theory. In practice, OR‐related techniques are more often developed as stand‐alone systems for decision support as a complement to the MPC system. In this paper, specific OR techniques are discussed for specific MPC problems in terms of applicability and the appropriate type of software solution; none at all, stand‐alone system or integrated part of the MPC system.</jats:p>",

The paper reports part of wider research intended to construct a framework for modelling the planning and control of multiple task work. The function of the framework is to support the solution of design problems associated with the performance of interactive planning and control worksystems. The study reported here used an initial version of the framework, based on a study of secretarial office administration, to construct a model of medical reception work. An observational study collected protocol data concerning a medical reception worksystem, comprising two receptionists and various office devices; its domain of application, comprising doctors, patients, their appointments, medical records etc.; and its performance, comprising the quality of medical reception work and the costs to the receptionists of performing that work. The data were then used in conjunction with the planning and control framework to construct the model of medical reception. The model includes physical and abstract structures and behaviours of the medical reception worksystem, as well as physical and abstract objects of its domain of application. Of particular interest for the solution of design problems is the model's differentiation of plan types into task plans, procedure plans, and activity plans. These plan types were used to extend the framework for the planning and control of multiple task work. The paper concludes with a brief illustration of how the model of medical reception might be used to support the solution of interactive worksystem design problems as they relate to performance. Future work to develop further the framework of planning and control of multiple task work and its application are discussed.</jats:p>",

The secret of successful business planning is to use it in appropriate contexts as one aspect of a more comprehensive repertoire of strategic leadership approaches and to avoid the pitfalls which detract from its otherwise efficacy.</jats:p>",

The current Dutch Nature Conservation Policy Plan proposes a spatial network consisting of existing nature reserves, nature redevelopment areas and corridor zones. One of the objectives is to stop the assumed decline of biodiversity due to fragmentation. In this contribution we show that breeding birds are affected by the spatial distribution of their habitat. We also show how problems due to fragmentation can be solved by integrating landscape ecological research data Into planning procedures. Fragmented bird populations show metapopulation characteristics, dependent on the degree of fragmentation. This can be concluded from pattern studies, in which presence or absence patterns are correlated with spatial characteristics. Metapopulation dynamics were used, and the frequency of local extinction and of recolonization were related to size of habitat patches and spatial position in the landscape. The conclusion is that, depending on the spatial scale, landscape fragmentation is a threat to birds.

This is particularly true with respect to infrastructure planning and finance. Recently, the allocation criteria for capital grants to local governments have been substantially revised, nearly every year, to reflect long lasting concerns regarding differences in interregional development needs and resources. In addition, the level of funding for local government investment has risen dramatically to support increased local responsibility in planning. Most development spending does not pass through local budgets, however. In either case, the project planning process has remained firmly under the direction of the central government's technical ministries.</jats:p><jats:p>Infrastructure investment thus tends to be segmented, not only by sector, but also by funding source. The rate at which these two factors balance off in current practice does not indicate a strong commitment to effective decentralization. The article suggests that greater regional government participation in the national planning process would be beneficial. To deal with the fragmented nature of sectoral planning is more problematic, as a more integrated approach would in the long term require either a new layer of bureaucracy or a substantial reorganization of the technical ministries. In the shorter term, a gradual shift toward general purpose grants would also generate regional development plans more consistent with the goals of decentralization while maintaining substantial central control and oversight.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The property in some random utility models that the distribution of achieved utility is invariant across alternatives (the invariance property) is noteworthy as it applies to the multinomial logit model as well as to its generalization: the generalized extreme-value (GEV) models. GEV models constitute the most versatile tool yet known for dealing with discrete choice situations with a structure of similarity—that is, statistical dependence—among alternatives. The invariance property is obviously violated in practice for heterogeneous populations. Therefore it has been argued that invariance constitutes a major problem for GEV models. In contrast these authors argue that invariance is a useful theoretical concept precisely by bringing out heterogeneity. Further, multiple segment GEV models are a suitable tool for dealing with heterogeneity—both theoretically and pragmatically. The class of random utility models possessing the invariance property was characterized by Robertson and Strauss; called the RS class here. However, their proof was not complete. An alternative representation of the RS class is suggested based on the notion of additive homogeneity. This new representation enables the authors to prove the RS characterization theorem and to simplify and systematize the proofs of many other results on RS—and specifically GEV—models. Also, in the new representation, the characterization is naturally stated in terms of the choice probabilities, and of the probability distribution of maximum utility. Assuming that the distribution of actual choices is observable, the choice probabilities are particularly empirically meaningful. This motivates a study of the conditions for a choice probability structure to be RS representable. For the binary choice case conditions that are both necessary and sufficient are given. </jats:p>",

In particular, little is known about the stability of the IMPLAN and REMI multipliers across the different versions of the models. The difficulty in comparing the multipliers derives from problems in benchmarking or standardizing the models, and this problem has been compounded by the release of new versions in recent years. Therefore, in this paper the current and previous versions of the IMPLAN and REMI models are compared. It is found that apparent changes in the multipliers in each model result from undocumented or poorly documented changes in the vendor default values of the available options for calculating the multipliers, not from structural changes in the models. The use of benchmarked versions of each model in the comparison, then, provides evidence on the stability of the multipliers of the models, and forms the basis for clarifying the misinterpretations of results in some of the published evaluations. </jats:p>",

Before mandibular distraction is embarked on, the extent of the deficiency of the mandible is assessed. The length of the vertical ramus and body are measured on cephalometric radiographs or three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) scans. Deficiency of the length of the mandible is calculated. The position of the pin placement angle (from the horizontal ramus) is calculated by means of the following formula: 180 degrees minus mandibular angle times vertical ramus deficiency divided by total deficiency. Placing the pins correctly will result in correction of the vertical ramus and body deficiency of the mandible and the excessively obtuse angle of the mandible will become more acute. </jats:p>",

Only seventeen of 239 (7·1%) nulliparae had ever used an FP method, compared with 170 of 434 (39·2%) parous subjects. Education of mother and of husband were independently and significantly associated with FP ever-use. Seventeen (4·9%) of 347 women who had a surviving child, had not breast-fed the child. The interval between the birth of the surviving child and the start of the index pregnancy was significantly associated with the duration of breast-feeding; the longer the duration of breast-feeding, the longer the inter birth interval.</jats:p>",

With a concentration on the subnational scale, the notion of localised modes of regulation is critically examined. With a view to operationalising some of these regulationist concepts, an analysis of the geographical contradictions of Thatcherism is presented. Thatcherism, it is suggested, should be interpreted as a failed or failing regulatory experiment, the contradictions of which are manifest in a variety of ways, including in the geographical sphere—in the collapse of the economy of the South East of England (Thatcherism's ‘heartland’ region) and in Britain's continuing crisis of uneven development. There is scope, it is argued, further to spatialise regulation theory through methodological refinement, and through analyses of regional restructuring and crisis. </jats:p>",

We introduce the notion of the satellite industrial district, comprised of branch operations of nonlocally based corporations, as an example of a rapidly growing industrial district distinct from Marshallian and Italianate forms, and argue with evidence from South Korea that these types of districts may predominate, especially in developing countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The impacts of hydropower developments on local environment, ecology, and socio-economics, has influenced, and will continue to influence, the efficacy in decisionmaking and planning/design processes. Big dams have several disadvantages: (a) high costs, (b) possible collapse, (c) evaporation loss, (d) flooding of prime agricultural land, (e) siltation of reservoir, (f) salt-water intrusion in coastal areas, (g) deforestation and ‘greenhouse’ effect, and (h) destruction of habitat for rare species. We must refine our environmental understanding of how hydropower development affects species, both individually and in their interactions with each other. The utter dependence of organisms on appropriate environments is what frustrates most attempts to proceed with development and still protect ecosystems and wider ecocomplexes. Conservation objectives must be integrated with other objectives in formulating national and other policies, before they crystallize into projects and programmes. When ecological factors are considered only at the end of the process, they are liable to be viewed as obstructing development, which can be disastrously wrong. But if integrated at the basic level of decision-making, they can positively guide development most propitiously and beneficially. Translated to the global context, this is best served by holistic thinking.</jats:p>"

Con el propósito de proveer un modelo para cultivo de maní, válido para esas aplicaciones, se procedió a la realización de ensayos con ese cultivo en el área de Carnerillo y de Río Cuarto, en la provincia de Córdoba (Argentina). Con los datos fenológicos, fenométricos, meteorológicos y de suelos, obtenidos de tres campañas agrícolas en cada lugar, se ajustó el modelo PNUTGRO V1.02 de maní. Las evaluaciones del comportamiento del modelo en ambos lugares geográficos mostraron una adecuada estimación de las fechas de los estados fenológicos. El rendimiento de grano en Río Cuarto fue estimado con un error de 9,6 %, mientras que en Carnerillo fue de 18,8 %. Los errores en la simulación de la biomasa del cultivo fueron mayores, llegando al 32 % en Río Cuarto y al 16 % en Carnerillo. Las bondades encontradas, principalmente en la simulación del estado del cultivo y en el rendimiento en grano, plantean el uso de este modelo como promisorio.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of this study was to establish the efficacy of standardized treatment planning for high dose rate (HDR) vaginal cuff brachytherapy in order to simplify and shorten the brachytherapy procedure. Two separate but related studies are presented. The first examined the reproducibility of treatment planning by assessing interoperator variability. This provided a baseline assessment of variability to evaluate standardized treatment planning in the second study. The second study examined interpatient variability in which the treatment plans of 20 patients were investigated by two different treatment methods. The first method used the dosimetry of the first insertion for the next insertion, while the other method utilized a standardized plan for all insertions dependent upon ovoid size. The dose was prescribed to the vaginal surface using either applicator points or dose points. Based on multiple calculations, a graph of distance vs. dose was generated to determine the dose to the bladder and rectum for a given implant. In the first study, interoperator variability was acceptable with a standard deviation of 0.4% of the prescribed dose using dose points for the worst case. Applicator points were less reproducible with a worst‐case standard deviation of 2.1% of the prescribed dose. In the second study, implementing initial dosimetric plans for the second implant for an individual patient yielded a worst‐case standard deviation of 2.4% of the prescribed dose. The use of standardized treatment plans for all implants was also efficacious with a worst‐case standard deviation of 1.7% of the prescribed dose. Treatment plans were always more reproducible when calculated to dose points rather than applicator points. Analysis of maximum bladder and rectal doses provided acceptable late tissue doses as predicted by the linear quadratic model. In conclusion, standardized dosimetry plans for vaginal cuff insertion are feasible and reliable in producing precise delivery of vaginal surface doses. The use of dose vs. distance curves facilitates rapid planning by providing a close approximation of the maximum bladder and rectal doses. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

The emergence process for dominant designs has typically been viewed as a black box process involving a sophisticated interaction of technological and non‐technological factors. This paper shifts the discussion to a strategic perspective. It argues that firms can frame the emergence process and can systematically manage elements of it in the pursuit of competitive advantage from innovation. An analytical framework is developed and discussed, with particular emphasis on the roles of certain external conditions, non‐technological forces, and complementary assets, as well as the implications for R&amp;D strategists and for future research. Four distinctive examples illustrate different aspects of the framework's utility.</jats:p>",

A supportive principal was cited by 88% of the teachers as an incentive. Deterrents included too much paperwork, too many students, demands of special education meetings, and job stress. Retention of teachers during the 5-year period was high. Approyimately 62% plan to continue to teach special education for another 3 years. However, approximately 125 additional special education teachers per year will be needed by districts during the next 3 years. Recommendations address future state and local level planning and methodology issues. </jats:p>",

The asymmetric collimation feature of a dual‐energy photon beam linear accelerator allows the user to set up half‐beam treatment fields posterior to the orbits with no divergence to anterior structures.</jats:p><jats:p>Treatment planning was performed with a relatively new Food and Drug Adminisration (FDA)‐approved 3‐D RTP system. Computerized tomographic (CT) scans used by this system to generate isodose distributions and dose‐volume histograms were obtained directly from the scanner which is connected via ethernet cabling to the 3D treatment planning system. These were used for evaluating the dose distribution to the treatment volume, clinical target volume, gross tumor volume, and certain critical organs. Using 6 and 18 MV photon beams, different configurations of standard treatment techniques for pituitary tumors, i.e., a 190° flying wedge arc, 3‐fields (an anterior plus a lateral wedged pair), and a pair of lateral fields, were studied and the resulting dose distributions were analyzed. Real‐time dose measurements on patients using diode dosimetry were made and compared with computed dose values.</jats:p><jats:p>With regard to minimizing radiation dose to surrounding structures, (i.e., lens, temporal lobes, spinal cord, etc.) the 190° flying wedge arc technique gave the best isodose distributions, followed by 3 fields (an anterior plus a lateral wedged pair). The opposing lateral fields gave the highest integral dose to the temporal lobes. The dose measured on the patient during the treatment agrees to within ±2% with the computed dose.</jats:p><jats:p>The protocols presented in this work for simulation, immobilization, and treatment planning of patients with pituitary tumors provide the optimum dose distributions in the target volume with reduced irradiation of surrounding non‐target tissues, and can be easily implemented in a radiation oncology department. The presence of a real‐time dose‐measuring system plays an important role in verifying the actual delivery of radiation dose. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
