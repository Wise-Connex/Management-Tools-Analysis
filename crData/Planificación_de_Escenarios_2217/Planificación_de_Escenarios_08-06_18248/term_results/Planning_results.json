This article examines the evolution of this ambiguous relationship (during the period 1910 to 1960) through four roughly chronological development stages. Data were seen first as an engine of social reform, then as the basis for a science of planning, next as a way to manage social and economic crisis, and finally as a way to justify government decisions. The article concludes that the limitations of official statistics are historically contingent, a result of Congress's lack of support, the federal bureaucracy's indifference to spatially detailed data, and planners' abandonment of the argument. </jats:p>",

The paper first discusses efforts to inject a territorial dimension into EU policies, including the European Spatial Development Perspective. During its preparation, the same issue of national sovereignty has been dominant as in the subsequent debate concerning the European Constitution. Had it been ratified, the Constitution would have given European planning a boost. The paper discusses its rejection and reviews literature that presents views of the EU as an unprecedented, dynamic construct, with transnational learning as the engine. Next, the paper discusses the application of the European Spatial Development Perspective, during which planners have been learning about territory and territorial governance in the context of an integrating Europe. Like with European integration generally, European planning can thus be understood as a learning machine. </jats:p>",

When the Democrats took over in 1922, they repudiated aesthetic planning as “chasing rainbows.” However, practical and aesthetic discourses coexisted, serving different audiences and purposes, and each served in different ways to legitimate a vision of comprehensive planning in the early 1920s. </jats:p>",

In reaction to these conditions, alternative planning approaches branched from the planning profession, one of these being the development approach known as place-making. Place-making is the physical designing of a place based on locational contexts. Place-making is offered as an alternative planning approach to current planning practice to ameliorate and possibly prevent continuation of the problematic ecological and social conditions. However, this implies that there has to come about a shift in the focus and aims of current planning practice. The main implications of place-making are that planning should become more contextually driven, holistic, multidisciplinary, as well as human and quality centred. Also, it is proposed to increase research on place in the South African context. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By 2030, seventy-two million people, or fully one of every five Americans, will be aged sixty-five or older, raising important concerns about how our cities, communities, and transportation facilities will safety accommodate their travel needs. The current policy solution is to increase driver testing, provide senior-oriented paratransit services, and ultimately, to house older, nondriving adults in senior care communities where more mobile individuals can provide basic household-related services for them. These practices, while perhaps well intentioned, effectively segregate older adults from the larger community. We can do better. This article summarizes the available literature on the travel-related needs, abilities, and preferences of older adults. Through a synthesis of the current knowledge, it identifies four strategies that can be used to design communities and transportation systems to address the safety and mobility needs of an aging population in an inclusive, universal manner. </jats:p>",

This study analyzes Guyana's drug policy and regulation, public financing, and drug procurement and delivery. The study also identifies main barriers to drug access and proposes alternatives to strengthen the country's public health functions. Data were collected from the country's regulatory agencies, public procurement agency, pharmacies, wholesalers, and pharmaceutical companies. The information was supplemented with interviews with a convenient sample of Guyanese health authorities and stakeholders. Data were also compiled from scientific databases, and web pages of the country's Ministries of Health, Commerce and Finance, the Bureau of Statistics, and international organizations. Major barriers to drug access include: (1) lack of national drug policy and regulation, and limited role of the regulatory authority; (2) inefficient drug selection and irrational drug use; (3) insufficient financial resources and lack of drug pricing policy; (4) inefficient planning and managing public supply system; (5) deficient epidemiological and information systems; and (6) inadequate infrastructures and human resources shortage. Improving drug access in Guyana requires the strengthening of the country's public health functions and the implementation of a national drug policy and pricing policy, streamlining the drug financing, procurement, and planning and managing drug supply; and adequate infrastructures and human resources.

Deliberate planning and contingency planning occur during team transition phases; deliberate planning specifies a primary course of action whereas contingency planning specifies backup plans. Reactive adjustment is planning that occurs during the action phase when teams adapt plans to account for evolving task conditions. The current study uses data from a scavenger hunt game involving a total of 38 teams randomly assigned to preplanning or control conditions. While instructing teams to plan increased deliberate planning, it does not increase the adaptation-enabling processes of contingency planning and reactive adjustment. Team effectiveness is determined most strongly by reactive adjustment, then by contingency planning, and least so by deliberate planning. </jats:p>",

Following the institutional economics approach, a health system's efficiency is considered to be determined by the existence and treatment of agency problems. Agency problems can be controlled by mechanisms built into the health system, or can also be controlled by an external actor, for example, the government, either by using the instruments available or by conducting institutional reforms. To explain differences in the amenability of a country's health system to external governmental control, I combine the veto player approach and the incentives for societal actors to exert influence, into the concept of indirect veto players: the more indirect veto players exist, the less external control will be exercised.</jats:p><jats:p>I derive indicators capturing both forms of control and perform a comparison of health systems based on institutional and performance data. Using data reducing methods, I identify two dimensions of control underlying the institutional setting of the health system and three dimensions of health system performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> The recent integration of kilo‐voltage cone beam computed tomography (kV‐CBCT) imaging systems into linear accelerators makes it possible to image and treat a patient on a single machine. The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility and usefulness of acquiring kV‐CBCT for adaptive radiotherapy for patients with lung and phantom study with significant target position. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A self made brain phantom and quality assurance phantom were used to compare the dosimetric and geometric accuracy between planning CT and kV‐CBCT with bow‐tie filter added. The quality of the kV‐CBCT volume images acquired using phantom was evaluated by measuring the spatial accuracy, contrast, hounsfield units (HU), and converting HU to electron density. The kV‐CBCT was registered to the CT image using normalized mutual information. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In both phantom studies, the DVH based on kV‐CBCT images were in excellent agreement with DVH based on planning CT images. CBCT images were dependent on image uniformity, linearity and it needed verify the difference the mean HU value of the center ROI and peripheral ROI using histogram. The difference (&lt;1%) is found in the calculated dose to the target for a complex inhomogeneous phantom between using kV‐CBCT images and planning CT images. These results indicate that kV‐CBCT images can be used to calculate dosimetric parameter accurately in radiotherapy treatment planning. In a patient study, doses for targets volume plans calculated on kV‐CBCT images agreed within 5% with those calculated on planning CT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have investigated the feasibility and usefulness of acquiring on‐board kV‐CBCT images for adaptive radiotherapy treatment planning and tested the accuracy. It is feasible to use kV‐CBCT to determine dosimetric consequences resulting from tumor volume changes. The kV‐CBCT has potential to become a very useful tool for adaptive radiotherapy treatment planning.</jats:p>",

Although CT is widely used for EBRT treatment planning (TP), traditional 2D film is still commonly used today in many institutions for BRT TP. The incompatible image information between the BRT and EBRT leads to great difficulty in computation of the cumulative radiation dose from both treatments. To date, doses to target and critical structures are approximated by adding the point doses of BRT to the EBRT plan. In this project, we propose to register the orthogonal films of BRT and CT of EBRT so as to accumulate the doses in a more accurate way. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Five patients treated with both EBRT and low dose rate BRT were retrospectively used in the study. 3D dose grids from the BRT and EBRT treatment planning were merged by a film‐to‐CT registration, which was accomplished by creating DRRs from EBRT‐CT in the same projections of the BRT films. A landmark based image registration tool was developed to register films and DRRs of CT. The calculated shift, rotation and scaling were applied on the dose grid of BRT. Once the registration was completed, dose distributions from EBRT and BRT were merged. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A composite plan with accumulated doses of BRT and EBRT was created for each patient. The dose accuracy was verified at relevant points such as “A” points. The isodose curve and DVHs were analyzed, and appear reasonable. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We developed a method to accumulate the dose distributions from film‐based brachytherapy and CT‐based external beam radiotherapy. This yielded a more realistic estimate of the cumulative dose received by the patient from both treatments.</jats:p>",

Applying a discourse analysis framework to wind-energy development in the North West of England, two strong coalitions operating within the wind-energy development arena were identified. By combining this framework with a multicriteria assessment, it is revealed that each coalition had very different priorities during the evaluation of wind-energy schemes. Overall, only when offshore wind is evaluated are there elements of common ground. This technology therefore appears to offer a solution to sharp contrasts in discourse. Based on this assessment, it is concluded that the implementation of national energy-policy objectives is contingent upon the regional government developing coherent storylines to attract the support of as broad a coalition of stakeholders as possible. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1990s, there has been a remarkable resurgence of the concept of the city-region in both academic and policy communities. In broad terms, the concept articulates the relationships between the city and its environs. While the city-region's rising popularity is recent, its origin is not. Despite its long history, however, the concept of the city-region does not enjoy a common definition, neither in its use as an analytical term nor in its upsurge as a political one. While there are clear linkages between the two, the main focus of this review is on the city-region as an analytical construct. Hence, the paper provides a critical review of the different methodologies that have been employed over the last 50 years for defining and mapping the city-region. This work shows that, despite their variations, they share two common features—an urban-centric view of the city-region and an economically driven approach to its definition. These are further elaborated by focusing on the prevailing conception of the city-region as a functional economic space and the dominant top-down approach to delineate the boundaries of what is known as the functional urban region. </jats:p>",

Measuring the relative costliness of specific DRGs is useful for a wide range of policy and planning applications. Estimating the relative use of resources per DRG can be done through different costing approaches depending on availability of information and time and budget. This study aims to guide costing efforts in Iran and other countries in the region that are pursuing casemix funding, through identifying the main issues facing cost finding approaches and introducing the costing models compatible with their hospitals accounting and management structures. The results show that inadequate financial and utilisation information at the patient's level, poorly computerized ‘feeder systems’; and low quality data make it impossible to estimate reliable DRGs costs through clinical costing. A cost modelling approach estimates the average cost of 2.723 million Rials (Iranian Currency) per DRG. Using standard linear regression, a coefficient of 0.14 (CI = 0.12–0.16) suggests that the average cost weight increases by 14% for every one‐day increase in average length of stay (LOS).</jats:p><jats:p>We concluded that calculation of DRG cost weights (CWs) using Australian service weights provides a sensible starting place for DRG‐based hospital management; but restructuring hospital accounting systems, designing computerized feeder systems, using appropriate software, and development of national service weights that reflect local practice patterns will enhance the accuracy of DRG CWs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years ideas of resilience have been increasingly embedded within urban planning and design practice as attempts have been made to make the built environment and critical infrastructure more resistant to external risk from natural hazards, particularly those associated with climate change, or from new security challenges facing many cities as a result of the ongoing threat of terrorism. The rapid renaissance of central urban areas in the last decade has given ample opportunities to apply such resilient principles to the construction of new buildings or regeneration areas, facilitated by changes in building regulations and the planning system concerned with broader issues of safety and sustainability. This paper argues that the embedding of resilience into the planning, design and engineering of the built environment is about not only security and community safety concerns but also the environmental benefits that might be achieved by integrating secure and sustainable design. The authors also argue that to date there has been limited integration of security and sustainability construction principles but that significant opportunities exist in the future for such sustainable urbanism to be commonplace. </jats:p>",

Alternative patterns of urbanization spread (including sprawl) are evaluated from the perspective of nature and people, stating land-use principles extracted from landscape ecology, transportation and hydrology. Good, bad and interesting spatial patterns for creating sustainable land mosaics are pinpointed, and urban regions are considered in broader contexts, from climate change to biodiversity loss, disasters and sense of place.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Ghana has undertaken many public service management reforms in the past two decades. But the implementation of the reforms has been constrained by many factors. This paper undertakes a retrospective study of research works on the challenges to the implementation of reforms in the public health sector. It points out that most of the studies identified: (1) centralised, weak and fragmented management system; (2) poor implementation strategy; (3) lack of motivation; (4) weak institutional framework; (5) lack of financial and human resources and (6) staff attitude and behaviour as the major causes of ineffective reform implementation. The analysis further revealed that quite a number of crucial factors obstructing reform implementation which are particularly internal to the health system have either not been thoroughly studied or overlooked. The analysis identified lack of leadership; weak communication and consultation; lack of stakeholder participation, corruption and unethical professional behaviour as some of the missing variables in the literature. The study, therefore, indicated that there are gaps in the literature that needed to be filled through rigorous reform evaluation based on empirical research particularly at district, sub‐district and community levels. It further suggested that future research should be concerned with the effects of both systems and structures and behavioural factors on reform implementation.

Goals must align with → audience or stakeholder needs and achieving this match usually requires the involvement of stakeholders in the program planning stage, if not all stages of program implementation, monitoring, and evaluation (→ Stakeholder Theory). Unlike many other types of communication programs, development communication demands greater attention to social structural factors (Wilkins 2000) because change typically is sought at the societal level, not just the individual level. Also, longer‐term and macro‐structural changes usually require greater attention to self‐sustainability of communication activities, engaging whole communities and organizations (not just individuals) and creating mechanisms for ongoing participation by and coordination among stakeholder groups at multiple levels of social organization from the international and national level to the local and community level (→ Participatory Communication).</jats:p>"

These impacts are analysed in the context of trip-chaining, defined here as consolidating two or more non-home activities in a single departure from home. The findings suggest that, rather than strictly promoting one type of transportation over another, the regional impact of localised urban design practices is to consolidate trip-making behaviour closer to the home. As such, urban design ‘carrots’ must be complemented by policy ‘sticks’ in order to promote true exchanges of travel modes. </jats:p>",

At this point, we have already determined the type of dictionary we plan to produce, and we have clear ideas about who will use it and what they will use it for (Chapter 2). We have collected the linguistic data that will form our raw material (Chapter 3). And the other resources we will need – software, Style Guide, template entries – are in place (Chapter 4). When we talk about the content of a dictionary (as opposed to the resources which underpin its creation), the terms ‘macrostructure’ and ‘microstructure’ are often used. Deciding on the types of entry the dictionary will include, and organizing the headword list, are macrostructure decisions, and these are the issues we address in this chapter. Planning the entries in the dictionary and deciding on their structure and components are microstructure decisions, and these form the focus of Chapter 7.</jats:p>",

An online survey of Truman State University students and Faculty was conducted, and the data was analyzed using crosstabs in SPSS software. In general, the results showed that older people are more aware of their personal finances and have begun saving for retirement. However, contrary to other studies, older people have more credit cards and credit card debt than younger people based on the data. Finally, the data showed that people who feel that they are aware of their personal finances, generally are aware and demonstrate their awareness through their actions.</jats:p>"

Laser therapies can provide a minimally invasive treatment alternative to surgical resection of tumors. However, the effectiveness of these therapies is limited due to nonspecific heating of target tissue and diffusion limited thermal deposition which often leads to healthy tissue injury and extended treatment durations. These therapies can be further compromised due to induction of molecular chaperones called heat shock protein (HSP) in tumor regions where non-lethal temperature elevation occurs causing enhanced tumor cell viability and imparting resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatments which are generally employed in conjunction with hyperthermia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rapid advances in functional and biological imaging, predictive assays and our understanding of the treatment responses herald the coming of the long‐sought goal of implementing biologically based radiation therapy in the clinic. Until now, the practice of RT has been based on the premise that effective treatments require the delivery of uniform radiation doses to all target volumes. However, the uniform‐dose approach only yields the best possible tumor control for the implausible situation in which all regions of the tumor have exactly the same biological characteristics and sensitivities to radiation. Theoretical studies and the accumulated clinical data strongly suggest that the treatment plans designed to exploit patient‐ and tumor‐specific biological features will substantially improve treatment outcomes.</jats:p><jats:p>Biologically based treatment planning (BBTP) use dose response models to estimate biological responses for a dose distribution and/or a fractionation schedule. There have been at least two commercial BBTP systems available for clinical use. A variety of dose response models and quantities (e.g., the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD), Poisson cell killing, serial and parallel complication models, and Lyman‐Kutcher‐Burman model) along with a series of organ‐specific model parameters are included in these systems to calculate TCP, NTCP and EUD. Experience with these commercial and non‐commercial planning systems has shown that the appropriate use of biological‐model based cost functions can generate plans with similar target coverage but with better normal tissue sparing or equivalent plans but with much smaller number of iterations, as compared to the use of physical (dose‐based) cost functions. Because of these and other anticipated benefits, we believe that the use of biological models in treatment planning process will become popular in the near future.</jats:p><jats:p>However, it is also evident that, due to various limitations, such as the limitations of models and available model parameters, the incomplete understanding of dose responses, and the inadequate clinical data, the use of biologically models for treatment planning can be potentially dangerous. In addition, the models can also be used simply to evaluate treatment plans. Some aspects of the models may be unintuitive and their correct interpretation and use as planning indices may not be straightforward. Biologically based planning represents a paradigm shift. There will be a steep learning curve for most clinical physicists/planners to understand how, when and why biological models do and/or do not work. To address these issues, AAPM has recently established a task group (TG166).</jats:p><jats:p>This talk will provide an overview for the development of biologically‐based treatment planning. Initial experience of using a commercial BBTP system will be discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1. Understand the basic and limitations of using dose‐response models in treatment planning.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Understand dosimetrical differences between biologically based and physical dose based treatment plan optimization and evaluation.</jats:p>",

The absence of linguistic input in development planning in Africa is one of the key reasons why the majority of the African people are left “on the edge of road.” This paper argues for a language sensitive and linguistically informed approach to technology transfer and development problems. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can serve to promote African languages much better than religion ever did, and language policies and language-in-education policies in Africa need to be cog­nisant and take advantage of the opportunities the digital era offers the Continent. Whilst, according to Ferguson, “religion has been one of the most powerful forces leading to language change and language spread,” African languages have yet to overcome the linguistic barrier to participation in knowledge societies, and most of them have no interface with science and information technology (e.g. the Internet). Why can’t African languages be languages of technology? How can this be achieved?</jats:p>",

The plans are compared for total monitor units, number of segments, treatment time and plan quality. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Ten patients were planned using both Elekta PTI Precise and the CMS XIO planning systems. For the Precise system, the apertures used in the optimization process were determined a priori by considering target and critical structure anatomic geometry. The XIO system used the BB approach with segmentation software to establish final apertures. The same target and critical structure dose constraints were used for the inverse planning for both systems. Seven gantry angles were used for the AB plans, and both seven and five angles were used for the BB plans. The prescribed dose was normalized to provide coverage to 95% of the PTV. Patient records were reviewed to determine overall treatment time. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Plans were evaluated by comparing the achievement of IMRT constraints. No significant variation in plan quality was found for the two planning techniques. The average MUs for AB was 337(range of 302.1–374.5) compared to 386.8(317–491.4) for 5‐field BB plans and 394.2(312.6–508) for 7‐field BB plans. The average number of segments for AB was 47.6(37–56) compared to 61.4(36–79) for 5‐field BB plans and 78.1(53–111) for 7field BB plans. The average treatment times were lower for the BB plans (10.66min) compared to (11.48min) AB plans. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The quality of the AB plans compared favorably with the BB plans. The AB plans had a small advantage in both total MU and segments, while the BB plans delivered more quickly. This result may be due to degree of delivery automation for the BB approach. This work points to the possibility of exploiting the use of AB planning for adaptive treatment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is an effort to situate interlinguistics and Esperanto studies in the social context of modern Japan. The origin of interlinguistic ideas in Japan was distinct from developments in Europe, in that English functioned as the bridge language to learn Western civilization from the very beginning of Japan’s modernization, while it was the lack of a suitable regional lingua franca that motivated the Europeans to search for a planned language. After the examination of some Japanese pioneers in interlinguistics, the main focus will be upon diverse traditions of Esperanto studies in Japan. These include the endogenous (inward-looking) tradition, socially engaged interlinguistics, the post-war ambivalence of the Esperanto movement toward scientific theorizing, and the gradual rise of macro-sociolinguistic approaches from the 1990s.</jats:p>",

An accessible format for care plans is therefore important. The National Minimum Care Standards in England now require that all residents in care homes have a service user plan. This study examined the format and content of 117 blank care plan documents used in Manchester and Cheshire care homes in 2001/02. Sixty‐eight per cent of homes used a problem‐orientated care plan document, 25% used a problem‐orientated care plan with assessment domains defined, 15% used standard care plans and five per cent used daily care plans. Although the government has stressed the importance of involving the user in the care planning process, only 16% of homes had a care plan that specifically asked for a resident's signature or agreement. There were also differences in content of care plans by home type, which may reflect the professional background and training of staff in nursing homes. The variety in types and format of care plans suggests that the interpretation and recording of care planning may not be uniform across homes and there is a need for further detailed work in this area using interviews or observational approaches.</jats:p>",

The present article reports on ethnographic research investigating official and popular discourses of language and identity in East Timor and the role of past and present language policies and practices in shaping national and social identity. It focuses on the discursive reconstruction of identity through five official instruments of language policy development. Hostile discourses in the Australian and Indonesian press towards the choice of Portuguese (the former colonial language) and Tetum (the endogenous lingua franca) as official languages provided the context for the investigation. A persistent theme in these discourses is that English and/or Indonesian would be preferable choices. The article puts these discourses into perspective by presenting findings from two data sets: (i) the 2004 National Census and (ii) analysis of the discourses of 78 participants in semi-structured interviews and student focus groups. The census shows clear signs of the revival of Portuguese and the reinvigoration of Tetum. It also shows how diverse linguistic identities have become in East Timor.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Process planning is part of the general product development and production process that usually follows design and precedes manufacturing. Manufacturability and process planning information in general play central role in many product development and production activities, including paradoxically, conceptual and detail design - the activities that take place before process planning. The need of conducting some of the process planning activities formally before or during design is thus rather obvious. One of the main research issues is therefore the identification of the process planning activities that can be performed before the traditional process planning phase and handling of the process planning information so as to adequately provide the designers with the manufacturability informationneeded during conceptual and detail design. Another issue is how to support collaboration during process planning and how to maintain continuity of the process planning tasks. This paper suggests the decentralization of the process planning task and proposes the execution of the process planning activities in a piecemeal fashion, starting right afterreceiving an order and specifying the requirements for a product. Process planning under the proposed procedure consists of six semi-autonomous sub-phases, some of which comprise activities that must be conducted prior to the process planning phase. This helps to overcome the problem of timely availability of manufacturability information during the execution of upstream and downstream product development and production activities. The paper alsoproposes a computer-based method of handling the manufacturability information generated in various stages of the product development and production process. A database design and structure of prototype software that manages the process planning information are presented and discussed. Furthermore, a case study conducted to explore howthe proposed process planning procedure could be put in use is presented and discussed.</jats:p>"

Comparisons were made concerning the available tools, ease of tool use, flow of the planning process, and tool integration. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The list of available tools was remarkably similar for all three systems however the tools functioned considerably different. Some differences existed with respect to the degree of automation and manual over‐rides. Large differences were observed in the planning efficiency and flow of the planning process. From the user's perspective, the architecture of long legacy systems with large customer bases appeared to use a linear model with multiple workspaces. The system with the shortest legacy and smallest customer base appeared to use a task oriented model with a single workspace. Several potential factors that could contribute to these differences were identified. These factors may conspire to prevent deep integration of cohesive tools thus limiting planning efficiency. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Before purchasing a system, customers should evaluate the cohesiveness of tools, integration of tools, degree of automation, and workflow. Occasionally, vendors need to “bite the bullet” and revise their systems to ensure the various tools are integrated together in a cohesive fashion that promotes efficiency of the planning process.</jats:p>",

Particularly, to study whether constrained optimization on the voxel level allows to deliberately trade‐off the dose delivered to one region of a volume of interest (VOI) with respect to other clinical goals. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We extended a stepwise optimization method for robotic radiosurgery to interactively modify dose constraints on a voxel level. The optimization problem is solved using linear programming, and every term in the objective function is matched by a corresponding constraint. Clinical goals are addressed separately and maintained using the constraints. A trade‐off among the clinical goals is then explored by a series of optimization steps. For visualization, VOIs are represented by a 3D grid of spheres, where each sphere represents a voxel and can be selected in a 3D scene. Constraints on the dose in the selected voxels can be considered independently for subsequent optimization steps. The method was applied to a prostate case, where we studied trade‐offs with respect to the maximum dose in the rectum. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Relaxing the upper dose bound on a set of voxels in the prostate lobes by 150 cGy allowed to reduce the maximum rectum dose by 100 cGy. Likewise, a relaxation of the lower dose bound on a few voxels on the prostate surface by 100 cGy allowed to further reduce the maximum dose in th rectum by 157 cGy. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Spatial information is not available from cumulative statistics typically used as criteria for treatment planning. Our results indicate that it is possible to include spatial information in interactive multi‐criteria optimization. The proposed method can be used when clinical goals can be expressed with respect to a subregion of a VOI. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research partially sponsored by Accuray Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Complete 4D imaging, planning and treatment delivery for pancreatic cancer. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The patient was scanned using a GE CT scanner while recording respiratory excursion of the chest by monitoring an infrared reflector. Images and respiratory recordings were binned into 10 phases on a GE Advantage workstation. 4D animation was used to observe organ movement. Phase 5 was the most stable and selected as the primary planning CT for contouring on the Cyberknife system. Phases 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 were sent to Cyberknife as a 4D CT with phase tags. Multiplan loaded the primary CT, RT structures and 5 phase tagged CTs. 2 gold seeds inside the pancreas PTV were identified in the primary CT and automatically propagated and registered in the 5 phases. Automatic deformable registration based on intensity was performed. Inverse simplex planning was performed and optimized to give 30Gy in 5 fractions to PTV (GTV+3 mm margin in all directions except toward the duodenum). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In the static plan, the 79% isodose‐line (30Gy, maximum 38Gy) covered 96% of the PTV. With organ movement assigned an equal weight for each phase the 79% isodose‐line (29.3Gy, maximum 37Gy) covered 91% of the PTV in the 4D plan. During treatment delivery, detectors monitored respiratory excursion of infrared reflectors that were placed on the chest of the patient and orthogonal x‐ray images were taken every 3 beams. The fiducial seeds were identified in the x‐ray images and correlated with the movement of the infrared reflectors. A movement prediction model of the seeds in Synchrony tracking guided the robot during radiation delivery. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> True 4D dose delivered by the Cyberknife tracking and delivery system by taking into account of organ motion can be estimated with 4D images and dose calculation during all phases of the respiratory cycle.</jats:p>",

CBCT numbers of each insert rod in images obtained with or without a 1‐cm bolus were measured. Hounsfield units (HU) of the insert rods were measured on a helical CT scanner. Conversions of CBCT number and HU to electron density (CBCT‐ED and CT‐ED) were generated. Single field treatment plans were created with heterogeneity correction in XIO treatment planning system, where the CBCT‐ED or CT‐ED conversions obtained without the bolus were used for unbolused and bolused plans with and without bowtie filter. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> CBCT numbers changed when the bolus was applied, with and without bowtie filter. The changes were smaller for the bowtie filter scans: the average changes were 83 and 128 CBCT number for scans with and without bowtie filter, respectively. CBCT numbers of the same material (e.g., solid water inserts) measured at different locations in the phantom were different: a maximum difference of 113 CBCT number was observed in the scan with the bolus and without the bowtie filter. With heterogeneity correction, the dose differences (maximums) between CT and CBCT non‐bolused plans were 3.8% and 4.4% due to irregularity of the CBCT‐ED points, for cases with and without bowtie filter, respectively. The differences between bolused plans were 4.5% and 12.0%, respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> CBCT numbers were found to be measurement‐position dependent within the phantom and varied when a bolus was applied. The bowtie filter improved the CBCT number consistency. However, dose difference is still significant.</jats:p>",

One element that is of equal importance to these aforementioned factors is the planning of patient care. However, there are concerns that some practitioners may not be adopting a planned approach to client care, possibly because of a lack of understanding, time, skill or interest in care planning.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method. </jats:bold> This is a position paper on the planning of patient care.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold> The planning of patient care can be effectively implemented using a two‐stage process. In brief, the first step involves the construction of a general goal, which is the overall, desired outcome of care. The expected outcome, or specific goal, forms the second part of the planning process, which clearly directs clinical care by specifically indicating how and when an individual will achieve the general goal of treatment.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion. </jats:bold> This paper highlights the importance of care planning and that the use of a clear, systematic planning framework may help to deliver a more transparent and consistent approach to patient care, which may greatly improve patient health and well‐being by hastening the achievement of clinical outcomes.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Relevance to clinical practice. </jats:bold> The knowledge and strategies contained in this paper can be easily adopted by nurses and other clinicians to modify or build upon existing practice.

One frequent contributory explanation is the heavy reliance placed upon the designation of public as opposed to private lands for statutory protection. Given that protected area designation in Britain has no such constraint, and indeed that more than half of such areas are on private lands, we tested the a priori assumption that within this region the representation of environmental conditions and land cover within statutory protected areas would be more equitable. Despite the reduction in land ownership constraints on where protected areas can be established, a marked bias in protected area coverage remains. Protected areas in Britain tend toward regions of higher elevation, soils of lower economic potential, and coastal/estuarine habitat and fail adequately to represent areas of lower elevation and woodland habitats. Improving the current situation requires not only a more systematic approach to site selection, but a more equitable and diverse portfolio of incentives for private landowners to facilitate the decision to manage sites for conservation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of mathematical models to summarized clinical or biological outcomes with respect to the distribution of dose throughout an organ or tissue has great appeal. At its best, the overall cumulative effects of all parts of a heterogeneously irradiated object could be summarized in terms of a clinically relevant outcome such as a tumor control probability (TCP) or a normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Further, it could be anticipated that a treatment planner would want to incorporate such information directly into the optimization of treatment planning parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>Despite this appeal, integration of these concepts into mainstream treatment planning has been slow in coming. Parameterization of the models is conceptually simple, requiring input data consisting primarily of dose, volume and outcome information from groups of patients. However, uncertainties in accumulated total effective dose and differential irradiated volumes together with heterogeneities in biological responses can make these determinations difficult. At best, it has been possible to obtain broad “population” based model parameters for some organs and tumors for “groups of similarly‐treated patients”. In general, as used today, these models are not within themselves (i.e., without additional stratification factors) “predictive” of outcome for “individual” subjects, nor can their use be generally extrapolated to the treatment of populations with techniques that vary greatly from those originally used.</jats:p><jats:p>However, disclaimers aside, the appeal remains great, and real progress has been made. In this session we will present some of the basic concepts associated with the models. Examples will be given as to how the models accommodate the responses of different tumor types and so‐called serial and parallel normal tissues. We will show how (as currently used) implementation of the models in evaluation or planning generally first requires reduction of a complex dose distribution (or DVH) into an equivalent “uniform” total (or partial) object dose.</jats:p><jats:p>Examples where the mathematical models appear to work well to describe the response of groups of patients will be provided. Specifically, the use of NTCP models for planning the treatment of tumors surrounded by volume effect normal tissues will be demonstrated, as will the use of EUD to allow rational heterogeneous irradiation of target volumes.</jats:p><jats:p>Some technical details associated with the implementation of mathematical/biological models into IMRT planning systems will be discussed. Since mathematical structures of biological models are nonlinear, an optimization algorithm that can explicitly handle nonlinear objective and constraint functions is important. We will describe various ways of incorporating the models into optimization problems.</jats:p><jats:p>This session will be concluded with a short survey of existing software tools that utilize the biological models for dose‐response data analysis, plan evaluation, and IMRT plan optimization.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

PET imaging shows focal and distributed regions of cancer and its metastases. Initial PET uses in oncology include diagnosis and staging, which are important for determining treatment decisions. Current PET uses now include target definition for radiation planning followed by PET‐based assessment of treatment. Hybrid PET‐CT devices are beginning to be used as radiation treatment simulators. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> F‐18‐labled Fluoro‐deoxyglucose (F‐18 FDG) is the most commonly used PET imaging agent. FDG shows regions of active glucose metabolism, such as local cancer, metastases, non‐cancer inflammation, and normal glucose use. Non‐FDG PET agents can be more specific in cell targeting (binding), and can image different aspects of tumor biology, like hypoxia (FMISO, CuATSM) and cell proliferation (FLT). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> PET imaging has coarse spatial resolution compared to CT and MR. PET's clinical use is valued because of its great sensitivity for cancer detection. Voxel intensity and image fidelity depend on equipment design, patient size, anatomic site, and imaging study parameters. PET‐CT units enable CT‐based attenuation corrections and inclusion of CT information in a registered PET‐CT dataset. The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is a normalized intensity measure for quantitative indication of disease, and can be used to identify disease or possibly for target delineation, with certain limitations. While FDG remains the most promising agent for tumor detection, other, biologically more specific agents (e.g., FMISO, CuATSM for hypoxia imaging or FLT for cell proliferation imaging) might be more appropriate for target delineation and treatment assessment. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This course reviews PET‐CT hybrid scanning devices, uses of FDG and non‐FDG PET for oncology imaging, and quantitative aspects for PET‐based radiation target definition and treatment assessment. Example images demonstrate the potential contributions and limitations of FDG and non‐FDG PET oncology imaging. This review course is intended for both imaging and radiation oncology physicists.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Segmentation of pulmonary X‐ray computed tomography (CT) images is a primordial step to most pulmonary image analysis applications. Many approaches have been presented in the past mainly focusing on lung extraction from high resolution CT data. Looking towards RT planning one has often to deal with low image quality, artifacts and pathological changes of the anatomy. We present a fully automatic method for delineation of the lungs and the trachea in three‐dimensional RT planning scans for thorax and breast patients. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The method consists of several steps. First, lung region is extracted automatically computing an optimal threshold method. Then, the trachea is separated from the lungs by fast marching. Next left and right lungs are separated in each slice by computing a minimal path in the area where separation is suspected from the information of the neighboring slices. Finally the 3D segmentations of the left and right lungs are refined running the random walker algorithm with foreground and background seeds automatically calculated from the intensity‐based pre‐segmentation. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Processing time is below one minute and does not require any user input. Several 3D CT Datasets from different patients were used to evaluate the methods. The algorithms can segment the trachea and separate the left and right lung. In comparison to previous publications stability could be improved. Still in some cases result are not satisfying, e.g. trachea segmentation reaches into the lungs and lesions or emphysema are not included in the lung segmentations. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The presented algorithm allows for fully automatic lung segmentation. One major improvement could be to employ a shape model as recently published by other groups as a shape‐constrained segmentation method could help to overcome the observed problems with exclusion of pathologies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The significant changes in housing policy in the UK over the last three decades have been widely described and discussed. Public housing has moved away from centre stage because of privatisation and the decline in new public sector building. In the last decade there has been a renewed concern to provide affordable housing, but policy has not reverted to the earlier model where the affordable-housing drive was led by local authorities and new towns. Instead, it has turned to the use of the planning system to deliver different kinds of affordable housing, and one consequence has been the advent of a different style and density of urban housing development. The authors address the change in housing provision from a perspective related to the politics of construction. They play off earlier work by Dunleavy, and contrast the new politics of urban housing with those described in the era prior to 1975. They draw on research on mixed-tenure developments and regional housing strategies in England, and suggest that there is a new technological and ideological shortcut which is affecting the pattern of housing in major urban areas. Although there are some profound differences from the era of mass housing, there are also some important similarities in the factors that underpin the new politics of urban housing. The authors discuss key issues and provide suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

Two powerful tools, climate change risk assessment and total water management, can be used to determine the vulnerability of water management systems to climate change. These tools can also be used to drive the development of integrated water management strategies and infrastructure to provide water supplies that are more resilient to the effects of climate change. One approach for assessing the risks of climate change to water systems is to use a dual analytical framework known as the threshold‐scenario risk assessment. The framework comprises two parts: the more qualitative threshold risk assessment approach; and, the quantitative scenario risk assessment approach. This article provides tools, resources, examples, and new, holistic solutions that can be used to manage both the built and natural portions of the water cycle. Water professionals will find this approach more effective than considering the components separately when addressing the challenges posed by global climate change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The foundation of a logic model or any theory-based planning model is the identification of the behavioral antecedents and the relationship of these variables to the target behavior. Applying theoretical concepts to specific behaviors and populations is often challenging for practitioners and program planning students. The challenge comes from the abstract definition of theoretical constructs, the duplication of similar constructs in multiple theories, and the need to combine multiple theories. To simplify the planning process when utilizing logic models and health behavior theory, we recommend the use of the PER Worksheet. The PER Worksheet is a planning tool that provides layman-term prompts for identifying health behavior antecedents. It encompasses five common health behavior theories—health belief model, theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, an ecological perspective, and transtheoretical model. The PER Worksheet is organized into three columns: P redisposing, E nabling, and R einforcing factors, terms of the PRECEDE/PROCEED model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> We recently started orthogonal two‐port carbon ion therapy for ocular melanoma with the intent to reduce incidence of radiation complications that occur with mono‐port therapy. In order to calculate dose distributions for this therapy, biophysical beam characteristics was investigated and defined as input into the treatment planning software. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Uniform fields of the vertical and the horizontal carbon‐ion beams from a synchrotron were shaped with the passive beam shaping systems. Apertures and range compensators (RC) were designed for individual patients. We used a commercially available treatment planning system for proton therapy, which was customized to our carbon‐ion beams. The physical depth dose profiles were measured with an ionization chamber and LET depth profiles were calculated. Variation of the survival curves with LET for HMV‐I cell were obtained experimentally. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce the spread‐out Bragg peaks with region of uniform HMV‐I cell killing for delivery of 70 Gray‐Equivalent in five fractions. The beam penumbra was defined based on measurements with radiographic films and calculations. The lateral penumbra was estimated to be 1/3.6 of the proton beam. Dose distributions were calculated with broad beam and pencil beam algorisms using these defined beam data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The dose distributions calculated in water for typical irradiation arrangements showed the lateral penumbra width (80–20%) to be less than 0.15 cm along full penetration depth. During two years, more than twenty patients have been treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams. With the use of RC, the dose distributions showed high conformity to tumors with low dose to organs at risk such as I‐C body and disk. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The biophysical beam characteristic for clinical dose calculation was described. The employed bio‐clinical model could be evaluated by clinical outcome.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Recent studies demonstrate that imaging procedures in radiotherapy for patient setup may add significantly to the doses to the normal tissues of the radiotherapy patient, especially using MV and kV cone‐beam CT (CBCT). These imaging procedures add the dose to an already high level of therapeutic radiation to organs. Accounting for image‐guidance dose is becoming increasingly important for radiation oncologists with regards to the total dose limit for normal tissues. This study is to accurately model and quantitate the additional dose from image‐guidance procedures, especially kV CBCT, as part of radiotherapy dose in the patient treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Unlike megavoltage photon beam in which the dose calculations mainly depend on the electron density of the media, the dose calculations of kilovoltage x‐ray depend on atomic number of the medium due to the photo‐electric effect. Therefore, kV x‐ray dose calculation is not available in current radiotherapy treatment planning systems. The Monte Carlo code BEAMnrc was used to generate kV CBCT beams and DOSXYZnrc was used to calculate dose to the patient using volumetric CBCT images. The dose‐volume‐histograms (DVHs) for organs were evaluated. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For a representative head‐and‐neck cancer patient treated with 33 fractions of IMRT, if the kV‐CBCT procedure was used in each treatment fraction, the accumulative imaging dose can total 230 cGy to 95% of the eye volume, a minimum of 132 cGy to 90% of the soft tissues within the imaged volume, and 528 cGy to 90% of the cervical vertebral volume. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The DVH analyses show significant doses to radiosensitive organs from repeated CBCT procedures. Hence, the management of imaging dose during radiotherapy is important to reduce the risk of complications. Total therapeutic dose limits in the treatment planning process may need to include the additional x‐ray dose to radiosensitive organs from image‐guidance procedures.</jats:p>",

The authors developed a coding protocol to measure the quality and comprehensiveness of reintegration planning for sex offenders. The protocol was retrospectively applied to groups of recidivists and nonrecidivists who were matched on static risk level and follow-up time. The protocol demonstrated adequate reliability. Compared to nonrecidivists, recidivists had significantly lower scores relating to accommodation, employment, and the Good Lives Model secondary goods, as well as lower total reintegration plan scores. ANCOVAs showed that when IQ and level of sexual deviance were controlled for, accommodation (a place to live) was significantly related to sexual recidivism and the Good Lives Model—secondary goods was significantly related to any recidivism. These results suggest that poor reintegration planning may be a risk factor for recidivism. </jats:p>",

Balancing the ethical principles of parental autonomy, the child’s right to self-determination, beneficence, the child’s best interest, and the appropriate use of limited resources can impede the expediency with which a discharge plan is executed.

For each pair of reference and test volumes axial overestimation and underestimation areas as functions of z coordinate are defined as the areas bounded by the set of contours in each axial slice. The axial underestimation and overestimation volumes are defined as integrals of corresponding areas along the z‐coordinate. The sagittal and coronal under/overestimation areas and volumes are defined analogously. An efficient and robust implementation for polygonal contours was obtained by using the Delaunay triangulation. The above metrics were used to compare different methods for determination of demonstrable respiratory motion of the GTV (iGTV) in 4‐D CT datasets. 27 patients with non‐small‐cell lung cancer (stage I: 17, stage III: 10) who underwent 4‐D CT simulation were studied. The iGTV was determined manually by (a) combining the GTV contours from 10 phases (GTV<jats:sub>AllPhases</jats:sub>) (b) combining the GTV contours from two extreme respiratory phases (0 and 50%) (GTV<jats:sub>2Phases</jats:sub>) (c) contouring using the MIP (GTV<jats:sub>MIP</jats:sub>) and (d) contouring using the MIP followed by modification with visual verification in individual respiratory phases (GTV<jats:sub>MIP_Modified</jats:sub>). For comparison of different approaches, GTV<jats:sub>AllPhases</jats:sub> was used as the reference. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The proposed metrics were successfully applied to 27 patients to show that iGTV as determined from GTV<jats:sub>MIP</jats:sub> and GTV<jats:sub>2Phases</jats:sub> underestimated iGTV as determined from the reference GTV<jats:sub>AllPhases</jats:sub>. Modification of iGTV determined from GTV<jats:sub>MIP</jats:sub> based on visual verification of contours through each individual phase reduced the degree of underestimation. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The constructed metrics provide very good tools for volumetric analysis of moving structures.</jats:p>",

Our study examined the extent of state-mandated collaboration between the Lee County School Board and Lee County government (e.g., the Lee County Department of Planning, the Office of Smart Growth, and the Department of Parks and Recreation). Specifically, we investigated planning processes under mandated coordination between the school board and the county and the impact of such coordination on the integration of land-use planning and school facility planning. By describing the process of mandated collaborative school planning in Florida, we illustrate the promise and pitfalls of such top-down legislation and offer insights to other state and local governments looking for ways to improve local planning and to increase physical activity among children.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To describe the commissioning process of a treatment planning system with proton therapy capability. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Simple proton beam arrangements can deliver very precise and highly conformal dose distributions to complex targets and simultaneously conformally avoid critical structures in the vicinity of the target. But proton treatment planning is quite challenging and less forgiving to errors, so commissioning a proton therapy treatment planning system presents its own challenges. Recently, we commissioned a new treatment planning system (Odysey™‐4.01). This treatment planning system has both proton and photon planning capability. We will present the process and results of our experience with commissioning the proton‐planning component of this system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In the non‐dosimetric part of commissioning, various tools and features of the treatment planning system were tested for specifications and were found to be within specs. The fidelity of the data and image transfer from CT to the treatment planning system and from treatment planning system to the treatment rooms was checked and found to be accurate. The treatment devices (compensator boluses and apertures) created by the planning system were checked for accuracy. In the dosimetric commissioning we compared depth dose profiles and beam profiles generated by the treatment planning system with the measured data for regular fields. Dose distributions generated by patch and match field arrangements, and for small stereotactic radio‐surgery (SRS) fields were verified by direct measurements in a phantom. The dose monitor units from treatment planning and hand calculations agreed within 2% for fields larger than 5 cm. Smaller fields needed portal specific calibration. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> All tests performed as part of commissioning were within specifications. For patch and match fields, dosimetric verification of the plan generated dose distributions is highly recommended.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To demonstrate the first instance of the direct production of deliverable plans using multi‐objective IMRT treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Three clinical IMRT cases are studied: a pancreas, prostate, and brain. The research software ORBIT Workstation is used to create a database of Pareto optimal treatment plans. For each case, N+1 plans are generated, where N is the number of objective functions. N=6, 8, and 9 for the pancreas, prostate, and brain, respectively. The N+1 plans are the N anchor points solutions (each objective individually minimized) and a single equally weighted solution. For all runs, a minimum dose to the target of approximately 90% of Rx dose is used as a constraint to ensure that each plan has some target coverage. The resulting plan database is navigated with a graphical user interface that allows users to improve any objective by appropriately mixing the plans in the database in real time. The final averaged plan is then used as the input to a dose matching algorithm in ORBIT, which achieves that plan using direct machine parameter optimization (DMPO). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We find that the database of size N+1 is adequate to explore the treatment tradeoffs and select a treatment plan. The selected plan can be reproduced with DMPO, and in fact the normal tissue sparing is typically improved during this step. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Since smooth navigation of Pareto optimal plans involves averaging plans, navigation can be done only before the plans are sequenced. We demonstrate the success of a two step approach, where first plans are generated and navigated in beamlet space and then the selected mixed plan is made deliverable by a DMPO dose mimicking algorithm. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Work done in collaboration with RaySearch Laboratories.</jats:p>",

The alleged benefits range from the growth of trust and social capital to better policy delivery and implementation involving a greater range of actors in the policy process. Yet, in many cases, poorly carried out partnership and participatory efforts can produce outcomes directly opposite to the benefits listed above. The author examines participation as a structural phenomenon and in doing so offers insights into how relationships could be strengthened in order to avoid these negative outcomes. Social network analysis is used to examine the structural relationships found within an urban redevelopment project in Portsmouth, England. Through the application of these measures, a number of relational patterns emerged which were not conducive to participation and left community groups feeling overwhelmed and underrepresented. The author concludes by noting how this technique could be used not only to highlight network imbalances, as seen in the case study, but also to offer community groups proactive advice in developing their network ties and communication structures, thus improving their overall position within the network and helping to deliver better levels of trust and social capital to the process. </jats:p>",

Geometry and dimensions of the simulated treatment devices, including accessories, are obtained from measurements of our own machines as well as limited use of schematics. DICOM filters are implemented to process the planning data exported from the treatment planning system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The patient's body contour, either outlined in the treatment planning system or generated by the IDL program from CT images, can be displayed as part of the 3D virtual linac.

Additionally, the patient's position on the couch can be translated in three dimensions. The result is the ability to accurately simulate almost any external beam treatment. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Since the 3D graphical models of the treatment units and the patient outline were established, the collision avoidance can be performed by visually simulating the treatment plan. Our virtual linac system includes add‐on accessories such as the electron cones and the SRS head frames; users can easily measure the clearance of device‐to‐patient‐couch and it does not need to use any complicated mathematical model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Collision avoidance of the treatment accelerator components such as gantry, table, collimators, jaws, and fixation devices with the patient is one of the biggest concerns in external treatment planning. Most commercial treatment planning systems do not include collision prevention simulation step. On the other hand, a fool‐proof collision‐map, lookup table, and simpler analytical method guard only against the most apparent collisions. Thus, a comprehensive virtual simulator design for collision avoidance is very useful for external radiotherapy planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> An accurate modeling of the treatment accelerator is possible with geometric data. Three‐dimensional patient modeling is also possible from the patient's CT data. Since each component in the data bank is described as an independent mesh modeling based on the type of associated polygons, relative position changes can be described easily for the device dynamics simulation. The relative motions of the gantry and the treatment table are collected from the treatment plan and the graphical user interface generates the events at the given time intervals. This visual system is incorporated with the treatment planning simulation system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The quality verification of our virtual simulator for the potential collision has been performed with two combinations of treatment table and gantry rotations where a collision is eminent based on the visual assessment. The planner can search for beam paths with minimal critical structure interference before extensive optimization process. A database of CT and MR scans for all tumor sites is being built, which provide useful information to map all potential collision possibilities for all treatment isocenters. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The important benefits of this virtual simulator is the replacement of the conventional laborious procedures required for the expensive hardware simulator unit, the efficiency increment, the accuracy improvement of radiation treatment procedure, and the cost reduction in terms of time and physical patient's presence.</jats:p>",

A central argument is that, across the different issue contexts, patterns of perceived agency are crucial to understanding the apparent contradiction in citizens' attributions of role-responsibilities for the management of risk. The empirical basis of the paper is a series of twelve reconvened focus groups conducted at locations around England, giving a total of twenty-four meetings, in which citizens discussed six different areas of technological risk: genetically modified (GM) crops, genetic testing, mobile-phone handsets; mobile-phone masts; radioactive waste; and climate change. The authors highlight the problem of citizen ambivalence towards responsibility, tracing it to perceived tensions affecting both citizen and state performances of responsibility, and conclude by discussing the implications for policy and by outlining an agenda for further research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite its broad definition, the concept of sustainability has become central to regeneration policy in the UK. A growing body of research, however, suggests that the policy goals of urban regeneration and sustainable development are not being integrated in practice. Ambiguity surrounding what ‘sustainability’ actually means is often cited as the reason why projects fail to achieve policy goals. We seek to make an innovative contribution to this debate, arguing that sustainability does make a positive difference in practice, and that it is necessary to develop approaches that capture these ‘actually existing sustainabilities’. Using a detailed case study of a multistakeholder regeneration project, we develop a more positive analysis of the role which ambiguity plays in the development process. We advance a dialogic conception of sustainability based upon Michel Bakhtin's sociolinguistic theory of the word as a ‘shared territory’. We suggest that the notion of sustainability acts as a shared territory for meaning around which diverse stakeholder groups coalesce, and show how the ambiguity inherent in this shared conception can generate more creative (and sustainable) outcomes to developmental challenges. Viewing sustainability as a shared territory makes ambiguity not only intelligible, but also desirable to the development process, and it is argued that there is a need to avoid the reduction of sustainability to the assessment of predetermined benchmarks or policy goals, both within the regeneration literature and across studies of planning policy and practice more generally. </jats:p>",

There is an increasing quest and support for a “harmonised” business approach to sustainable use of land and water resources to achieve enduring business partnerships in the water management. The “system harmonisation” approach seeks to identify business opportunities for irrigators to become an integral part of an expanding environmental services industry and in so doing support a truly sustainable and diversified irrigation business environment The system harmonisation framework involves an all‐encompassing approach that combines research and business principles to achieve productive and environmental improvements at the catchment level. The framework involves five feasibility steps including three research components and a business analysis component leading to the formation of regional irrigation business partnerships (RIBPs). The system harmonisation process establishes the base physical, economic and social position of the region, identifies the key biophysical, economic, social, environmental or institutional pressure points in the system and the system constraints. Changes in these key pressure points need to be assessed and acted upon, in a comprehensive and systematic way, to enhance the multifunctional productivity of irrigation systems.

This is not only true because firms are more exposed to catastrophes, but also the result of investments made in recent years to operate supply chains with fewer human and capital resources, especially inventory. Consequently, there is today less “slack” available in supply chains to deal with catastrophic events. Thus, proactively planning for these types of events should be a priority for supply chain managers. A catastrophic event has a very low probability of occurrence but has significant consequences if it does occur. The goal of this research is to develop a process to proactively plan for catastrophic risk events through an integration of diverse research streams related to the management of risk. In particular, the proposed process builds upon an existing risk analysis framework by incorporating an innovative methodology used by the insurance industry to quantify the risk of multiple types of catastrophic events on key supply chain locations.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To illustrate the use of patch field arrangements to treat geometrically complex tumors with proton beams. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> One very important property of a high‐energy proton beam is the ease with which it can be stopped at a desired depth in a medium and the sharp distal dose fall‐off near the end of range. This leads to the creation of straightforward beam arrangements to treat very complex tumor shapes. One variation of these beam arrangements is the patch field arrangement. These patch field arrangements are a powerful tool in proton therapy planning. A geometrically complex tumor, e.g., one wrapped around a critical structure, can be treated by a patch field arrangement in which one beam, called a shoot‐through beam, irradiates a part of the tumor. Patching another beam from a different direction and distally stopping this beam on the lateral edge of the shoot‐through beam irradiates the tumor not treated by the shoot‐through beam. We will show how proton patch fields can be used to treat complex clinical cases. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We present two plans showing the use of proton patch fields to treat two clinical cases. These cases demonstrate the simplicity of the patch field beam arrangements and the ease with which critical structures can be conformally spared and tumors can be fully irradiated. In addition, these beam arrangements are quite simple to set up clinically. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> In any clinical practice, one is frequently faced with difficult cases in which tumors, because of their proximity to critical structures, can neither be fully resected nor can they be safely treated with conventional radiation. Proton irradiation, because of its superior dosimetric characteristics, offers treatment options for such cases.</jats:p>",

In this algorithm, approximations are performed in the physics of transport of particles which may lead to significant deviations in inhomogeneous media. In the phantom study, an inhomogeneous phantom was build using two sets of slabs of low‐density material (0.3 g/cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) separated by two thicker slabs of water‐like density material. The phantom was irradiated using three static fields with sizes of 1.25×2.5, 2.5×2.5 and 10×2.5 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>. Dose distributions were calculated by both C/S and TomoPen and compared to measurements made with EBT gafchromic films. This experiment enables to evaluate the capability of the C/S algorithm to handle loss of lateral electronic equilibrium effects. Clinical cases were also studied for various tumor locations and dose‐volume histograms (DVH) obtained with C/S and TomoPen were compared. To ensure a “fair” comparison, all the calculations were performed using identical dose grid and DVH computation engine. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In the inhomogeneous phantom study, good agreement (within 3%/2mm) was achieved between C/S, TomoPen and measurements proving that the C/S algorithm accounts for loss of electronic equilibrium effects. For the clinical cases already compared in this ongoing study, a very good agreement was generally achieved between TomoPen and C/S excepted for small lung tumors where differences up to 3% could be observed for the mean dose to the target volume. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Those results proved the ability of the C/S algorithm to compute accurately the dose in inhomogeneities but demonstrated also the potential of introducing TomoPen in clinical practice, especially for small lung tumors. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research sponsored by Tomotherapy incorporated.</jats:p>",

These data have been compiled for use in evaluating different planning system calculation algorithms. Ones we reviewed, as examples, included Pinnacle and the correction‐based, older version of Eclipse. The data were taken with the intent of exploring the limits in the capabilities of planning systems to handle both energy and small‐field effects. As such, data extended from 2×2 to 10×10 cm<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> field sizes over the available range of energies. It is also becoming increasingly important to find some method of checking monitor units generated by these planning systems when heterogeneities are included. To this end, we also evaluated the range of performance accuracy for two, familiar 1‐dimensional inhomogeneity correction factors (ICF): a variation on the primary transmission‐based effective attenuation method and the TMR ratio method. <jats:bold>Results &amp; Conclusion:</jats:bold> We found, as have others, that Pinnacle predicts doses to, generally, within ±5%, even near interfaces over the full range of energies and field sizes tested. Eclipse (pre‐AAA model) Batho and equivalent TAR algorithms were equivalent to, or poorer than the 1‐dimensional ICF corrections, particularly with increasing energy and decreasing field size. The effective attenuation and TMR ratio methods were adequate for 6 MV, even for 2×2 fields and appear to have application for 6×6 fields and larger at all energies. In the interest of patient safety, we recommend that some type of corrected backup calculation be done to verify every treatment plan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Given the propensity of Canadians to migrate, it is likely that migration has a large impact upon the distribution and redistribution of income across regions. Such impacts may be magnified within the older population, as their relocation involves the transfer of nonearned income such as pensions, retirement investments, or other income supplements from province to province and so return migration to a province of birth following retirement subsidizes local economies. By using methods proposed by Plane in 1999, income-based versions of demographic effectiveness are applied to evaluate the movement of nonearned income in the Canadian context among Canada's older population. The analysis uses data drawn from the 2001 Canadian Census, and focuses upon the older population (aged 60+ in 2001) who reported nonearned incomes in 2000. The paper distinguishes between four types of nonearned income, including (i) Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplements; (ii) Canada/Québec pension plan benefits; (iii) Retirement Investment income; and (iv) Investment Income. The objectives of the paper are twofold. First, it documents the movement of nonearned income between Canada's provinces, focusing upon the demographic effectiveness of the observed flows. Second, the paper explores the potential for primary, return, and onward migration to redistribute nonearnings income across Canada, and the significance of regional income redistributions by each type of migration. Results illustrate the importance of migration in transferring nonearned incomes over space, and the particular importance of return migration as a vehicle to redistribute nonearned income to economically depressed provinces. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, extraction of logs and their products is one of the most important operations in harvesting which is generally carried out by machinery along skid trail network. Therefore, determining skid trails and taking into consideration the related standards is necessary in order to reach harvesting objectives. GPS was used to survey skid trails and existing road network of Shafaroud Forest District number 3 and then a Map of skid trail network was prepared. The prepared Map covered 1059 hectares of Shafaroud Forest District Number 3. Then with the use of environmental factors and analyzing them the area was divided into suitable and unsuitable areas: Unsuitable areas are; areas with slope of more than 65%, soil susceptible to land slide, areas with ruined forest (volume less than100m3/ha), areas which contain Porotia, Diospirus and Pertrocaria species, areas with no trees, rural areas and valleys. Suitable areas are; areas with slope of less than 65%, areas with suitable soil, good drainage and suitable texture, areas that have volume of more than 100m3/ha, area which have Fagus and Carpinus species, etc. \nGIS Arc view/Arc info and etc were used to digitize and prepare related Maps and in order to find suitable areas and avoiding environmental damages the most suitable skid trails network were designed which covers 801ha of total area of district. Finally, the existing skid trails network Map was compared with the most suitable designed skid trails network. The results showed that 712 ha of the area that were covered by existing skid trails network were unsuitable areas for designing and constructing skid trails network and therefore causes environmental damages and also only 347 ha of the area that were covered by existing skid trails network were suitable areas. Meanwhile 454 ha of total District which were suitable areas, were not covered by the existing skid trails network. These areas were considered when designing the new skid trails network. The results of this research can be used in designing more appropriate skid trails with less environmental damages.</jats:p>",

It calculates the RBE for cell lines or tissues starting from the corresponding experimental/clinical photon data and an amorphous track structure model. Different track structure models that use energy‐dependent as well as energy‐independent core radii are investigated and compared to in vitro and in vivo data. Additionally, we apply them to calculate the biologically effective dose along a spread‐out Bragg peak for typical chordoma treatments. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We show that the LEM is sensitive to different descriptions of the radial dose distributions. However, by changing a single model parameter of the photon reference curve, reasonable RBE values can be achieved for all dose distributions. The general improvement of predictions using a modified version of the LEM with an energy‐dependent core radius is demonstrated by comparison to in vitro data of human cell lines and to experimental data of the radiation tolerance of the rat spinal cord. Additionally, we find a larger therapeutic ratio for the modified model version relative to the original LEM for a typical treatment scenario for chordoma patients. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The Local Effect Model is sensitive to the inner part (few nanometers) of different track structure descriptions. Since these interactions of ions with liquid water are neither well understood experimentally nor theoretically, more studies should address the energy deposition around ion tracks. This will be in particular useful for further optimization of carbon ion therapy in general and with respect to comparison with other treatment modalities like protons or IMRT.</jats:p>",

The closest thing resembling a spatial policy is the outdated and unofficial European Spatial Development Perspective (ESDP). The inclusion of the term ‘territorial cohesion’ in the Reform Treaty has created new opportunities for proponents of European spatial planning. Despite wide political support for the concept, there is still little consensus on its actual meaning. The purpose of this paper is to take stock of this curious situation. This is done by raising some fundamental issues. Does a ‘planning subject’ and ‘planning object’ exist in Europe? What different interpretations of territorial cohesion are there, and what implications could this have? These issues are investigated further by means of a recent ESPON study which produced several policy‐oriented spatial scenarios. Ultimately, the lack of a precise definition of territorial cohesion may prove to be advantageous.</jats:p>",

While these diverse literatures have provided needed theoretical advancement to rethink the city in relation to political–economic change, they also run the risk of conceptualizing, studying, and representing cities without sufficient attention to the spatial copresence of multiple actors. The result is that some treatments of the city reproduce a unified story line that conceals human agency, reads as if there is only one trajectory on which all cities are moving, and does not engage in imagining alternative urban futures. In this paper we suggest that there is a continued need to critically examine the spatial narratives mobilized both by researchers as well as by the other actors they encounter. Drawing on the widespread idea that the stories which researchers tell are intimately linked with the conduct of research itself, we advocate a researcher mode of engagement that permits collaborative critique of projects that aim to transform urban space. We report on our experience with two research practices—grounded interviewing, and the public research memo—to provide empirical examples of our perspective. </jats:p>",

The 4D Planning module uses deformable registration and information about beam movement to calculate a dose distribution that takes into account both target movement and tissue deformation during treatment (4D dose). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For the 3D dose in the coronal film, 64.4% of pixels had a disagreement of 3% or less between measured and predicted dose; for the 4D dose distribution, 97.6% of pixels had a disagreement of 3% or less. Using a Gamma function with a passing criterion of 5% dose difference or 3mm distance to agreement, 94.9% of pixels pass for the 3D dose and 100.0% of pixels pass for 4D dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The 4D Planning module accurately calculated dose in this phantom test for a moving target.</jats:p>",

A treatment plan is Pareto optimal if there does not exist another plan which is better in at least one objective and at least as good in every objective. We analyze Pareto optimal plan databases by three methods. The first method examines the points as they are added sequentially, and for each newly added point we determine how “new” that point is (i.e. how far that point is from the convex hull of the previously generated points). Principal component analysis (PCA) on the set of beamlet solutions is used to understand the shape of the Pareto surface in beamlet space. Correlations between objectives are found by computing Spearman correlation coefficients on each pair of objectives. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We compute Pareto surfaces from 3 to 10 dimensions for pancreas, prostate, and brain cases. For all cases, we find that after about 40 plans, subsequently generated plans are very close to what can be achieved by averaging the previous plans. Therefore, allowing for averaging of plans, which is possible if the plans have not been sequenced yet, the entire Pareto surface can be well approximated by a small number of plans. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Since the shape of the feasible set is relatively simple, as demonstrated by PCA, the Pareto surface is simple to describe, regardless of the number or types of objectives used. Once plans that span this space are computed, further plans do not add to the diversity of solutions available. Based on the analyses, we offer a simplified strategy for finding a small set of spanning Pareto optimal plans.</jats:p>",

Disciplines were formed into impact assessment groups, which were charged with developing indicators and targets for identified values and objectives and with constructing models to predict the impacts of forest management activities. Three different modeling approaches were used in developing the plan and the best results were obtained by integrating indicators directly into the forecasting model even when the indicators were simple versions of complex models. Integrating indicators into the forecasting model reduced the penalty cost on other indicators, permitted the model to find better solutions, provided almost immediate feedback to the plan development team, permitted more scenarios to be investigated, and provided a better understanding of the dynamics and tradeoffs. The other two techniques used in the DFMP involved the assessment of forecasted scenarios with more complex discipline specific models, which provided more detailed information about the indicators.

While Wisconsin's law remains a work in progress, it illustrates the contemporary policy battles over land use and smart growth and the resurgence of the property-rights movement. It further highlights the influence of smart-growth coalitions and policy networks on planning reform. The authors suggest that planning practitioners and active-living proponents can adapt and transfer these policy lessons from Wisconsin to address the complex relationships of the built environment, physical activity, and the nation's current obesity problem through state and local planning reforms.</jats:p>",

The method consists of two phases: 2D extraction and 3D extraction phases. In the 2D extraction phase, smoothing and multilevel thresholding based on CT values are performed for each ROI (Region Of Interest) on all the CT images. Next, erosion followed by dilation of the extracted blobs is applied to eliminate speckle‐shaped and thin line‐shaped blobs. Subsequently, island blobs having areas less than a predetermined threshold level are removed. After that, the compactness that characterizes a disk‐shaped blob is calculated for blobs in each ROI image and the disk‐shaped blob having the maximum compactness is identified because a contour of spinal canal in axial plane is close to a ring. In the subsequent 3D extraction phase, false regions are removed by evaluating position variations of the centers of gravity of the identified blobs in the slice direction. For improperly extracted ROI images that have no reasonable blobs, interpolation in the slice direction is performed by referring to the properly extracted blobs in the adjacent slice images on both sides. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The false blobs in 2D extraction phase are replaced to reasonable ones in 3D extraction phase and smoother shape is clearly observed in 3D views of segmented spinal canal. The calculation time was approximately six seconds for 126 slices in lung SRT (Stereotactic radiotherapy) datasets. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We proposed a fast automatic spinal canal segmentation approach. Verification results have showed that the proposed method is well‐balanced speed and accuracy combination, which expectedly results in significant acceleration of radiation treatment planning with reduced oncologist's workload.</jats:p>",

Water balance analysis indicated moderate water surplus at Malleboinpally (179 mm) and at Nandavaram it is low at 40 mm. Both watersheds have similar water deficits of 1050-1100 mm per year. Runoff analyses indicated that about 0.3 to 0.5 million m3 water is available for storage during normal years at the watershed area of 500 ha. In the wet years, Malleboinpally has a potential of about 1.25 million m3. Nandavaram has the lowest potential even in wet years. Though both the locations have Semi-Arid type of climate, there is a tendency for the climate to temporarily shift towards drier side. Malleboinpally has the most stable climate (Semi-Arid) climate. In contrast, Nandavaram showed higher tendency towards arid type of climate. Nandavaram provides greater opportunity for double cropping as the LGP here ranges from 120 to 195 days. Malleboinpally has LGP ranging from 100 to 160 days and provides greater potential for sole cropping during rainy season and intercropping with short to medium-duration crops. Early and mid-season droughts occur at Nandavaram and this watershed would require crop / varieties tolerant to early or mid- season droughts depending upon the location. Malleboinpally has greater potential for water harvesting and offers opportunity for supplemental irrigation. These results help in arriving at efficient and sustainable management of natural resources and thereby sustaining rural livelihoods at watershed level.</jats:p>"

Additional MC methods were implemented in order to provide different complexity levels for the MC simulation: Considering the collimators as totally absorbing, considering attenuation only, considering first order or all Compton scatter. Furthermore, either a simple or an exact geometry can be selected for the absorbing or attenuation method. Phase spaces above and dose distributions in a water phantom are analyzed for artificial and clinical treatment fields using 6 and 15 MV beams. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For all MC methods, differences in the radial mean energy and radial energy fluence are within 1% inside the geometric field. Below the collimators the energy fluence is underestimated for non‐full MC transport methods ranging from 5% for all Compton to 100% for absorbing. Gamma analysis using EGSnrc calculated doses as reference shows that the percentage of voxels fulfilling a 1%/1mm‐criterion decreases from 99% when using VMC++ to 80% (non‐IMRT) and 40% (IMRT) when the absorbing method in a simple geometry is used. However, compared with EGSnrc calculations, the gain in efficiency is a factor of 10 for VMC++ and 90 for the absorbing method. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results of this investigation suggest that it might be suitable to use a simple transport technique in the initial treatment planning process and use more accurate transport methods towards the end of the planning process accepting longer calculation time. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work was supported in part by Varian Medical Systems.</jats:p>",

The spatiality of greening is expressed by showing how spatial relations, territorial spaces, and spatial differences were created and utilised within the process. Empirically, the focus is on the Russian forest sector. By analysing two examples, a conflict over old-growth forests, and a forest certification process, the study indicates how spatial reorientation and the westward export of the forest industry have resulted in greening timber markets in various parts of the Russian forest peripheries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Through an exploration of UK municipal waste policy, this paper examines debates on environmental policy integration (EPI) and governance. We argue that this policy arena has been characterised by modes of vertical integration, which have failed to promote the horizontal integration required to move beyond the limits of anachronistic institutional structures and have failed to achieve the paradigm shift needed to make meaningful progress towards sustainability. Through this analysis we develop three critical arguments. First, that the analysis of EPI requires attention to embedded paradigms, structures, and dynamics at all levels of governance, emphasising the importance of incorporating subnational levels of governing to EPI analyses. Second, that both analysis of and arguments for EPI need to engage more fully with broader dynamics of governing and to recognise the coexistence of contradictory processes of integration. Finally, we sound a note of caution in relation to calls for EPI. In the messy, dynamic, and multilevel reality in which EPI has to be implemented, such calls must recognise both sustainability and policy integration as iterative processes rather than as predetermined blueprints. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The lack of early integration with the planning and decision-making process has been a major problem in environmental assessment. Traditional project-based environmental impact assessment has inadequate incentives and capacities to incorporate critical environmental impacts at a broader temporal or spatial scale. While many applications have been geared towards implementing project-level environmental assessments, comparatively little research has been done to determine how to incorporate strategically critical environmental impacts into local comprehensive land use planning. Although the principles of strategic environmental assessment (SEA) are not yet required in local comprehensive land use planning in the United States, these principles create a theoretical framework for local environmental assessment. This study builds a theoretical framework for more effectively integrating the principles of strategic environmental assessment into local comprehensive land use plans. The empirical case study results indicate that California local jurisdictions did not fully integrated the SEA principles into their local plans. </jats:p>",

IMRT treatment plans created with the flattening filter (F) were reoptimized with equivalent segments and computed for the beam model without the filter (NF) on 10 clinical head‐and‐neck cases. All plans (F and NF) were compared for equivalence and delivered to phantoms; treatment time and dose agreement with planning system were determined. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Dose distributions are similar between the two beam lines, and clinically reasonable plans were created despite the absence of the flattening filter. PTV hot spots were &lt;0.5% hotter and cold spots were &lt;0.5% colder for the (NF) plan. Similarly, all other ROIs investigated were within 1% for hot spots and cold spots. On average NF plans required 15% more MU, but delivered treatments were shorter (9 min vs 11 min). Dosimetric differences between computed and ion chamber measurements were similar (−1.7%+/−1.3% − F) and (1.7%+/−1.9% − NF). The number of pixels meeting gamma map criteria of 3%/3mm, 5%/5mm, and 7%/7mm were statistically equivalent (p = 0.6): [88.5%, 96.8%, and 97.8% (NF)], [87.8%, 96.6%, and 97.9% (F)]. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The planning system was able to generate equivalent plans, and measured dose distributions in ion chamber and film show no difference between beam models with or without the flattening filter. At the higher dose rate, overall treatment times were reduced and could be applied to gating and hypofractionation. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research supported by industrial grant from Siemens Medical Solutions.</jats:p>",

Delivery method (step and shoot vs. dynamic), leakage radiation variations (lack of secondary collimators on the Elekta SL‐S MLC head), hardware constraints and leaf edge shape all factor in when a radiation treatment planning system (RTPS) optimizes MLC segments. Different optimization algorithms within treatment planning systems influence IMRT planning results as well. In our study we evaluated delivery efficiencies from Elekta, Varian and Siemens machines coupling with two different treatment planning systems. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> 16 IMRT plans were created for prostate and headneck (HN) sites (5 and 6 co‐planar beams respectively) using CMS Xio and Philips ADAC Pinnacle. Plans were optimized using the same dose and DVH objectives and modulated using clinical thresholds. The monitor units needed to deliver the weight point dose for each field were tabulated for each site and machine source data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> All plans have similar quality meeting the objectives. HN plans have an average MU efficiency of 5.02 +/− 1.09 MU/cGy. The plans created on the Pinnacle RTPS had a lower mean efficiency but was not statistically significant due to the high standard deviation. Prostate plans were more efficient than the HN plans with an average value of 2.19 +/− 0.47 MU/cGy. Pinnacle prostate plans had a mean MU efficiency of 1.69 +/− 0.18 MU/cGy compared to 2.51 +/− 0.22 MU/cGy from Xio. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> There is no statistical difference in MU efficiency for HN plans from different planning/delivery system combinations. Prostate plans have higher delivery MU efficiencies than those from HN plans, most likely due to less modulation. For the prostate plans there exist slight differences in MU efficiencies with unknown clinical significance between different planning/delivery systems.</jats:p>",

After the Stalinist years in which they could communicate very little, they found that they had much to learn from each other. Mathematical economics came to bridge the divide between East and West even though the meetings and collaborations between American and Soviet colleagues were fraught with tension and misunderstanding. The Cold War excitement about mathematical economics and the East-West cooperation it allowed, however, dwindled with the end of détente, the global shift in economic science away from mathematical economics, and the end of state socialism in the East Bloc. To understand the rise and fall of this cooperation and convergence, we examine the case of the connection between Tjalling C. Koopmans, a Dutch economist living in the United States as a result of World War II, and Leonid V. Kantorovich, a Russian scientist living in the Soviet Union. These two men jointly won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1975. Their scientific connections reflect the broader experiences of East-West scientific collaboration during the Cold War. At the same time, they offer insights for scholars regarding struggles over scientific research priority and the potential for convergence between capitalism and socialism during the Cold War era.</jats:p>",

The same CT data, contours, isocenter, number of beams (7–9), beam angles, and calculation grid spacing (2 mm) as in the original XiO plans were used for the Monaco treatment planning. Biological cost functions were used with parameter values suggested in a Monaco training manual as initial guesses. Iterative adjustment of isoconstraint values followed by re‐optimization was continued until approximately 95% coverage of each target volume by a prescription dose was achieved. A Monte Carlo algorithm with 3% variance was used for final dose calculation in Monaco. Dose calculations in XiO were performed using a fast superposition algorithm. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Monaco plans tend to result in smaller values of the mean dose and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) for OARs (15 out of 17 OARs in all plans combined) and greater mean doses and gEUD for targets (4/5). Maximum doses to normal structures are sometimes greater in Monaco compared to XiO (6/17) as a consequence of larger hot spots in target volumes. Dose heterogeneity was increased for all but one target in Monaco plans. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The biologically based Monaco TPS has the potential to generate superior IMRT treatment plans compared to the dose‐based XiO TPS, as judged by better or equivalent target coverage accompanied by reduction in normal tissue exposure. However, greater dose inhomogeneity in the target must be accepted in most cases.</jats:p>",

The method overcomes the limitations of traditional methods used in 3D volume reconstruction which can be quite irregular, leading to non‐physical beam intensities during inverse‐planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Stacks of contours are extracted from DICOM RS files which are exported from the treatment planning system. Surface models are generated from the contours via a surface reconstruction algorithm. The surface reconstruction algorithm contains two steps. First, contours are triangulated and medial axes are computed. Then, contours on adjacent cross sections are joined to create a surface. Gaussian and other surface smoothing operators are applied to the surface models. The smoothed models are re‐sliced with CT planes to produce new contours. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The Gaussian surface smoothing operator is an excellent smoothing tool but suffers from the volume shrinkage problem. To circumvent this problem, a volume‐preserving surface smoothing operation is implemented (Taubin's surface smoothing algorithm), which uses a non‐shrinking variant of the Gaussian smoothing algorithm. As noted in the figures, the method, applied to prostate volumes, shows good correspondence between the smoothed and original volumes. The mean 3D vector distance between the smoothed and original surfaces was 0.6 mm (RMS = 0.8 mm) for an example case. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The proposed surface‐based reconstruction algorithm produces more physically realistic, smooth target volumes in 3D while maintaining the overall structure of the original volume.

Dose‐population histograms were generated comparing target coverage and normal tissue sparing of all critical structures between the treatment groups. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The anterior beam treatment significantly spared the anterior rectal wall more than the IMRT and bilateral beam treatments at the 70 Gy (12.3% vs 19.2% and 19.2%), 60 Gy (15.7% vs 23.8% and 24.3%), 45 Gy (19.4% vs 30.1% and 29.6%), and 30 Gy dose levels (22.7% vs 39.9% and 34.2%). Bladder wall dose was greater in the anterior beam treatment than IMRT and bilateral beam treatments at the 70 Gy (14.1% vs 11.2% and 12.8%), 60 Gy (22.5% vs 13.7% and 16.2%), 45 Gy (29.0% vs 17.9% and 19.8%), and 30 Gy dose levels (32.6% vs 25.1% and 23.1%). No dose was delivered to the femoral heads with the anterior beam treatment while the IMRT and bilateral treatments delivered a mean dose of 17.0 Gy and 25.1 Gy to the femoral heads respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> With the implementation of in vivo proton beam detection, anterior proton beam treatment of prostate is a possible treatment alternative, sparing dose to the rectum and femoral heads at the cost of a small increase in bladder dose.</jats:p>",

A chest phantom was examined with a 16-slice CT scanner. Six scans were performed with different radiation doses. The lowest radiation dose which had no impact on image quality with regard to the information required for surgical planning of patients with scoliosis, was 20 times lower than that of routinely used protocol for CT examination of the spine in children (0.38 mSv vs 7.76 mSv). Patients with scoliosis planned for corrective spinal surgery can be examined with low dose helical CT scan. The dose reduction systems (DRS) available in modern CT scanners contribute to dose reduction and should be used. </jats:p>",

The objective of this work was to evaluate the new clinical Siemens KonRad inverse treatment planning system (TPS) and compare it to the CMS XiO TPS with special emphasis on the segmentation efficiency. For head and neck, liver and prostate cancer patients, step‐and‐shoot IMRT plans were designed using both CMS XiO and Siemens KonRad TPS. Number, direction and energy of beams used were the same in the plans from both systems for each treatment site. The plans were optimized to achieve the same clinical objectives concerning dose to the target volume and to the relevant organs‐at‐risk (OARs). The number of intensity levels were minimized until the clinical objectives could not be achieved anymore. Dose‐volume histograms (DVHs), mean and maximum doses were compared, as well as the number of beam segments and monitor units (MUs). The beams of each plan were delivered individually on a MapCheck device to verify the agreement between calculations and measurements to be less than 3%–3 mm distance‐to‐agreement. Plans optimized with KonRad resulted in fewer segments and lower number of MUs and therefore reduced delivery time on average by 28% or 3.6 min, while achieving similar dose distributions. CMS XiO plans exhibited a slightly steeper dose fall‐off outside the target volumes; however the difference was not clinically significant. DVHs to OARs were comparable. All calculated dose distributions passed the 3%–3 mm verification check.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.55.D</jats:p>",

The user provides the position and label for an arbitrary vertebra center, and the algorithm automatically identifies the outlines and labels of all visible vertebrae in the field on view. The method is based on adapting 3‐D deformable vertebrae models, placed according to the relative positions derived from a spine atlas. Using the segmentation results, ellipsoid ROIs can be superposed automatically to the vertebrae using co‐registration of the segmented vertebrae with the vertebrae models in the atlas. Ellipsoid ROIs can be used for margin design and avoid excessive expansion due to vertebra processes. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The method has been validated on 29 CBCT spine datasets, representing all treatment areas: cervical, thoracic and lumbar. The total number of visible vertebrae was 234. For every dataset, segmentation was started from every visible vertebra. The deviations between the automatically detected position of the vertebra centers and their manual estimations were computed. For about 59% of all vertebrae, the median deviation was less than 5 mm, in approx. 33% of the cases was between 5 and 10 mm, and in approx. 8% of the cases was over 10 mm, which is an indication for a segmentation failure. The running time was a few seconds on a 3.4 GHz PC. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Validation study of a one‐click semi‐automated approach to spine segmentation and labeling in cone‐beam CT has been performed. The method has the potential to significantly reduce the time required to identify clinically relevant areas in online planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Recently, the inverse planning planning system Monaco (CMS Inc) version 1.0.0 was installed in our department. The Monaco system incorporates a two‐stage IMRT optimization procedure and a version of the XVMC Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm. In the first stage the fluence distribution of the IMRT beams are optimized using hard (‘biological’) constraints for the organs at risk. In the second stage, the beams are segmented and their weights optimized while still satisfy the hard constraints. In this study we investigated the dosimetric accuracy of the XVMC dose engine implemented in MONACO. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> For an ELEKTA(r) linac (6, 10 and 18 MV) depth dose curves, dose profiles and output factors were measured in a waterphantom using source‐to‐surface distances (SSD) between 80 and 100 cm. Symmetric fields ranging from 2×2 to 30×30 cm and off‐axis fields of 2×2 3×3 cm and 2×10 cm were used. In addition, GAFCHROMIC(r) film measurements were performed in anthropomorphic phantoms to validate the dose accuracy in inhomogeneous media. Furthermore, the dosimetric accuracy of IMRT fields for prostate and head‐and‐neck cancer treatments was evaluated. All fields were simulated in Monaco using a grid size of 2 mm and variances of 0.5 and 1%. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The agreement between measured and calculated dose distributions was generally within 2%. Only in the build‐up region larger dose differences were observed, especially for the highest photon energy. No impact of the SSD on the dose accuracy was observed. Calculation times for a 10×10 cm field and a 0.5 or 1% variance were 75 and 23 minutes, respectively. Conclusion: A very good agreement was observed between Monaco Monte Carlo dose calculations and measurements, allowing clinical introduction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an approach of motion planning for a humanoid robot using a state transition method. In this method, motion planning is simplified by introducing a state-space to describe the whole motion series. And each state in the state-space corresponds to a contact state specified during the motion. The continuous motion is represented by a sequence of discrete states. The concept of the transition between two neighboring states, that is the state transition, can be realized by using some traditional path planning methods. Considering the dynamical stability of the robot, a state transition method based on search strategy is proposed. Different sets of trajectories are generated by using a variable 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>-order polynomial interpolation method. After quantifying the stabilities of these trajectories, the trajectories with the largest stability margin are selected as the final state transition trajectories. Rising motion process is exemplified to validate the method and the simulation results show the proposed method to be feasible and effective. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> In Gamma Knife (GK) stereotactic radio‐surgery, highest accuracy of dose calculation is important. The attenuation of each single beam in GK is determined by their paths. The path, where each beam passes through the skull to the tumor, is determined by the measurement of skull radius. To estimate the path attenuation effect on the dose calculation is important for clinicians in deciding selection of the gamma angle, blocking beam and helmet size, etc. The purpose of this study was to design and test a new method to assess the beam path attenuation effects on dose computation in GK. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A simulation of GK C‐model was employed for this study. The skull was initially assumed to be a spherical bulb. Shot locations in the center and in the periphery of the bulb were tested. Shot center dose and each beam's contribution was calculated using the tissue maximum ratio (TMR) formula for each path. The simulation of the inhomogeneity calculation is an approach similar the procedure of finding the different paths from different beams. The dose point at different beam contribution is quantitatively calculated with variation difference. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The data from several typical plug locations showed that the path length difference could be over 50% and ensuring TMR changes could be as much as 20% of the average value. The single beam profiles at the shot center were variable; however, the composite profiles from the total beams did not show significant changes. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our method to calculate the different path length of single beam from GK treatment planning simulation model shows that the beam path parameters affect GK treatment planning. The beam profile changes based on path length variations. These findings suggest the necessity of considering dose contributions to the normal tissue from different beam paths.</jats:p>",

Several types of phantoms, combining low and high density heterogeneities ranging from air through lung to cortical bone, are used to evaluate eMC by comparing its results with measurements and with full MC simulations using DOSXYZnrc (NRC, Canada). Measurements with physical phantoms are done using EBT Gafchromic© films, leading to absolute dose. The phantoms are reproduced virtually in order to exclude the effect of the CTscan (HU — density conversion curve, noise, artifacts, …) in DOSXYZnrc and in Eclipse© for full MC and eMC calculations, respectively. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Absolute dose profiles obtained via the three methods (measurements, eMC and MC) are compared. As expected, MC simulations agree better with measurements. The three methods agree quite well in general, within 5% even in regions of high dose gradients, which is a great improvement compared over the previous algorithms. However, larger discrepancies (as high as 10%) between eMC and measurements are found under the small heterogeneities, as was already reported by Ding et al (Phys. Med. Biol. 51, 2781 (2006)). Our differences are smaller though probably due to the fact that that they use smaller heterogeneities which is harder to model due to scatter. This is still under investigation. The effect of the use of CT‐defined phantoms instead of the virtual phantoms is also part of this study. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our preliminary results using virtually designed phantoms show that eMC simulations give a good agreement with measurements within uncertainties. This study is very encouraging and shows that it should now be possible to treat the electron beams with the same kind of precision as is already done for photon beams.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The past decade has witnessed a revival of interest in the role of labour in political and economic restructuring. Following a period in the 1980s and early 1990s when trade unions and employees were routinely portrayed as passive victims of corporate restructuring, the past ten years have seen a resurgence of work by geographers highlighting the continued agency of labour. Despite this ‘new labour geography’, however, there has been little empirical research examining the uneven development of employment relations at a broad industry level. We address this issue by examining the changing geography of employment regulation in the UK's privatised rail industry. A major shift in the scale at which industrial relations are organised has taken place under privatisation, away from national collective bargaining to a system of localised company bargaining. On the basis of secondary data gathered from industry sources, we provide an initial assessment of key outcomes of employment change in the rail industry. Our analysis indicates that considerable disparities in pay and conditions exist between different groups of workers, companies, and regions, although these are perhaps less extreme than suggested by the unions. In addition, the number of industrial disputes has escalated in the aftermath of privatisation. Moreover, instead of the set piece national strikes that took place in the nationalised industry, the majority of this strike action has been conducted against particular operators at the local and regional scales, reflecting the logic of company-level bargaining. At the same time, the membership of the three main unions has actually increased in recent years against a backdrop of long-term decline, suggesting that the decentralisation of collective bargaining presents unions with opportunities as well as challenges. </jats:p>",

This study reports our investigation into the potential of using adaptive planning CT (ApCT) which combines the planning CT (pCT) and CBCT for dosimetric evaluation in the radiotherapy of head and neck cancers. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A Varian Clinac‐iX linear accelerator with the on‐board imager (OBI) was used to obtain CBCT images. The CBCT and pCT images of head and neck patients were registered weekly to generate ApCT images using our in‐house image registration software. The registration similarity measure was intensity based “mutual information” operated in the “neighborhood” region. The search was optimized using the “downhill simplex” algorithm. The registration registered internal anatomies on the pCT and CBCT, while the external contours were extracted from the CBCT and superimposed onto the pCT to form the ApCT. Dose distributions and dose‐volume histograms were re‐calculated based on ApCT. Depending on the results, a decision could be made whether re‐optimization was necessary — if needed it was performed using the ApCT. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> It was found that the localized rigid image registration was satisfactory since most structures in head and neck patients were quite rigid. The doses to the respective PTVs and critical structures were compared between the initial treatment plan and the adaptive plans based on ApCT images. For those that failed to meet clinical criteria, the IMRT beams were re‐optimized using the ApCT images. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Re‐planning with ApCT images was accurate, time efficient, and cost effective. The actual dose delivered could be accurately assessed based on the ApCT, which eliminates the potential dosimetric errors resulting from the uncertainty in inhomogeneity correction in CBCT‐based planning.</jats:p>",

In preparation, the National Marrow Donor Program and American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation have established the Radiation Injury Treatment Network (RITN), a voluntary consortium of transplant centers, donor centers, and umbilical cord blood banks. RITN is partnered with the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response in the United States Department of Health and Human Services to develop treatment guidelines, educate healthcare professionals, coordinate situation response, and provide comprehensive evaluation and care for radiation injury victims. We outline the current plans for event response and describe scenarios, including catastrophic events that would require extensive support from hematologists/oncologists across the country. In addition, we highlight important reference resources and discuss current efforts to develop medical countermeasures against radiation toxicity.

The Matlab‐based software allows for user‐interactive graphical positioning of the headframe or manual entry of headframe position relative to the clinical image coordinate system. Six degrees of freedom (translations and rotations) are enabled. The process was tested by matching the graphically added (virtual) fiducial markers to the true fiducial markers obtained from headframe image sets having known translations and rotations. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> GK‐SRS fiducials can be virtually positioned either graphically or manually and then written to a new combined set of DICOM images for export to the GK‐SRS planning system. Frame placement accuracy is estimated at 1mm (∼ 1 voxel), dependent on the base image pixel resolution. GK‐SRS treatment plans can be developed prior to the treatment day to optimize both frame placement (e.g. ideal location) and treatment (e.g. dose location). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Adding GK‐SRS fiducials to a DICOM image set allows possible headframe positions to be evaluated and enables transfer of the modified image set to the GK‐SRS planning system for definition of potential stereotactic coordinate systems. Viability of GK‐SRS can then be assessed with an initial treatment plan, without the patient present, to demonstrate treatment feasibility and increase efficiency on the treatment day.

An issue relevant to this goal is the quality of the experience perceived by users of marine protected areas. Understanding relationships between stakeholder\n values at different sites and their perceptions of crowding and other impacts is, therefore, important information for managers. As a consequence, the study reported here compares the perceptions of individuals involved in tourism, commercial and recreational fishing, scientific research,\n boating, yachting, and other activities with values derived from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park management and scientific databases. Surveys of regular reef users indicated that different activities were targeted at specific areas according to a combination of values that could be statistically\n analyzed and mapped across the region. Respondents considered that current levels of use were too high for many locations in the Cairns Sector. They preferred to see fewer people and vessels, but were more concerned by the number of vessels than the number of people. Acceptable levels of use\n varied widely depending on the location. At established tourism destinations and major recreational fishing sites, responses indicated that a large number of vessels (20–100) and people (100–1,000) could be tolerated. At areas visited only rarely, only low levels of use were acceptable.\n This suggests that there may be shifts in perceptions at sites that become used more frequently. The results have implications for management as reef use continues to increase and extend to other locations. Results from the survey were used to assess management settings to limit the level\n and type of activity in different areas. The techniques used have since been valuable in helping to plan for sustainable marine use in other regions in Australia and might be usefully employed elsewhere.</jats:p>",

In order to calibrate the system with regard to hounsfield units (HU) a special phantom has been designed to include the whole imager area. Removable inserts allow flexible positioning of the probes (in the center/middle/border of the FOV) and the measurement of central axis doses. A planning study was carried out to determine the usability of CBCT data and compare these with diagnostic CT data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Comparisons of data between a diagnostic CT scanner and the 3D‐calibrated CBCT with regard to image quality and HU representation for an humanoid phantom (RSD Alderson) indicate good accordance. Within the field of view the HU variation is up to 5%. Towards the imager edges hounsfield units show small deviations relative to the imager center (max. 8%). Relative dose distributions in CBCT‐based plans show minor differences to plans calculated using a diagnostic CT image dataset (p=0.002) and absolute dosage deviations are within 1% (p=0.001). Central axis doses applied during the acquisition of one volumetric data set are between 0.8 and 1.8cGy depending on the geometry. Results with real patient data show excellent image quality. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A properly calibrated CBCT option allows off‐line treatment planning based on CBCT data. Dose distributions and absolute MU's are equivalent to dosimetric calculations based on diagnostic CT data. The image quality is sufficient for contouring of target outlines.</jats:p>",

Other quantities such as D<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> (the minimum dose received by 99% of CTV/PTV), D<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> (the maximum dose received by 1% of CTV/PTV), the volume of CTV/PTV receiving 110%, 105% and 95% of D<jats:sub>p</jats:sub> (V<jats:sub>110%</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>105%</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>95%</jats:sub>), the volume of rectum and bladder receiving 65 and 40Gy (V<jats:sub>65</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>40</jats:sub>), and the volume of femur receiving 50Gy (V<jats:sub>50</jats:sub>) were evaluated. Total segments and MUs were also compared. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> While all plans meet target dose specifications and normal tissue constraints both XiO and Eclipse plans show less target dose heterogeneity (smaller D<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>110%</jats:sub>) and lower V<jats:sub>65</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>40</jats:sub> for the rectum and bladder compared to the Corvus plans. The PTV D<jats:sub>min</jats:sub> is about 2Gy lower for XiO plans than Corvus and Eclipse plans while the XiO and Eclipse plans have slightly higher V<jats:sub>50</jats:sub> than the Corvus plans. The Eclipse and XiO plans require significantly less MUs to deliver than the Corvus plans. <jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold> To deliver on a Varian Trilogy accelerator, the Eclipse and XiO plans have better target dose uniformity, slightly less rectal and bladder doses and faster beam delivery. The Corvus plans have less rectal volumes receiving low doses (5–20Gy) while the XiO plans have slightly lower target doses. Overall, the Eclipse TPS is favored for our prostate IMRT planning.</jats:p>",

The design is an application of a sound process evaluation planning framework that integrates the components of context, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity, implementation, recruitment, barriers, and maintenance. The planning framework also provides guidance regarding the steps of designing and implementing the process evaluation. This planning process was conducted by utilizing a participatory research approach. At the end of the planning phase, the evaluation team accomplished the following: (a) development of an evaluation plan, (b) development of evaluation instruments (i.e., surveys, interview guides, observation forms), and (c) development of evaluation questions and process objectives. The information derived from this study can be valuable to practitioners and researchers involved in the planning of community partnerships or coalitions and interested in process evaluation that takes place in community settings. </jats:p>",

In practice, it is very difficult to establish impact effects because it is hard to establish the counterfactual. This difficulty arises as a consequence of different theoretical predictions as to what would happen in the absence of intervention, overlapping funding streams, and the regional impact of other policies such as European integration. There are also evaluation problems caused by data inadequacies and noise. Even so, the balance of evidence suggests that Objective 1 funding has had remarkably little demonstrable impact and there is, therefore, a strong case for reform. </jats:p>",

We modeled the range modulator, second scatterer, range shifter, applicator, aperture and other components in detail. A Monte Carlo code (MCNPX, Los Alamos National Laboratory) was used to simulate the beam profiles.

The dose profiles and machine‐specific parameters were then entered into the treatment planning system for configuration. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A complete set of configuration parameters and beam profiles will be generated.

Validation of the Monte Carlo modeling will commence. Using a validated MC model to (partially or fully) commission the treatment plan and proton therapy machine is under investigation, which could significantly reduce the overall time and cost to model and commission proton beams for clinic use.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1990s the largest transnational temporary staffing agencies have progressively expanded the geographical extent of their operations. Moving beyond the established Dutch, French, UK, and US markets in which the majority are headquartered, and encouraged by supportive supranational and national reregulation, they have entered a number of countries in Southeast Asia, Southern Europe, and Latin America. Moreover, in the run-up to, and since, the accession often new member states to the EU on 1 May 2004, the leading transnational agencies have turned their attentions to establishing and expanding operations in Central and Eastern Europe. This paper offers an initial assessment of the state of temporary staffing and its regulation in two leading markets in the region, the Czech Republic and Poland. It explores how temporary staffing markets are being forged through the interactions between regulators, transnational agencies, local agencies, trade bodies, and inward investors. Both countries legalized temporary staffing in 2004, having begun the legalization process prior to accession. Rather than these developments heralding the start of a period of sustained growth, however, our research suggests that there are still significant constraints on expansion in markets where the pressure to neoliberalize labour markets intersects with postsocialist expectations, norms, and economic structures. </jats:p>",

In response to changing political and economic realities during the 1980s, though, much of the Services' own performance of many technical acquisition tasks devolved to management of contractor efforts. After a number of aircraft accidents in the mid‐ to late 1990s were traced to breakdowns in these processes, the Air Force issued new policy stressing the need to apply Systems Engineering (SE) discipline during later life cycle phases. Significant cost and schedule overruns on major programs, and resultant intense Congressional scrutiny, engendered several initiatives to restore technical and programmatic credibility throughout the entire Department of Defense (DoD) acquisition enterprise. This paper recounts the Air Force's approach to modernizing engineering and technical management policy and practices over the 2000–2006 timeframe, and provides a glimpse of key highlights of their roadmap for the next several years.</jats:p>",

The technique demonstrates improved sensitivity and specificity compared to standard MR image sequences, but feature extraction from standard DT‐MRI displays is a laborious process. We present a novel algorithm based on tensor decomposition techniques to facilitate the rapid identification of white matter tract infiltration. Our aim was to produce a real‐time interactive version of this tool for use at the time of radiotherapy treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Post operative DT‐MRI was performed in six patients with Glioblastoma prior to radiotherapy treatment planning. A graphical user interface was written in Object Pascal which enabled the user to navigate through the DT‐MRI data set in 3D. For each voxel in the data set, the diffusion tensor is characterised by plotting the magnitude of the isotopic (p) and anisotropic (q) components of water diffusion on orthogonal axes. Using these plots of p‐q space it is possible to produce a tissue signature for each voxel which allows the user to rapidly distinguish between normal and potentially infiltrated white matter. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> When compared to standard fractional anisotropy displays, the p‐q space navigation tool provides a rapid visual assessment of white matter integrity. The tool can be run alongside the planning workstation at the time of contouring. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The p‐q space navigation tool provides a feasible technique for the assessment of white matter infiltration at the time of radiotherapy treatment planning. Further development of the tool to include co‐registration with the planning CT data and export of region of interest data is under way. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research sponsored by Siemens Oncology Care Systems USA.</jats:p>",

Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) could improve lumpectomy delineation. We investigated treatment plans for CyberKnife and conventional C‐arm LINAC delivery of MRI‐guided APBI in prone position. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We acquired a CT scan of a patient positioned on a mechanical assembly with the same geometry as the dedicated MR coil to simulate the position during breast MRI acquisition. Ellipsoidal virtual PTV's of 4 cm were defined in the anterior part and in the lower outer quadrant of the right breast. Treatment plans were generated by inverse planning techniques for each system. For CyberKnife, we minimized beam directions from posterior to anterior to protect critical normal tissues (heart, lung and contralateral breast) and normalized the maximum dose to 120% of the prescription dose (38.5 Gy). For the conventional LINAC, we excluded any beams directed towards the critical normal tissues and normalized the plan to achieve 99% of the prescription coverage for 99% of PTV. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> LINAC‐based plans resulted in maximum doses of 41.6 Gy in PTV and ⩽ 0.5 Gy in the critical normal structures. CyberKnife‐based plans led to 90% of the prescription dose coverage for 95% of PTV. Maximum doses were ⩽ 0.5 Gy in contralateral breast, ⩽ 1.9 Gy in heart, and ⩽ 4.2 Gy in both lungs. The fraction of normal ipsilateral breast tissue receiving ⩾ 37 Gy was 1% and 5% for CyberKnife and LINAC plans respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> CyberKnife and LINAC generate treatment plans for MRI‐guided prone position APBI with acceptable dose distributions. The standard LINAC requires careful beam configuration to secure clearances between equipments. CyberKnife results in better conformity and slightly higher doses in the critical normal tissues.</jats:p>",

We have commissioned a new exclusive physics machine for pseudo electron arc planning and checked the validity with phantom measurements. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> With an electron arc aperture tray under Varian 21‐EX, minimum beam data including depth doses, lateral profiles and output factors were measured and transferred into a Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> for commissioning. An acrylic cylindrical phantom wrapped with 1 cm‐thick bolus was used for planning and measurement. Multiple static beams with 5 degrees interval were adopted for the pseudo arc planning and delivered via dynamic electron arc mode of the Varian linac. For the evaluation of the pseudo arc planning, measurements were made with MOSFET detectors placed at five different points beneath the bolus and on the surface. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> was commissioned successfully for the electron arc treatments with a fixed field of 6×25 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> on the Varian 21‐EX. The extended distance from the beam‐shaping‐edge of the electron arc aperture to the surface makes the beam characteristics totally different from those for the usual electron beams. The MOSFET measurements agreed with the calculation to within 5% except the ends of the arc where 16.5% of discrepancy was obtained. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Without the electron arc planning function, multiple static beams can be exploited successfully for the electron arc treatment on the commercial planning system. However, a new physics machine for the exclusive electron arc therapy should be commissioned because of the totally different characteristics of the electron beam for arc therapy. In‐vivo dosimetry is a necessity for the plan evaluation.</jats:p>",

Bivariate and logistic regression results indicate that CCP-committed localities are quantitatively different to noncommitted localities on both climate-change risk and socioeconomic-capacity dimensions. On vulnerability measures, the odds of CCP-campaign participation increase significantly with the number of people killed and injured by extreme weather events, projected temperature change, and coastal proximity. On socioeconomic-capacity measures, the odds of CCP-campaign involvement increase with the percentage of citizens that vote Democrat and recycle, as well as the number of nonprofit organizations with an environment focus. The odds decrease in a county area as the percentage of the labor force employed in carbon-intensive industries increases. </jats:p>",

Since the events of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina during the summer of 2005, the words crisis and disaster evoke images of families stranded on causeways turned islands, surrounded by what little property they could carry; houses smashed by killing winds; and skyscrapers crumbling out of the sky. Disastrous events, such as fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist incidents, and chemical spills, cause the loss of resources, destruction of property, financial hardship, and death. During these events, local, state, and federal governments commit large numbers of resources, time, and money to mitigate the consequences of the disaster.To manage the response to these events, leaders of public safety organizations and agencies such as fire and police departments, emergency medical services, and health-care organizations, public works departments, private industry, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) descend on the disaster site.These leaders are required to make high consequence decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information, ill-defined goals, and the pressures of time and a constantly changing situation by drawing on their training and experience. This article positions scenario planning and scenario-based training as two cutting-edge methods for organizational leaders to understand better their environments so as to avoid disastrous events and to put in place efficient and effective plans for coping if disaster should strike. </jats:p>",

For each site, we generated IMAT plans for delivery with variable dose rate single arc and with constant dose rate multiple arcs. Treatment delivery times were modeled mathematically. A maximum leaf motion per unit gantry angle metric is used here to measure the complexity of leaf motions in treatment deliveries, and we proposed to use this metric to assess IMAT plan adaptability. IMAT plans were compared based on dosimetric qualities (target conformality and uniformity indices, dose‐volume indices of critical organs), delivery times, and plan adaptabilities. All IMAT plans were generated on Pinnacle 8.1v (Philips Medical Systems) for Varian linacs. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Overall, both IMAT approaches have comparable dosimetric plan qualities, although generating variable dose rate single arc IMAT plans required increased angular sampling to accommodate larger leaf motions, especially when there are two or more target volumes. The delivery time for the single arc is limited by both the gantry rotational speed and the maximum leaf motion between field segments, whereas, the multiple arc approach is generally limited by the gantry rotational speed alone. For the prostate plan, the delivery times are 1.2 minutes and 2 minutes respectively. In the oropharynx case, the single arc and the multiple arc deliveries were similar at approximately 2 minutes. The adaptability indices reflected the complexity of leaf motion in the single arc compared to the multiple arc approach. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> IMAT plans with variable and constant dose rate deliveries were evaluated under multiple considerations for potential clinical utilizations.</jats:p>",

The TPI-ASA measures nine dimensions relevant to the evaluation and treatment of adolescents with sexual behavior problems (inappropriate sexual behavior, healthy sexuality, social competency, cognitions supportive of sexual abuse, attitudes supportive of sexual abuse, victim awareness, affective/behavioral regulation, risk prevention awareness, and positive family caregiver dynamics). Members of the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers completed the TPI-ASA with 90 male adolescents with sexual behavior problems as part of a psychosexual evaluation. The preliminary findings provided support for the internal consistency and convergent and discriminant validity of the dimensions.

Often, however, such an effort has been oriented to generate a large volume of data, focused only on financial indicators and on a static view of the relevant system.

The field of NIE studies the effect of institutions on the decisions of economic actors. Policy is intended to shape institutions and thus influence behavior. NIE is therefore particularly suitable for the analysis of policy programs such as AES. Their aim is to explain some of the management problems that have arisen in AES and to contribute to finding solutions by using insights from NIE. To this end a specific Dutch AES is used as a case study, in which a number of administrative problems are analyzed. These problems prove to be similar to those that have been identified in other European AES, and are related to the ecological efficacy of this particular type of policy program, its economic efficiency, its administrative sustainability, and the level of sociopolitical support it enjoys. The explanation for the problems identified is based on NIE; this approach is also used to identify solutions. The solutions derived from this theory are then compared with the solutions that have been applied in reality. The authors conclude with a discussion of what these lessons imply for AES in general.</jats:p>",

After exporting the treatment fields to the R&amp;V system, the fields were delivered in the QA mode with the ASi imager deployed. The resulting dosimetric images are automatically stored in a DicomRT format in the treatment console PC. The grey scale images are subsequently pushed to the R&amp;V system. The measured images are then transferred electronically to the planning system and imported into the QA plan in the dosimetry work space for further analysis. The screen shots of the gamma evaluation and isodose comparison are imported into the R&amp;V system as a word document to be reviewed prior to initiation of patient treatment. The calculated images can also be sent as a grey scale image to the R&amp;V system to be compared with the measured dose represented as a gray scale image. <jats:bold>Results/Discussion:</jats:bold> Our department does not have an integrated planning, R&amp;V, and delivery system. In spite of this, we are able to fully integrate a paperless and filmless IMRT QA mechanism. This process enables the QA process to be more efficient and the QA document can be directly attached electronically to its specific patient chart in the R&amp;V system. The calculated and the measured grey scale images can be viewed electronically side by side to analyze the density differences and ensure proper dose delivery to patients. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> In the absence of an integrated planning, verifying, and delivery system, we have shown that it is nonetheless possible to develop a completely electronic IMRT QA process.</jats:p>",

The 3D MRSI data were acquired on a Siemens 3T TRIO TIM scanner using PRESS (point resolved spectroscopy) sequence with TE/TR: 135/1510 ms, 16×16×8 matrix, FOV: 16×16×8 resulting in MRSI voxel size of 10×10×10 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Registration of MRSI (gray scale DICOM) data with planning CT and creation of metabolite‐derived target contours were performed on Pinnacle treatment planning system. Target contours created using MRSI‐derived tumor metabolic abnormalities were compared with those created based on morphological (T2 and T1 contrast weighted) MRI scans. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The CT‐MR (T1) registration accuracy was found to be within 1 mm, with no spatial distortion during MRSI. Registration errors were found in the TPS due to field‐of‐view size and origin difference between studies. These were corrected using a simple algorithm to determine the translation. Re‐scaled MRSI pixel values allowed automated segmentation of metabolic ratios and were consistent with those identified on the control console of the MRI scanner. When applied to a clinical case, a 42 cc (or 58%) reduction in the treated volume of the PTV was possible, assuming the CNI ratio of 2.5 included all microscopic extension of disease requiring the boost dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> MRSI derived functional information can be incorporated into RT planning for brain tumors well within the registration tolerance limits of current planning process.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the present work is to determine the extent of dosimetric differences between conventional three‐dimensional (3D) dose calculations and 4D dose calculations based on deformation of organ models. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> 4D dose calculations were performed on a set of 15 patients with Stage III non‐small‐cell lung cancer using a model‐based deformable registration algorithm on a research version of a commercial radiation treatment planning system. Patients were planned using internal target volumes based on explicit motion of the clinical target volume in the 4D data set and setup margins based on clinical practice. Target volume coverage as well as doses to critical structures calculated using the 4D methodology were compared to those calculated using conventional 3D methodology. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For 11 of 15 patients, CTV coverage was comparable in the 3D and 4D calculations, whereas for 7 of 15 patients, PTV coverage was comparable. For the other patients, the 4D calculation indicated a sufficient difference in target volume coverage so that replanning should have been done. No correlations could be established between 3D and 4D differences and GTV size or extent of GTV motion. Negligible differences were observed between 3D and 4D dose‐volume relationships for normal anatomic structures. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> To ensure that target volumes are not underirradiated when respiratory motion may affect the dose distribution, 4D dose calculations should be performed.</jats:p><jats:p>This work has been supported in part by a Sponsored Research Agreement with Philips Healthcare.</jats:p>",

Seven patients (IMRT and 3D‐conformal stereotactic) were included. GTVs and their respiratory motion envelopes were contoured from 4DCT images. All patients were aligned with daily projection imaging (IMRT) or CT (SBRT); perfect bony anatomy alignment was assumed. Average residual uncertainties (tumor versus bone) were previously determined from analysis of CBCT images. A 3D displacement probability map was calculated (0.0+/−3.4mmAP, 0.8+/−3.4mmSI, and 0.5+/−2.7mmRL), assuming setup errors were normally distributed. To determine the worst‐case dose‐coverage, pGTVs were created by expanding the GTV by 6mm (95.5% probability). Cumulative dose distributions were calculated based on the 3D displacement probability map. The assumption of normally distributed displacements was not appropriate for hypo‐fractionated patients; therefore a worst‐case systematic displacement scenario was evaluated for one patient. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The 4mm pGTV demonstrated good dose coverage (&gt; 90%). With the current planning techniques, the worst‐case analysis of GTV coverage showed that usually &lt;=5% GTV would receive &lt;95% Rx dose. Differences between the planned and cumulative dose distributions were minimal. For the hypofractionated Patient, the probabilities that the GTV will receive at least 98%, 96%, 94%, and 92% of the prescribed dose are 42%, 78%, 93%, and 95% respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Prescribing 90%–100% of the prescription dose to the GTV + 4mm planning margin should result in sufficient dosimetric coverage of the GTV for both IMRT and hypo‐fractionated stereotactic patients. When prescribing concomitant boosts a pGTV margin is required, but this need not be as great as the PTV margin around the CTV.</jats:p>",

However, when significant anatomical changes occur, a simple isocenter shift may not be adequate. In this study, we propose an online IMRT replanning strategy for prostate cancer which uses the deformed dose distributions from the original treatment plan as its objective. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The replanning procedure used was as follows: (1) the dose distribution on the planning CT was deformed to the daily CT and used as the reference objective dose distribution for IMRT replanning; (2) the prescription isodose line on the reference dose distribution was auto‐segmented and used as the fictitious “target volume” to set the initial MLC leaf positions; (3) we developed and implemented a voxel‐by‐voxel dose‐based cost function. The IMRT treatment plan was optimized using the direct machine parameter optimization algorithm to achieve the following goals: (a) inside the region enclosed by the original prescription dose line, the replanned dose distribution was optimized to match with the reference objective; (b) outside this region, the objective function was chosen to lower the dose value and to penalize the dose value exceeding the reference dose for each voxel. The replanning process does not need re‐auto‐segmentation of patient's anatomy, although re‐segmented anatomic contours were used to evaluate the effectiveness of this approach. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We compared the dose distributions and the DVHs of the original plan and the daily plans using (1) image‐guided setup based on prostate alignment, (2) deformed dose distribution from the original plan, and (3) our re‐planning method. We found that our re‐planning strategy matched well with the original plan. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The replanning strategy using the original dose distribution as the goal for optimization produces dose distributions similar to the original approved plan and is an effective approach for on‐line CT‐guided adaptive radiotherapy.</jats:p>",

Three patients had passing DQA plans and three had DQA plans with ion‐chamber measurements that deviated from the expected dose by more than 3%. All patients were planned using similar parameters, including a 2.5 cm field width and pitch values ranging from 0.143–0.215. Machine output was determined not to be the problem so normalized leaf timing sinograms were analyzed to determine the mean leaf open time (LOT) for each plan. This analysis suggests the observed discrepancies are associated with plans having predominantly low LOTs. To test this, patients with failing DQA measurements were replanned using an increased pitch of 0.287. After replanning, new DQA plans were generated and ion‐chamber measurements performed. Exit fluence data was also collected during the DQA delivery using the onboard MVCT detectors for dose reconstruction purposes. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Sinogram analysis showed increases in mean LOTs of 30–85% for the higher pitch plans. In addition, ion‐chamber measurements showed a reduction in point dose errors of 1.9–4.4%, bringing all patient plans within the ±3% acceptance criteria. Dose reconstruction results were in excellent agreement with ion‐chamber measurements and clearly illustrate the impact of leaf timing errors on plans having predominantly small LOTs. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The impact of leaf timing errors on plans with low mean LOTs can be significant. This becomes important for plans using low pitches, or potentially for hyper‐fractionated treatment schedules. The ability to reduce the impact of these errors by increasing the plan pitch is demonstrated. In addition, the efficacy of dose reconstruction in diagnosing delivery errors is established. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Some authors have a financial interest in TomoTherapy, Inc.</jats:p>",

We use the same constraints for 3D‐CRT and IMRT. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For upper abdominal sites, we use the following dose‐volume histogram (DVH) constraints: esophagus (V50Gy &lt; 50%, maximum dose &lt; 70Gy), stomach (maximum 54Gy), heart (V40Gy &lt; 40%, V60Gy &lt; 25–30%), lungs (V20Gy &lt; 35%), kidneys (V20Gy &lt; 33% each), and spinal cord (maximum 45Gy). For the whole normal‐functioning liver, we limit V20Gy &lt; 66%, V30Gy &lt; 50% and NTCP &lt; 10%. For lower abdomen sites, we keep the DVH of the small bowel limited to V20Gy &lt; 50%, V45Gy &lt; 10% and maximum 50Gy; bladder, V45Gy &lt; 20%; genitalia, V20Gy &lt; 67% and V30Gy &lt; 20%. A predetermined Internal Target Volume (ITV) margin of 1cm radially and 2cm superior‐inferiorly is added for neoadjuvant gastric radiation treatment. The ITVs for the esophagus and liver are determined using 4D‐CT. A 10‐mm planning target volume margin is used when imaging is performed weekly, and 5 mm when imaging daily. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Guidelines on constraints and margins for 3D‐CRT planning provide practical tools to the planner.

AAA was implemented at Stanford Cancer Center in 2007 by modeling the intensity profile, extra‐focal photons and electron contamination using diagonal profiles of a 15×15 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and an extrapolated 40×40 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> field. 8 IMRT treatment plans and 9 dynamic conformal arc patient plans were delivered to a homogeneous solid water phantom. Verification measurements were made using ionization chamber and film. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Percent depth doses calculated using AAA of open fields defined by collimators, agreed with measurement to within 2%. However larger discrepancies, 2.6%, were observed in small fields defined by MLC at depths larger than 20 cm. Of the 8 IMRT patient plans, measurements showed differences from 0.25% to 3.7%. The 9 dynamic conformal arc plans had a consistently higher discrepancy with AAA calculations, 0.78% to 6.5%. It was found that for smaller target volumes for both IMRT and conformal arc plans, differences between AAA and measurements are greater. It was also noted that for the dynamic conformal arc plans, the discrepancy with measurement is related to treatment volume size with larger variations for smaller target volumes. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Due to the limited maximum field size and small field sizes used in SRS, implementation of AAA proved to be a challenge. It is shown that acceptable results, (average ∼2%) though not perfect, could be achieved. AAA is still the preferred calculation algorithm for clinical use as the majority of our SRS cases are targeting the thoracic region.</jats:p>",

Three jaw widths (5, 2.5 and 1 cm) and six pitches (0.86, 0.7, 0.43, 0.34, 0.287 and 0.215) were used with a (maximum) modulation factor setting of 4. The 18 plans per patient were generated using an identical optimization procedure (e.g., number of iterations, objective weights and penalties, etc.), based on recommendations from TomoTherapy. The plans were compared using isodose plots, dose volume histograms, dose homogeneity indices, conformity indices, radiobiological models, and treatment times. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Smaller pitches and jaw widths showed better target dose homogeneity and sparing of normal tissue, as expected. The conformity index had a maximum for pitches between 0.287 and 0.43. The tumor control probabilities were greater than 99% for the 2.5‐ and 1‐cm jaw widths for all pitches except 0.86. The treatment time increased inversely proportional to the jaw width. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our study indicates that the smaller jaw widths (2.5 and 1 cm) and pitches near the range of 0.3–0.4 produce better plans for helical tomotherapy head and neck treatment. However, because of the large increase in treatment time with only slight improvement in sparing of the critical structures for the 1‐cm jaw width, the 2.5‐cm jaw width, currently used in our clinic, remains our preference.</jats:p><jats:p>Supported in part by a research agreement with TomoTherapy, Inc.</jats:p>",

Teams either did or did not include members with expert-level task-relevant cognitive abilities, and either did or did not receive an intervention that fostered collaborative planning. Results support the authors' hypothesis that analytic performance requires both task-appropriate expertise and collaborative planning to identify strategies for optimally using that expertise. Indeed, high expertise in the absence of collaborative planning actually decreased team performance. Teams engaging in collaborative planning were more likely to effectively integrate their information on key aspects of the analytic problem, which significantly enhanced their analytic performance. Furthermore, information integration mediated the effects of the interaction of expertise and collaboration on performance. The implications of the findings for the optimal use of team member skills and the development of team performance strategies are discussed. </jats:p>",

Development on the rural-urban fringe is ongoing in metropolitan areas around the United States. In this article, we evaluate the product of the concept-planning process from the standpoint of the extent to which environmental elements conducive to active living were included. We also analyze four issues in which challenges to the incorporation of active-living features surfaced: choices related to transportation facilities, the design and location of retail stores, the location of schools and parks, and the location of a new town center. Overall, the Damascus/Boring Concept Plan positions the area well to promote active living. Analyses of the challenges that emerged yielded lessons for advocates regarding ways to deal with conflicts between facilitating active living and local economic development and related tax-base concerns and between active-living elements and school-district planning autonomy as well as the need for advocates to have the capacity to present alternatives to the usual financial and design approaches taken by private- and public-sector investors.</jats:p>",

The MC code DPM was employed to calculate dose distributions in the phantom with different CT resolutions. The three‐field conformal setup used a 6MV photon beam. Both qualitative and quantitative dose evaluation metrics were applied. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A reference CT resolution of 1×1 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> was established by comparing the CAX depth doses between a detailed lung model and its voxelized version. The fine details revealed in high resolution can be smoothed, especially when the geometrical voxels cross the heterogeneities, hence introducing a potential systematic error. Visible difference, up to 1%, can be seen in the DVHs of the cases with a small tumor. The insensitive relative absolute differential dose shows the DVH's disadvantage of lack of positional information of the dose distribution. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A realistic random lung model was applied to show the effect of the accuracy of the geometrical representation on dose distribution in heterogonous sites, such as the lung. Our results show that a CT resolution up to 2×2 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> may be sufficient while a 4×4 mm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> could lead to significant perturbations.

Using planning CT instead of a RDTS for registration might decrease the uncertainty of the registration resulting from the added edge blurring of DTS and simplify the setup verification process. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A solid water breast phantom containing four surgical clips was imaged with CT and OB‐DTS modalities. The OB‐DTS was acquired for a 40° lateral angle (kV source: 250°–290°). An open‐source GPU based FDK filtered backprojection algorithm was used for reconstruction of DTS image sets. The centroids of all the clips were localized in the DTS image sets and locations were compared with the clip locations in CT image sets. Using a filtered cross‐correlation algorithm, the OB‐DTS was registered with the CT and RDTS image sets and the registration accuracy of OB‐DTS was calculated. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Clip centroids were found to be within 1 mm in DTS and CT image sets. The OB‐DTS was registered with the CT within 1 mm ± 2 mm along the x‐axis (direction of projection) and less than 1 mm ± 1 mm along the two orthogonal (y and z) axes with a maximum translation of ±1.4 cm in the orthogonal axes and ±4.7 cm along the x‐axis. The OB‐DTS was registered with the RDTS within 4 mm ± 11.5 mm along the x‐axis, 1.4 mm ± 2.8 mm along the y‐axis and 0.5 mm ± 0.7 mm along the z‐axis, with a maximum translation of ±1.4 cm in the orthogonal axes and ±2.8 cm along the axis of propagation. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> OB‐DTS can be registered to CT with equal or better accuracy than when registered with RDTS and with greater translations along the propagation axis.</jats:p>",

Results showed major differences (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) in high and low density regions as bones and lungs. Dose overestimation of 5% was observed in bone regions and dose underestimation of 5% to 10% was observed in lung regions. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Those results are of major interest since, depending on the treatment planning system and its beam commissioning, it could lead to significant dose misevaluation.

We report our comparisons with prostate and head and neck IMRT Pinnacle treatment plans. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Our source model components include: a primary photon point source, an extended extra‐focal source, and contamination electrons. One unique feature of the system is that it is fluence‐based, not a segment based calculation. A modified composite fluence map for each beam is built by summing the MLC segments and modifying for the effects of leakage, and rounded leaf edges. Model parameters are automatically determined by fitting to measurements. We re‐computed two 6 MV head &amp; neck, and three 18 MV prostate, IMRT plans created by Pinnacle. For head &amp; neck plans, we compared the DVHs of PTV, brainstem and parotid glands, as well as the mean dose to parotid glands. For the prostate plans, the DVHs for PTV, rectum, and bladder, as well as the D50, D98, and minimum doses for PTV are compared. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We found that our dose calculation system is comparable with Pinnacle for prostate IMRT plans, with small differences. For the prostate tests, the D50 for the PTV agrees within 0.7% with Pinnacle. DVHs for rectum and bladder all agree closely. The model predicts more pronounced dose inhomogeneity inside PTV in head and neck cases: the average reduction in the D98 value for the primary PTV was 5.5%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> As expected, prostate IMRT recalculations agree well with the Pinnacle results. However, differences in head and neck results may be due to improved physics in the Monte Carlo system. The results support the use of the Monte Carlo tool as a treatment planning QA tool. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Work partially supported by grant PHS CA010953.</jats:p>",

Fixture survival rate was 89% (92% maxilla, 83% mandible). Implant‐supported suprastructures remained stable during the follow‐up period in 26 out of 31 jaws (90% maxilla, 70% mandible). Surgical or technical complications occurred in 42% of treated cases. Misfit of abutment‐bridge appeared in five cases, resulting in disconnection of the bridge in two patients where fixtures were left for unloaded healing. Fixture losses resulted in the removal of the suprastructure in three patients, who returned to removable dentures. Extensive adjustments of occlusion were made in 10% of the immediately connected bridges. Radiographic bone defects developed in three patients after drilling, which appeared in two cases after anchor‐pin drilling in the maxilla and another in a severely resorbed mandible.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold> The patient's post‐operative discomfort such as swelling and pain was almost negligible. However, compared to conventional protocols, the occurrences of surgical and technical complications were higher, and thus this method must still be regarded to be in an exploratory phase.</jats:p>",

Standard loading patterns were manually optimized to reach an optimal coverage with 7 Gy per fraction to the High Risk‐CTV and dose constraints for organs at risk. A second plan was retrospectively created with OncentraGYN (v0.9.14, Nucletron). Anatomy based automatic dwell position loading was used to produce loading patterns similar to standard Fletcher loadings, but adapted to the topography of bladder, rectum, and sigmoid. The optimization algorithm included individual dwell time gradient restrictions and modification restriction for the T/R and needle optimization to preserve the spatial high dose and dwell time distribution as accepted for manual plans. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> HIPO could achieve a better target coverage (V100) for all T/R and 7 T/R+N patients. The D2cc per fraction for bladder, rectum and sigmoid was on average lower by 0.2 Gy, 0.4 Gy, 0.2 Gy respectively for T/R patients and 0.6 Gy, 0.3 Gy, 0.3 Gy for T/R+N patients (e.g.: a decrease from 4.5 to 4 Gy per fraction means a total dose reduction of 5 Gy EQD2 for a 4 fraction schedule). In 7/10 cases the dwell time in the additional needles was lower as with manual planning. The optimization procedure including handling, evaluation and calculation time (&lt;3s per run) was lower compared to manual treatment planning. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> HIPO is a feasible and quick method for treatment planning in cervix cancer brachytherapy. Essential is anatomy based loading, anatomy based optimization and a dedicated concept to control spatial dwell time distribution. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research sponsored by Nucletron.</jats:p>",

The planar dose measurements at 5 or 10 cm depth in water were compared with the predictions from both TPS. A 3 % −3mm distance to agreement (DTA) criteria was used to score the percent of passing points (PPP) for each individual field. The samples for both TPS were composed of 75 % of Head and Neck cases, 15% prostates and 10 % other sites. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The distribution of the PPP showed that 83% and 85% of the evaluated beams were above the 95 % PPP for Eclipse and Pinnacle respectively. Between 90 and 95 % the PPP were 15% and 14% and below 90% the PPP were 1.9 % and 1.7 % for Eclipse and Pinnacle respectively. The passing rates for Eclipse‐SW are significantly improved when the first 20 Eclipse‐SW cases (130 beams) are not considered for this comparison. The Eclipse‐SW PPP above 95% increases to 91.1 %. The patterns of failure observed for the two TPS were distinctively different with Pinnacle‐SS exhibiting clusters of hot points (measurements higher than calculations) while Eclipse‐SW showed cold points aligned in the direction of the MLC leaves movement. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results from our patient specific IMRT QA using the Eclipse‐SW delivery system exhibited a better agreement when compared with our previous experience using Pinnacle‐SS.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Held in abeyance by the Cold War and the preeminence of the nation-state over the past fifty years, the legitimacy of the corporation is once again in dispute. New kinds of private agencies and social actors have emerged to raise questions and, in some cases, intervene directly in the governance of major corporations. Often, corporate engagement is out of the public view—being a conversation amongst financial elites about common interests. In other cases, however, shareholder activism is a public affair played out in the full glare of the media at annual general meetings. In this paper social activists' corporate engagement strategies are evaluated utilizing three proprietary databases which enable analysis of the patterns of activists' shareholder resolutions with respect to the financial structure and environmental performance of target corporations. An analytical framework is introduced, referencing two models of the firm, the nature of corporate assets (tangible and intangible), and public expectations of corporate performance. Utilizing Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility data on social activists' shareholder resolutions it is shown that these types of resolutions can be differentiated according to the nature and volume of activists' resolutions and the motive forces driving intervention. It is also shown that, for all the differences between institutional investors and social activists, they may share the same approach to realizing shareholder value depending on the nature of the corporation. </jats:p>",

However, the effects of restoration practices are difficult to measure, and restoration goals often are unclear. Landscape modeling provides a tool for evaluating outcomes of various management scenarios and restoration strategies. In this article, we provide a framework for using landscape models for forest restoration. Specifically, we present a case study using LANDIS, a landscape simulation model of forest disturbance and succession, to explore the effects of restoration strategies for forests damaged by southern pine beetle in the southern Appalachians. Our research suggests that landscape models are valuable tools in the forest restoration decisionmaking process. Future work on landscape models for forest restoration and other related issues is discussed.</jats:p>",

A study of acute‐radiation‐exposure‐ induced pneumonitis in NHPs involves total lung irradiation (TLI) to 12.5 Gy in a single session, where acute radiation exposure may also lead to the lethal hematopoeitic and gastrointestinal subsyndromes. The latter syndromes occur at 7–8 Gy and at 12–14 Gy, respectively, 1 and 2 weeks after irradiation. Hence, high dose conformity is essential to spare bone marrow, cord and bowel. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> An offline DMPO plan is created on a CBCT scan of the NHP several days prior to the TLI session; using seven, 6MV photon beams. TLI targets a PTV from a 1 cm expansion of lung contours, sparing tissues outside the PTV. On the day of the irradiation a new CBCT is acquired, loaded into the planning system, and contours and DMPO dose objectives are propagated from the offline plan. DMPO is executed online using the original off‐line plan as starting points and the resultant on‐line plan is compared to the offline plan, on a Philips Pinnacle 8.1v workstation. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Online‐ and offline‐planned DMPO plans achieve V95 &gt; 95% coverage of the PTV, and excellent bowel sparing. However, offline‐planned DMPO delivers &gt; 7 Gy to more than 50% of the cord volume, while online‐planned DMPO delivers &lt; 6 Gy to more than 50 % of the cord. Online DMPO re‐optimization from scanning to the start of irradiation takes less than 45 minutes. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Online DMPO‐based re‐planning of NHP total lung irradiations is established in support of a study of radiation‐induced pneumonitis in non‐human primates. Online‐planning on NHPs is valuable experience prior to clinical implementation in human patients.</jats:p>",

The phantom set‐up was 4cm solid water then 4cm lung phantom material (Gammex), then either no bolus, 1cm bolus, or 2cm bolus; then 4cm solid water. Point doses were calculated by placing points of interest (POIs) along the beam central axis at various depths. All dose distributions were calculated using the Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>™ adaptive convolve (AC) algorithm, for a 10×10cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> AP beam (6MV and/or 15MV) @ 100 SSD and 200MU prescription. Ion chamber and/or MOSFET measurements were performed between bolus slabs for the bolus containing phantoms and POIs were generated to obtain calculated dose for each dosimeter position. In addition, a MapCheck device was placed under each phantom to measure 2D dose distributions for comparison against the calculated 2D planar dose map. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Agreement between calculated and measured dose using ion chamber was within ±1% for 19/23 measurements with a maximum difference of 3.23%.

The user was then able to conveniently view DRRs at various source angles to choose the angles where the tumor is less obstructed by surrounding structures during the planning phase. The 2D‐3D software, using mutual information, simultaneously aligned DRRs from the end‐expiration planning 4D‐CT with four end‐expiration projection x‐rays (lateral, Anterior‐Posterior (AP), and 2 oblique) on a sub‐image based on the projection of the tumor. For the analysis, the x‐ray projection data was taken from three lung patients in a separate research protocol for 4D cone‐beam CT. The 2D‐3D results were compared with 3D‐3D alignment of the end‐expiration 4D cone‐beam CT with the end‐expiration planning 4D‐CT on a region around the tumor. Respiration phase information was deduced from a commercial external fiducial system (Real‐time Position Management, Varian Medical Systems). The volumes of the three tumors were 14.0 cc, 45.8 cc, and 17.9 cc. The extents of motion in the Superior‐Inferior (SI) direction were 2 mm, 4 mm, and 11 mm. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The mean differences between the 3D‐3D and 2D‐3D registrations were −0.1 mm, 0.1 mm, and 1.6 mm in the lateral, AP, and SI directions respectively. The standard deviations were 2.2 mm, 1.8 mm, and 1.0 mm. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have demonstrated the feasibility of direct lung tumor setup with per‐patient x‐ray source angles. The preferred oblique x‐ray angles were anterior and posterior angles on the same lateral side as the tumor. Future work will investigate the optimal number of x‐rays and the lower limit of the tumor's size.</jats:p>",

Routine development drilling in the Kaphong field of the Pattani basin unexpectedly discovered two production horizons that possessed reservoir characteristics and sufficient oil reserves to make each a viable horizontal-well candidate. At the time, however, only a single drilling slot was available on the platform; thus, dictating that only one wellbore could be drilled to tap both reservoirs. Further complicating the problem was that the drilling rig that discovered the horizons would be moving to a new platform 5 weeks after it was understood by reservoir engineers, geologists, and geophysicists that multiple horizontal-well candidates existed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper chronicles the rapid processes that took place to evaluate, plan, and execute the first multilateral well in the Gulf of Thailand. More importantly, this paper captures the unintended consequences (both good and bad) that came with executing this project so quickly. This includes an analysis of how decision making, project planning, and ultimate execution where affected by the short time window available. From this, we discuss lessons learned that may be universally applicable when rapidly expanding the use of technology in a remote region of the world (regardless of how small that expansion is).</jats:p>",

There may be a mismatch between the provision of LTC beds and clients' needs. To compare the type and annual rate of clients seeking placement to LTC, incident annual cohorts (N = 1,496) in five provincial health regions within Newfoundland and Labrador were compared using objective measures of disability. Client need was assessed using a decision tree and the optimal distribution of LTC beds was determined. </jats:p><jats:p> Within the four island regions, little difference was observed in degree of disability, but Labrador clients differed from the island regions in age, degree and type of disability. A decision tree suggested that optimal placement was 7% to housing, 34% to supervised care, 17% to supervised care for cognitive impairment and 42% to nursing home care. </jats:p><jats:p> In Newfoundland and Labrador, institutional LTC is dependent on nursing homes, whereas the major need is for appropriate supervised care for those with modest disability, with or without cognitive impairment. Different approaches to restructuring of long-term care in each region are necessary because of the differences in rates of presentation for LTC and differences in availability of nursing home and appropriate supervised care beds. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Our goal is to validate treatment planning metrics that are computationally efficient yet have inherent radiobiological meaning, either directly or by correlating highly with more explicitly biological metrics. We show how mean‐tail‐dose and the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) metrics could be used to replace dose‐volume metrics in IMRT treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> gEUD and MOH/MOC<jats:italic>x</jats:italic> (mean of the hottest/coldest <jats:italic>x</jats:italic>% of a structure) are candidates for dose‐volume metric replacements due both to their averaging‐nature (closer to the expected radiobiology), as well as their convexity (and the linearity of MOH/MOC<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>), which allows for optimal solutions and faster optimization. We used datasets from both 3DCRT planning (219 lung/pneumonitis; 263 lung/esophagitis; 491 prostate) and IMRT (40 prostate; 398 head and neck). We calculated the Spearman's rank‐correlation coefficient between typical clinical dose‐volume metrics and these quasi‐radiobiological metrics with a range of values for the variable parameter (<jats:italic>a</jats:italic> for gEUD; <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> for MOH/MOC<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>). We also calculated the sensitivity and specificity values resulting from using the quasi‐radiobiological metrics to ‘predict’ violation of a clinical dose‐volume threshold. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We found high correlations between the proposed quasi‐radiobiological metrics and clinical dose‐volume metrics. Twenty‐seven out of thirty correlations tested had a Spearman correlation coefficient above 0.90 with highly significant p‐values. We also found, for many of the dose‐volume metrics, the associated quasi‐radiobiological metric was an excellent classifier. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> There is evidence from large datasets including both 3DCRT and IMRT patients that the biological metrics of gEUD and MOH/MOC<jats:italic>x</jats:italic> are highly correlated to traditional dose‐volume metrics and are fairly accurate for classifying acceptable from non‐acceptable plans. Many of the gEUD or MOH/MOC<jats:italic>x</jats:italic> metrics could be substituted for traditional dose‐volume constraints with a sensitivity and specificity well above 0.80. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Partially supported by a grant from Tomotherapy, Inc., as well as NIH R01 grant CA85181.</jats:p>",

The patient underwent computerized tomography (CT) scans for inverse planning. These CT images were used to outline the planning target volume (PTV) and several organs at risk (OAR) including bladder, rectum, and femurs for defining dose constraints during the inverse planning process. Using the Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> planning system (V. 8.0d), 5‐ and 7‐field IMRT plans were generated using (a) 6 MV, (b) 10 MV, and (c) 15 MV photons. These six plans were scored using dose‐volume‐histograms (DVH) to infer quality index parameters, namely, dose uniformity and conformity in the PTV, dose to OAR, and integral dose in the irradiated normal tissue. Each IMRT beam of the selected treatment plan was transferred on to a homogeneous flat phantom for planar‐dose calculations at 10‐cm depth. These planar dose distributions were measured using MapCHECK and film dosimetry to superimpose on the planned dose distributions for comparison. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Our planning studies have shown that: (1) 5‐F vs. 7‐F IMRT plans for all beam energies predict less doses to the normal tissue surrounding the prostate target volume below 3500 cGy level, (2) As expected, superior dose distributions are achieved with all IMRT techniques for all photon beam energies in the 6–15 MV range, (3) Dose uniformity compares fairly well between 106.5 and 108.3% for all plans irrespective of photon energy and beam arrangements. Detailed dosimetric differences between plans will be discussed. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have successfully performed an inverse planning study to examine the effect of photon beam energy and the number of these beams on the quality of IMRT plans to treat prostate patients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> For PET/CT the fast CT acquisition time can lead to errors in attenuation correction, particularly at the lung/diaphragm interface. Gated 4D‐PET can reduce motion artifacts, though it is not always attenuation corrected with a similarly acquired 4D‐CT. We performed phantom studies specifically designed to evaluate 4D‐PET images using three different methods for attenuation correction: a single 3D‐CT (3D‐CTAC), an averaged 4D‐CT (CINE‐CTAC), and a fully phase matched 4D‐CT (4D‐CTAC). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A phantom was designed with two density regions corresponding to diaphragm and lung. An 8ml vial loaded with FDG was used to represent a lung tumor and background FDG was also added with an 8:1 ratio. Imaging was performed with a GE Discovery DVCT‐PET/CT scanner. Periodic motion of 2 cm amplitude was used and the image data was reconstructed into 10 phase bins over the motion cycle. Image data was analyzed using a GE image processing workstation and in‐house developed software. Values of activity within the target for each relative phase were corrected for decay and compared to those derived from a 3D PET scan with no motion present (3D‐STATIC). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Activity values derived from 4D‐CTAC corrected PET images are generally closer to 3D‐STATIC images with no motion present. Mean activity over the known target volume over the motion cycle, normalized to the activity for 3D‐STATIC, was 93%, 101% and 98% for 3D‐CTAC, CINE‐CTAC and 4D‐CTAC images respectively with corresponding standard deviations of 6%, 10% and 3%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Compared to other attenuation correction methods, 4D‐CTAC corrected 4D‐PET images correspond more closely on average to similar 3D‐STATIC images. Using CINE‐CTAC for correction resulted in mean activity values slightly closer to 3D‐STATIC, but with much greater variation over the motion cycle. We believe these results have implications for the use of 4D‐PET imaging for radiation therapy target definition.</jats:p>",

To quantify differences between the dose distributions calculated by the proton treatment planning system and the actual dose distribution, because the inaccuracy of calculations may arise due to inhomogeneity by the presence of surface curvature, air cavities, and bony structures in the head‐and‐neck region. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We compared the two planning strategies for head‐and‐neck patients: (i) original CT; and (ii) corrected CT in which the HU values inside air cavity were replaced by −1000 of air HU value. Proton beam plans for original CT images were performed and then verification plans, using the same proton beam settings as those for the uncorrected CT images, were applied to the corrected CT images. In the plan comparison, the range shift of the proton beam and change of dose distribution between original CT and corrected CT images were revealed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In some clinical data, DVH of plan using original CT demonstrated was different from the result using corrected CT. Target coverage is unaffected by whether the CT images are corrected or not, the irradiated volume of normal organs such as brain stem, optic chiasm, optic lens in verification plans with corrected CT is higher than that in plans with uncorrected CT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> In proton radiotherapy, the correct prediction of proton beam range in treatment planning is critical for precise delivery of radiation does to the target. It could be important for purpose of range calculation of proton beams in treatment planning that the HU value of air cavity is replaced by optimal HU value making an allowance for CT artifacts for head‐and‐neck tumors.</jats:p>",

In an Agency whose success depends on acquiring and deploying the latest technologies for collecting and protecting information, a system engineering approach is mandated to successfully transition and manage the complexity of new technologies.</jats:p><jats:p>Using such a systems approach, this paper proposes a model and a process for technology transition. The development of the technology transition model is based upon NSA's need to establish a repeatable, reliable and predictable technology transition process at an enterprise level. The model is established using a systems view, is based on the principles of systems life cycle planning, a business case, and critical decision points for any technology transition activity.</jats:p><jats:p>The latter part of the paper demonstrates how the principles of Portfolio Management can be used in conjunction with the technology transition model to enable strategic systems planning, ensure technology readiness, and guarantee a focus on technology relevance and feasibility.</jats:p><jats:p>Effective methods, such as the one proposed in this paper, for the transition and infusion of new technologies into mission will enable NSA to maintain its preeminence in a global environment of rapid technology change.</jats:p>",

Four observers delineated the gross tumour volume (GTV) (prostate and seminal vesicles), bladder and rectum for nine patients. Contouring done by radiologist was considered as gold standard for comparison purposes and for IMRT plan optimisation. Maximum average variations in contoured prostate, bladder and rectum volumes were 3% (SD = 8.4), 2.5% (SD = 4.12) and 13.2% (SD = 6.77), respectively. The average conformity index for standard contouring set (observer A) was 0.85 (SD = 0.028) and statistically significant differences were observed for observers A–B (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.008), A–C (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.006) and A–D (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.011). Average values of normal tissue complication probability for bladder and rectum for observer A were 0.361% (SD = 0.036) and 1.59% (SD = 0.14). Maximum average tumour control probability was 99.94% (SD = 0.035) and statistically significant difference was observed for observers A–B (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.037) and observers A–C (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.01). Inter-observer contouring variations have significant impact on dosimetric and radiobiological outcome in IMRT treatment planning. So accurate contouring of tumour and normal organs is a fundamental prerequisite to make good correlation between calculated and clinical observed results.</jats:p>",

This article presents data from open-ended comments collected during research on the impact of PCP on the life experiences of 65 people with intellectual disabilities living in England. These comments addressed the goals set prior to and during PCP, and the main benefits of PCP for participants. The results suggest that PCP led to increased goal setting in a range of goal categories. This was reflected in the most common main benefit of PCP of `increased activities and opportunities' reported for 57 percent of participants. For 48 percent of participants, a main benefit of PCP was that they felt better in themselves, in terms of happiness or self-esteem. This must surely be the ultimate aim of those seeking to improve the quality of life of people with intellectual disabilities. </jats:p>",

MVCT images were taken using the TomoTherapy Hi‐Art system (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, WI), and the CT numbers were converted to density by calibrating the Hi‐Art system using an electron density phantom. Doses were computed using MVCT images and kVCT images and compared by calculating dose differences in the uniform dose region <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20043-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20043:acm20043-math-0001\" />, excluding buildup region) and calculating distance‐to‐agreement (DTA) in high dose‐gradient regions (penumbra and distal falloff, 90%–10%).

The same phantom was then MVCT scanned nine times with square skin collimators of Cerrobend on its surface ‐ field sizes of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20043-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20043:acm20043-math-0003\" />, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20043-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20043:acm20043-math-0004\" />, and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20043-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20043:acm20043-math-0005\" /> and thicknesses of 6, 8, and 10 mm. Using the Philips Pinnacle<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#c3\"><jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:ext-link> treatment planning system (Philips Medical Systems, N.A., Bothwell, WA), a treatment plan was created for combinations of electron energies of 6, 9, 12, and 16 MeV and each field size. The same treatment plans were calculated using kVCT images of the phantom with regions‐of‐interest (ROI) manually drawn to duplicate the sizes, shapes, and density of the skin collimators. With few exceptions, the maximum dose differences exceeded <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20043-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20043:acm20043-math-0006\" /> and the DTAs exceeded 2 mm. We determined that the dose differences were due to small distortions in the MVCT images created by the high density material and manifested as errors in the phantom CT numbers and in the shape of the skin collimator edges. These results suggest that MVCT images without skin collimation have potential for use in patient electron beam treatment planning. However, the small distortion in images with skin collimation makes them unsuitable for clinical use.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS: 87.53.Tf, 87.59.Fm, 87.53.Fs</jats:p>",
