      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem and the solution. Since the events of September 11, 2001, and Hurricane Katrina during the summer of 2005, the words crisis and disaster evoke images of families stranded on causeways turned islands, surrounded by what little property they could carry; houses smashed by killing winds; and skyscrapers crumbling out of the sky. Disastrous events, such as fires, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist incidents, and chemical spills, cause the loss of resources, destruction of property, financial hardship, and death. During these events, local, state, and federal governments commit large numbers of resources, time, and money to mitigate the consequences of the disaster.To manage the response to these events, leaders of public safety organizations and agencies such as fire and police departments, emergency medical services, and health-care organizations, public works departments, private industry, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) descend on the disaster site.These leaders are required to make high consequence decisions with incomplete or inaccurate information, ill-defined goals, and the pressures of time and a constantly changing situation by drawing on their training and experience. This article positions scenario planning and scenario-based training as two cutting-edge methods for organizational leaders to understand better their environments so as to avoid disastrous events and to put in place efficient and effective plans for coping if disaster should strike. </jats:p>",

Industrialized cities, rural towns, and villages coexist with a variety of health care facilities and an almost complete lack of organized trauma care. There is gross disparity between trauma services available in various parts of the country. Rural India has inefficient services for trauma care, due to the varied topography, financial constraints, and lack of appropriate health infrastructure. There is no national lead agency to coordinate various components of a trauma system. No mechanism for accreditation of trauma centers and professionals exists. Education in trauma life‐support skills has only recently become available. A nationwide survey encompassing various facilities has documented significant deficiencies in current trauma systems. Some initiatives on improving prehospital systems have been seen recently. Although injury is a major public‐health problem, the government, medical fraternity, and the society are yet to recognize it as a significant public health challenge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Indian banking industry is going through turbulent times. With the lowering of entry barriers and blurring of product lines of banks and non-banks since the financial sector reforms, banks are functioning increasingly under competitive pressures. Hence, it is imperative that banks maintain a loyal customer base. In order to achieve this and improve their market and profit positions, many retail banks are directing their strategies towards increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty through improved service quality. Moreover, with the advent of international banking, the trend towards larger bank holding companies, and innovations in the marketplace, customers have greater and greater difficulty in distinguishing and selecting one institution from another. Therefore the current problem for the banking industry in India is to determine the dimensions of customer-perceived service quality. This is because if service quality dimensions can be identified, service managers should be able to improve the delivery of customer perceived quality during the service process and have greater control over the overall outcome. </jats:p><jats:p> The objective of the study was to explore the dimensions of customer perceived service quality in the context of the Indian retail banking industry. A set of service quality parameters, drawn from customers’ perceptions about service quality as well as the bank marketing and service quality literature, were drawn up. These parameters have been used in the context of four of the largest banks in India to identify the underlying dimensions of service quality, using factor analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> The study suggests that customers distinguish four dimensions of service quality in the case of the retail banking industry in India, namely, attitude, competence, tangibles and convenience. Identifying the underlying dimensions of the service quality construct in the Indian retail banking industry is the first step in the definition and hence provision of quality service. This article has drawn upon the findings of the service quality dimensions to contend the initiatives that banks’ managers can take to enhance employees’ skills and attitudes and instill a customer-service culture. </jats:p>",

At high elevations, warming is amplified and future temperature distribution lies outside the range of present‐day distribution. Compared to the Caribbean side, temperature changes are greater at high elevations on the Pacific side. Model results also show significant changes in precipitation amounts and variability and an increase in the altitude of cloud formation on the Pacific side that may have serious implications for mountain ecosystems in and around Costa Rica.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change impact assessment on water resources with downscaled General Circulation Model (GCM) simulation output is characterized by uncertainty due to incomplete knowledge about the underlying geophysical processes of global change (GCM uncertainties) and due to uncertain future scenarios (scenario uncertainties). Disagreement between different GCMs and scenarios in regional climate change impact studies indicates that overreliance on a single GCM with a scenario could lead to inappropriate planning and adaptation responses. This paper focuses on modeling GCM and scenario uncertainty using possibility theory in projecting streamflow of Mahanadi river, at Hirakud, India. A downscaling method based on fuzzy clustering and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is applied to project monsoon streamflow from three GCMs with two green house emission scenarios. Possibilities are assigned to all the GCMs with scenarios based on their performance in modeling the streamflow of the recent past (1991–2005), when there are signals of climate forcing. The possibilities associated with different GCMs and scenarios are used as weights in computing the possibilistic mean of the CDFs projected for three standard time slices 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. The result shows that the value of streamflow at which the CDF reaches 1 reduces with time, which shows the reduction in probability of occurrence of extreme high flow events in future. Historic record of monsoon streamflow of Mahanadi river also shows similar decreasing trend, which may be due to the effect of high surface warming. Reduction in Mahandai streamflow is likely to pose a major challenge for water resources engineers in meeting water demands in future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Heritage is a cultural identity to be refl ected in the purview of individual, unique and multiple layers of pluralism, especially with respect to religion, at least in Oriental cultures that maintained their traditions and continuity together with examples of contestation, destruction and also sometimes harmonious co-existence. In the span of time the layering of various cultures put their marks, which in the sequence of time turn to be the issue of confl icts due to claims and controls by the diff erent groups. As a consequence there resulted issues of representation, belongingness, control and power, dissonance and contestation. Despite all theoretic constructs and human concerns for peace and harmony the issue of dissonance dominates, especially withreference to ethnicities and religion. The religious built environments are the pitiful suff erers in such happenings of turmoil recorded every parts of the world. In South Asia the Muslim invasion in medieval period (15th to 18th centuries) had been the major force and process for destruction and superimposing Islamic structure, like in case of major sacred cities of Hindus in north India. In the areas of old culture one fi nds heritagescapes that are subject to ‘ill construction and jumbled space’ where ‘several sites appear incompatibly’. The confl icts between secularist democracy and democratic religiosity are the common phenomena in South Asian region. So on, confl icts between archaeological sites or monuments and lived cultural heritage. It may be accepted rationally that if the two communities, Hindus and Muslims, are ready not to heap defeat and humiliation with an aim to re-establish the history of the medieval times, the issues can be resolved amicably. This essay reviews the emerging literature dealing with the enduring role and context of religion in the issue of contesting heritage (mostly cultural). Emphasis is further laid on the contextual constructs of analysis, examples from diff erent parts of Southern Asia, and fi nally role of religion in policies, mitigation and management of contesting heritage.</jats:p>",
