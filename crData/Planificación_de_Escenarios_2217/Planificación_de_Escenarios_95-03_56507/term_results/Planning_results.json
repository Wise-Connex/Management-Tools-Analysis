The federal and municipal governments have at their disposal a number of state-of-the-art transportation plans but seem unable to implement the most important of the recommendations. In this paper Bangkok's transportation woes are described in terms of the obstacles that face the agencies charged with implementing improvements.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Local government in Great Britain is currently undergoing reorganisation. The reorganisation process is being progressed separately in each of the three countries of Great Britain‚ÄîEngland, Scotland, and Wales. Reorganisation itself has always been a sensitive issue, and the current process is no exception. Political implications of the process have often tended to cloud the practical implications for the delivery of local authority services. In this paper support by senior members of the planning profession in Wales for central government's reorganisation proposals is measured. The content of the proposals is examined and the principal planning-related issues that arise from them are identified. The paper highlights current debate on the implications of local government reorganisation for the future delivery and nature of planning in the principality, with particular reference to three key areas: Planning in a unitary local government structure, the nature of strategic planning within a reorganised local government structure, and the role of community and town councils in the planning process. It is shown that despite general dissatisfaction with central government's regard for the planning function in its proposals for reorganisation, there is considerable support for the underlying principles and content of those proposals. The paper is concluded by progressing the debate to the form of local authority planning postreorganisation. </jats:p>",

Key elements of Duri's reservoir management practices include: injecting steam in new patterns at rates up to about 1.2 BCWEPD/NAF* or the maximum rates achievable below fracture pressure; distributing the steam into reservoir layers in proportion to their hùúôSo; maintaining these rates until steam breakthrough occurs in multiple wells in a pattern; then performing injector wellwork to shift steam out of the breakthrough layers while continuing initial rates into the non-breakthrough layers. The area-wide rate reduction schedule caused by these shifts resembles a heat balance (Vogel1) rate reduction schedule. The steam that is shifted out of an old steamflood development area becomes the supply of steam for the start up of a new area. Key elements of Duri's development planning practices include: obtaining sufficient reservoir information to be able to predict performance of all areas in the field; dividing the undeveloped parts of the field into steamflood areas that are logical and will fit the steam availability and construction scheduling constraints of the project; ranking the new projects by their profitability; and installing them at a schedule that matches the steam shifts out of the old areas with the ramp up of the new area so that steam plant capacity is fully utilized. This paper discusses the interrelationships between reservoir management practices, development planning, and the maximization of overall DSF project value.</jats:p>",

Increasing concerns about these effects by producers, surface owners, trustees, and regulatory agencies suggest the need for realistic approaches to assessment and management of saline materials generated by the oil and gas industry. Salt impact assessment and management approaches have received much attention by agriculturalists, especially in irrigated desert regions, and these methods and tools can be adapted to the unique needs of the oil and gas industry.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper demonstrates salt assessment and management principles as applied to a typical site. Rapid quantification of the environmental setting and extent of impacts, using tools such as electromagnetic inductance (EM), accurately and inexpensively provides the basis for management decisions. Reclamation goals are then determined, accounting for the resource capability classification of soils and groundwater and the effects of local agricultural practices. Site specific reclamation alternatives are evaluated, supported by simple laboratory treatability screening of standard and innovative soil amendments. These efforts and associated cost analysis provide a basis for the development of an appropriate reclamation plan. Remedy selection attempts to optimize costs by taking maximum advantage of site conditions, natural forces, and time. Reclamation then results in return of the land to agricultural production.</jats:p>",

Of interest here are questions about how localities have developed over time; which neighbourhoods have experienced gentrification and in which places have the recessions of the previous decades had their worst effects? Overall, do we see a picture of polarization or a levelling out of social disparities either locally or nationally? It is argued that these questions cannot be answered by conventional quantitative techniques because the answers are unlikely to be simple enough to be presentable in tables or by equations. Pictures are needed to show how different processes occur in different places, and holistic patterns need also to be seen without generalizing out the detail. Neither traditional thematic mapping nor commercial geographic information systems can do this well. Spatial visualization is an alternative approach in which the researchers choose what they wish to see and how they wish to view it. Many problems require new methods of visualization for their exploration. A new census presents us not only with new statistics, but also with the opportunity and impetus to develop radically different ways of envisioning information to reveal more fully the human facts contained within a mass of social statistics. </jats:p>",

Specifically, a nonlinear optimization problem is firstly formulated and solved to find the minimum joint velocity and the minimum contact force to impart a desired motion to the object at each time step. Then, the relative velocity at the contact point is found by calculating the velocity of the fingertip and the object at the contact point. Finally, time derivatives of the surface variables and the contact angle of the fingertip and the object at the current time step is computed using the Montana's contact equation to find the contact parameters of the fingertip and the object at the next time step. To show the validity of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example is illustrated by employing the robotic hand manipulating a sphere with three fingers each of which has four joints</jats:p>",

In this paper, we exploit the inherent capability of ATM networks to rearrange dynamically the already installed resources, and propose performance‚Äêoriented management combined with virtual path bandwidth (VPB) control for the planning of the extensions of bandwidth capacities of virtual paths (VPs) and transmission links of the network. We define a large network optimization problem and solve it by a rigorous, analytical procedure. The optimization model comprises specific requirements of the network‚Äêplanning problem and a bandwidth distribution scheme ensuring network reliability. We reveal the efficiency of the proposed scheme by applying it on a model network, considering two realistic case‚Äêstudies of network‚Äêtraffic evolution. We show that in the presence of VPB control: (a) the initial distribution of the total bandwidth to VPs is of no importance, since it can be adaptively rearranged according to the offered traffic, (b) the network is well used and bandwidth investment could be saved, and (c) whenever additional bandwidth must be installed in VPs which have an unanticipated bad grade‚Äêof‚Äêservice, time savings result. We present the network performance in detail, in figures, and compare this with the performance of the network in the absence of VPB control.</jats:p>",

The strength of cultural values has not encouraged a declining population growth rate in parallel with the Iranian wave of modernisation before and after the revolution. A special cultural revolution is the prerequisite for a demographic revolution. This study is placing the main emphasis on the social and psychological factors involved in family planning. The general findings of surveys conducted so far demonstrate that few people know anything about family planning and methods of contraception. Social, cultural and religious institutions seem to inhibit the expansion of family planning. Moreover, the lack of economic and social security promotes a large family size and prevents contraceptive use. However, social change in Iranian society will eventually be brought about by urbanisation, industrialisation and education, and the ensuing modernisation of values is expected to increase the use of contraceptives and lead to changes in the associated social and cultural institutions. </jats:p>",

This initiative targets the involvement, through ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù, of residents of ‚Äúareas of concentrated disadvantage‚Äù in the processes of programme formulation and delivery. Underlying this is the objective of ‚Äúincorporating‚Äù neighourhood residents in ‚Äòmainstream‚Äô political and economic life. In this paper, that objective is set in the context of contemporary conditions in such neighbourhoods. Experiences of the early stages of two City Challenge programmes are then discussed, in order to assess the character of the partnerships which are evolving. The two examples vary significantly in their style and in the strategy of the local authority, as well as in the characteristics of the areas. It is argued that, although central government's influence over the style of the programmes remains pervasive, the strategy of the local authority and the struggles by the participants in the partnerships have a significant influence on the content and style of the programmes. Further, the style of the programmes affects the balance of power within the programme and the terms of incorporation of the various partnerships in governance processes. </jats:p>",

An exception is a source‚Äêcontaining rigid mold that delivers brachytherapy when inserted securely in a surgical defect. A technique has been developed in which an acrylic mold of the region to be treated is suspended in a demountable aluminum box, which is then filled to a suitable level with dental stone to form a casting that supports the mold and that can be removed intact. First, the box is aligned on a mill table and a ball mill is used to drill three parallel holes in the acrylic mold, with precisely known locations and depths and as widely separated as possible. The spherical air cavities that result from plugging these holes with ball‚Äêmilled acrylic rods become reference markers in subsequent computed tomography (CT) scans. After optimum CT‚Äêcoordinate locations have been planned for <jats:sup>125</jats:sup>I seeds in catheters, they are transformed to mill coordinates using a matrix developed from the known marker coordinates in the two systems.

The other two conditions involved choice tasks in which the amplitude and direction of movement were varied. The variables recorded were: movement latency determined by measuring the RT, duration of movement and the terminal accuracy of pointing as reflected in the movement time (MT), pointing surfaces (PS), and systematic errors. RTs and MTs were found to be significantly longer in cerebellar patients than in controls. In both groups the choice RT increased significantly as compared to simple RT, but no significant difference between patients and controls was found for the mean increase of the choice RT as compared with the mean increase for simple RT. A strong correlation between MTs and PSs was found in the controls. The cerebellar patients showed no correlation between MTs and PSs.

Federal transfers are not only a cost-effective means of enabling such states to undertake nationally optimal levels of poverty alleviation but also a way of ensuring that they actually do so. The distribution of intergovernmental transfers in India during the seventh five-year plan is examined, and it is argued that general-purpose and specific-purpose transfers were inadequate and imperfectly designed from the perspective of poverty alleviation. </jats:p>",

Spatial analysts have begun to exploit the new opportunities provided by the broadly comparable two sets of Small Area Statistics with the advantages of computerised access. However, the integration of 1981 and 1991 data is far from straightforward because of changes in census geography and definitions, in the administration of the census, and in the format and nature of the data. It is explained how, by a further refinement of population surface modelling concepts, these two data sets can be transformed into a single, consistent geographical database independent of the two original and inconsistent zonal structures. At the same time, the technique allows the effective management of the difficulties associated with ‚Äòrestricted‚Äô and ‚Äòspecial‚Äô census zones. There is no sense in which such techniques can add to the accuracy (real or apparent) of the census data, but they are literally a re-presentation of the same data in a different form. The resulting models permit intercensal analysis with considerable spatial flexibility and a number of computational advantages. Illustration is made of the types of analysis that can be supported, and attention is drawn to the availability of the remodelled data to the academic community. </jats:p>",

This results in a projection‚Äêfiltering algorithm for the calculation of optimal beam profiles. The method yields analytical solutions for circular and triangular dose distributions, and combinations thereof. Practical solutions for arbitrary cases can be found numerically.

Because it is not possible to use humans in long-term toxicological studies, the use of animals will continue. However, the data obtained in animal studies can be better extrapolated to the patient by utilizing bridging studies with in vitro models of human drug metabolism. There are 2 basic categories of in vitro methods for the examination of human liver drug metabolism. The first group of in vitro methods consists of the cellular models, which include primary hepatocytes, liver slices, and cell lines. The second group is the use of preparations of the drug-metabolizing enzymes such as tissue homogenates, subcellular fractions, and isolated enzymes. Studies modeling both the human and experimental animal metabolism of a drug are useful in the design of toxicological studies. In vitro studies can identify metabolites, species-specific metabolic routes, and the experimental animal model that best reflects the potential human exposure to the drug and its metabolites. This information can also be useful in the design of the clinical studies by identifying human metabolites, the enzymes responsible for the metabolic clearance of the drug, the effects of genetics and other host factors on the metabolism of the drug, and potential drug-drug interactions. An example of how such information is generated and interpreted is presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Establishing the extent to which the level of transport supply affects demand generation remains a daunting problem for the transport analyst because of reciprocal causation and dependency between supply and demand. After the US deregulation of domestic air transport, unprecedented increases in air-service supply were observed at many US airports, increases which can be considered to be clearly independent of local service requirements. The supply measures reflect improvements in service both to nearby major airports and to the United States as a whole. In this paper, a sample of three airports is examined in an attempt to establish causal relationships between local demand and several measures of air-transport supply. Causality is established by using cross-correlation-function analysis, and the impacts of supply on demand are determined by using time-series transfer-function modelling. Causality is found to be location dependent, but supply tends to affect demand with a 3‚Äì6‚Äìmonth lag. Supply in terms of the total number of destinations served was found to have a significant impact on demand at Syracuse, with estimated transfer-function elasticities of 0.5. </jats:p>",

How can the practical integration of emergency planning and city planning principles be achieved? While their importance is not contested, questions such as these are not part of the contemporary planner's creed, even though the industrial hazardscape of cities and towns, in particular, is increasing. There is a compelling need for a closer integration between disaster and city planning. Planners need to consider aspects of emergency management, risk assessment and hazard vulnerability in their planning and development deliberations. An emergency management focus is particularly necessary when urban renewal and redevelopment is being considered. Of special importance is the need for planners to understand that large-scale urban and industrial projects can exacerbate the plight of existing ‚Äòat‚Äîrisk‚Äô groups, and may even create a more hazardous social environment for both existing and future populations. These issues are examined in two articles. This first paper examines the issues in the context of emergency management and other relevant literature. In the second paper two case studies are presented to demonstrate how these issues translate into practice. </jats:p>",

For thin walled hollow organs, such as the rectum and bladder, the surface area irradiated is a more appropriate measure of the biological effect than the full volume. It is also more accurate and efficient to define the surface for a hollow structure and compute the surface area histograms. Application of the dose‚Äêsurface histograms provide new insights into prostate treatment planning. A simple idealized geometry model demonstrates that the percentage surface area intersected by the geometric beam edge differs from the percentage volume intersected. For a group of prostate patients, it is shown that the dose‚Äêsurface histograms yield substantially different results from the dose‚Äêvolume histograms in ranking four‚Äê, six‚Äê, and, eight‚Äêfield treatment plans and in calculating the fraction of the rectum irradiated to high dose. The difference in terms of surface area between these plans in the high‚Äêdose region is usually less than that in terms of the volume, and a reverse of plan ranking order can consequently occur. The percentage of organ surface irradiated to high dose is typically greater than the percentage volume by 5% to 10%. The use of the dose‚Äêsurface histograms in analysis of organ motion and/or patient setup uncertainty, and analysis of rectal complications, is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Another approach, referred to as the ‚Äúinverse problem,‚Äù is: Given the dose prescription, compute the optimal set of photon beams while preventing unphysical solutions such as negative beam weights, and iterate to achieve the prescription as closely as possible. This solution to this inverse problem, which uses image reconstruction mathematics, entails the delivery of large numbers of nonuniform beam intensities to produce uniform dose distributions. These dose distributions can be arranged to conform very closely to even complex target volumes, yet spare surrounding sensitive tissue. Alternatively, the dose distributions can be arranged to generously treat a regional field and ‚Äúconformally avoid‚Äù overtreating sensitive volumes within the field. Multiple dose prescriptions can be delivered without additional effort. We propose that a practical way of delivering optimized dose distributions would be to intensity modulate a photon beam, using collimator leaves intersecting a slit field of radiation. Modulation is achieved by varying the time that the leaves are blocking the field. A practical geometry to deliver such a beam is a computed tomography‚Äêlike gantry configuration, which also lends itself to tomographic setup verification of dose delivered to the patient. We refer to such a delivery method as ‚Äútomotherapy.‚Äù Several types of tomotherapy simulations have been conducted. A fully three dimensional optimized treatment planning system using iterative filtered back‚Äêprojection have been developed. We will present examples of conformal plans for breast and prostate radiotherapy. We have constructed an experimental apparatus for simulating helical tomotherapy delivery by simultaneously rotating and longitudinally translating a phantom past an intensity‚Äêmodulated fan beam. A comparison between a computation and and experimentally realized plan is presented. A Monte Carlo simulation of the angular distribution and energy fluence spectrum of 10‚ÄêMV photons produced by a tungsten target have been used to estimate the optimized shape and mass of a primary shielding required to meet regulatory standards.</jats:p>",

Much of the region's manufacturing base is made up of two groups of industries: A declining aerospace‚Äìdefense sector, and a low-wage, low-skill sweatshop sector. What are the prospects for creating a growing manufacturing base focused on high-wage, high-skill industries? In this paper we examine the opportunities presented by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's $183 billion thirty-year capital improvement plan as the potential catalyst of a set of technological and manufacturing synergies that would reorient the regional economy towards a new advanced ground transportation equipment industry. We investigate the dynamics of agglomerated complexes of industry in general, and the institutional and infrastructural arrangements that create and sustain competitive advantage within regional economic systems. Next, we evaluate the potential for the successful development of a technologically dynamic advanced ground transportation equipment industry in Southern California. This central part of the analysis focuses on (a) the existing industrial assets of the region, (b) specific forms of institution building that need to be carried out in the interests of local economic development and high-quality job creation, and (c) the importance of building a cooperative, high-trust manufacturing system. We then offer suggestions for specific types of policy intervention that might foster new forms of local economic growth. We argue that a coordinated response by both the public and the private sectors could conceivably set the region on a successful new economic development trajectory. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sunday trading in Scotland is an established feature integral to the retail operations of many companies. This requires that a considerable number of people take up paid employment on Sunday. Illegal Sunday trading in England and Wales, particularly since Christmas 1991, has made similar demands on retail staff. In this paper Sunday employment in superstores in Scotland with its more established and legal Sunday working, is compared with England and Wales, with their more recent and illegal opening pattern. It is concluded that a number of differences do exist, particularly in grocery superstores. Key findings include the high number of Sunday-only workers and a lower proportion of workers on premium rates in Scotland. When Sunday trading is legalised and established in England and Wales it would be expected that the employment pattern would come to mirror more closely the Scottish situation. These findings are discussed in the context of employment change and spatial-legal debates. </jats:p>",
