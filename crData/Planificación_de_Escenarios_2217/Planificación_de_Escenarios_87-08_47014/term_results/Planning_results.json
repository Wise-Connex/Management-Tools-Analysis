At every stage, one or more machines are available for processing tasks. We assume that the jobs are independent and that the processing of a task, once begun, cannot be interrupted. In this paper we focus our attention on a critical but largely ignored aspect of flow-shop utilization, namely, that of planning the efficient transportation of work between stages. We therefore assume the existence of a transport, used to ferry jobs from one stage to the next. We devise and formally analyze effective transportation strategies for various situations in this environment that are dependent on the amount of time needed for transportation relative to the amount required for task processing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is widely recognized that agglomeration economies are a crucially important factor in explaining the existence and growth of urban areas, and therefore should be explicitly taken into consideration in long-run urban growth analysis. Once such economies are introduced, however, the urban economy tends to diverge from a steady state equilibrium and may ‘explode’ without limit. A possible way to solve this dilemma is shown. </jats:p><jats:p> First, a simple urban growth model with production and factor migration functions in the presence of agglomeration economies is set up. It is proved that the urban economy with agglomeration economies tends to approach a kind of balanced growth path in the long run, although the growth rate itself is accelerating without limit. It is also shown that if the total demand for the output of the city is growing at an exogenously given rate, a sustainable steady growth equilibrium exists and is unique and globally stable. Then, land is introduced to show that the availability of the third factor of production will make it more likely to achieve a steady growth equilibrium in the presence of agglomeration economies. Last, the model is generalized to include many factors of production. </jats:p>",

More specifically,. the term stands for strategies seeking either to support children in their own home or to move swiftly to adoption. Permanency planning has become widely accepted as a framework for child welfare programmes, and as a measure of the adequacy of laws relating to child welfare and adoption. This article offers a critical view of at least the more dogmatic statements of the permanency planning approach. It considers how far permanency planning is supported by research evidence, and the extent to which it provides a satisfactory framework for developing social and legal policy relating to children. An argument is advanced that, while drawing attention to important aspects of children’s needs, permanency planning tends to become a slogan that identifies children’s welfare with a simplistic view of the nuclear family, obscures important policy issues relating to public intervention, and tends to create a climate highly threatening to low income and minority groups. The paper refers to several recent Australian discussions in which permanency planning is treated with caution, and concludes with an account of recent developments in Australian children’s law, which, it is argued, embody a more satisfactory and flexible approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electric utilities in many developing countries are faced with a panoply of major problems. Often operating at low reliability, in severe financial difficulty due to inadequate tariffs, and under pressure to expand the network to rural areas at the same time that they are under pressure to reduce capital outlays because of demands to reduce public‐sector spending and concerns over the ability to service foreign debt. Traditional approaches to electric utility planning have become inadequate in this new financial climate. In this paper we explore the institutional, economic, manpower and financial dimensions of the present crisis, and examine their implications for national governments, donor agencies and international financial institutions. We emphasize the need for a more balanced approach to planning models, for improved procedures to deal with uncertainties and for a more imaginative approach to non‐traditional solutions.</jats:p>",

Furthermore, the author compares the legal and medical understandings of patient self‐determination and the uses of best interest and substituted judgment standards. It is argued that medicine and law differ on the important issues only in degree of emphasis, not in principle. To clarify the issues, a systematic classification of the multiple levels of instruction directives and agent‐proxy decision‐making models is developed. Finally, it is recommended that health care decision‐making for the elderly can be enhanced by encouraging patients to: 1) create as much evidence as possible to affirm their preferences and values; and 2) plan the delegation of decisions by appointing a proxy.</jats:p>",

An earlier model of international labor migration is used to derive additional insights into the growth and decline of labor supply in different labor markets resulting from migration.

This paper is an investigation of the attempts by the county planning authority to persuade other agencies that the diluted approved policy should be interpreted and enacted in the spirit of the more innovative intentions of the draft policy. Evidence is presented of attempts via various mechanisms to transfer institutional values generated at county level to the actions and decisionmaking of other organisations, particularly the district councils. Although some transfers have occurred at policy level, the enactment of policies in most cases has not reflected the intentions of the county authority. Such intentions have been frustrated both by the nature of the institutional culture operating at county level, where prorural dispositions were subject to the higher priorities of financial constraint, and by the fundamental preservation by other agencies of their own (albeit declining) powers of financial allocation. Policy implementation has therefore taken the form of a centrally constrained, low-cost search for visible policy responses which rely increasingly on the resources of the private and voluntary sectors. </jats:p>",

This article examines the contraceptive and fertility behavior after their last clinic visits. The results showed that most of these women were \"protected\" from pregnancy risk considerably beyond their last clinic visit. However, the analysis also revealed that in spite of the reported high contraceptive use rate, unplanned pregnancies occurred after the client's last clinic visit, suggesting that contraceptive use was either inconsistent or ineffective. These findings suggest that instead of allocating a large proportion of resources to follow-up acceptors to bring the \"drop-outs\" back to the clinics, a more effective program strategy would be to systematically and effectively educate and counsel the clients during their clinic attendance, especially during their first clinic visit. </jats:p>",

The author purports to show that blacks have made little headway in terms of educational progress and income expectations, and are ‘losing ground’ within US society. A critical evaluation of Murray's research shows that he has focused on microeconomic issues at the expense of a consideration of wider structural changes, and that the book is thus flawed in a number of ways. This notwithstanding, the book has been successful, in that it has engendered academic analysis and political debate. It is inferred that, as an exercise in policy development, Murray has had a major impact exactly because he has offered a simplistic approach to his material. It is argued that this challenges what is regarded as the typical practice of scholarly research, publication, and discussion. The book constitutes an important yet distressing example for those who have aspirations for influencing the course of policy generation. </jats:p>",
