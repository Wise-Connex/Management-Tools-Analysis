      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rappaport &amp; Van den Heuvel (1982) suggested the following formation scenario for B emission (Be)/X-ray binaries: the progenitor of the neutron star is the initial primary star with mass M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub> = 10-20 M<jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>, which during hydrogen-shell burning transfers mass to the companion (with M<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> &lt; M<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>). The secondary is spun up due to disk-accretion (e.g. Packet 1981) and has become a rapidly rotating Be star (M ≃ 10-20 M<jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>).</jats:p><jats:p>With this scenario the observed orbital periods (P<jats:sub>orb</jats:sub> &gt; 15 d) of the Be/X-ray binaries can be explained. This was shown by van den Heuvel (1983) by adopting an idealized period distribution for unevolved O- and B-type close binaries with P<jats:sub>orb</jats:sub>, &lt; 30 d (see Fig. 1) and assuming conservative evolution, i.e. that mass and angular momentum are conserved during mass transfer.</jats:p>",
