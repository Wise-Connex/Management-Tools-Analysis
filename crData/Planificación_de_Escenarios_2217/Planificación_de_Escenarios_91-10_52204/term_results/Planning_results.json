Recent papers (Gördon and Moore 1989; Moore and Gordon 1990; Gordon and Moore in press) review some of the issues raised and suggest extensions that resolve many of the conceptual dilemmas suggested by the original model. Most of the existing approaches surveyed in these previous papers make little use of the duality properties of the assignment model. In this paper duality information provided by the linear version of the Koopmans and Beckmann model is used to explain the utility of transferable development rights (TDR) as land use control policies. In particular, it is shown that aggregate rents accruing to capital are affected by land use plans in ways the current literature ignores. This view emphasizes the importance of TDR policies to city planners and sheds light on how planners can guide optimal urban development. </jats:p>",

Further examination of planning consequences of the value study showed that a variant of the social learning paradigm of planning seems to be effective in planning with the New Credit community.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper theoretically investigates filtering in urban housing markets: how the process occurs and the degree to which its outcomes are beneficial. Central to the framework presented is the partitioning of the urban housing market into submarkets that are segmented by quality. Within each submarket there is latitude for independent adjustments of demand and supply, and submarkets are interconnected by the actions of households, converters of new dwellings, and builders of new dwellings. Forces impinging on one submarket create signals there that eventually lead to systematic, but nonuniform repercussions, potentially throughout the submarket array. It is these dynamics of intersubmarket adjustments of demanders and suppliers that illuminate filtering. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the task of converting military facilities to civilian uses, differentiat ing demand side from supply side approaches. We distinguish four alternative models of conversion from military to civilian use, each organized around a different target: converting the company, converting the community economic base, converting the worker, and converting the facility. After some discussion of each approach we scrutinize the last of these, which is in many ways the most difficult and yet the most attractive in terms of retaining jobs and stabilizing communities. After stating both strict and broader criteria for judging \"success,\" we present the results of six geographically-dispersed and industrially- diverse case studies of such conversion efforts in the 1980s. While to date none has succeeded in the narrow sense of preserving jobs, these experiments have had a significant impact on public thinking about the formidable tasks of conversion. Several have resulted in state or regional studies, legislation, and economic development efforts. As a group, the cases demonstrate the ability and willingness of defense workers to plan for civilian work. In some, local conversion planning has led to an alliance between labor and peace organizations which has strength ened the political clout and institutional capabilities of both. </jats:p>",

A total of 13 of the country's 19 provincial hospitals were surveyed. In addition, data were collected on key indicators of the quality of service provided by each hospital. These selected indicators provide a measure of the quality of administration and management, patient care, buildings and equipment and essential drugs in hospitals. Weaknesses in management and administration were found in all hospitals. Deficits were also found in other important areas. The use of a simple scoring system enabled the identification of those hospitals falling short of expected levels of quality. This paper presents a description of the performance of the surveyed hospitals over a range of indicators, discusses the implications of the findings and suggests further work to develop a regular quality‐assurance programme in hospitals.</jats:p>",

Cost‐effectiveness is related to the quality of the health‐care intervention. In the economics literature, health‐care demand studies generally indicate that quality is an important determinant of utilization patterns, but do not clearly identify those components of quality most important to the patient. On the supply side, cost analyses have not closely examined cost‐quality tradeoffs, nor the net costs of quality. Policy makers must determine the affordability of cost‐recovery mechanisms, which include both increases in price and quality. Further research should identify those aspects of quality which will maximize effectiveness at the least cost, thus helping to promote the financial sustainability of the health service.</jats:p>",

Structured observations of immunization sessions and clinic logistics highlighted functional problems at particular clinics that contributed to shortages of vaccines, sterilized needles and oral rehydration salts (ORS). Quality assessment of medical records for the treatment of diarrhea revealed a wide variation in the recorded quality of services. Clinical case histories were presented to public and private providers, who advised different approaches for case management, highlighting areas where improvement is needed. For example, public providers were more likely to use ORS to treat dehydration; private providers were more likely to enquire about symptoms of dysentery. Private providers were more likely to treat a mild respiratory infection with antibiotics, but few providers were likely to prescribe antibiotics for a child with signs suggestive of severe pneumonia. Advice to mothers was insufficient in most areas.

Personnel policy, especially regarding physicians and nurses, is central to the level and type of care provided, and ultimately to the resources expended. There is increasing evidence that state health systems in many Latin American countries face the apparently paradoxical situation of oversupply of physicians coupled with the undersupply of physician services. Yet, productivity of medical staff in public facilities in Latin America is a relatively unexplored area. Further, little is known about the relationship between productivity of medical staff and quality of services provided in developing countries.</jats:p><jats:p>Taking the case of a large public hospital in the Dominican Republic, this study examines the quality of hospital structure and process as it relates to the functions and performance of physicians, and to a lesser extent, nurses. Based on a patient‐based survey, data were collected on physician and nurse time allocations in outpatient, emergency, surgery and inpatient wards, the types of services provided, and the time costs of providing them.</jats:p><jats:p>The analysis focuses on medical staff performance according to the professional levels of physicians and nurses providing care, and the time spent attending to patients and conducting supervisory tasks. The gap between contracted and expended physician hours is examined. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications for hospital management, particularly as they relate to incentives for medical personnel.</jats:p>",

Developing countries have achieved remarkable reductions in fertility rates in the past 25 years, but continuing gains depend largely upon increasing the capacity of family planning and health care delivery systems in rural areas. National governments are unlikely to allocate additional funds to improve delivery systems to rural areas because of the greater political influence of urban areas and the declining health-care budgets of the central government. This situation has led many to propose alternative arrangements for health-care delivery in rural areas.</jats:p>",

A team of 12 occupational therapists and one educationalist tackled the challenge of constructing a curriculum. The article analyses and reflects upon the unpredictable and creative process of curriculum innovation, within a particular context provided by a clear, collaborative relationship between the purchasers and providers of a vocational training course. The curriculum planners needed to take into consideration the characteristics of adult learners and the requirements of quality assurance and validation as set by national statutory bodies. These provided additional dimensions which contributed to the specific context for this curriculum initiative. The two outcomes of the development year — the product and the course planning team members' evaluation of the process — are also described. </jats:p>",

Geographic information abstractions with aspects of theme, time, and space can be used to provide a comprehensive description of geographic reality in a geographic information system (GIS): In the context of geographic modeling a geographic information abstraction is defined as a simultaneous focus on important characteristics of geographic content, structure, and process while temporarily suppressing certain details—rather than elimination or deletion of detail. Geographic information abstractions can be used in a database design process to develop a more realistic description of reality in the form of a database model. The geographic information abstraction types are: classification, generalization, aggregation, and association. They are used to structure a descriptive GIS database model by using an example from urban transportation. The embedding of a practically adequate descriptive database model in explanatory and predictive models of urban change is discussed. </jats:p>",

This paper examines what this apparent success has meant for women, taking women's rights to the control of their fertility as the necessary aim for all family planning programmes, and the safeguarding of their reproductive health as an obligation. In the paper, the aims and methods of the Family Planning Programme are examined separately, in order to assess on the one hand the extent and the manner in which women's interests are acknowledged in its objectives, and, on the other, whether in its implementation the programme takes into account the needs of women, both as recipients and as family planning workers. The main conclusion of the paper is that the priorities, style of implementation and service delivery of the programme do not provide women with the means of regulating their fertility autonomously through access to freely chosen contraceptives and related services. In addition, the paper concludes that the safeguard and improvement of women's reproductive health is not among the concerns of the programme, in principle or in practice.</jats:p>",

The main restructuring pressures are identified and the effects in two of the principal electronics industries, namely, data processing and telecommunications, are examined. At this sectoral level the results of the analysis suggest that even the very largest firms are having great difficulty in coping with the uncertainties associated with changing markets and technological change. Consequently, these firms are increasingly resorting to new forms of collaboration in an attempt to compete more effectively. It is also argued that these changes (such as the trend towards more integrated supply chains) carry enormous implications for national and regional development strategies. These spatial implications are examined in the context of an analysis of Britain's withering position in the international division of labour in electronics. The paper is concluded by an examination of the theoretical and policy implications of these changes. </jats:p>",

Fluid employment relations and efficiencies in search and mobility within the local labor market provide Silicon Valley firms remarkable flexibility in meeting their labor demands and help to ensure a rapid circulation of knowledge and information within the production complex. The accelerated transfer of technological knowledge allows Silicon Valley firms to build cumulatively upon a common stock of technological successes and failures, contributing significantly to the innovative dynamism of the region. </jats:p>",

General characteristics of models to be used for sustainable development are discussed. It turns out that such models do not exist. </jats:p><jats:p> Short critical descriptions are given of representative analytical models that have arisen in theories on economic growth with renewable and nonrenewable resources, and pollution, or that provide an interesting alternative view of economic — environmental interactions. These models appear to provide incomplete descriptions of economic, ecological, and interactive processes. </jats:p><jats:p> To clarify the logic and special features of the general model, three issues are addressed. First, a general ecological model is proposed that is consistent with a macroeconomic system in terms of geographical coverage. Such a general model would have to be able to deal with a specific set of general functions and characteristics of ecological systems. Second, the meaning of some economic, ecological, and physical concepts for modelling is discussed. Third, the potential for inclusion of sustainable development conditions is examined. </jats:p><jats:p> Next, the general structure of an economic — ecological model for sustainable development is presented. It includes the general ecological model, descriptions of economic activities and dynamics, material and economic balances, constraints, and behavioural feedback mechanisms related to sustainable development conditions. It is shown how concern for the well-being of future generations can be included. Simulation is used to obtain insight into the behaviour of the system under different policies and scenarios. Several environmental policies can be studied, including waste treatment, recycling, research and development, and environmental cleaning. Resource use strategies may include sustainable use and specific division of extraction between renewable and nonrenewable resources. Resource-use and waste-emission strategies may be based on variable degrees of concern for future generations. </jats:p><jats:p> The relevance of this model is that it allows for a study of the medium-term and long-term dynamic economic and environmental consequences of sustainable development conditions and variable degrees of concern for future generations. Its purpose is not to investigate the conditions under which the entire system will (n)ever breakdown. </jats:p>",

The growth characteristics, planning experiences, and policy implications of the expansion of service industries in large and medium‐size metropolitan areas around the world are examined. This has illuminated issues connected with the interurban competition for services. The service sector has shaped new urban planning and public policy agendas and the way in which metropolitan areas in this study have started to reshape their policies provides a good lead for others to follow. It is likely that new pressures will strengthen the need to look beyond their established urban planning policies to broader, integrated urban management policies.</jats:p>",

Dental compensations which occur in all three planes of space are discussed. Special attention is given to the importance of dental compensations in the antero‐posterior plane in orthognathic surgery treatment planning. There is a necessity for early definitive decision‐making in the borderline orthognathic surgery patient and the role of orthodontic camouflage is pointed out. Case selection for treatment with removable appliances is explored.</jats:p>",

This approach ignores the possibility that the manufacturing planning system may be managing the incoming work flow so that peaks and valleys in the work load have been smoothed out.</jats:p><jats:p>This study shows, via a simple computer simulation of a random job shop, that such smoothing by the planning system can improve system performance and enhance the effects of Order Review/Release. The two ‘filtering’ mechanisms of planning system smoothing and Order Review/Release have a complementary impact on the system, with smoothing working to reduce flow time and flow time variability and ORR working to reduce work in process and work in process variability. The combination of smoothing with ORR results in shorter and more consistent lead times, lower and more stable work‐in‐process levels and better delivery performance. This results in a system which is very stable and predictable.</jats:p><jats:p>Further, the study shows that the combined effects of smoothing and ORR can improve the performance of simple shop floor dispatching rules like first come‐first served to the point where they are competitive with more sophisticated, due date oriented rules. This raises the possibility of simplifying control mechanisms on the shop floor by doing a better job of work load planning and order release.</jats:p>",

This is especially true of applications in geodemographics and epidemiology, but the work described here is of relevance in any attempt to attach specific locational identifiers to unit postcodes in Britain. Conventionally, unit postcodes are given an explicit spatial reference by means of the Central Postcode Directory (CPD), in which 100-metre grid references are assigned to each postcode. However, in a major undertaking, the company Pinpoint Analysis Ltd is digitising every property, both domestic and commercial, in the country. This gives a 1 metre grid reference for each such property; from the set of all addresses in a unit postcode a centroid may be obtained. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper the locational referencing provided by the ‘Pinpoint Address Code’ is compared with that of the CPD. The empirical work draws on data for Camden in London, but reference is made to earlier work in Whitehaven. We make some observations on the value of using point data in GIS (notably epidemiological) research, rather than relying on data for essentially arbitrary areal units. </jats:p>",
