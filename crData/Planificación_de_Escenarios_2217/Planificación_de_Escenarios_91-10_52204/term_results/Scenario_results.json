The algorithm determines a solution that does not depend on hindsight and accounts for the uncertain environment depicted by a number of appropriately weighted scenarios. The solution procedure decomposes the stochastic program to its constituent scenario subproblems, thus preserving the network structure. Computational results are reported demonstrating the algorithm's convergence behavior. Acceleration schemes are discussed along with termination criteria. The algorithm's potential for execution on parallel multiprocessors is discussed.</jats:p>",

The PSQ is similar to the ASQ, but is composed of three five-point scales rather than three seven-point scales.</jats:p>",
