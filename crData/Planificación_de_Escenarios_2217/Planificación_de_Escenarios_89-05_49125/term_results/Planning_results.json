The reserve estimate for the field is currently 209 million Sm3 (3.31 billion stb) of oil and 92 billion Sm3 (3.25 TScf) of gas.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The reservoir management planning prior to production start up has focused on optimizing the original production plan for the Oseberg reservoirs and investigate dynamically key elements in the plan in several long-term reservoir tests.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper demonstrates reservoir management as a key element in the process of optimization of offshore developments and the importance of having some flexibility in the development plan to accommodate new knowledge and new technology.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The main factors influencing an offshore field's profitability is the geology and reservoir conditions, the development solution and the oil price. While the price remains uncertain throughout the life of the field, the development solution is traditionally decided while there still is much uncertainty as to the interpretation of how the reservoir will behave during production.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Important reservoir aspects are at this stage inferred from extrapolation of static data obtained during drilling, short drill-stem tests and from geological and geophysical work. More accurate knowledge of reservoir behavior is typically obtained after regular production has started, when dynamic reservoir information is being gained.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In such a situation where much uncertainty exists it is important to give the development solution flexibility for possible adjustments to cost-effective improvements. It is equally important to actively search for new information about the reservoir that may lead to improvements in the plan and in the production operations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The Oseberg Field is a major oil field located in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. The field was discovered in 1979. The Field Development Plan of the Oseberg Field was decided in the end of 1983. From then and until the production start-up in December 1988, the Plan has seen two significant modifications which both have originated from the process of optimizing the reservoir management of the field.The production mechanism of one of the major structures has been altered from water injection to gas injection to increase recovery. This has been made possible by import of unprocessed gas from the giant Troll East Field.The average production capacity from the field has increased from 204.000 to 340.000 stb/d.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In addition, a long-term reservoir test has taken place, which not only has provided valuable dynamic information about the reservoir prior to regular production, but also given income to the Oseberg owners.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper will give an outline of the reservoir management planning process for Oseberg. The background for and the consequences to reservoir management by the improvements to the development plan and by the long term-reservoir test will be presented</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Educational music facility planning has become a specialty within the broad field of acoustics. While teaching, rehearsal, and performance spaces for school and college music departments share many of the requirements for downtown concert halls and opera houses, they are in many ways unique. A school or college music facility planner ideally combines a practicing background as a teacher and conductor with knowledge and experience in room acoustics, noise control, and electronic systems. As a member of the design team, he represents the music staff of the educational institution and articulates their needs to the other planners. Throughout the design development process he provides a level of expertise beyond that of the music educator. A close relationship with the 55 000 member Music Educators National Conference is very beneficial. The educational music facility planner can work under contract with the client or with the architect, depending on the particular circumstances, or he may work for a firm of established acoustical consultants who wish to use his special experience and expertise to supplement their own.</jats:p>",

Provisional treatment plans, based on a screening clinical examination alone (n = 33), or on a screening clinical examination plus panoramic radiograph (n = 43), were compared with final treatment plans based on a complete diagnostic assessment (including all necessary radiographs). For this analysis, the final treatment plan was considered correct and used as the gold standard. The two groups used in the comparison were equivalent in age, gender, and final treatment plan needs. The availability of a panoramic radiograph did not improve the accuracy with which provisional treatment plans predicted the number of teeth requiring composites, amalgams, crowns, or extraction, nor did it improve the accuracy of the assessment of the periodontal status (Wilcoxon rank sum, alpha = 0.05). The proportion of patients who had an intra-oral full-mouth series as part of the complete diagnostic work-up was essentially the same for both groups (58% and 60%, respectively); the availability of the panoramic film did not reduce the need for full-mouth series radiographs for the development of the final treatment plans. </jats:p>",

This article focuses on the process the Tucson (Ariz.) Water Department uses to develop long‐range financial plans. The fundamental steps in this process are presented, including establishment of a mechanism for citizen involvement, formulation of policies that guide financial planning efforts, and identification of the components of a financial plan and of the tools utilized in the planning process. The preparation and publication of such plans have built confidence and credibility in Tucson Water among both customers and policy‐makers.</jats:p>",

It is recognised that when regression analysis became popular in the 1970s with the advent of the mainframe computer, much hype and little marketing benefit ensued. It is argued that simply speeding up the old practices of the 1970s, which rightly fell from favour, will provide no benefit to the advertising industry. ‘What is new’, the ‘benefits’ of advertising assessment, and where it is applicable are described. It is suggested that not only does technology facilitate data analysis, but also, critically, modelling methodology itself has changed, with a greater ability to remain close to one's data. As a consequence, it is argued that improved advertising decisions can only be made when the other elements of the marketing mix are formally taken into account. </jats:p><jats:p> The methodology described in the paper has been developed and successfully applied in a number of sectors for different UK clients of Coopers and Lybrand, and Collett Dickenson and Pearce. </jats:p>",

Estimated evapotranspiration totaled 69% of potential evapotranspiration (as estimated by the Penman equation) for 36 selected periods from May 15 to July 30, 1975. The root zone (0- to 15-cm layer) supplied 58% of the total evapotranspired water from the soil profile. Evapotranspiration from this layer was found to be a good predictor of total water loss. Evapotranspiration from the root zone, expressed as a percentage of potential evapotranspiration, was related to soil water tension at 3 cm depth. This relationship, combined with a knowledge of soil hydrodynamic properties, can be used to estimate evapotranspiration from the 0- to 60-cm soil profile, which in turn can be used to predict irrigation needs. For practical purposes, a relationship using net radiation instead of potential evapotranspiration can also be used. Depending on the available information, either of these two relationships may be used for irrigation planning. </jats:p>",

These may be found from direct measurement. However, if the beam model is sensitive to the parameters, it will be necessary to optimize the parameter values to obtain better correspondence between dose profiles calculated by the model and actual measured profiles. The procedure is time consuming if optimization is done manually. We have developed an optimization scheme, using a personal computer, to find the set of wedge parameters which will result in the best fit of calculated wedge profiles (using the beam model of the treatment planning system) to measured wedge profiles. The procedure is efficient and calculated profiles were found to match measured profiles to within 2% of the central axis value.</jats:p>",

They are users of two health care systems and are generally in good health. When they do need to use health care resources, however, they show a distinct preference for the Canadian system. There is a sensitivity to health concerns, especially among the older of the migrants. This sensitivity generates considerable precautionary behavior including pretravel visits to their Canadian family doctors, stocking up on drugs before the trip, and taking out health insurance for Canadians traveling abroad. The behavior is strategic in that it is both intentional and oriented to contingencies. Cost of health care may be a motivating factor because such strategic behavior is inversely related to income in this relatively affluent migrating population. The flock of Canadian snowbirds is not likely to place exorbitant demands on the U.S. health care system. </jats:p>",

The tasks undertaken by the Committee are described, as are its composition and method of operation, the major ‘discoveries’ it made, and the recommendations put forward to government. A total of sixty-four recommendations were made covering digital (especially Ordnance Survey) topographic mapping, the availability of geographically disaggregated data, the problems and benefits of linking different data sets together, the need to enhance user awareness of geographical information systems and information technology, education and training, research and development, and the appropriate role for government and machinery for coordination. Finally, the government's published response to the Chorley Report is examined, particularly with regard to the proposed Centre for Geographic Information.
