In the case of a single product, the order of the differential fertility and location rent is examined. This order is neither given nor natural, but depends especially on the distribution. Formulating a spatial equilibrium with n goods where several qualities of soil exist raises a number of difficulties. When several techniques are used to manufacture a product then it is shown how different techniques are located in relation to the centre according to prices and the distribution variables. The manner in which a new technique is introduced and spreads in space is also examined. </jats:p><jats:p> The predominant method used for evaluation in British structure planning compares strategies in terms of their achievement of particular criteria derived from community objectives. A recent survey shows that of the traditional evaluation techniques only modified goals-achievement matrix (GAM) methods are widely used in structure planning. This approach is also applied to local and project oriented planning processes where citizen participation seems even more necessary. The goals-achievement matrix was not presented by its originator—M Hill—as an entirely unambiguous method. It can be interpreted as a set of significantly diverging variants which are used here for three purposes: to show that economists' critique of GAM is too general, to clarify the connections between GAM and other well-known evaluation methods, and to discuss how GAM could best be structured for use in local participatory planning. </jats:p>",

However, such descriptions do not explicitly inform us as to how prairie-style houses are constructed, and consequently provide little help in designing new members of this style. The power of a grammar, such as the one given here, is that it establishes a recursive structure from which new designs can be constructed. Three new prairie houses generated by the grammar as well as a step-by-step generation of one of these designs are shown. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the United States moves toward a future with a very probable energy shortage, the urban settlement patterns must become far more energy efficient than they are at present. This will require new planning, zoning, taxing, and financing policies and practices. For such policies and practices to be successful, however, there must be methods for identifying and characterizing the energy needs of urban settlement configurations. This paper defines and develops some parameters which act as measures of the minimal energy consumption requirements of urban settlement configurations. The specific parameters are for the thermal quality of buildings resulting from their size and shape, for some residential land-use intensities, for service-center and access distances, and for public transportation viability as functions of dwelling-unit density. Values of these parameters are calculated for several settlement configurations, specifically for detached single-family units sited on [Formula: see text] acre lots, and for several multistory multifamily configurations. Of course, as expected, the patterns with a denser population lead to more energy efficiency, but the parameters measure the contribution of each element of the settlement configuration to the overall efficiency in terms of dwelling-unit density and living-area size. </jats:p>",

In the case of a single product, the order of the differential fertility and location rent is examined. This order is neither given nor natural, but depends especially on the distribution. Formulating a spatial equilibrium with n goods where several qualities of soil exist raises a number of difficulties. When several techniques are used to manufacture a product then it is shown how different techniques are located in relation to the centre according to prices and the distribution variables. The manner in which a new technique is introduced and spreads in space is also examined. </jats:p>",

It was especially limited in its ability to bring independent colleges and universities into statewide planning. The unfulfilled comprehensive statewide planning model makes an attractive case for decentralised decision–making. State planning, usually characterized by the so–called “bureaucratic model,” might be balanced by increased use of an “incentive model.” The work of the state agency would be to encourage and reward fair market competition among the institutions and segments of higher education. Such an approach is based on the conviction that “…intelligent planning can diminish the role of government in the academic and administrative affairs of all sectors, while improving accountability to the public and to the diverse constituencies our institutions serve.”</jats:p>",

This is followed by a critical appraisal of the evidence they provide about national and regional price levels and about house price inflation. Attention is focused on two crucial factors: the representativeness of the data and the heterogeneity of houses. It is concluded that incomplete coverage of all house transactions means that most series tend to overstate price levels and that intertemporal and interregional comparisons are sensitive to the composition by type of houses traded. </jats:p>",

Starting with some basic assumptions about the form of urban population distributions, a mathematical relationship between the methods is derived by applying the centrographic technique to an exponentially distributed urban population. By use of data from a diverse sample of cities that vary in population, region, area, and time of data collection, the relationship is tested empirically. The results of the empirical analysis are compared with the predictions of the derived relationship, and the causes of differences between them are discussed. </jats:p>",

By embedding a conventional static Leontief input-output model within an activity analysis framework, a number of interesting results are obtained. First, a new series of production, income, and employment multipliers is derived which offers considerable advantages over those currently in use. Second, partitioning the framework provides fresh insights into the complex relationships between demographic and economic variables. These developments in methodology are tested in a case study of Mersey side where an operational version of the framework is applied in a forecasting context. </jats:p>",
