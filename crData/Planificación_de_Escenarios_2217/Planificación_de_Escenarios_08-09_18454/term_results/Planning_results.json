      "abstract": "<jats:p> The international movement toward recognition of indigenous rights over the past thirty years has created a number of complex and compelling issues in planning for the use of land and natural resources. Planning should have much to say about many of these issues, given its concern for the use of land and resources, its focus on problem-solving, and its normative disposition. There is, however, only a modest literature on indigenous planning. Thus, we draw on the planning literature, but also call heavily on work from associated disciplines to introduce to planning scholars some of the problems and opportunities indigenous communities face with respect to land and resource management. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pakistan's ongoing Karachi strategic development plan 2020 (KSDP 2020) approaches city planning as a project. The overall assignment, comprising vision building, articulation of objectives, situation analysis and development of planning scenarios, was undertaken from a project-oriented standpoint. It poses a challenge to the various stakeholders in the city, including city planners. Empirical research has established several urban development trends in the city. These include large-scale real estate projects with the assistance of foreign venture capitalists, mega transportation projects in the form of expressways and light rail transit, large schemes of landscape development, swift conversion and demolition of heritage properties and land sale ventures for housing projects. Almost all the projects have been announced on an ad hoc basis without any relevance to current or past urban planning guidelines. This paper examines the plan-making process undertaken for KSDP 2020. It analyses the planning approach with respect to internally defined objectives, stated procedures and findings. Based on specific case studies, the paper highlights the nature of the relationship between the various projects and the existing planning attempt, which is perceived as a project by the city administration. The paper presents an overall critique of whether city planning can be applied as a project across the outlined parameters. </jats:p>",

The model has been developed for use by persons without specialised expertise. It is freely distributed and may be downloaded from the Internet. Land use data for the model have been estimated from satellite imagery. Aggregate logit models have been estimated and are used to predict the probabilities of land being converted from non-urban to residential and employment-related uses for 1609-meter grid cells. A key feature of the model is the capability to generate alternative development scenarios reflecting a range of policy choices and assumptions regarding future development, ranging from the imposition of development restrictions to changes in densities of development to different overall rates of population growth. The model and its capabilities to produce alternative scenarios have been applied in a variety of planning contexts. </jats:p>",

This paper focuses on two types of innovations—identified here as degenerative variations and integrative paradigms—to examine their impact on urban form and to discuss the implications for public policy. The paper begins with a presentation of how degenerative variations collectively generate an undesirable urban form. The paper then illustrates how integrative paradigms are conceived as a response to the problems of development of a particular period and the transformation of urban form. These paradigms are expected to nurture a collective vision and have a positive impact on urban form; however, they are undermined by the realities of development. The paper concludes with a discussion of the policy implications of innovations in urban design. </jats:p>",

Although a ‘conventional wisdom’ has developed about how to address such problems, each country has developed its own particular approach. The paper first of all provides a brief overview of the situation at the European level. The main focus of the paper, however, is on neighbourhood-based policies in Denmark, England, France, and Germany. This illustrates the broadly similar, albeit at times distinctive, approaches each country has developed particularly with regard to the neighbourhood. Finally the paper briefly considers some wider governance issues raised by these neighbourhood-based programmes. The conclusion then identifies and reflects on common themes, conceptualisations and approaches.</jats:p>",

This claimed association is, however, not supported by an evidence base, nor is there consensus on how high quality or social cohesion are defined. This paper aims to provide definitions of both concepts, calling on primary research conducted in six study sites in England. The findings show that features of quality of the built environment have varying influence on social activity. Residents' perceptions of quality of the neighbourhood and the level of maintenance and the character of the neighbourhood are positively associated with sense of community and place attachment, while density is negatively associated with social interaction and perceptions of trust. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications that the findings have for UK policy and practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The global climate is changing in ways that are likely to have a significant impact on society and the natural and built environments over the coming decades. Extreme weather events, both globally and in the UK, appear to be increasing in frequency and severity, and there is growing concern that the cost of managing them and their impacts will increase. Preparedness and resilience measures can help to mitigate impacts and associated costs to both infrastructure and to people. A new multi-institutional research programme involving 13 universities in the UK called Crew (community resilience to extreme weather) has recently started, which will develop a tool kit to support decision making and will therefore improve the capacity for resilience of local communities to the impacts of future extreme weather. The broad aim is to develop a set of web-based tools for mapping potential future extreme weather events, for assessing their impacts under a range of scenarios, and to evaluate and offer a range of potential coping measures. As part of this the project will identify existing coping measures for dealing with extreme weather events at the levels of the community, buildings and individuals. The work will assess coping measures in terms of their suitability for the climate and buildings in the UK, their effectiveness for risk reduction and technical aspects that may affect their uptake. This will therefore provide the basis for the development of more effective coping measures for the community, including households, small businesses and local policy makers. </jats:p>",

With antenatal service coverage of over 90%, the integration of prevention of MTCT (PMTCT) of HIV infection into the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) services in Tanzania, this is likely to overstretch the staff capacity and undermine the already compromised quality of health care services. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the impact of integrating and scaling‐up PMTCT of HIV infection into routine RCH services, on the magnitude of <jats:italic>staff workload</jats:italic> in RCH clinics. The study was conducted in 60 health facilities identified from five regions that had participated in the pilot phase of PMTCT implementation in the Mainland Tanzania. The a<jats:italic>verage staff workload</jats:italic> was calculated from <jats:italic>staff‐load</jats:italic> obtained from attendance records and <jats:italic>activity‐time</jats:italic> obtained by direct observation; and <jats:italic>staff‐time</jats:italic> from records that were kept at the clinic. The <jats:italic>average staff workload</jats:italic> was found to be 50.5% (8–147%) for facilities providing PMTCT of HIV infection and 37.8% (11–82%) for facilities without PMTCT services. The average <jats:italic>staff workload</jats:italic> was computed on the assumption that all clients attending various antenatal clinics received PMTCT services from trained staff only and the result revealed <jats:italic>staff workload</jats:italic> of 87.2%. This study concludes that services for PMTCT of HIV infection can easily be scaled‐up and integrated into RCH services using the already existing staff. In the wake of the human resource crisis in the health sector in developing countries, strategies to address the problem will need to go beyond numbers to address issues of staff productivity and their distribution.

It aims at reconstructing the manifold discoursive ways in which urban decline and regeneration are being interpreted. In so doing, it looks at the current issue of „urban renaissance”, which is considered by some observers as an indication of a substantial trend towards „reurbanization”. The particular statement of the paper is that related assessments are not supported by significant evidence yet. Rather, they appear as an outcome of urban discourses. Such discourses are considered a specific way of constructing the city. In this context, the paper pleas for a more theory led interpretation and cautious assessments of contemporary urban change.</jats:p>"

Corporate identity is understood largely in terms of instrumentality for enhancing competitive advantage, and corporate marketing is mostly discussed as only an execution part in representing corporate identity to the stakeholders. To address this issue, the purpose of this paper is to propose a model which explicates the strategic roles the corporate marketing manager plays in building effective corporate identity.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>The paper explores strategic management of the corporate‐identity construction process and marketing communication management of corporate‐identity representation from the perspectives of sociology, organisational psychology and corporate marketing communication, primarily based on the narrative paradigm. Detailed theoretical exploration, coupled with several conceptual propositions as well as analyses of exemplary cases, provides academic and practical implications for corporate marketing researchers and managers.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The proposed model conceptualises that the corporate marketing manager assumes three strategic roles for building effective corporate identity: narrative coordinator to manage the narrative construction process, narrative‐network weaver to manage the narrative network, and narrative co‐author to manage the external communication programmes. These roles define the strategic relationship between corporate marketing management and corporate‐identity building.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper contributes to furthering the understanding of how to use the narrative paradigm for effective corporate‐identity building, which may help enhancement of business performance.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The purpose of this paper is to shed more light on women’s views of health services by exploring their experiences of maternal and child health and family planning services in Cato Manor in KwaZulu- Natal. The findings suggest that the majority of women were unclear about the purpose of antenatal care. Most women had little or no knowledge about the required number of antenatal care visits. In addition, few women reported that they were offered a comprehensive range of contraceptive services during their visit. In most cases, they were only given information on a limited number of family planning methods. However, the majority of women expressed overall satisfaction with the services. Discontent mainly rose from the long waiting period, duration of the consultation and limited contraceptive counselling. In order to ensure sustainable improvements in women’s health increasing involvement of men is also important.</jats:p>"

Individuals are required to take distributions from their IRAs after age seventy-and-a-half, while distributions taken prior to age fifty-nine-and-a-half generally incur a ten percent penalty. Previous research has found that IRA owners rarely tapped these assets prior to retirement. This chapter updates results and shows that these patterns continue. Several factors influence the probability of withdrawal (prior to sevent-and-a-half): being younger than sixty lowers the probability of a withdrawal, but being retired, in poor health, or having a home mortgage increases the likelihood of withdrawal.</jats:p>",

Managers often must assess complex business environments, changing competitive forces, and uncertain futures, and then make significant resource allocation decisions. Traditional quantitative planning and budgeting techniques often fail to consider nonlinear relationships, discontinuities, and uncertainty. Qualitative techniques can lack rigor and perpetuate biases. Using simulation modeling technology could specifically address those concerns, but there are few if any general simulation models of integrated business processes to support strategic planning processes. Basing simulation models for enterprise planning on the REA framework, an established enterprise domain ontology, would facilitate reuse of and learning from these models in a variety of business contexts. An ontology-based planning model would allow managers to assess the consequences of alternative resource allocation decisions and determine appropriate performance indicators. To illustrate the concepts, we provide an example of how that model could be used to facilitate management planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of heterotopia was introduced and immediately abandoned by Michel Foucault in 1966–67, but it quickly diffused across human geography, urban theory, and cultural studies during the 1990s. Notwithstanding the deserved impact of Foucault's overall work on these fields, there are some conceptual problems with the heterotopia concept. While the desire for a single term to probe spatial difference is understandable, the author takes issue with the kind of space envisioned in heterotopology. From a close reading of Foucault's notes, and with the help of Deleuze, Derrida, and Althusser, it is suggested that the spatiality of Foucault's heterotopology repeats certain flaws of the structuralism in vogue in 1960s France. In order for heterotopias to be ‘absolutely different’ from ‘all the rest’ of space, Foucault needs to posit a totality to society and to perform a ‘slice of time‘. The author ends by briefly examining how the structuralist tendency of heterotopology has pervaded some recent Anglophone adoptions of Foucault. As both geography and postcolonial theory have shown, slicing time often conceals particularist suppositions and is therefore inadequate to account for the multiplicity and unevenness of geographical change. </jats:p>",

With this, it is elaborated both on the centrality of offers on basis of the dispersion factor and on the centrality of demand due to a quantitative-empirical investigation. Compared to survey conducted in 1977 certain changes concerning centrality have been turned out in the Saarland. Those changes can also be found in the current regional development plan: The interlacing fields on tier of the secondary centres are indistinct, interlacing fields on tier of the basic centres let to prove, numerous basic centres and secondary centres follow their normative function only inadequately. Due to the clear modifications of the centrality of numerous places a continuous monitoring of the centrality is suggested as an instrument of the politics deliberation.</jats:p>"

The continuous convergence of planning contents by scale make it unnecessary to have redundant plans on different levels. The technical means (GIS and Telecommunication) and the changing demands of customers connected to the internet recommend a new concept to achieve planning information. The convergence demands for standardization of terms and planning categories. This leads to clearness and transparency concerning the goals of planning, it raises the benefit from the expenses of coordination, makes plans more up to date, eases the discussion on planning goals for politicians and it helps the public to achieve and understand the plans.&#x0D;\nThe proposal ‘one space — one plan’ deals with the function of spatial planning to regulate land use. The duties of spatial development by the planning authorities are not dealt with. The observations mainly focus on the conditions of spatial planning in Lower-Saxony.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Seven communities’ EOPs were assessed to explore potential planning differences between urban and rural cities. Four urban and three rural communities were selected from the Federal Emergency Management Agency Regions V, VII, and VIII. The EOPs of the selected cities were evaluated against a comprehensive list of questions that explored pre-evacuation planning, operations, roles and responsibilities, communication, and postevacuation return. Within each category, the questions probed for the roles of public transportation in disaster situations. The results yielded several parallels between urban and rural communities in general evacuation planning, and these differences were not based on the city size. From this information, six suggested best practices were developed regarding the role of public transportation in emergency management.</jats:p>"

Strategic asset management planing is being developed as local government authorities face many challenges associated with managing the urban water cycle system. Statistical or conventional mathematical modelling approach has been found not practical for assessment of deteriorating infrastructures. Alternatively, application of fuzzy-based models is found more suitable as it links engineering judgment, experience and scarce field data of the deteriorating assets. In this study, a representative network of buried stormwater system's data is drawn and a pipe condition index is derived by linking the field data and reasoning using fuzzy approach. The inferred results are found to be useful and relevant for asset maintenance and future development programs.</jats:p>",

Next we set up a simpler constrained planning problem in which we restrict the planner to choose from a set that contains the set of equilibrium allocations in the decentralized economy. If there is a government policy that allows the decentralized economy to achieve the constrained planner's allocation, then it is the optimal policy choice. To illustrate the power of such analyses, we solve such planning problems in three monetary environments with limited communication. The upshot is that solving constrained planning problems is potentially an extremely “efficient” (easy and quick) way of deriving optimal policies for the corresponding decentralized economies.</jats:p>",

The attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001 highlighted failures in government agency coordination, while the anthrax attacks that followed and the more recent natural disasters of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 have deepened concerns that our government is unprepared for emergencies. Partially in response to the public’s concern, the federal government has encouraged Continuity of Operations (COOP) planning at the federal, state, and local government levels.Public attention, government engagement, and the promulgation of federal directives and guidance are leading to an increase in the standard of care for all public sector planning efforts, thus creating potential liabilities in the areas of COOP planning, testing, training, and maintenance. At this point, COOP planning is becoming the norm for state and local government agencies, and while the process of COOP planning may itself expose agencies to certain liabilities, there is also an increase in the potential liability for agencies that do not undertake COOP planning efforts. Further, it appears that the potential liability of agencies that do not engage in COOP planning far exceeds any liabilities incurred through the planning process.</jats:p>"

The purpose of this paper is to identify the planning policies that improve these indices and to also suggest modifications to the indices that yield more sensible policies.<jats:bold>Design/methodology/approach</jats:bold> – This paper solves the first‐best welfare problem in which the planner maximizes a development index subject to resource constraints.<jats:bold>Findings</jats:bold> – Planning strategies that maximize the HDI tend towards minimizing consumption and maximizing expenditures on education and health. Interestingly, such strategies also tend towards equitable allocations, even though inequality aversion is not modelled in the HDI. The paper shows that the GDI generates optimal plans with similar properties, and determine when the GDI and HDI generate consistent optimal plans. A problematic feature of the optimal plans is that the income component in the HDI (or GDI) does not play its intended role of securing resources for a decent standard of living. Rather, it acts to distort the allocation between health and education expenditure. The paper argues that it is better to drop income from the index. Alternatively, the paper considers net income, income net of education and health expenditures, as indicating capabilities not already reflected in the index. Finally, it compares how the modified indices and the HDI rank countries.<jats:bold>Originality/value</jats:bold> – The paper is believed to be the first to integrate development indices into national development planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Providing practical and sensible information should facilitate women with constructing a more accurate picture from which realistic hopes, fears and expectations can be formulated about impending labour. To facilitate midwives with this process, a flexible framework for a birth plan has been proposed. This easy to complete template can be used to assist childbearing women with assimilating their ambitions and desires regarding labour. Birth planning is important, since studies that compare women's expectations of childbirth with actual experience present contrasting accounts, with disappointment, guilt and failure compared with delight, pride and success. Since experiences differ it is recommended that midwives audit birth satisfaction against women's birth plans. Results would inform auditors of whether there is satisfaction with a woman's birth experience and the quality of care that she perceived she received. Women's articulated wishes about birth would facilitate understanding of why satisfaction/dissatisfaction occurs. </jats:p>",

This paper proposes a novel approach for motion planning of spatial parallel robots. The framework for the geometric modeling is based on the visibility graph methodology. It is opted for a multiple-heuristics approach, where different influences are integrated in a multiplicative way within the heuristic cost function. Since the issue of singularities is a fundamental one for parallel robots, it is emphasized on the avoidance of such configurations. To include singularity-free planning within the heuristic approach, two heuristic functions are proposed, the inverse local dexterity as well as a novel defined “next-singularity” function, in such a way, well conditioned motions can be provided by a single planning procedure. The success of the method is illustrated by some examples.</jats:p>",

A simple spreadsheet‐based tool has been developed to assist in the design of injection‐only systems for distributing emulsified oils in barriers and area treatments. This tool allows users to quickly compare the relative costs and performance of different injection alternatives and identify a design that is best suited to site‐specific conditions. Contact efficiency is estimated using results of prior numerical model simulations and dimensionless scaling factors that relate the volume of oil and water injected to treatment‐zone dimensions. Sensitivity analysis results indicate that maximum oil retention is one of the most important factors controlling system performance and cost. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

It will require a fundamental shift in the way mental health organizations provide leadership, develop strategic plans, and plan for organizational change. Toward that end, this final chapter reviews some of the key ingredients necessary for moving health promotion forward into the field of mental health practice. As Chapter 1 emphasizes, there are a variety of stakeholders (e.g., consumers, family members, providers, agency administrators, and policy makers) who have an interest in mental health system reform. This chapter is written with that audience in mind. So whether you are currently in an administrative or leadership role, thinking about being in an administrative or leadership role, or simply want to be a part of an informed change process, this chapter is for you.</jats:p>",

If, in what way and with which level of persuasive power it can actively act, depends, among other things, on the degree of attention it gets from public, parliament, government, and administration, and in a federal republic, from states, regions and communities. In addition to the attention it manages to attract, other factors also play a major role in its effectiveness, mainly democratic legitimation, but also its usefulness to other public functions. Its political status is an outcome of all relevant factors. If the status is low, spatial planning will have difficult times, if it is high, it can count on favourable conditions. Because the term has not been scientifically defined, a phenomenon has emerged that is illustrated by the history of Swiss spatial planning: its political standing must be constantly and diligently reattained.</jats:p>"

This topic has been discussed intensively since a series of major accidents occurred at several places around the world. Organizations, industries and society have been paying close attention to this issue in order to implement the correct actions for dealing with this type of problem. In Brazil, oil refineries are often located in densely populated areas whose residents are vulnerable to major accidents, particularly because of the high-risk industrial activities conducted at these facilities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The preparation of specific Emergency Response Plans for areas surrounding industrial complexes involves fast response systems, with the use of appropriate tools – such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Risk Analyses – supporting decisions that must be taken in critical situations. Consequently, regional mapping that encompasses sets of elements constituting urban environments is very important within the External Emergency Response Planning context. Additionally, modeling critical accident scenarios that affect not only assets, but also employees and neighboring communities, portrays the actual extent of the area affected by the accidents under analysis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>By deploying the GIS as tool and modeling critical accident scenarios, georeferenced data can be generated, stored and handled, in addition to presenting the potential of spatial integrated analyses. The inclusion of geoprocessing technology, which is a vital tool for this type of planning, streamlines the integration of these data with quantitative risk analyses, constituting a powerful instrument that examines the composition of critical accident scenarios and their consequences in urban areas and outlying areas around industrial complexes. The integration of these tools is essential as a decision support system for Emergency Response Planning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The use of support tools for dealing with emergency situations is a crucial step for dealing with major industrial accidents. The integrated use of these tools, specially the GIS and Risk Analyses, offers a fresh view of this issue and the science, making approaches to this type of problem more representative. Above all, it examines and quantifies analyses of urban environments around outlying industrial areas, fostering the development of integrated actions that help mitigate widespread impacts caused by industrial activities.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, migrations from cities to surrounding areas continue both in growing and shrinking cities. Interviews executed among migrants in two West and two East German regions moving from cities to the surrounding area have provided comparative regional results on household structures, mobility patterns, the process of deciding to migrate but also on later reflections upon this decision. The results also include the analysis of the financial calculation of private households. The article furthermore deals with the future framework conditions for the choice of the residence and shows strategies how to limit urban-rural migrations which might strengthen central cities as residential locations and at the same time help to reduce the traffic in metropolitan regions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Classical economic theory following Bentham and Mill assumes decision makers are completely informed, highly sensitive to differences between alternatives, and above all rational in being able to rank order the possible alternatives and choose among them on some measure of welfare (utility maximization). In recent years, this view has been successfully challenged by empirical studies of decision making, and many alternative decision rules have emerged (such as lexicographic, elimination by aspects, counting, conjunctive, heuristic additive difference, affective, take the best, and so on). Despite thirty years’ work on boundedly rational and cognitive approaches, the classical view is still widely accepted in urban travel demand modeling. This paper develops a newer conceptual framework for shopping travel situtations—namely, choice of shopping place on different kinds of tour, for different orders of goods, and for regional malls and neighborhood centers. Hypotheses concerning the use of different kinds of decision rule are generated for the different situations or contexts. A statistical design is provided for tests of these hypotheses using fieldwork, verbal protocol analysis, and low-level t-tests. Fifty-five MIT students are interviewed, and their protocols for the shopping situations recorded and analyzed. The findings are that decision rules are multiple and vary with context. Although the specific hypotheses of the paper are not strongly supported, there is overwhelming evidence of the widespread use of simple heuristics. Implications of the findings are drawn for future work in the travel demand field and the preference and choice field. In addition, the contribution of this paper to behavioral decision making is noted, through the extension of work on choice heuristics to a different field (travel demand) and the use of a fieldwork qualitative methodology. </jats:p>",

Preprogramming robots for execution of complex domestic tasks such as setting a dinner table is of little use, since the same order of subtasks may not be conceivable in the run time due to the changed state of the world. In our approach, we aim to learn the goal of the task and use a task planner to reach the goal given different initial states of the world. For some tasks, there are underlying constraints that must be fulfille, and knowing just the final goal is not sufficient. We propose two techniques for constraint identification. In the first case, the teacher can directly instruct the system about the underlying constraints. In the second case, the constraints are identified by the robot itself based on multiple observations. The constraints are then considered in the planning phase, allowing the task to be executed without violating any of them. We evaluate our work on a real robot performing pick-and-place tasks. </jats:p>",

Many researchers have considered how biased data may affect their ability to draw conclusions and examined ways to decrease bias in sampling efforts, but few have addressed the implications of not considering estimate precision. We propose a method to assess whether the number of instantaneous samples collected is sufficient to obtain precise activity budget parameter estimates. We draw on sampling theory to determine the number of observations per animal required to reach a desired bound on the error of estimation based on a stratified random sample, with individual animals acting as strata. We also discuss the optimal balance between the number of individuals sampled and the number of observations sampled per individual for a variety of sampling conditions. We present an empirical dataset on pronghorn (<jats:italic>Antilocapra americana</jats:italic>) as an example of the utility of the method. The required numbers of observation to reach precise estimates for pronghorn varied between common and rare behaviors, but precise estimates were achieved with &lt;255 observations per individual for common behaviors. The two most apparent factors affecting the required number of observations for precise estimates were the number of individuals sampled and the complexity of the activity budget. This technique takes into account variation associated with individual activity budgets and population variation in activity budget parameter estimates, and helps to ensure that estimates are precise. The method can also be used for planning future sampling efforts.</jats:p>",

Management must be based on the diagnosis of the presenting condition and the history of the previous treatment, particularly in relation to when it was completed. Most root‐filled teeth with periapical pathosis should be re‐treated in the first instance via a conventional orthograde approach since most disease is related to an infected root canal system. However, this approach to treatment should only be followed if the tooth is suitable for further restoration and when the restoration has a good long‐term prognosis. Assessment of whether a tooth is suitable for treatment may not be possible until after restorations, caries, and cracks have been removed so that the remaining tooth structure can be visualized and assessed. Periapical surgery should be reserved for teeth with persistent symptoms and/or apical radiolucency following root canal re‐treatment and where the differential diagnosis suggests an ongoing periapical condition such as a true cyst, extra‐radicular infection, or foreign body reaction which cannot be addressed via an orthograde approach. If a tooth has to be extracted, it can be replaced with one of several forms of prostheses; implant‐supported prostheses are gaining popularity and have a proven track record, especially for single tooth replacements. The use of implants should be restricted to cases where teeth are already missing or where a tooth cannot be retained because it is not suitable for further restoration due to insufficient tooth structure.</jats:p>",

Data were collected through telephone interviews with thirty-six IR staff and individuals who played important roles in the development of IRs at their respective institutions. Interviewees came not only from academic institutions where an IR had been implemented but also from those planning, pilot-testing, or having no plans to launch an IR. Regardless of the phase of IR development, interviewees consistently expressed enthusiasm for deploying IRs to provide access to and to preserve digital materials. The findings indicate that IR staff view the IR as the infrastructure for their university’s participation in the open access movement and are confident about IR’s long-term sustainability. Because branding and the scope of IRs have evolved over the years, IRs are increasingly being perceived in terms of this overarching goal or purpose, rather than as a set of specific functions, features, or services. Based on these results, it is suggested that IRs need to design value-added service models that would allow IR staff to better serve their learning communities.\n\t</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to the emerging body of literature examining the interregional income migration in the United States and offers explanations for why certain areas emerge as magnets for nonearnings income flows while other areas are losing this increasingly important source of personal income. By synthesizing ideas from contemporary understandings of life-course influences on migration and earlier work on income migration, the paper builds a theoretical model of factors shaping income migration across space and tests the model with evidence from Census 2000 by using both ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression techniques. The analysis highlights the importance of life-course understandings of migration in shaping nonearnings income flows across space. Demographic factors such as concentrations of married couples with no children combine with quality-of-life and economic variables to explain nonearnings income migration. Other factors such as housing-market costs and immigration rates shape nonearnings income flows more powerfully in certain regions than in others. The results have important policy implications. With the baby boomers on the cusp of retirement, an understanding of the geographies of nonearnings income will be important for future regional economic planning and forecasting, as these income sources will become increasingly large components of total personal income. </jats:p>",

In the wake of Hurricane Katrina and the US occupation of Iraq, contemporary media discourses on planning have downplayed this complexity and diverted attention away from a more nuanced understanding of planning as a sociological process. In this article, I show how policy and press debates regarding bureaucratic planning in Iraq and New Orleans are rooted in technocratic and rationalist perspectives, constituting a kind of modernist faith. These contemporary discourses are often one‐dimensional, failing to consider the conflicts, contradictions, and counter‐intuitive outcomes that are inherent in planning in complex situations, including urban reconstruction, military occupation, and disaster response. I show how flawed approaches in the present are deeply linked to the past, connecting Iraq and Katrina to a detailed ethnographic case study on failed urban planning in colonial Zanzibar. Even though the three cases of Iraq, Katrina, and Zanzibar differ across time, context, and conditions, they reveal that bureaucratic planning is best understood as a multidimensional strategic practice that is intrinsically shaped by sociocultural forms. Plans may ostensibly fail in one sense and yet still produce quite enduring effects. They may remain ‘fictions’ at one level but still wield real impact. And even if they are informed by fantasy, bearing little utility from a functional perspective, plans still serve as performative and persuasive acts, informed by political ends.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper follows the trials and tribulations of a loose alliance of urban conservationists seeking to create and maintain spaces for brownfield wildlife in East London. It focuses, in particular, on the construction of living roofs—an innovative conservation strategy where wildlife habitat is created on top of new and old buildings in the city. The paper identifies three obstacles that have challenged the development of brownfield conservation, which relate to the urban geographies, lively temporalities, and inconspicuous forms of brownfield wildlife and wild-living. These obstacles differ markedly from those of the nonhumans prioritised in mainstream conservation. Brownfield conservationists have developed a novel and fluid model of practice, whose emergence and characteristics can be linked to wider developments in UK nature conservation. This model chimes clearly with new approaches to theorising human-nonhuman interaction that have been developed in nonequilibrium ecology and relational geography. Drawing together these empirical and theoretical innovations, the paper concludes by outlining the parameters of a fluid biogeography of UK wildlife conservation to help understand and guide future conservation practice. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that telecommunication cannot be regarded as a means of overcoming the problems of geographical distance. We find that VC suppliers frequently syndicate investments in distant portfolio firms with partners who are more closely located. The age of the portfolio firm does not affect the importance of spatial proximity. On the whole, regional proximity is not a dominant factor in VC partnerships. </jats:p>",

Low economic status, poverty and food insecurity characterize the region. Most countries are regular food aid recipients. As the population growth rate is higher than the growth in food production, future conditions may become even worse, irrespective of the potential resources within the region. Land and water resources are quite sufficient to support food production. Only 16.8% (which is about 4% of the arable land) of the potentially irrigable land has been developed for irrigated agriculture. Drainage development is almost untouched and involves only 0.4% of the agricultural area.</jats:p><jats:p>In order to get an impression of promising options and possible constraints, with the help of the policy dialogue model PODIUM, this paper analyses the development of water management scenarios to improve food production in the region. Six sample countries – Cameroon, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa and Sudan – were considered for the analysis. Three water management scenarios were considered: focus on rainfed agriculture, focus on irrigated agriculture and a mixed scenario. The results of the analysis show that, with proper water management approaches, food security in the region is achievable. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The findings indicate that this involvement provides the next generation with crucial tacit business knowledge and skills, facilitating interpersonal work relationships between incumbents and next-generation leaders and building credibility and legitimacy for the next generation. The comparative analysis of the cases allowed us to identify the five variables that seem to combine in explaining much of the observed differences in the amount and composition of benefits experienced in the 18 firms. Our findings extend current understanding of two understudied topics in family business: the postentryphase training of the next generation and strategic management in family firms. </jats:p>",

In the last decades, urban growth and consequent environmental impacts on natural areas have been a major concern for the Portuguese land‐use planning system. Sprawl around sensitive areas has been revealed to be a persistent phenomenon in spite of the increasing challenges underlying land‐use plans. This article critically analyses the content of three main documents recently adopted by the Portuguese government – the ‘National Strategy for Sustainable Development’, the ‘National Policy Programme for Spatial Planning’ and the ‘Sector Plan for Natura 2000’ – seeking prospects to innovate future plans at lower levels in order to prevent additional pressures on natural areas. First, the article reviews the recent theoretical debate on planning for the protection of natural areas. Results evidenced by recent EU evaluation reports are used to propose a set of guidelines to evaluate planning guidance at national level. Second, it critically analyses the three planning documents, bearing in mind the main features of the planning system and the proposed guidelines. The article is concluded with a discussion of their potential, exploring whether they bring a new impetus to the role of land‐use planning against an outdated and persistent praxis, or whether, on the contrary, further efforts to strengthen planning guidance remain to be formulated.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The changing modal composition and volume of work travel in London, Birmingham, and Manchester and their resultant energy consumption implications are considered in this research. Essentially, the mechanism is to calculate the passenger km travelled by mode and then to apply mode-specific energy consumption parameters to calculate energy consumption. By classifying work-travel trips according to their travel mode and their location and orientation (within, out of, and into town) it is possible to determine where the major forces for commuting change are and, more important, assess the implications of these forces for energy consumption. Average energy intensities per person trip are not the same everywhere or for every energy-consuming mode; furthermore, the magnitude and direction of change in average energy intensities are not the same either. Many of the trends seem to be moving rapidly away from positions of energy sustainability. The data are derived from the 1981 and 2001 special workplace statistics of the Population Census for small areas, and from fuel consumption technical parameters calibrated by engineers. One important objective of the paper is to understand the relative importance for energy consumption of changing travel modes for work journeys and changing trip orientation caused by urbanisation trends. </jats:p>",

While the overall response to the census has been estimated at 94%, enumerators and their managers explain why differential undercount between social and geographical groups remained a problem. Fieldworkers subjected the census to criticism, from form design and quality checks to address-listing and management. Postal return of census forms caused unexpected difficulties for field staff and expense for the census offices. The subcontracting of various census operations and inflexible operational procedures made it difficult to find and implement timely solutions to problems that arose. A relatively high proportion of missing and inconsistent responses was expected by experienced fieldworkers and put extra burden on the editing and imputation procedures. </jats:p>",

We highlight shoppers’ selective adoption of new self-service formats in relation to certain product categories and argue that this can be explained in part by reference to the socially embedded nature of women food shoppers’ behaviours and in particular the influence of contemporary notions of the ‘good housewife‘. We support our argument by reference to a wide range of contemporary documentary material relating to postwar shopping including market research reports, the publications of local consumer groups, and selected retailer and government archive sources. </jats:p>",

This urban field can be estimated from the encroachment of built-up areas. The CORINE Land Cover database enables the measurement of the gradient values for the spatial distribution of built-up areas in European cities. Instead of the exponential or power functions, which usually provide the best fit for the distributions of population densities, we find that two linear functions strongly differentiating a central and a peripheral gradient provide the best fit for built-up surfaces. The comparison between the 1990 and 2000 CORINE images demonstrates a convergence in the trend of urban spread between Northern and Southern European cities. However, it is still difficult from the data to decide which of the models of urban field is winning: will the steeper central gradient become diluted into the less dense periphery, or are the closer fringes of the central parts becoming integrated into the ordered pattern of the urban central agglomerations? </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper draws on the emerging literature on diverse economies to analyse the everyday practices in a new type of finance organisation. Social finance organisations (SFOs), on the one hand, provide a mechanism for ‘ethical’ investors to invest money in line with their values and, on the other, provide loan finance sensitive to the needs of a variety of charities, and social enterprise and civil society organisations which have traditionally found access to finance difficult. They work through a mode of operation which emphasises partnership, reconnection, and association between stakeholders. Furthermore, social finance practitioners have developed a series of negotiation strategies for balancing social concerns with financial ones. The paper argues that there remain few analyses from inside organisations trying to practise economic relations differently. It demonstrates how theoretical debates on economic–social relationships are expressed on a day-to-day basis. The paper develops the concept of a sociofinancial narrative to highlight how social and financial organisational logics are hybridised within SFOs. This leads to a discussion on the integration of ethics into economic practice, in the context of neoliberalism as well as the entanglement of analysing alternatives through an ethnographic lens. </jats:p>",

It was also verified that the enterprise will be front to expressive risk of shortage of water in the month of April, what doesn't happen for the cropping pattern obtained by the minimization of the irrigation requirement in the months of April in the four years. The scenario analysis indicated that the sale price of the passion fruit crop exercises expressive influence on the financial performance of the enterprise.

As such, the paper explores the diverse behavior of retailers with respect to the adoption of e-commerce. In particular, it empirically examines the extent to which the adoption of Internet strategies is affected by firm-specific features (eg habit of entrepreneur, routines of firms), network relationships, and geographical proximity. Logistic regression analyses of 643 independent retailers in the Netherlands suggest that geography matters, when other factors are controlled for. That is, the probability of having an Internet strategy increases significantly (a) when more relevant knowledge is locally available; (b) the more demanding local customers are; and (c) the less rivalry is present locally. </jats:p>",

Because of growing number of uncertain parameters in the environment and lack of information about the future, the strategic choice has become very complex and critical. One of the popular tools for solving the problem is scenario analysis. In this paper based on fuzzy clustering we propose a method for building, analyzing and ranking the possible scenarios. To cope with the issue of uncertain parameters of the environment in strategic planning, we use the concept of fuzzy set theory to enhance the proposed method. Finally the performance of the proposed method is illustrated in a strategic planning case in a pharmaceutical company.</jats:p>"

Results indicated adequate to strong internal consistency reliability for the strivings appraisal scale scores, and the pattern of correlations support the convergent and discriminant validity for scores obtained using this approach.

Action planning and coping planning are two self‐regulatory strategies that may help bridge the gap between intentions and behaviour. Action planning comprises the when, where and how of implementing a behaviour. Coping planning involves the anticipation of barriers and ways to overcome them. The study examines whether the inclusion of these two planning constructs would improve the overall prediction of physical activity. The main research question is which kind of planning would be beneficial for the initiation of behaviour and which one for its maintenance. Moreover, it is examined whether intentions moderate the planning–behaviour relationship.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods</jats:bold> A 5‐week longitudinal on‐line study was conducted with 354 participants. Differences in prediction patterns between formerly active and formerly inactive individuals were compared using multigroup structural equation modelling. Moderating effects of intentions were tested by means of latent interactions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results</jats:bold> Inclusion of the two planning factors accounted for substantially more behaviour variance than intention alone did. Coping planning mediated the intention–behaviour relationship only in formerly active, but not in formerly inactive participants. Moreover, intentions moderated the effects of both types of planning on behaviour.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold> Action planning appears to predict behaviour only when intentions are high. For actors, coping planning represents a critical self‐regulation strategy to maintain their physical activity levels.</jats:p>",

This paper, presented in two parts, deals with the development, application and tests of a methodology and of a computational modeling tool to support planning of irrigated agriculture activities. Part I aimed at the development and application, including sensitivity analysis, of a multiyear linear programming model to optimize the financial return and water use, at farm level for Jaíba irrigation scheme, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, using data on crop irrigation requirement and yield, obtained from previous simulation with MCID model. The linear programming model outputted a crop pattern to which a maximum total net present value of R$ 372,723.00 for the four years period, was obtained. Constraints on monthly water availability, labor, land and production were critical in the optimal solution. In relation to the water use optimization, it was verified that an expressive reductions on the irrigation requirements may be achieved by small reductions on the maximum total net present value.</jats:p>",

Many strict constraints are imposed on this type of problem. To solve these strict‐constraint problems, a selfish constraint satisfaction genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed. In this GA, each gene of an individual satisfies only its constraint selfishly, disregarding the constraints of other genes in the same individuals. Moreover, a constraint prechecking method is also applied to improve the GA convergence speed. The experimental result shows the proposed method can obtain an accurate solution in a practical response time. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Co‐digestion changes slurry characteristics and is supposed to increase short‐term nitrogen (N) uptake by crops after application. A higher N uptake from slurry reduces the need for additional mineral N fertilizer. If farmers apply co‐digested slurry (CS), a higher N recovery has to be taken into account to prevent losses to the environment. Since data on the effects of co‐digestion on N recovery by crops are scarce, a pot experiment was performed. The apparent N recovery (ANR) of five different co‐digested pig slurries was compared with their raw source slurries (RS) during 105 d after a single fertilization of ryegrass (<jats:italic>Lolium perenne</jats:italic> L.), grown under controlled conditions. Slurry was mixed with sandy soil and grass was cut every 35 d. The results show that co‐digestion increased (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) the ANR at first cut on average from 39 to 50%, at second cut from 7 to 9% (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05), and had no effect on ANR at third cut (3%). The ANR increase at first cut was likely due to an increase of the NH<jats:sub>4</jats:sub>–N/total N ratio along with a decrease of the organic C/total N ratio of slurry during co‐digestion. Field application may under certain circumstances decrease N fertilizer value of CS, due to a higher NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> emission compared to RS. A potential ANR increase may then be reduced, absent, or even become a decrease. Under comparable NH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> emissions, however, CS can in the short term be more valuable as an N fertilizer than RS, and fertilizer savings can likely be realized.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to solve this problem. Firstly, we parameterize the joint trajectory using polynomial functions, and then normalize the parameterized trajectory. Secondly, the Cartesian path planning is transformed to an optimization problem by integrating the differential kinematic equations. The object function is defined according to the accuracy requirement, and it is the function of the parameters to be defined. Finally, we use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to search the unknown parameters. The approach has the following traits: 1) The limits on joint angles, rates and accelerations are included in the planning algorithm; 2) There exist not any kinematic and dynamic singularities, since only the direct kinematic equations are used; 3) The attitude singularities do not exist, for the orientation is represented by quaternion; 4) The optimization algorithm is not affected by the initial parameters. Simulation results verify the proposed method. </jats:p>",

The Scottish population of London and the South East is falling and this despite Scots enjoying continued occupational success within the South East labour market. The authors ask why Scots are leaving the UK's main escalator region and then investigate how these migration changes can best be theorised relative to literature on the mobility of the ‘new service class‘. Building on Fielding's escalator region hypothesis, the authors report on recent research on longer distance flows out of the UK's main escalator region. They advance the critique of the escalator region hypothesis set out by Findlay et al and ask why people would leave a global city offering good opportunities for occupational mobility. Demographic regime change provides only a partial answer. Other explanations can be found in the changing mobilities of the new service class as they engage in what Smith has defined as ‘translocal’ and ‘transnational’ urbanism. The authors argue that Scotland's changing relationship with London and the South East may be representative of a wider set of changes in migration linkages between regional economies and global cities. </jats:p>",

These changes in personal orientations are viewed against the backdrop of structural changes that have accompanied capitalist reforms and contribute to a climate of insecurity characterized by weakening social supports and the threat of unemployment. The article explains how conflicts between cultural values that prioritize family and the neoliberal values that have reshaped the workplace actually constrain choices and lead Polish citizens to make plans for the future and life choices that contribute to declining birthrates in Poland.</jats:p>",

The maintenance costs are increasing while the financial resources of municipalities remain limited. Water distribution system (WDS) managers therefore need tools to assist them in the elaboration of pipe renewal management plans. In this article, results of a newly developed strategy for pipe renewal based on a cost function are presented. The strategy allows the minimization of a cost function while also considering hydraulic criterion. This strategy was tested on a short planning horizon of five years. The pipe number to be replaced and the optimal moment for renewal are identified using three different optimization techniques: IGA (Island Genetic Algorithm), NPGA‐2 (Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm 2), and NSGA‐II (Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm‐II). The proposed approach has five distinctive features: (1) it is coupled with a flexible evolutionary framework that allows the user to select any type of operator for IGA or any kind of multiobjective genetic algorithm; (2) it uses the hydraulic simulator Epanet2.0 which allows steady state or dynamic simulations; (3) it considers a probabilistic break model to evaluate the structural deterioration of pipes; (4) it integrates a Bayesian approach for the estimation of the pipe break model parameters that take into account the influence of inherent uncertainties related to the quality of data during the decision‐making process; and (5) it simulates the variation of the pipe's roughness over the years. The developed strategy/model is explained using an example that allows us to elucidate its most important components. Simulation experiments on a small network (100 pipes) are presented. A comparison of three evolutionary algorithm results is provided. Tests showed that IGA performs well, but for networks of larger sizes, we recommend increasing the number of demes to reach better solutions. Higher quality results were achieved with NSGA‐II than NPGA‐2 on differently sized networks. We recommend the use the NSGA‐II to optimize large WDS. Future developments for this strategy are also discussed.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Research has shown that the DHS currently lacks national standards for the review and maintenance of emergency plans, the frequency of emergency drills, and the review of results from such drills. This policy proposes the standardization of emergency exercises and the creation of the cycle of emergency planning (CEP), with DHS funding contingent on implementation of these national standards. This article addresses how the implementation of the CEP would provide a method for testing, revising, and maintaining emergency preparedness through review, exercises, and revision. Holding emergency exercises every two years and reviewing their results would help keep plans current and grounded in feasibility. Reviews of emergency plans and capabilities, conducted every five years by a third party, would help maintain objectivity. These exercises and reviews should be used to update and maintain emergency plans as part of the CEP. Enforcing these new standards would remedy the failures in the current emergency preparedness system and improve the general safety and security of the nation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We compare an inverse‐planning intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) technique with three previously published forward‐planning dynamic arc therapy techniques and a newly implemented technique for treatment of prostate only. The three previously published dynamic arc techniques are dynamic arc therapy (DAT), two‐axis dynamic arc therapy (2A‐DAT), and modified dynamic arc therapy (M‐DAT). The newly implemented technique is the bilateral wedged dynamic arc (BW‐DAT). In all dynamic arcs, the multileaf collimator is moving during rotation to fit the prostate, except that, in 2A‐DAT, it is fitting two separate symmetrical rhombi including the prostate. The rectum is shielded during rotation only in the cases of M‐DAT and BW‐DAT.</jats:p><jats:p>The results obtained indicate that the BW‐DAT, M‐DAT, and DAT techniques provide the intended dose coverage of the prescribed dose to the planning target volume (PTV)—that is, 95% of the PTV is covered by 100% of the dose. The maximum dose to a 3‐cm margin of healthy tissue that surrounds the PTV is lower by 2.5% in the case of IMRT than in both BW‐DAT and M‐DAT, but it is lower by 5.0% than that in both DAT and 2A‐DAT. The maximum dose to the rest of the healthy tissue in the case of BW‐DAT is <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20037-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20037:acm20037-math-0001\" />.

Also, this dose is much lower than the accepted maximum dose (52 Gy) to the femoral heads and necks according to Report 62 from the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements.

We found that fewer than 6.5% of the pixels in the dose distributions of the scanned and calculated area of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20037-math-0033.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20037:acm20037-math-0033\" /> cm failed the acceptance criteria.</jats:p><jats:p>We conclude that, in addition to simplicity of the dose calculation, the BW‐DAT technique provides the intended concave dose distribution for treatment of the prostate only. Compared with IMRT, it produces better dose protection to the most of the rectum volume and to the healthy tissue outside the treatment volume. Also, as compared with the other forward planning dynamic arc techniques, it gives the most favorable isodose distributions to the prostate and rectum.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

A sandtable is a representation of the mission area using the earth, sticks, rocks and anything else available. Team Mission Assistant-Tactical/Exercise (TeamMATE) was created to allow leaders to plan, rehearse, execute, and have an after action review on an electronic platform. This in turn would support efficient planning and review of a mission on all levels of the leader and subordinate chain-of-command. Through the design process of conceptualizing the design space, prototyping, and empirical data gathering we were able to provide design solutions to better support the end users of TeamMATE. Design approaches and limitations will be discussed throughout the paper. </jats:p>",

This implies that probabilities of failure can be updated in a consistent way when new information (from inspections and repairs) becomes available. The Bayesian approach and a no-crack detection assumption imply that the inspection time intervals usually become longer and longer with time. For ageing platforms several small cracks should be expected to be observed according to the bath-tub curve development often assumed – implying an increased risk for crack initiation (and coalescence of small cracks) and increased crack growth. This should imply shorter inspection time intervals for ageing structures. Different approaches for updating inspection plans for older installations are proposed. The most promising method consists of increasing the rate of crack initiations at the end of the expected lifetime – corresponding to a bath-tub hazard rate effect. The approach illustrated is for welded steel details in platforms. Systems effects are considered, including the use of dependence between inspection and failure events in different components for inspection planning. </jats:p>",

To improve the efficiency of QA, electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) can be used. The major objective of the present work was to use a commercial treatment planning system to model EPID response for the purpose of pre‐treatment IMRT dose verification.</jats:p><jats:p>Images were acquired with an amorphous silicon flat panel portal imager (aS500: Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) directly irradiated with a 6‐MV photon beam from a Clinac 21EX linear accelerator (Varian Medical Systems). Portal images were acquired for a variety of rectangular fields, from which profiles and relative output factors were extracted. A dedicated machine model was created using the physics tools of the Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (Philips Medical Systems, Madison, WI) treatment planning system to model the data. Starting with the known photon spectrum and assuming an effective depth of 7 cm, machine model parameters were adjusted to best fit measured profile and output factors. The machine parameters of a second model, which assumed a 0.8 MeV monoenergetic photon spectrum and an effective depth in water of 3 cm, were also optimized. The second EPID machine model was used to calculate planar dose maps of simple geometric IMRT fields as well as a 9‐field IMRT plan developed for clinical trials credentialing purposes.</jats:p><jats:p>The choice of energy and depth for an EPID machine model influenced the best achievable fit of the optimized machine model to the measured data. When both energy and depth were reduced by a significant amount, a better overall fit was achieved. In either case, the secondary source size and strength could be adjusted to give reasonable agreement with measured data. The gamma evaluation method was used to compare planar dose maps calculated using the second EPID machine model with the EPID images of small IMRT fields. In each case, more than 95% of points fell within 3% of the maximum dose or 3 mm distance to agreement. These results are slightly poorer than those obtained using an ion chamber array, which confirms agreement to within 2% of the maximum dose or 2 mm distance to agreement for all points within these fields.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.55Qr, 87.56.Fc</jats:p>",

No significant differences were found for the majority of objective training measures analyzed, but there was a marginally significant advantage for the GFP system in terms of number of clearances successfully input within a specified time limit. Other significant differences in objective measures showed some advantages for GFP and some advantages for MCDU.

The rectal contours were manually outlined on the pCT. A narrow band with the outlined contour as its interior surface was then constructed, so that we can exclude the volume inside the rectum in the registration process. The corresponding contour in the CBCT was found by using a feature‐based registration algorithm, which consists of two steps: (1) automatically searching for control points in the pCT and CBCT based on the features of the surrounding tissue and matching the homologous control points using the scale invariance feature transformation; and (2) using the control points for a thin plate spline transformation to warp the narrow band and mapping the corresponding contours from pCT to CBCT. The proposed contour propagation technique is applied to digital phantoms and clinical cases and, in all cases, the contour mapping results are found to be clinically acceptable. For clinical cases, the method yielded satisfactory results even when there were significant rectal content changes between the pCT and CBCT scans. As a consequence, the accordance between the rectal volumes after deformable registration and the manually segmented rectum was found to be more than 90%. The proposed technique provides a powerful tool for adaptive radiotherapy of prostate, rectal, and gynecological cancers in the future.</jats:p>",

D. 2009. Systematic conservation planning in the Mediterranean: a flexible tool for the identification of no-take marine protected areas. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 66: 137–146. We propose the use of systematic conservation planning in the Mediterranean context for the identification of no-take marine protected areas (NTMPAs). We suggest a logical framework that should be used for the identification of areas to be targeted for multispecies, spatially explicit conservation actions. Specifically, we propose seven steps: (i) definition of the study area; (ii) selection of the species or habitats to be considered; (iii) definition of the planning units; (iv) measurement of the fishing effort; (v) definition of the conservation targets; (vi) review of the existing conservation areas; (vii) selection of additional NTMPAs. Moreover, we consider the potential impact of different conservation plans on existing fishing vessels. A working example is presented, focusing on a limited number of species and on a limited study area. This framework can be easily expanded to include datasets of different origin and to accommodate larger spatial scales. Such a process involves major data-collection and capacity-building elements, and conservation of productive commercial fisheries must be a priority.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an extension and application of a recent developed multiple objective evolutionary algorithm to solve design allocation problems commonly found in the power systems area. The evolutionary algorithm introduced is called MOMS-GA, a multiobjective genetic algorithm developed to solve multistate design allocation problems. MOMS-GA works under the assumption that both the system and its components can experience more than two possible states of performance. MOMS-GA uses the universal moment generating function (UMGF) approach to evaluate the different reliability indices of the system. Therefore, system availability is represented by a multistate availability function which extends the traditional binary state availability. Three different design allocation problems commonly found in power systems planning are solved to show the performance of the algorithm. The multiobjective formulation considered in the first two examples corresponds to the maximization of system availability, minimization of system investment cost, and maximization of expected system capacity. In the third example the multiobjective formulation seeks to maximize system availability, minimize system investment cost, and minimize expected unsupplied demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Two soil–water balance models were tested by a comparison of simulated with measured daily rates of actual evapotranspiration, soil water storage, groundwater recharge, and capillary rise. These rates were obtained from twelve weighable lysimeters with three different soils and two different lower boundary conditions for the time period from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 1998. In that period, grass vegetation was grown on all lysimeters. These lysimeters are located in Berlin‐Dahlem, Germany. One model calculated the soil water balance using the Richards equation. The other one used a capacitance approach. Both models used the same modified Penman formula for the estimation of potential evapotranspiration and the same simple empirical vegetation model for the calculation of transpiration, interception, and evaporation. The comparisons of simulated with measured model outputs were analyzed using the modeling‐efficiency index <jats:italic>IA</jats:italic> and the root mean squared error RMSE. At some lysimeters, the uncalibrated application of both models led to an underestimation of cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, despite a good simulation quality in terms of <jats:italic>IA</jats:italic> and RMSE. A calibration of soil‐hydraulic and vegetation parameters such as maximum rooting depth resulted in a better fit between simulated and observed cumulative and annual rates of groundwater recharge and capillary rise, but in some cases also decreased the simulation quality of both models in terms of <jats:italic>IA</jats:italic> and RMSE. The results of this calibration indicated that, in addition to a precise determination of the soil water‐retention functions, vegetation parameters such as rooting depth should also be observed. Without such information, the rooting depth is a calibration parameter. However, in some cases, the uncalibrated application of both models also led to an acceptable fit between measured and simulated model outputs.</jats:p>",

Les diferències entre el que és rural i el que és urbà no són avui dràstiques ni radicals, sinó que es difuminen al llarg del territori. El periurbà s’estén en un espai de transició on se superposen diverses franges que van d’una ruralitat més gran a una de més reduïda en funció de la distància que hi ha de la ciutat central. En aquest entorn, dur a terme una activitat agrària de qualitat és cada vegada més difícil. Per això, a la Regió Metropolitana de Barcelona, s’hi ha plantejat la preservació dels espais agraris i el desenvolupament de les explotacions agrícoles amb projectes com ara el del Parc Agrari del Baix Llobregat. A l’Àrea Urbana de Tolosa, la situació és semblant, però l’entramat institucional i associatiu garanteix el manteniment de l’agricultura periurbana i no cal bastir mesures de planejament extraordinàries.</jats:p>"
