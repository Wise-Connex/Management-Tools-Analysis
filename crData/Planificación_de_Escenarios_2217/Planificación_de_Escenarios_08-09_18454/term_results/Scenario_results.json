One of the popular tools for solving the problem is scenario analysis. In this paper based on fuzzy clustering we propose a method for building, analyzing and ranking the possible scenarios. To cope with the issue of uncertain parameters of the environment in strategic planning, we use the concept of fuzzy set theory to enhance the proposed method.

It describes a scenario workshop that was used to engage senior policy actors in our research project on the precautionary principle in relation to genetically modified crops. The workshop highlighted some of the difficulties faced by qualitative researchers in attempts to provide evidence for senior policy makers. Nevertheless, we conclude that engaging policy makers within the research process in this way allows researchers scope to explain more about the nature of the evidence being produced and how it may be useful. The dialogue encouraged by more active engagement of potential end-users increases the likelihood of producing grounded `evidence' that they will find relevant. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research developed an empirical approach for characterizing user mental models in multitasking scenarios in virtual reality (VR). Participants were required to attend to and detect different types of perceptual events occurring randomly in time in a virtual locomotion environment (VLE) simulation while carrying on physical activity (walking on a treadmill). Three different forms of mental models for performing the perceptual task were hypothesized and expected response patterns for situation awareness (SA), task performance measures and mental workload ratings were compared with observed data. Results demonstrated the SA and task measures to be useful for identifying the occurrence of different mental models and to reveal response patterns in-line with hypotheses. However, in the multitasking scenario, the process of developing SA appeared to be substantially influenced by the physical and cognitive task demands; thus, the progressive development of highly accurate mental models of event distributions appeared to be restricted. Possible applications of the results of this study include development of training programs for mobile, visual inspection tasks, such as airport roving security patrols, for accurate mental model development and promoting detection of critical events. </jats:p>",

The context for the research was air traffic control as it provided a useful, applied stimulus that involved correct or incorrect responses. Participants were tasked with learning to recognize when aircraft, displayed on a simulated air traffic control display, would be likely to be involved in a conflict in the absence of change in altitude or track. The results indicated that the generalization of training outcomes to novel stimuli was least accurate when exemplars were provided in the absence of augmented cue or production-based information.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Advances in modern day technology are rapidly increasing the ability of engineers to automate ever more complicated tasks. Often these automated aids are paired with human operators who can supervise their work to ensure that it is free of errors and to even take control of the system if it malfunctions (e.g., pilots supervising an autopilot feature). The goal of this collaboration, between humans and machines, is that it can enhance performance beyond what would be possible by either alone. Arguably the success of this partnership depends in part upon attributions an operator develops that help guide their interaction with the automation. One particular factor that has been shown to guide operator reliance on an automated ‘teammate’ is trust. The following study examined 140 participants performing a simulated search-and-rescue task. The goal of this experiment was to examine the relationship between automated agent's reliability, operator trust, operator reliance, and performance scores. Results indicated that greater automation reliability is positively correlated with greater user reliance ( r = .66), perceived trust ( r = .21), and performance scores ( r = .34). These results indicate that more reliable aids are rated as significantly higher in terms of perceived trust and relied upon more than less reliable aids. Additionally, the size of the effect is much larger for operator behaviors (i.e., reliance) compared to more subjective measures (i.e., self-reported trust). </jats:p>",
