Thus, despite the sharp growth rate during the second quarter of 1983, the recovery is likely to be relatively moderate. The outlook for 1984 and beyond depends principally on interest rates—any significant rebound in rates above present levels would likely slow or stop the recovery within six months despite the fact that most of the other underlying forces remain favorable for continued recovery. In my judgment, preventing higher interest rates, and in fact, encouraging somewhat lower rates, will require further adjustments in the administration's policy mix. This should include additional expenditure cuts and tax increases designed to reduce future deficits as well as a continued accommodative monetary policy.</jats:p>",

Due to the meteorological conditions, the acoustic impedance of ground and various wave propagation phenomena, the attenuation of sound level propagated from source to receiver, has been calculated [G. J. Ruijgrok, J. Sound Vib. 72(4), 469–479 (1980)]. Also, during the temperature lapse and inversion, the boundaries of upwind zone and downwind zone (acoustic shadow and light zones) have been determined [F. M. Wiener and D. N. Keast, J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 31, 724–733 (1959)]. Accordingly, the residential areas have been established within the boundary of shadow zone in which sound is not absorbed, while the light zone has been used for certain purposes. Further, the heights of residential buildings in the shadow zone have been found according to the rays of sound waves which propagate respectively upward and downward during the temperature lapse and inversion; this will aid architects in design layout and in decision concerning the exterior construction of buildings.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Summary. A number of writers have pointed out that the word 'planning' is used so loosely that it can describe almost any approach to policy-making or decision-making. This paper asks whether it is in fact possible to identify planning as an analytically distinct method of informing and making public policies and decisions. (Clearly, it will not be empirically distinct, since in practice, policies and decisions will also reflect the influence of other 'methods', such as relying upon the market, or upon the ballot box). To permit the examination of this question, four such analytically distinct methods of decision-making, of which planning is one, are each set out in ideal-type form. Planning, since it is less readily comprehended, is set out in more detail than are the other three. This is done by breaking it down into its most characteristic 'constituent ideas'. Examination of these 'constituent ideas' of planning thought suggests that they fall into two groups. Firstly, we can distinguish a collection of ideas, each of which has intellectual credibility, but none of which seems logically or empirically to be the prerogative of planning; any policy-making, planned or unplanned, would seem able to make use of them. Secondly we can distinguish among the 'constituent ideas' of planning thought a group which are not intellectually credible, since their meaning is unclear. It is therefore concluded that planning cannot be an analytically distinct method of informing and making public policies and decisions. </jats:p>",

The system has simple properties with respect to aggregation and turnover, yet incorporates spatial competition, adjacency, and effects of geographic shadowing. The objective function satisfied by the model reduces congestion and minimizes the per capita work; solves a quadratic transportation-problem and fulfils in-sum and out-sum constraints. The associated Lagrangians can be interpreted as pushes and pulls, or as shadow prices. A spatially continuous version of the model consists of coupled elliptical partial differential equations with Neumann boundary conditions, solvable by numerical methods. With migration data from the United States of America the model yields an amazingly good fit, better than existing models and with fewer free parameters. Inversion of the model yields an estimate of distances between regions. In-movement rates are predicted from out-movement rates in the model. </jats:p>",

A level of conformity in lending behaviour is identified, which it is argued results from a number of constraints that arise from the environment in which lending decisions are made. It is further argued, however, that considerable variation in lending behaviour is also apparent and is made possible by the practice of charging interest rates which are lower than the market clearing rate. The first part of the paper expands on these arguments and develops a model of managerial lending behaviour. The paper then continues with an examination of successful mortgage applicants in a sample of building society branch offices and attempts to show what statistical evidence there is for the pattern of variation and constraints described at the inter- and intrasociety levels. </jats:p>",

The trip distributions are elliptical, being expressed as bivariate normal distributions. The parameters of these distributions are shown to be related to the parameters of an assumed density function for activity sites (such as jobs and shops) and to travel speeds. The model implies a housing density function in a monocentric urban area which is negative exponential. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The forces that affect growth, location, and distribution in the service sector will have elements in common with those at work in manufacturing, but equally will exhibit certain unique features. This paper examines such forces in the specific context of location choices made by offices of multinational enterprises (MNEs). Such enterprises emerge in response to particular market imperfections and to exploit particular ‘ownership specific’ advantages. The nature of such ownership specific advantages is discussed with specific reference to MNE office location, and tested using data drawn from a survey of European offices of mainly US-based MNEs. It is shown that a distinction must be drawn between offices that provide a service for final consumption and those that provide a mainly coordinating role. The former types of office are shown to be heavily market oriented and to act in ways consistent with theory. The latter types of office are more complex, but again locate in ways consistent with theory; in particular they are influenced more by accessibility and by environment than by cost and geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Successful implementation of a corporate strategic plan requires the support of all individuals in the organization, some of whom play different, and possibly conflicting, roles. Cohesiveness within groups that favor different sides of an issue was examined to determine its effect on attitude polarization. The findings suggest that cohesiveness can result in greater polarization, thereby impeding the successful implementation of the strategic plan. The study findings also afford insight into the attitude polarization process brought about by group interaction. The social comparison and persuasive-arguments theories, which make different predictions about this process, are not necessarily competing as has been previously suggested. The results suggest that the relative validity of the explanation offered by each theory is determined by the environment in which interaction between groups occurs. Specifically, when group cohesiveness was enhanced, information was not transmitted effectively as predicted by the persuasive-arguments theory. However, when the value of group membership was de-emphasized, an effective transmission of information occurred during intergroup discussions. </jats:p>",
