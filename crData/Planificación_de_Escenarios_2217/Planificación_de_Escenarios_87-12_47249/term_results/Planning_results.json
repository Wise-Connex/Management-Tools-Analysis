The distinctions summarised in Table I are important in their implications for the POE techniques to be used, and for the form of information that emerges. This article is about conducting a planning workshop, the technique recommended for the upgrading type of POE, whether of the problem‐solving or of the planned improvement type. The third article will deal with methods more appropriate to the planning type of POE.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A broad outline of the main elements of the Norwegian local tax system is first given. This is followed by a discussion of some of the changes that have taken place in the relative distribution of various sources of local revenue since the mid-seventies. It is shown that although local government's share of total national income tax revenues has increased over recent years, such taxes have decreased as a proportion of total local revenues. This relative decline in the importance of local income taxes has been compensated, in particular, by increases in state grants. Thus, whereas in 1977 taxes accounted for 53% of total local current revenues, by 1982 this proportion had dropped to 47%. Over the same period, central government grants increased from 31% to 35% of current revenues. It is also shown that fees and charges are becoming increasingly important as sources of local revenues. </jats:p><jats:p> These relative changes in the composition of local revenues have not been uniform across all municipalities. Whereas the larger cities were subject to real cutbacks in tax revenues, taxes continued to increase in the smallest and most peripheral municipalities, despite a government decision in 1978 to lower the maximum local tax rate. Overall, it is suggested that the long-term effect of the policy of central government, as regards local revenues, has been to bring about a rather massive redistribution of revenues, solely benefitting the smallest and already the most well-off municipalities. </jats:p>",

In government planning, systems are introduced to increase task interdependencies, create common purposes and establish performance monitoring. Such a system forces the organizational units concerned to confront their differences. This is because planning systems change task interdependence from pooled to reciprocal. This change means that the differences between organizational units in terms of values, status, organizational processes and power are brought into the open. As a result conflict occurs, not so much because planning in uSis context represented an organizational change, but because reciprocal interdependence is inherently conflictual.</jats:p><jats:p>This case shows that the planning systems are about both policy‐making and organizational structure and processes. Changes in ways of making policy are changes in organizational operation. Outcomes such as incrementalism and political behaviour are derived from the pre‐existing pattern of organizational differentiation and the way in which an innovative technical system, in this case integrated resource planning, interacts with that differentiation by changing task interdependence between resource agencies.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire: </jats:bold> Cet article traite de la mise sur pied et du mode de fonctionnement d'un service intégré de planification des ressources au ministére de l'Énergie et des Res‐sources naturelles de l'Alberta entre 1976‐86. Les gouvernements conçoivent des systémes de planification pour accroître l'interdépendance des tâches, fixer des objec‐tifs communs et surveiller le rendement. Un systéme de ce genre fait ressortir les divergences qui existent entre les unités organisationnelles car l'interdépendance des tâches y est réciproque au lieu d'y être collective. Ceci met en lumiére les différences qui opposent les unités organisationnelles sur le plan de leurs valeurs, de leur statut, de leurs procédés organisationnels et de leurs pouvoirs. Il en découle un conflit, non pas tant parce que dans ce contexte la planification représente un changement organisational, mais parce que l'interdépendance réciproque est conflictuelle par essence.</jats:p><jats:p>L'étude démontre que les systémes de planification touchent à la fois l'élaboration des politiques, la structure et les procécdés organisationnels. Modifier la façon d'élaborer les politiques débouche sur un changement du fonctionnement organisationnel. La comportimentation et le comportement politique qui en résultent proviennent du modéle organisationnel pré‐existant, des divergences qu'il comporte et de la maniére dont un systéme technique novateur, en l'occurrence la planification intégrée des ressources, répose sur ces divergences pour modifier l'interdépendance des tâches entre les organismes ressources.</jats:p>",

I argue that it is difficult to derive policy-relevant normative propositions about federal financial relations, but that it is possible to suggest means by which one could improve the efficiency of policy decisions. There is a review of the discussion of the Buchanan and Scott contributions of the 1950s and 1960s, and it is concluded that it is easier to discover significant questions than agreed answers. Practical considerations of geography, regional economy, and administrative separation of powers are then introduced. The argument is that the normative economic definition of equity and efficiency may have little relevance to the practical policy-question of forming and maintaining a federation. I conclude with a proposal for linking the attempt to solve questions of regional and national policy through a network of committees—one for each of the following areas: budget coordination, regional equalization, common standards, stabilization, and economic growth. </jats:p>",

The nutritional constraints specify that the amount available of each nutrient for human consumption should meet or exceed some prechosen nutrient requirement level. However, fixed nutrient requirement levels are difficult to prespecify. In this paper, a bicriteria mathematical programming model is proposed which does not require planners to prespecify nutrient requirement levels for several key nutrients. Instead, the model generates an entire set of efficient nutrition plans which supply various amounts of these nutrients. To demonstrate the use and potential benefits of this model, an illustrative application to Colombia, South America is included. </jats:p>",

A minimum cost mixed integer programming model was developed to determine the airfield locations, the number of types of aircraft, and the flight plans to best conduct the spray operation.

I emphasize the predicament of civilians who are subject to direct and deliberate armed assaults. Particular attention is given to enforced uprooting or removals of population, and to annihilation of urban places with weapons of mass destruction. Two case histories are explored, both taken from the last months of the Second World War. They are, the expulsion of German civilians from Eastern Europe, and the firebombing of Japanese cities, especially Tokyo. Damages and casualties are detailed. However, the main concern is to establish the composition, plight, and responses of civilian populations, and this includes their relation to national war efforts. It is concluded that the vast majority, because of gender, age, health, occupation, and class, were essentially marginal to, and little involved in, the war efforts of their respective states. This contrasts sharply with the assumptions or rhetoric of the theory of ‘total war’, and the practice of targetting civilians and nonmilitary areas. It is suggested that the majority of home populations remain civilians in the fullest sense of the term, even in wartime. From this it follows that assaults upon them by military forces are primarily strategies of terror, and that the ‘social space’ attacked is essentially civilian. Such uprootings and mass destruction of human settlements have, however, become an ever larger part of the war strategies, and the history of warfare, of most powers since 1945. </jats:p>",

As these schemes use waste heat from electricity generation, the power station associated with them must, for reasons of efficiency, be near to a region where the heat usage per unit area (heat-load density) is high. </jats:p><jats:p> To plan CHP schemes, the heat-load density of urban areas needs to be mapped and monitored. To calculate heat-load density for residential areas workers have conventionally multiplied the number of dwellings per unit area by the average heat-load per dwelling. This is time-consuming and must be repeated in full, for each resurvey. In this paper the use of remotely sensed data from the Landsat Multispectral Scanning System (MSS) to estimate heat-load density is proposed. A survey using these data for the City of Sheffield was faster and no less accurate than a survey performed by conventional means. However, Landsat MSS data were unable to discriminate between more than four classes of heat-load density, a level of discrimination that may be increased if Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) data were to be used in future surveys of this kind. </jats:p>",

Until the mid-1960s, the rate of profit was stable or rising, but since then it has fallen. In the first half of the period under consideration, the market strength of the food and beverage industry offset the negative effects of changes within the industry; in the second half of the period, however, the food and beverage industry has suffered as its price per unit of value of output has fallen (but changes within the industry have been negligible). Within the industry the following changes have occurred: turnover times have fallen; the value of labour power (and so the rate of exploitation) has been virtually constant; the technical composition of capital has risen, but only slowly since 1965; until 1965, the main contribution to the rising technical composition of capital has been an increase in fixed capital per worker (and so of the quantity of materials processed per hour); since 1965, the technical composition of capital has changed only in response to changes in turnover times and in capacity utilisation rates. The general picture, then, is of an industry in which technical change has slowed dramatically and changed its form since the mid-1960s; the interaction of this effect and of the changing market strength of the industry accounts for the history of the rate of profit in the Canadian food and beverage industry. </jats:p>",

A sample of 434 students in grades 2, 6, and 10 were administered cognitive processing and achievement tests. Significant developmental changes in scores across the three grades and significant correlations with achievement in reading and math provided support for the validity of these cognitive processing tasks. Simultaneous and planning appeared to be more related to math than successive processes at the younger ages, and reading correlated with coding at the lower ages and both coding and planning at tenth grade. Planning and coding correlated significantly with achievement (rs = .23, .45, .56 and .37, .33, .52 for grades 2, 6, and 10 for planning and coding, respectively). Planning was related increasingly to the total MAST, as well as separate reading and math scores, with age. Implications for the assessment of intellectual functioning are presented. </jats:p>",

This focus on the growth process has ignored the existence of an industry with an ongoing need to keep mills working at some significant fraction of capacity. In this paper we discuss a model framework that will enable the calculation of regeneration harvest policies in a long term context of wood supply to an integrated industry. The paper briefly reviews the literature on economic approaches to forest rotation and then goes on to examine the mathematical programming approaches, particularly the Model I and Model II forms discussed by Johnson and Scheurmann. Only the work of Barros and Weintraub attempts to model both growth and harvest together with an integrated industry structure. Their work, however, uses the Model I formulation, which severely restricts the alternative regeneration harvest policies. We examine a new model based on a Model II type of modelling of the forest growth and harvesting. Like Barros and Weintraub, we use a simple integrated industry structure. The resulting mathematical programming model is large but possesses considerable special structure. We outline a simple approach to decomposition to permit the rapid solution of this model and report on some preliminary computational experience. </jats:p>",

These zones have certain similarities with Export Processing Zones in some other countries within Southeast Asia, although they are more comprehensive in development and include the provision of housing for foreigners and local Chinese, as well as social services and many other facilities. Housing and service provision has, to an extent, however, lagged behind the economic and physical development of the Chinese zones. The authorities in the zones have begun to view housing as an item worthy of investment, and the coexistence of foreign firms and joint ventures with Chinese-owned undertakings within the zones has meant that incomes and aspirations, and hence demands for facilities, are often higher than elsewhere in the country. This has meant an important re-examination of socialist principles in the zones. Housing in particular is becoming a commodity which is of higher quality than elsewhere in China and can be bought and sold, and many types of social and retail services are also being provided by individuals and firms rather than by the state or larger production units. In this paper the authors examine some of the changes currently being witnessed in these zones and the dilemmas which they pose for a government still attempting to maintain an avowed socialist orientation in its policy. In particular, they discuss the emergence of competition for housing and resources, and consider the extent to which the commodification of social facilities is compatible with the continuation of socialist state policy.</jats:p>",

The publication of the World Bank's revised policy statement, therefore, provides an opportunity to gauge changes in its policy directions over the past decade and assess challenges to what is now the new orthodoxy. Initially, attention is focused on key elements in the World Bank's original policy statement with its unfashionable emphasis on short-term incremental planning, congestion pricing, deregulation, and privatisation. Then an examination is made of the salient features of the World Bank's restated policy: managing the demand for road use, improving efficiency by traffic management, public transport, and investment decisions. Finally, counterarguments to this restated policy are outlined. With this background we are in a position to assess the differing arguments and to make a plea for researchers to evaluate the predilection of World Bank economists for buses rather than rail rapid transit, and deregulation and privatisation instead of state control. </jats:p>",

This followed the realisation that Health Authorities were beginning to set arbitrarily their own norms for bed provision, often based on one or two examples within their region, despite the fact that there is a two to three fold variation between districts in the number of beds provided for acute psychiatry. For example, in 1981 Worcester used 0.19 acute beds per 1,000 population and Camberwell used 0.76.</jats:p>",

There were 15 cases in Stonehouse residents during the 4 years from April 1983, an annual attack rate of 56·5 per 100000. Four secondary cases occurred despite rifampicin prophylaxis. The objectives of this community survey were to investigate patterns of meningococcal carriage, transmission and immunity and to determine the proportion of non-secretors of blood group antigens in the Stonehouse population find amongst meningococcal carriers. A total of 6237 subjects participated including 75% of the 6635 Stonehouse residents. Over 97% of the participants provided all three of the requested specimens – nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva and blood samples.</jats:p><jats:p>The co-operation between the many organizations involved in the detailed preliminary planning was instrumental in the success of the survey; in particular the value of effective collaboration between Departments of Community Medicine and Microbiology and of the Public Health Laboratory Service network of laboratories in undertaking investigations of this size and type was clearly demonstrated.</jats:p>",
