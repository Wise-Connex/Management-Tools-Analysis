      "abstract": "<jats:p>During the last ten years the use of computers has allowed high-quality instantaneous data gathering, and this, combined with the better use of manpower, has achieved in some instances the highest possible level of production, has provided a means for more efficient operation, and has permitted maximum profits.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Computer Production Control (CPC) is defined as the combination of automation features as applied to a system to perform well testing, data gathering, and most look-and-see functions, as well as to provide data-processing capacity. Automatic well testing requires remote supervisory control capacity. Automatic data gathering means measurement of all oil, gas, and water volumes. Look-and-see functions require well-status indicators and alarms. Since a computer is required to give a reasonable combination of these features, the data-processing capacity inherent in the computer should be used. CPC is a communications-oriented remote open-loop supervisory control, local closed-loop control, and closed-loop data acquisition computer operation. Maximum use is made of computer software to allow minimum use of field hardware.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Considering these features, a state-of-the-art review can be made to determine the technical feasibility of CPC. At the date of this writing, technical presentations and trade journals describe 17 major industry installations to some extent. This is not a complete list of all installations but of those that have some pertinent significance in arriving at an evaluation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A state-of-the-art review will reveal that during the last 10 years the use of computers has allowed high-quality instantaneous data gathering, and this, combined with the better use of manpower, has achieved in some instances the highest possible level of production, has provided a means for more efficient operation, and has permitted maximum profits from producing operations. Oil and gas production is also producing operations. Oil and gas production is also being controlled successfully with a computer-oriented push-button operation in other installations on which push-button operation in other installations on which no reports have been published. Knowing that the concept is within current technical abilities makes it possible for planning to progress to the point that possible for planning to progress to the point that economics can be considered.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Automation</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>It might be well to establish at this point the difference between automation and mechanization. In old systems, we have been mechanizing for technological improvement for a number of years. Mechanization is installing equipment to perform a given function automatically and repetitively. Automation is a machine system that through measurement, control, and feedback will allow operation with optimum efficiency. With mechanization no feedback for optimization is implied. Automation implies and requires feedback and optimization, and it requires the complete exploitation of communications, computations and control. In any case, automation for automation's sake is not enough. It must lead to attractive economic results or automation will not and should not be instituted.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Production-oriented automation systems include five items that can be categorized as old or well established production components.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 134</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Decisions can be made with some degree of confidence that they will not be outdated before initiated.

Early concentration on the development of personal skills and occupational knowledge should be initiated and supported by the vocational consultant. The responsibility then is to work toward altering the emphasis in work for the blind from one of inability to perform competitively to one of almost limitless potential. Only such positive concepts can help to turn the tide for the blind worker and result in the prevention of vocational disabilities. </jats:p>",

The concept of “work flow structure” is developed and methods for determining this structure from a sample of job routings or a routing transition matrix are described. Two key notions used to define work flow structure are “paths” of work flow and the relative activity levels or throughput volumes of processing units in the system. Sample results are presented from the application of these methods to data from a large machine shop. The final section of the paper suggests a number of ways in which work flow structure information might be used in procedures for production planning and control. The application areas discussed include product mix planning, capacity planning, personnel assignment, work releasing and dispatching. </jats:p>",

Network analysis (PERT) and recursive programming are integrated in the model, which is applied to data for a district in India. The findings provide insights into the sporadic nature of economic development and differential marginal value productivities of limiting resources over time. The integrated planning technique, resulting from the methodological study, appears to be especially useful for spotting potential bottlenecks sufficiently early to initiate action for eliminating them, thereby facilitating the development process.</jats:p>",
