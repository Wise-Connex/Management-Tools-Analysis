According to this point of view much of the lack of success children experienced in learning arithmetic was attributed to a too-rapid exposure to the “special difficulties” of a given operation. Curricula of this period provided teachers with elaborate gradations of “easy steps leading to the mastery of arithmetic.”</jats:p>",

In an effort to understand this problem better, a study was made of the relation of engineering effort to sales. It was found that this problem was analogous to that of a servomechanism system for which mathematical techniques have been developed and applied successfully. The study resulted in the development of a “transfer-function” formula which has proved to be a useful tool for measuring the relation between engineering effort and sales. The method employed to obtain the transfer function and the results obtained by its use are presented herein. </jats:p>",
