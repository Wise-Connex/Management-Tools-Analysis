      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years we have witnessed a revival of interest in the National Resources Committee (NRC) and its work on national planning. The research shows that the roots of national planning at the NRC are found in the Progressive Era, when individuals sought, through city, regional, and economic planning, to bring order to American society, in the government's management of the economy during World War I, and in Hoover's attempt at macromanagement of the economy. The research also shows that national economic planning, as distinct from other forms of planning, was an important component of the committee's work. In regard to this, researchers have acknowledged that Gardiner Means, as director of the Industrial Section of the Industrial Committee and author of <jats:italic>The Structure of the American Economy, Part I: Basic Characteristics,</jats:italic> was an important and outspoken advocate of economic planning within the NRC, but they have been less clear as to his specific contributions to economic planning. Moreover, the researchers have not extensively investigated the NRC position toward national economic planning, the economic models from which national economic plans would be developed, and the impact of the Keynesian revolution on the NRC approach to national economic planning. These omissions are not surprising inasmuch as neither Warken's (1979) nor Clawson's (1981) general coverage of the NRC provided much more than a brief and superficial description of the Industrial Section and a listing of its most important publications. Kalish (1963), on the other hand, discussed Means and the Industrial Section in more depth but in such a disjointed manner that it is impossible to grasp the movement toward economic planning that took place in the NRC and the important role Means played in the process. Finally, neither Chapman's (1981 and 1983) nor Jeffries's (1987) discussions of the impact of the Keynesian revolution on the activities of the NRC dealt specifically with its impact on Means's work on economic planning.</jats:p>",

One approach to increasing efficiency is to identify measures which allow service levels, in terms of patients treated and standards of care, to be maintained at a lower cost. This could be achieved by maintaining service levels with fewer hospital beds. Reducing lengths of stay by removing organizational delays and expansions of day‐case care, are policies which can increase patient caseload per bed.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper puts forward an approach for estimating the resources released by such policies and assesses the savings achieved by realizing efficiency gains identified in a previous study by Beech <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic> (1987). That study identified significant potential for maintaining services with fewer beds, with the expansion of day‐case care being a key mechanism. However this paper concludes that when services are maintained with fewer beds, the vast majority of hospital costs remain fixed. It also reaches the alarming conclusion that as a vehicle for reducing costs, day‐case care is much less effective than previous studies have implied.</jats:p><jats:p>However, increasing hospital throughput per bed does release capacity to treat more patients. The proposed reforms of the NHS (Secretaries of State, 1989) envisage an internal market for health care, allowing hospitals to enter into contracts with purchasers of health care. The approach to costing described in this paper is applicable to assessing the increased costs associated with such developments. These extra costs can then be compared with expected income.</jats:p>",

After wide and lively consultation throughout the department at three levels (working, middle management, and senior management), the planning staff produced a policy integrating conservation with all the other archival functions. The development of the first annual conservation plan and the first long-range conservation plan tested the new policy. Annual conservation plans describe specific conservation-related activities and branch responsibility for implementation, resources, and deadlines, while long-range conservation plans delineate the strategic direction of the corporate conservation program.</jats:p>",

The procedure for constructing the objective tree is presented and the difficulties involved are highlighted. Such difficulties include sustaining logical thinking and confusing means with sub-objectives. Although the technique has some limitations, the advantages are felt to outweigh these. The results of the exercise can befed into other planning and manage ment techniques. The objective tree has wide application in the field of tourism planning and management. </jats:p>",

Most of the following section is concerned with relatively large-scale surveys in technically less developed countries. However, a systematic approach is needed in nutritional assessment in all situations relating to both populations and individuals. The contents and suggestions in the present chapter are mainly concerned with large-scale surveys. They need to be used selectively in other forms of nutritional assessment (Fig. 7.1).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Socioeconomic systems are often characterized by spatiotemporal structured data sets. If many potentially explanatory variables are available, a ranking of their relevance is desirable. A numerical procedure is presented which allows for a stepwise selective regression analysis of such variables based on least square principles. The optimal set of key socioeconomic factors is obtained from a large number of variables by an orthogonalization procedure. This orthogonalization takes into account the correlation between the variables which have been already been selected and the remaining set. Time delays of variables are also considered. As an example the key factor analysis of regional utilities of the migratory system of the Federal Republic of Germany is treated. </jats:p>",

Sample design involves the method of sampling and carrying it out. The need for a random sample with acceptable coverage and response rate is essential for cross-sectional surveys. Errors related to this are often difficult to estimate and may cause serious doubts concerning the acceptance of the sample data as reflecting the population of concern. Sample size, on the other hand, is concerned with the ‘precision’ of results, (i.e. how the results vary from that which would be obtained if the entire population were surveyed.) Hence, results from samples include as estimate and a range of statistical confidence (‘confidence interval’) (Appendix 4) around the estimate.</jats:p>",

Such systems can play an important role in the processes of formulating social policy, planning, and programming. This role includes the identification of social issues and their formulation, goal clarification, the identification of priorities and alternatives in these processes, and in social monitoring and evaluation (Berman, 1985). In contradistinction to the political aspect of decision‐making, information systems aid in bringing about rationalization of the decision‐making process in the public policy sphere (Welrich, 1985). The effective use of information systems, however, is dependent upon the accessibility of the system to the decision‐maker during the decision‐making process. The place of the decision‐maker in the administrative structure determines the type of information he needs and its mode of application. The value of the information system in decision‐making is contingent upon the relevance of the information in content and in being available at the right time.</jats:p>",

Each link of a robot arm is modeled by a cylinder ended by two hemispheres, and the remaining wrist and hand is modeled by a sphere. To describe the danger of collision between two modeled objects, minimum distance functions, which are defined by the Euclidean norm, are used. These minimum distance functions are used to describe the constraints that guarantee no collision between two robot arms. The collision-free motion planning problem is formulated as a pointwise constrained nonlinear minimization problem, and solved by a conjugate gradient method with barrier functions. To improve the minimization process, a simple grid technique is incorporated. Finally, a simulation study is presented to show the significance of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

The methodological aspects of, and the results from, two models will be considered, namely the MASTER (Micro-Analytical Simulation of Transport, Employment and Residence) model and the LILT (the Leeds Integrated Land-use Transport) model. The MASTER model simulates demographic change, decisions about moving home and changing job, and decisions about transport, such as car ownership, and modal choice for a set of households and their members. The nature of the model permits the analysis of the relationships between household dynamics, car ownership, car availability, and modal choice. The model can identify latent demand for homes and employment, so that the implications of increasing the supply of dwellings and jobs for travel demand, can be traced through these relationships. LILT is an aggregate land-use transport model that was originally based on the Lowry model, but now includes travel demand, plus various other extensions. The models have been applied to the same study-area over the same time-period, so the implications of testing a variety of policies with the two models can be discussed. The focus of this paper is both on the methodological issues and the practical implications of the two approaches, as well as the comparable results from the two models. </jats:p>",

For the test year of 1979, trip generation data were developed using three models. The models were based on stepwise regression, principal components, and ridge regression. Following the trip generation phase, a gravity model was used to distribute the output of each model. Given the limited number of alternative routes, an all-or-nothing assignment was used. The stability of the models was assessed using data for 1971. Of the three models evaluated only the one based on ridge regression proved to be reasonably stable over the term period. A stepwise regression model without intercept was also developed and reasonable results were obtained for the stability of this model. Key words: planning, model, stability, trip generation, distribution, assignment, provincial. </jats:p>",

A competing central place model is developed using spatially defined choice sets for origin — destination pairs by threshold distance and central place order. The competing central place generalization is empirically tested by undertaking a comparative analysis of 1980 domestic airline passenger traffic amongst selected cities in the continental United States. A host of modeling strategies are contrasted and the effects of mass, separation, and competitive forces noted in the presence or absence of hierarchical data. The production-constrained competing central place specification is shown to exhibit not only greater explanatory power than Fotheringham's competing destinations model, but also significant reductions in potential multicollinear relations between regressors. The model is later extended to incorporate an intervening opportunities filter. Competitive flow patterns between paired origins and destinations are then delimited by geographic range, compatibility, and the impeding effects of substitute and/or intervening flows within a hierarchical network. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Predicting the effect of changes in land‐use on bird populations requires a degree of understanding of their population dynamics which is seldom available. Such knowledge is especially difficult to acquire if the birds occupy a variety of habitats of differing quality and they are also migratory. The effects of habitat loss at a particular time of year on the year‐round population dynamics are then difficult to predict. The problem is discussed using wintering waders as examples. Unless a species can extend its present range, the initial effect of habitat loss is to increase bird density. Whether this affects population size will depend on whether bird density affects either winter survival or subsequent breeding success. Measuring such density‐dependent relationships is in practice extremely difficult in migratory populations. However, behavioural studies help in testing the key hypothesis that birth and death rates are affected by bird density, and may even allow the form of any density‐dependent functions to be deduced. Simulation modelling then allows the effects of habitat loss on the overall population dynamics to be explored. The general point is that behavioural studies play an important part in Environmental Impact Studies because behaviour is the main way in which birds respond to environmental changes and compete for limited resources, such as diminishing habitat. They are therefore likely to provide insights when making predictions about the responses of birds and populations to habitat loss.</jats:p>",

Damaging agents reduce tree growth, kill trees, destroy the commercial value of stands, and sometimes reduce yield in subsequent rotations. Sustainable harvest may be reduced by up to 60% by a severe spruce budworm outbreak and up to 40% by a 1% per annum loss to fire. Serious overestimation of future timber supply can therefore result from the failure to allow for catastrophic or continual small losses caused by fire or biotic agents. Current efforts in New Brunswick to explicitly incorporate effects of spruce budworm defoliation into forest management planning are described, including research studies into protection planning and delivery, damage detection, and defoliation-based growth forecasting. An improved understanding of the impact of insects, disease, and fire on stand yield and methods to incorporate this information into timber supply analyses are essential to reduce uncertainty about future timber supply. </jats:p>",

The CAP system was imbedded in a comprehensive public involvement program that paralleled the reservoir operating policy modeling process, as part of multipurpose reservoir operations planning on the Great Plains Reservoirs in Colorado.

Water resources planning can become a forum for proactively resolving water policy disputes by employing the principles of environmental dispute resolution. The purpose of this article is to explore the role of collaborative, consensus‐building planning processes in resolving water policy disputes.
