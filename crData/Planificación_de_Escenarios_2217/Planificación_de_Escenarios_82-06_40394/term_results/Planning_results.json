      "abstract": "<jats:p> Local economic development has become a central concern of public policymakers. Urban, rural, and regional planners will encounter new opportunities to establish or restructure economic development planning in the years ahead. Local planners require an approach to planning for economic development that responds to the growing pressures on planning to achieve tangible results and accounts for the formidable political and financial constraints on public planning. The proposed approach—contingency planning—is presented in this paper. In the first section, contingency planning is placed in a planning theory context. In the body of the paper, the approach is described and critically discussed in the context of local economic development. After the conclusions, the practice of contingency planning is reviewed in the appendix to the paper. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most assessments of the poor performance of regional planning agencies have focussed on the policy problems of putting development theory into practice. This paper looks instead at the institutional aspect. Abstracting from the diversity of policy contexts, it asks whether there are common political and administrative features in the process of organizational reform which first creates and then dissolves regional planning agencies. In a broad comparative review of published case studies an intrinsic dilemma of such agencies is identified. As planning units they trespass on the jurisdictions of established departments who in the long run have the proven ability to starve them of information, effectiveness, and credibility. Their only power-base is a regional political constituency; but developing this may prove equally fatal, for reforms which amplify interregional cleavages threaten the political integration of the state, making the political cost of regional planning unacceptably high to national governments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning process is modelled as an information processing system. The inputs to the system comprise observations of the state of the environment, and the outputs are goals and plans to guide actions in the environment. The processor consists of two interacting subsystems: the one carrying descriptions about material states is called the state space and the other holding information about decisions and values is called the decision space. The memory of the planning system stores its history: its ‘experiences’ both of its external and of its internal environments. The ‘facts’ which inform the planning system are represented as a relation between the state space and the decision space. Such a relation induces a pair of functions which is known to form a Galois connection between two sets. Compositions of these two functions are closure operators which define closure systems on the decision space and the state space, respectively. Each of these functions when restricted to the closure systems is an isomorphism. Isomorphic elements are paired together and the collection of such pairs forms a Galois lattice. A Galois lattice presents to the planners an overall view of the current ‘situation’ of the environment. Each element of the Galois lattice relates a set of ‘systems’ represented in the state space to a set of ‘values’ used to evaluate ‘systems’ in the decision space. The planning process is then viewed as a transformation of the Galois lattice which represents the current ‘situation’ to another Galois lattice which represents the desirable ‘situation’. </jats:p>",

In addition, a mixed data evaluation approach will be discussed, which includes three techniques which are all based on different interpretations of basic assumptions. Next it will be shown that there are some practical ways to deal with the weighting problem in evaluation. Finally, an illustration of the mixed data approach is provided by means of an empirical application to a housing allocation problem. </jats:p>",

Five strategies are considered, and by means of the effective method of ‘analytic hierarchy process’ these strategies are prioritized with respect to a set of tangible and intangible criteria. The results are compared with criteria adopted by the United States Department of Energy. The approach demonstrates that, when good judgments are used, one can solve complex decision problems in a simple way and make a rational decision in a short time. </jats:p>",

The strategic planning cycle for each line of business should include eight planning elements: mission statement; internal analysis including the unit's strengths and weaknesses; external analysis which includes opportunities and threats in the environment; goals and objectives; strategies for action; management review action; planning for implementation; and continuous evaluation of performance of both people and products in terms of the strategic plan and stated objectives.

There are as many types and forms of economic planning as the number of countries, because each country formulates a plan according to its political and economic environments and goals of the national economy. In a general sense, the term economic planning can be defined as formulation of control and regulation of economic activity by public agency with a view to achieving well‐defined objective(s). Since the key questions implicit in this definition such as formulation of economic policies, regulation and control of economic activity and goals and objectives of the national economy, are closely related to the political structure of a society, the techniques and patterns of economic planning thus become intricately woven with its political system.</jats:p>",

Emphasis throughout the discussion is on generation and incorporation of managers' judgements of design and performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Use of the Malthusian Paradigm for Justification of Compulsory Family Planning</jats:bold> One of the most important issues in the contemporary debate concerning population policy has been the question of compulsion in family planning (or more specifically, compulsory sterilisation) for the quantitative control of population. The present‐day demographic scene in the Third World is characterised as one of “population explosion”. It is argued that despite the spread of family planning and the recent trends towards decline in fertility among two‐thirds of the populations of the developing countries, the burden of the population problem in terms of the requirements on the eve of the 21st century is not going to be light, considering the limited and fast depleting resources of this slender globe. Hence, pressures have been mounting from various quarters towards more and more stringent measures converging on coercion to control the family size and population growth in the low‐income countries. For example, during the Emergency in India (1975–77), it was felt by the then Government (under the prime ministership of Mrs Indira Gandhi), the ruling Congress Party and some groups and individuals that the time had come to put the population problems of the country on a war footing and adopt drastic measures such as compulsory sterilisation to meet the hydra‐headed scourge of over‐population. In fact, the Government of Maharashtra, a state within the Union of India, went a step further and pioneered for the first time in history a bill on the compulsory sterilisation of eligible persons, for introduction in the State Legislative Assembly which passed a revised version of this bill (1976). To support and justify compulsion in family planning, various arguments — scientific and pseudo‐scientific — are usually made. At the head of all the arguments is most distinctly the Malthusian — or rather the neo‐Malthusian — argument. The novelty of the Malthusian argument made is that it is advanced this time to present a justification, not for the mere control of population by some voluntary means, but for a strict regulation of the size of each family in society through <jats:italic>the instrumentality of physical force having the sanction of the law of the land and having penal provisions for the defaulters</jats:italic>. It is the major concern of this essay to examine whether and how far the Malthusian paradigm is relevant, adequate and correct, <jats:italic>vis‐à‐vis</jats:italic> the issue of compulsion in family planning. What exactly is the basis of the neo‐Malthusian position on compulsion? Would Malthus, if he were amongst us, have supported compulsory family planning for the reasons which generally go under the caption of Malthusianism? Is the issue of compulsion in family planning so narrow as to be capable of being fully tackled by the Malthusian paradigm? These are some of the important questions which are sought to be explored in the short space available for this article.</jats:p>",

The first part distinguishes urban planning as a “future oriented” activity, from urban management which is primarily concerned with resource allocation. (The nature of urban development — interdependence and long life — makes a long‐term perspective important.) When urban management aims to implement a plan the two are complementary. Urban policy covers a broader range of issues. The second part distinguishes four levels of debate about urban issues: ideological, political, operational and technical. Frequently debates in urban studies are not coherent because the participants are arguing at different levels and therefore make different assumptions about what is given and what can be varied. It is argued that the various levels form a hierarchy so that debates at any level need to assume particular positions with respect to higher level questions. Ideological issues include individual <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> collective perspective, capitalist <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> socialist, the appropriate role of markets and governments and the relative weight given to equity and efficiency criteria. The examples of political issues discussed are rationality <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> group pressure as explanations of government behaviour, and whether planning is mainly a political or a professional activity. Operational issues include the appropriate level of government for carrying out urban functions and the role of statutory planning and other policy measures. Technical issues focus on predicting the effects of policy measures and external changes on cities. The different levels are illustrated by a discussion of policy towards inner city areas.</jats:p>",

This framework allows a more realistic representation of the uncertainties fundamental to this problem than previous models. In addition, using Wets's algorithm for linear simple recourse problems, this formulation has approximately the same computational complexity as the mean approximation (i.e., the deterministic program obtained by replacing all random elements by their means). Using this formulation we empirically investigate the effects of differing distributions and penalty costs. We conclude that even with symmetric penalty costs and distributions the mean model is significantly inferior to the stochastic linear programming formulation. Thus we are able to demonstrate that ignoring the stochastic components in linear programming formulations can be very costly without having significant computational savings. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a “perfect planning horizon procedure” for the simple cash balance problem, where the objective of the firm is to schedule the selling and buying of its earning assets so that all the positive demands are met at minimum cost. Demand for cash can be both positive or negative; a positive demand means the cash outflow and a negative demand means the cash inflow. While the planning horizon procedure reported in Mensching, Garstka, and Morton (Mensching, J., S. Garstka, T. Morton. 1978. Protective planning-horizon procedures for a deterministic cash balance problem. Oper. Res. 26 637–652.) obtains optimal initial decisions for the infinite horizon cash balance problem by using forecasts for some finite horizon, the perfect procedure in this paper is guaranteed to obtain these decisions by using the minimum possible number of periods of forecast data. We also present a forward dynamic programming algorithm which is computationally more efficient than the forward algorithm of Blackburn and Eppen (Blackburn, J., G. Eppen. 1973. A two asset deterministic cash balance problem. Research Paper No. 133, Stanford University.). Our computational results show that the perfect procedure in this paper can lead to significant savings in the number of periods of forecast data required to obtain optimal initial decisions and the CPU time compared to the planning horizon procedure in Mensching, Garstka, and Morton (Mensching, J., S. Garstka, T. Morton. 1978. Protective planning-horizon procedures for a deterministic cash balance problem. Oper. Res. 26 637–652.). </jats:p>",

The labour market changes over the postwar period have resulted in labour shedding in the older heavy industries and in mining and quarrying, leading to changes both in the composition and in the location of the work force. During the same period there have been major changes in the tenure structure of housing with the growth of owner occupation. There is a strong relationship between the areas which have a buoyant labour market and those which have a high rate of house price increase. The implications of these changes in the labour and property markets are examined in relation to mobility and class structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with applying and extending a methodology for analysing spatial aggregation in gravity models developed in three earlier papers to a larger scale and hence more realistic example of spatial interaction than has been treated so far. Problems of model performance and the analysis of spatial aggregation effects identified in earlier papers are first described, and accordingly the spatial information (entropy) function used previously is then generalised to enable a wider set of models to be applied. Seven models are generated by means of spatial and generalised entropy functions subject to a standard set of model constraints, and the properties of the models in terms of their canonical forms are presented. The models are then applied to four levels of aggregation (234, 121, 58, and 22 zones) of the spatial interaction pattern in Edmonton, Alberta. As in previous papers, information in the data set at the four levels of aggregation is first measured and interpreted, the models are then fitted to these four levels, and relationships between information and parameter values sought. The approximation theory developed earlier is then used to predict parameter values of such models directly from observed spatial information. The results are only fair, better than those of part 3, but worse than those of part 2; although in terms of predicted parameter shift between levels of aggregation, the shifts associated with the doubly constrained model are accurately predicted. The various themes in these papers are then drawn together, conclusions with respect to the value of the insights gained are made, and speculations as to the most fruitful lines for future research outlined. </jats:p>",

Additional explanatory analyses of the process of search focused on the interrelationship of household characteristics, housing attributes, search effort, and search strategy. The descriptive data on temporal and spatial search emphasize the importance of realtor involvement in search, the constraints (on search) of stage in the household life cycle, and the differences in search activities for new and ‘used’ housing. </jats:p>",

Public participation in large scale federally funded water resources and pollution control projects is now a federal requirement and practice of various planning agencies. However, no systems based model for quantifying and measuring the effectiveness of public participation is known to exist. In this paper, we report a fuzzy set based model developed for doing this in areawide water resources planning The model is essentially cascade in nature and employs the concepts of fuzzy pessimistic and optimistic aggregations to cluster and analyze the evaluations of the basic factors. Sample computations of the model are provided.</jats:p>",
