      "abstract": "<jats:p> Following Calavita and Krumholz’s answers to conservative attacks on planning, this commentary offers another way to promote planning in public discourse. Transaction cost theory (TCT) debunks the “planning versus markets” dichotomy, relieving planning advocates from claiming the need for public intervention, an argument that encounters frequent skepticism. TCT makes the case for planning in three ways: (1) rejecting generalizations, it focuses debate on specific cases; (2) breaking the link between planning and government, it disarms conservative critics; (3) it provides an authoritative theoretical base for answering neoliberal attacks on public planning. Convincing people that planning (not only as public intervention) is necessary and enhances their welfare is an argument that can be won. </jats:p>",

This article draws on the results of a survey of planning educators to determine trends and patterns in environmental planning curricula. It develops an explanatory model for predicting the learning expectations for various types of knowledge that are part of environmental planning education in U.S. and Canadian planning programs. This model uses individual, organizational, and curricular characteristics to predict the substantive environmental planning topics taught in graduate planning programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The literature about service learning in planning education contains a wealth of insights from practitioners at large research universities in urban settings. Very little has been written about experiences in rural areas. The Environmental Studies Department at St. Lawrence University has experimented with several strategies for service learning in rural northern New York. As a type of service learning, the research seminar offers several advantages over conventional internships and community-based independent study. These advantages are critical in rural areas of sparse population, where few agencies exist. Case studies involving conservation easements, community planning, and historical preservation demonstrate that some agencies derive real benefits from service learning. The case studies also illustrate the following lessons: the research seminar can engage a variety of planning issues and organizations; it is helpful, though not necessary, if sponsoring organizations articulate needs, but they should not anticipate preferred results from research; university staff should pay close attention to the sociopolitical context of participating agencies and ensure that students are fully immersed in the community; and service learning can make tangible contributions to the quality of rural life, thereby making these areas more attractive for residents who wish to stay. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article concerns the equity dimension of partnerships between disadvantaged communities and local governments and private sector firms to provide basic services and amenities. It examines the necessary conditions for fulfilling the expectation that such partnerships can serve the interests of the poor and the critical role of state in intervention to level the playing field for such a partnership. In the context of decentralizing third world governments, the article highlights conceptual inconsistencies underlying public-private partnerships that lead them to deliver results opposite to those they claim. The article points to the ambivalent and even deceptive core of such partnerships that enables their effective operation as a form of privatization, advancing the interests of the private sector and the market under the banner of sharing power with the poor and the state. </jats:p>",

Findings suggest that about one-half of planning faculty actively publish and that there is considerable concentration of both publication and citation activity among a relatively small group of scholars and schools. Accredited and nonaccredited schools show substantial differences, as do doctoral degree-granting schools compared with master’s-only schools. The strengths and weaknesses of faculty quality measures used are discussed, leading to a call for other studies using different measures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public participation is central to the practice, legitimacy, and dominant normative principles of spatial planning. It has a strong presence in the discourse of communicative governance, which suggests that participatory rights should be strengthened as part of a systematic institutional design. Interest in the concept of rights within planning has been gathering pace, but is still undeveloped. In terms of third-party rights, attention has been focused on citizens as rights claimants and their use of rights to promote self-interest, rather than the values that should be protected by such rights or the balance of rights between different stakeholders. This paper explores some of the theoretical issues related to third-party rights in planning, using the existing literature on planning disputes to contextualise current debate. It examines a case study of third-party appellants in the Republic of Ireland and identifies five distinct ‘discourses of objection’. These discourses highlight the complex factors that stimulate third-party rights-claims and illustrate how they can be related to issues such as citizenship, the public interest, and property rights. The paper concludes with a number of general observations on the nature of rights in planning and the implications this has for the broader paradigm of communicative governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In current inverse planning algorithms it is common to treat all voxels within a target or sensitive structure equally and use structure specific prescriptions and weighting factors as system parameters. In reality, the voxels within a structure are not identical in complying with their dosimetric goals and there exists strong intrastructural competition. Inverse planning objective function should not only balance the competing objectives of different structures but also that of the individual voxels in various structures. In this work we propose to model the intrastructural tradeoff through the modulation of voxel‐dependent importance factors and deal with the challenging problem of how to obtain a sensible set of importance factors with a manageable amount of computing. Instead of letting the values of voxel‐dependent importance to vary freely during the search process, an adaptive algorithm, in which the importance factors were tied to the local radiation doses through a heuristically constructed relation, was developed. It is shown that the approach is quite general and the EUD‐based optimization is a special case of the proposed framework. The new planning tool was applied to study a hypothetical phantom case and a prostate case. Comparison of the results with that obtained using conventional inverse planning technique with structure specific importance factors indicated that the dose distributions from the conventional inverse planning are at best suboptimal and can be significantly improved with the help of the proposed nonuniform penalty scheme.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the role of claims of global conspiracy in undermining a local environmental planning process known as Natural Heritage 2020 (NH 2020) in Nevada County, California. County officials intended NH 2020 to mitigate the environmental impacts of rapid growth in this gentrifying rural community. This program illustrates the increasing use by land-use planners of landscape-scale approaches derived from conservation biology to protect biodiversity on private land. In Nevada County, this new planning vision met intense resistance. The ensuing struggle demonstrates the conflicts that can arise between social groups with competing visions for the future of the local environment in response to efforts to realize particular visions through land-use planning and policymaking. Opponents perceived a significant threat to their property rights from the use of a landscape-scale vision from conservation biology in county planning, which some depicted as part of a global environmental conspiracy. We explore the links between broader conservation science, ideology, and activism in the case of NH 2020, and suggest that quite real conceptual connections to global conservation politics potentially make local conservation planning efforts susceptible to claims of ‘outside’ interference. Although NH 2020 had no direct link (despite claims by some opponents) to global conservation efforts, the successful use of claims of global conspiracy in efforts to halt the program underscores social realities that planners and scholars need to consider when promoting what they often view as simply ‘good planning.’ </jats:p>",

User fees for primary education have become common, as has the intervention of parent-teacher associations (PTAs), which requires further fees. A look at the relationship between PTAs and local government in Jinja, Uganda, demonstrates that the de facto decentralization of the provision of primary education to PTAs provides an opportunity for building political accountability; when parents bring resources to the table, governments must share resources and responsibility and relationships of accountability emerge. These relationships are threatened by the new universal primary education (UPE) policy for which Uganda has few resources and little accountability. Current UNESCO initiatives for establishing UPE in Sub-Saharan Africa call for participation and accountability but may ignore the potential for accountability and improvement through partnerships between governments and PTAs. </jats:p>",

The shift from defined benefit to defined contribution pension plans and the recent bankruptcy of Enron Corporation underscore the importance of managing retirement accumulation and liquidation risks. This study analyzes the effectiveness and adequacy of institutional‐provided information and advice on employees' retirement planning decisions and their satisfaction with financial resources during retirement. Results suggest that retirement planning should begin earlier in an employee's career and that employer‐provided retirement information and advice is a highly valued service. Gender, planning practices, job classification, and age are all significant predictors of satisfaction with financial resources during retirement. Targeting women and union employees with retirement information and advice that focuses on allocating contributions using a balanced portfolio approach should result in significant increases in satisfaction with financial resources during retirement. Regulatory objectives should focus on reducing retirement accumulation and liquidation risks, improving the delivery of professional financial advice to plan participants, and expanding qualified retirement plan choice for all labor force participants. To encourage employer participation in employee retirement planning, employers acting in “good faith” should be federally protected from liability for providing retirement planning information and advice to employees.</jats:p>",

The data gathering encompasses 12 years of well intervention experience, which originated a summary; a consistent data base to work with, including the indication of the real reason of each intervention. To this data base, which is restricted to satellite offshore oil wells connected to production platforms in water depths ranging from 500 to 1,500 meters, it was incorporated the annual growth of wells population. It is worth to mention that, in this particular deep water scenario, the database available for the study is unique. The area of failure modeling in association with well interventions behavior is the focus of this study. It was obtained the pattern of the interventions and extracted the wanted data: types and failure modeling, durations, annual frequencies, and number of interventions. The results can be used in economical analysis, maintenance prediction and in reliability studies. Therefore, the importance of this study relies on the application of a methodology as an alternative to reduce the subjectivity in investment decision making concerned to the oil well intervention planning.</jats:p>",

Since “value” is abstract in its nature, managers need to know more concrete and clear target measures that derive the value of their business. In this model common financial variables and their variations are used as input variables to synthesize the market value added (MVA). The model used an artificial intelligence technique that is non‐parametric by nature and intended to capture a dynamic relationship between input and output variables. The study results show that this model is able to identify a set of strategic variables that are linked directly to the MVA of companies involved.</jats:p>",

Thus, terrorism should no longer be a stranger to us. Although there might not be as many terrorism incidents in Thailand as in some other countries, the possibilities of attack still remain a factor for architects and engineers when designing buildings. This article begins with the facts about terrorism. Then, a few ideas are presented to be used as guidelines for design professionals, when dealing with the new awareness of terrorism. Site and building planning, strengthening structure against impact, code compliance and the sub-office and the idea of decentralization are the main topics of discussion. The ideas are not meant to prevent acts of terrorism or to protect buildings entirely. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to prevent attacks. This article suggests that we, as design professionals, can find ways to minimize the impact of terrorist acts or discourage those acts altogether in order to protect ourselves and our property from becoming soft targets.</jats:p>"

In this paper, we investigate whether strategic planning can be used to reduce organizational members' position bias, or the extent to which they direct their attention toward the immediate goals and priorities attached to their position. We examine the hypothesis that involving employees in the strategic planning process and communicating the agreed-upon priorities to them afterwards enhance goal convergence by attenuating position bias. We examine these questions in a sample of 164 manufacturing plants from five countries and three industries, where we asked middle-level managers to assess the importance of various organizational goals. We find that participation and communication function as complements to jointly reduce managerial position bias. </jats:p>",

It must be able to forecast and plan the future maintenance requirements of spares, man‐hours and total costs. As equipment ages and enters the wear‐out stage, with increasing failure rates, this forecasting becomes difficult. Maintenance management is faced with the dilemma of either resorting to high inventories, over‐planning and inflated budgets or of suffering stockouts, lengthy delays in repair and budget blowouts. A model for an optimal inspection frequency can help correct this. For an inspection frequency to be optimal, it must exactly match the failure rate of the equipment. Hence, with the use of a cost rate factor, the optimal inspection frequency can also be used as a tool for planning and forecasting maintenance costs. This paper develops an optimal model, ensuring that the inspection frequency is capable of matching the varying failure rates throughout the life of the equipment. It also demonstrates how this optimal inspection frequency can then be used to plan and forecast maintenance costs.</jats:p>",

When musicians improvise, they cooperate and take risks in ways that recommend fitting strategies for urban planners, who traditionally view their planning function as dependent upon values of liberal rationalism.  Furthermore, some improvising musicians deliberately stage their performances as interventions in their urban communities, thereby linking the aesthetic aspects of music to social and political action.  Examples of three modes of musical improvisation—deviation, response, and insurgency—adapted to the work of urban planners, designers, theorists, and historians illustrate how such enterprises can challenge a purely rational, purely planned understanding of such work, as well as how planning work already and inevitably entails improvisational impulses and influences.  The paper thus urges on planning professionals an ethos of improvisation inspired by musicians.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Rotary-steerable technology is progressing rapidly all over the world because of the improvements in hole cleaning and torque-and-drag. It works well especially in extended-reach drilling and holds great promise in directional work.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In rotary-steerable drilling operations, bit walk objectively exists along an actual drilled well trajectory. The drilling experience shows that it is an effective measure to control a well trajectory by use of the physical bit walk. The authors developed a method to plan various bit-walk paths with any combination of arc and straight sections in the vertical expansion plot.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors also presented a method to calculate a drilled well bore trajectory directly using the rates of inclination change and azimuth change for rotary-steerable drilling. Compared with the radius of curvature method and minimum curvature method, the most commonly used methods in the oil field, the improved method of survey calculation yields more accurate and stable results.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>When a well trajectory deviates from the planned path, the driller must make a path correction and the correcting section has to employ a 3D trajectory to hit the predetermined target. Existing methods for planning 3D trajectories are available, but their objectives are only to hit the expected targets. In some cases, however, adjusting the trajectory to the preferred direction is more important than only reaching the target. For example, when drilling horizontal wells, engineers must focus on trajectory direction to land the build-up section successfully and continue drilling the horizontal lateral. The authors proposed a method to make a soft landing of well path, which yields a well trajectory that reaches the expected target from a specified path direction, with no need for trial- and-error procedures.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In a word, the methods in this paper represent significant improvements over the traditional well-path planning and survey calculation techniques, and were programmed into computer software. The results proved satisfactory for directional and horizontal wells in China.</jats:p>",

Three different sets of data, from every twenty years in the years 1952, 1974 and 1998 compiled through the aerial photographic interpretation technique were examined, and a survey research and field survey were undertaken, which were based on the investigation of different houses and different locations of settlements that have affected the inhabitant’s altitude towards environmental concerns. The paper examined two levels in the study for the purpose of (1) the analysis of settlement structure (fabric pattern of settlement) (2) the analysis of change in building types from old types to new types. The findings found that changes in building construction types, which occurred as dwelling, were built in modern style and materials. First, the settlement structure has varied by sites which are related to factors such as space, canals, roads, land sub-divisions, and site patterns in different locations in greater Bangkok. Second, changes in building construction type occurred and dwellings were built in modern styles and materials. Moreover, those changes of building types are correlated with the change in settlement structures in the same way. The transformation process of house forms indicated the change from a traditional to a modern type, which took over forty years in Bangkhu Wiang (urban-fringe), Klong 9-10 and Sai Gong Din (suburb area). Meanwhile the process took twenty years in Mahasawat (urban) since it was the nearest to the CBD.</jats:p>"

The article examines what has been the impact so far. The decision of the Divisional Court in Alconbury at first indicated that Article 6 would require drastic changes to the procedures for determining planning applications and appeals. However, successive decisions of the House of Lords have made clear that, apart from the need to give reasons, at the most Article 6 means that the courts have the potential to look more closely at the fairness of decision-making by planning authorities. Articles 8 and 1 of the First Protocol have had more effect on substantive decision-making by planning authorities but the way the courts have applied the doctrine of proportionality has meant that, except in the case of the granting of injunctions, the courts tend to defer to the superior expertise of the planning authority. </jats:p>",

The special contribution made by creative arts education in shaping PDP will be explored. Ambivalence in the sector as to both PDP\n and writing will be considered in the light of experiments with alternative writing practices. In particular, these will relate to the emergence of personal narrative and authorial voice, detectable in both the visual product and the learning process.

The inherent difficulty is that most design processes and systems exist as independent tools used for individual tasks by the various disciplines involved in the planning process.

The recent wave of enterprise-wide resource planning systems adoptions is a significant commitment of resources and may affect almost all business processes. This study examines the effect of adoption of enterprise systems on a firm's long-term financial performance. A large-scale data identification and collection method compared the financial data of 247 firms adopting enterprise wide systems with a matched control group of firms cross-sectionally and longitudinally before and after adoption. A number of implementation characteristics were also measured and their effects assessed. The results show that firms adopting enterprise systems exhibit higher differential performance only after two years of continued use. Furthermore, controlling for implementation characteristics as vendor choice, implementation goal, modules implemented, and implementation time period, helped explain the financial performance effects of enterprise resource planning system use. These results provide important insights that complement extant research findings and also raise future research issues.</jats:p>",

Emergy 26 Journal of Architectural Research and Studies Volume 2 2004 Faculty of Architecture Thammasat University Analysis Technique is used to calculate the amount of energy required to make something expressed in units of the same form of energy, called Solar Emergy. And Emergy of money, called Embath has also been evaluated. The objectives are to evaluate and compare Emergy and Embath of buildings to help determining the Emergy saving and the environment benefits of buildings and building materials during construction and demolition. The method is to collect and analyze data inputs of cost and quantity from bill of quantity; BOQ of buildings: residences, schools, offices and hospitals for construction and 2 types of structure, halftimber and concrete structure for demolition. Materials during construction and demolition of each building are evaluated. This study examines all factors, which are Emergy, masses and cost, and environmental inputs to create Emergy index and environmental index as well. Four influencing factors effecting Emergy values are found: Renewable resource or structure, non-renewable resource or decoration, building system and labor. Structure is the major factor of residential buildings, schools and office buildings. Decoration is the major factor of hospital buildings. In demolition stage, structure is also the main factor. In demolition stage, Emergy value of half-timber structure buildings is the same as 7 years of energy consumption. Whereas Emergy value of concrete structure building is the same as 19-30 years of energy consumption. Therefore, structure materials should be used in as small amount as possible, especially the high transformity materials. Eventually, the environmental index suggested that using more renewable than non-renewable resource would be appropriate to the environment and the world resource. The building usable life is depend on materials, the more non-renewable resource, the longer life of the materials should be used.</jats:p>"

Indeed, such planning is essential if crisis situations are to be avoided, particularly the double shock to service users of losing their home at a time when they are also bereaved. Most research about future planning has tended to focus on the perspective of the family carer rather than that of the service user. To rectify this situation, this paper considers the findings of a project which directly sought the views of adults with a learning disability, including their experiences of living with their older carers and planning for their future housing and support. The findings demonstrate that adults with a learning disability are very aware of the likelihood of an end to family care and that they have preferences about their future housing and support. However, planning for the future can be difficult because of the mutually supportive relationships that often exist in these families.</jats:p>",

Although not a primary hospice condition, pressure ulcers are not uncommon in dying patients. Their management in hospices, particularly the involvement of family caregivers, has not been studied.

Descriptive qualitative data analysis using grounded theory was utilized.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: The following three themes were identified: (1) the primary role of the hospice nurse is an educator rather than a wound care provider; (2) hospice providers perceive the barriers and burdens of family caregiver involvement in pressure ulcer care to be bodily location of the pressure ulcer, unpleasant wound characteristics, fear of causing pain, guilt, and having to acknowledge the dying process when a new pressure ulcer develops; and (3) the “team effect” describes the collaboration between family caregivers and the health care providers to establish individualized achievable goals of care ranging from pressure ulcer prevention to acceptance of a pressure ulcer and symptom palliation.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Significance of results</jats:italic>: Pressure ulcer care planning is a model of collaborative decision making between family caregivers and hospice providers for a condition that occurs as a secondary condition in hospice. A pressure ulcer places significant burdens on family caregivers distinct from common end-of-life symptoms whose treatment is directed at the patient. Because the goals of pressure ulcer care appear to be individualized for a dying patient and their caregivers, the basis of quality-of-care evaluations should be the process of care rather than the outcome of an incident pressure ulcer.</jats:p>",

The ERP market has become saturated and is on the decline; and emerging from it is the market for small and medium scale enterprises. ERP, especially in India, is being offered by small‐localized players to small and medium sized firms customizing it to the needs and their pockets. Taking this cue, the big ERP players have also started offering complete solutions to the small firms. The paper illustrates this point by using the case example of Prathma, a modern blood bank in India. Prathma has been the first blood bank in India to use ERP to integrate its functions using a customized ERP. This has installed a quality check in its day‐to‐day operations and has significantly lowered costs. The findings of this study indicate that ERP systems promises benefit from increased efficiency to improved quality, productivity, and profitability.</jats:p>",

This paper explores how the local has been manifested in practice, drawing upon an extensive qualitative study of biodiversity action planning in Birmingham, UK, undertaken between 1999 and 2002. Analysis highlights the embedded and geographically uneven character of the process, and a number of local path dependencies are identified that act to both constrain and enable the process. It is concluded that environmental policy tends to accept the positive rhetoric of local action rather uncritically. In practice, the local is manifested in a number of different ways, with highly heterogeneous effects.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Visible and Invisible of Thai Architecture Culture concern with the fundamental problem of theory and concepts developed in contemporary Thai architectural culture. \nTraditional Thai architecture is characterized as a high gable with elevated terrace, a floor, and a courtyard [1], thus, with this perspective; to be genuine traditional ‘Thai’ architecture is to be constructed within this framework. This notion is, however, needed to be re-thought, and re-defined whether it is enough in the development of contemporary Thai architecture. Since, architecture is a dynamic organization, through built form, which brings together human behavior, sociology, economics, social hierarchical order, etc. [2]. Architecture, therefore, cannot be valued merely at its formal representation. It is, itself, life, unfortunately that along the history of architectural development, architecture is mainly perceived merely as a formal representation and leaves out what have generated those particular built forms. Through this; architecture becomes static which leads to nowhere but a museum where is preserved for spectacles, and separated from everyday life. This phenomena has happened in the development of contemporary Thai architecture in which built form is perceived as passive given seperatecy from social factors which lends its body. Thus, many of contemporary Thai architectures have lost its connection, not with the past but, with its time. \nThis established notion is, also, found in most of the cultural studies in which culture is perceived as static and characterized as a symbol of the state or nation, which could not be changed. It becomes problematic since, as soon as culture is reduced to a merely representation, it looses not only its dynamism, but also its force and power. \nThis paper is mainly concentrated on the construction of ‘Thai’ architecture. Attention is given to: \n- the social mechanism of the ‘Thais’ – the invisible, \n- how the invisible effects the construction of architecture, and its organization – the visible, and finally, \n- how architecture, and its organization, both the intangible (space, volume, proportion, scale etc.), and the tangible (form, wall, roof, floor, ornaments, material, etc.) functions in the construction of ‘Thainess.’ \nThis paper is, however, not intended to criticize, nor to put the question of (Thai) Architecture to the conclusion, but rather it is intended to re-think, re-question, and re-define how architectural functions might be, by deferring a thought to the other fields of knowledge to which it might introduce different notions to the development of theory and concept in contemporary Thai architecture. \nAlthough the concentration is on the context of Thai, it is hoped to extend the discussion across the divided line between states and nations to the more broader sense which is what might be the development of theory and concept in architecture also, what architecture can do, to what extent do architectural academic and practices could bring about the value of its creation.</jats:p>"

In this paper the author seeks to develop the research agenda in this area from an economic – geographical perspective that is sensitive to spatial and temporal fluctuations in corporate strategies and investment patterns, the importance of political economic context(s), and the variety of potential developmental outcomes. The paper is structured into two main parts. First, the author offers a review of current levels of retail internationalisation in static and dynamic terms, illustrating that this is a phenomenon that demands more academic attention. The second reveals several limitations in the prevailing management/business approach to the topic, and maps out an explicitly geographical research agenda on the internationalisation of retailing. Six key areas in which research can usefully proceed are identified. </jats:p>",

The well was recently drilled and completed in the 759 area of the northern Soldado Field, offshore Trinidad in approximately 60 feet of water. A multilateral completion was selected over conventional well construction to horizontally access heavy-oil reserves in the Forest 4B and 4C sands, located at true vertical depths of 3850- and 4000-ft respectively. Since the formation parameters included poorly sorted, non-uniform formation characteristics, the completion would have to employ some method of sand control.</jats:p><jats:p>This well represents several \"firsts\" for this area as it not only represents the first multilateral well in Trinidad but also is the first in the area that integrates sand control into a multilateral.</jats:p><jats:p>After reviewing many possibilities, horizontal openhole gravel-pack technology had been selected to provide sand-exclusion. A TAML 4 multilateral well junction was selected originally because it offered a cemented junction with full casing-drift access across the mainbore/lateral interface. When sand was encountered above the junction area, a completion workover was required to convert the existing TAML 4 multilateral junction into a TAML 5 to gain pressure integrity across the junction area.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper will present the initial planning, special considerations, methods for implementation of horizontal gravel pack into multilateral technology, and finally, the rework operation later required for junction conversion.</jats:p>",

We study a class of planning goals where in addition to a main goal there exist other goals, which we call auxiliary goals, that act as constraints to the main goal. Both these type of goals can, in general, be a temporally extended goal. Linear temporal logic (LTL) is inadequate for specification of the overall goals of this type, although, for some situations, it is capable of expressing them separately. A branching-time temporal logic, like CTL, on the other hand, can be used for specifying these goals. However, we are interested in situations where an auxiliary goal has to be satisfiable within a fixed bound. We show that CTL becomes inadequate for capturing these situations. We bring out an existing logic, called min-max CTL, and show how it can effectively be used for the planning purpose. We give a logical framework for expressing the overall planning goals. We propose a sound and complete planning procedure that incorporates a model checking technology. Doing so, we can answer such planning queries as plan existence at the onset besides producing an optimal plan (if any) in polynomial time. </jats:p>",

The second objective is to assess the propensity of financial auditors to consult with information technology (IT) audit specialists within their firm when assessing ERP and non-ERP system risks during the planning stage of an audit. One hundred sixty-five auditors participated in an experiment in which we manipulated system type (ERP versus non-ERP) and measured auditor type (IT audit specialists versus financial auditors). Both auditor types indicate significantly higher business interruption, process interdependency, and overall control risks with the ERP, as compared to the non-ERP, system. Additionally, while IT audit specialists assess significantly higher network, database, and application security risks with the ERP system, financial audits do not recognize higher security risks in these areas. Perceived risk differentials from the non-ERP to the ERP system across all risk categories are significantly greater for IT audit specialists than financial auditors. Finally, financial auditors do not indicate a greater need to consult with IT audit specialists when auditing an ERP versus a non-ERP system and they are equally highly confident in the ability of financial audit teams to assess risks in both computing environments. Overall, evidence from this study suggests that financial auditors may be overconfident in their ability to assess ERP system risks.</jats:p>",

We adopt a grounded theory approach and interview partners in two suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. The results have two implications for the development of family migration theory. First, as dual-earner households make family migration decisions in the context of linked lives, these migration decisions cannot be understood as either economically driven or care driven, being contextualised by both spheres. Second, the importance of intergenerational links may increase the incidence of return migration of later-life dual-earner households. </jats:p>",

Urbanization of the countryside, rural industrialization and housing development, lack of systematic agricultural protection policies and mechanisms for their implementation, and land-development programs are often considered responsible for the conversion of agricultural land to nonagricultural uses. Through a detailed case study of Yuhang in Zhejiang Province, the author attempts to unveil the complexity involved in land-use change in rural China. A variety of data sources, including published and unpublished official documents and statistics, local gazetteers, key informant interviews, and field observations, are employed. The results of the case study indicate a substantial reduction in agricultural land over the last twenty years. However, the path of this decline has not been smooth. The second decade of reform saw much evidence of decline in agricultural land. Spatially, the most severe decrease in agricultural land has been in areas close to urban centers, and with high accessibility. Urban sprawl, rural industrialization, and housing development have all contributed to the loss of agricultural land. But the author concludes that governments at various levels have played contradictory roles in the process of change. Whereas the governments have made a series of policy initiatives to protect agricultural land, they have, however, been the most important players in destabliizing the land base for agricultural production. </jats:p>",

Whether the aim was to increase factory safety, beautify a village, or raise standards of living, the party and the East German government used mass mobilizations to shape society, or at least certain social groups. Communist campaigns were directed attempts to improve diverse sectors of society by concentrating resources on arenas marked as economically deficient and socially resistant. By directing their efforts at revolutionizing narrowly defined critical areas, Communist leaders felt that they could enact overarching societal changes. Campaigns thus served as a means to initiate new policies and to correct problems that developed later. They were an essential part both of the state planning so prevalent in Communist systems, and of the often hectic short-term initiatives endemic in such economies. These mobilization efforts were so critical to the regime that one scholar has declared that the German Democratic Republic (GDR) possessed a campaign, rather than a command economy.</jats:p>",

In this article, she reports the results of a small‐scale survey which looked at the views of 17 parents whose children with severe and/or complex learning difficulties had made the transition from a residential special school to an adult placement. Pa rents were asked their retrospective views on the transition planning process; their own involvement; and how the adult placement met the needs of their children.</jats:p><jats:p>Melanie Smart's findings indicate that the majority of parents were very much involved in the planning process, although they reported struggling to get consistency of approach and basic information. The young people themselves were found to be marginalised in the planning process, with very few being involved in any decision making. Most parents were happy with the eventual placement, but those who had concerns were still pushing for basic services and care. Of those who had suffered placement breakdowns, the major factor was lack of consistency of approach and failure to use prior information about the child.</jats:p><jats:p>This survey shows that parents and their learning disabled children experience difficulties in the transition process. There seems to be a distinct lack of person‐centred planning, particularly with this user group, by both child and adult services. Parents are vital to this type of planning approach, particularly when the young people themselves cannot voice their needs or advocate their own rights to quality service provision. Melanie Smart argues that parents need access to better quality information and reassurance that their children will receive the services they deserve as young adults. The various agencies, she asserts, need to work together to ensure that the transition process is effective.</jats:p>",

Even though it has long been recognized that univariate spatial association measures such as Moran's I and Geary's c are special cases of Mantel's generalized association statistic, an intensive and comprehensive examination of the connections, particularly in terms of significance testing has never been undertaken. Furthermore, researchers have faced difficulties in dealing with spatial weights matrices with nonzero diagonal elements, and establishing the significance testing method for bivariate spatial association measures such as Cross–Moran and Lee's L. The author demonstrates that the proposed extended Mantel test can be applied to any global measure of spatial association with any form of spatial weights matrix in order to approximate the first two moments of the measures. A Monte Carlo simulation for each measure with various forms of spatial weights matrices confirms the exactness of the approximation. </jats:p>",

Reducing operating cost has the single most significant impact on this objective but has become more challenging to minimize, as the deviated wells required to economically exploit reserves, necessitate highly accurate placement and increasingly advanced engineering. Rapid evaluation cycle times and operational lost time prevention are critical to cost reduction.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will detail how the well design process and WITSML enabled real-time drilling information is conducted and visualized in one 3D view. It will demonstrate how this increased efficiency, contributed to better well placement and reduced operational cost, by complementing technical expertise and increasing collaboration, through a multidiscipline workflow approach.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This change in working practice culminated in the success of achieving the worlds fastest drilled well of more than 8000m measured depth, from a sub sea template.</jats:p>",

Therefore it should serve as a criterion for treatment planning in social psychiatric institutions. </jats:p><jats:p> Aim: We looked at the QoL of our outpatients diagnosed with schizophrenia in order to identify possible areas of life that might need further attention in treatment planning. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods: We used the short German version of the Lancashire Quality of Life Profile (BLEP-KF) to evaluate the QoL of 164 schizophrenic outpatients. All patients were diagnosed with the International Diagnostic Checklists (IDCL) for ICD-10. Demographic and treatment data are analysed cross-sectionally in relation to their QoL. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: The majority of patients was moderately happy with their general QoL. They were least satisfied in the domains of job and financial situation, mental health and sexuality. Psychopathology and especially the quality of individual care had a significant influence on the evaluation of QoL. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: This result supports an argument in favour of more individual patient-centred forms of case management to reduce the burden of severe psychopathological symptoms experienced in everyday activities by patients suffering from schizophrenia. </jats:p>",

The findings show that, in general, middle-aged Hong Kong adults do little retirement planning. Retirement planning behaviors focus on a very narrow set of activities, including financial and health planning. Of the 19 planning variables, only a few were significantly related to perception of sufficiency in retirement planning and retirement satisfaction. More important, middle-aged adults in Hong Kong no longer feel that they can depend on their family for support for retirement planning or satisfaction during retirement. The lack of private and public support for retirement planning left the respondents feeling unsure as to whether they have the capability to plan sufficiently for retirement. The discussion concludes with policy implications related to assisting middle-aged individuals in planning for retirement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p><jats:bold>Aim </jats:bold> One of the limitations to using species’ distribution atlases in conservation planning is their coarse resolution relative to the needs of local planners. In this study, a simple approach to downscale original species atlas distributions to a finer resolution is outlined. If such a procedure yielded accurate downscaled predictions, then it could be an aid to using available distribution atlases in real‐world local conservation decisions.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Location </jats:bold> Europe.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods </jats:bold> An iterative procedure based on generalized additive modelling is used to downscale original European 50 × 50 km distributions of 2189 plant and terrestrial vertebrate species to <jats:italic>c.</jats:italic> 10 × 10 km grid resolution. Models are trained on 70% of the original data and evaluated on the remaining 30%, using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) procedure. Fitted models are then interpolated to a finer resolution. A British dataset comprising distributions of 81 passerine‐bird species in a 10 × 10 km grid is used as a test bed to assess the accuracy of the downscaled predictions. European‐wide, downscaled predictions are further evaluated in terms of their ability to reproduce: (1) spatial patterns of coincidence in species richness scores among different groups; and (2) spatial patterns of coincidence in richness, rarity and complementarity hotspots.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> There was a generally good agreement between downscaled and observed fine‐resolution distributions for passerine species in Britain (median Jaccard similarity = 70%; lower quartile = 36%; upper quartile = 88%). In contrast, the correlation between downscaled and observed passerine species richness was relatively low (<jats:italic>rho</jats:italic> = 0.31) indicating a pattern of error propagation through the process of overlaying downscaled distributions for many species. It was also found that measures of model accuracy in fitting original data (ROC) were a poor predictor of models’ ability to interpolate distributions at fine resolutions (<jats:italic>rho</jats:italic> = −0.10). Although European hotspots were not fully coincident between observed and modelled coarse‐resolution data, or between modelled coarse resolution and modelled downscaled data, there was evidence that downscaled distributions were able to maintain original cross‐taxon coincidence of species‐richness scores, at least for terrestrial vertebrate groups. Downscaled distributions were also able to uncover important environmental gradients otherwise blurred by coarse‐resolution data.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Main conclusions </jats:bold> Despite uncertainties, downscaling procedures may prove useful to identify reserves that are more meaningfully related to local patterns of environmental variation. Potential errors arising from the presence of false positives may be reduced if downscaled‐distribution records projected to occur outside the range of original coarse‐resolution data are excluded. However, the usefulness of this procedure may be limited to data‐rich regions. If downscaling procedures are applied to data‐poor regions, then there is a need to undertake further research to understand the structure of error in models. In particular, it would be important to investigate which species are poorly modelled, where and why. Without such an assessment it is difficult to support unsupervised use of downscaled data in most real‐world situations.</jats:p>",

Subsurface and surface technologies were integrated. Part of the integration involved employing an integrated asset model. The integrated asset model (IAM) tool included a surface pipeline network simulator, coupled to wellbore models, reservoir inflow models, and material balance models for the entire field. This application addresses modeling of tight gas reservoirs with nodal analysis models in a manner that incorporates the transient aspects in the nodal analysis. The reservoir in this study had a high temperature, and thus water vapor was accounted for in the pressure drop calculations of both the wellbores and the surface pipelines. The modeling of compressors in the surface pipeline network model is also addressed. Modeling compressors with low suction pressure was found to be extremely challenging. Limitations and areas for improvement are discussed.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Facility modifications to increase gas production, profitability, and gas reserves were identified. Better management of individual wells routed to particular compressors is expected to increase gas recovery by lowering overall field abandonment pressure.</jats:p>",

Accumulating data indicate that a diet characterised by low-glycaemic index (GI) foods may improve the management of diabetes or lipid profiles. The objective of the present meta-analysis was to critically analyse the scientific evidence that low-GI diets have beneficial effects on carbohydrate and lipid metabolism compared with high-GI diets. We searched for randomised controlled trials with a crossover or parallel design published in English between 1981 and 2003, investigating the effect of low-GI <jats:italic>v</jats:italic>. high-GI diets on markers for carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Unstandardised differences in mean values were examined using the random effects model. The main outcomes were fructosamine, glycated Hb (HbA<jats:sub>1c</jats:sub>), HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Literature searches identified sixteen studies that met the strict inclusion criteria. Low-GI diets significantly reduced fructosamine by –0·1 (95 % CI –0·20, 0·00) mmol/l (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·05), HbA<jats:sub>1c</jats:sub> by 0·27 (95 % CI –0·5, –0·03) % (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·03), total cholesterol by –0·33 (95 % CI –0·47, –0·18) mmol/l (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&gt;0·0001) and tended to reduce LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic subjects by –0·15 (95 % CI –0·31, –0·00) mmol/l (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0·06) compared with high-GI diets. No changes were observed in HDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations. No substantial heterogeneity was detected, suggesting that the effects of low-GI diets in these studies were uniform. Results of the present meta-analysis support the use of the GI as a scientifically based tool to enable selection of carbohydrate-containing foods to reduce total cholesterol and to improve overall metabolic control of diabetes.</jats:p>",

However, transportation is planned manually at present, and it is difficult to quickly formulate an efficient plan. In this context, air transportation planning is considered a transport problem, and an air transportation planning method using a mutually coupled neural network composed of binary neurons, while considering the hardware implementation, is proposed. In the proposed neural network, air transportation planning is partitioned into three subproblems, which are successively solved by three neuron blocks. By this provision, the scale of the problem is reduced and the solution is derived efficiently. Several practical problems with various numbers of aircraft and transportation demands are considered, and simulations are performed using the neural network with various parameters. An examination of the results reveals that the proposed neural network is able to determine whether the air transportation planning can be performed with high speed and high accuracy. In other words, the proposed method is an efficient solution method with many advantages. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The project took place over a two-year period and was sponsored by the UK Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (formerly the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions). The results of the study are reported in three separate papers. In this paper we present an overview of the project and then describe in detail both the process of modelling out-migration rates from origins across England and Wales and the calibration results from this modelling stage. The results yield important information on the determinants of out-migration and population re-distribution within England and Wales. In paper 2 we describe the modelling of the destination choices of migrants and the calibration results from such models. In paper 3 we tie both the out-migration and the destination choice results together into a mapping and visualisation system (MIGMOD) which can be used to assess the impacts of various policies on population movements in England and Wales. The simple policy scenarios reported in this third paper are illustrative and indicative of the model's potential, rather than necessarily being a true reflection of the effects of policy changes. The three papers contribute substantially to the existing migration literature because they present the most exhaustive analysis of the determinants of both out-migration and destination choice that has ever been undertaken. The number of variables in both modelling processes is far larger than has ever been assembled before and the results therefore provide much greater insight into the role of various attributes in determining out-migration rates and in-migration rates than has previously been possible. The papers also provide an interesting lesson in a problem rarely encountered—that of having too much data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The time required to deliver intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments can be significantly longer than conventional treatments, especially for the segmented multileaf collimator (sMLC) delivery system with a large record and verification (R&amp;V) overhead. In this work, we evaluate the impact of the number of intensity‐modulated beams (IMBs) and the number of intensity levels (ILs) on the quality and delivery efficiency of IMRT plans, generated by the Corvus planning system for sMLC delivery on a Siemens LINAC with the Lantis R&amp;V system. Detailed studies were performed for three image data sets of previously treated oropharyngeal patients. Treatment plans for patient 1 were developed using 5, 7, 9, or 15 evenly spaced axial IMBs as well as one with 7 axial IMBs whose directions were user‐selected, each using ILs of 3, 5, 10, or 20. For patients 2 and 3, plans with 15 IMBs and 20 ILs were not attempted. A total of 42 plans were developed using three oropharyngeal cancer CT image data sets. Plan quality was evaluated by assessing compliance with the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) H‐0022 protocol criteria and the physician's clinical judgment. Plan efficiency was accessed by the number of segments of each plan. We found that for our treatment‐planning and delivery system, an IMRT plan that uses a moderate number of IMBs and ILs, such as 7 or 9 IMBs with 3 or 5 ILs, would appear to be the optimal approach when both quality of the plan and delivery efficiency are considered. Based on this study, we have routinely used 9 IMBs with 3 ILs or 7 IMBs with 5 ILs for head and neck patients. A retrospective comparison indicates that delivery efficiency is improved on the order of 30% compared to plans generated with 9 IMBs with 5 ILs.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Park and ride (P&amp;R) facilities have been proposed in several countries to alleviate the accessibility problems in cities. Despite growing accessibility problems, these facilities do not seem to attract the expected number of car drivers and are underused. In an attempt to measure consumer evaluations of the attributes of P&amp;R facilities, a stated choice experiment, based on the method of hierarchical information integration, was conducted in the city of Nijmegen, The Netherlands. This paper documents the major results of this study, which differs from previous research in that a large range of attributes is examined, including accessibility of the facility, the quality of the facility, and the features of connecting transport. In addition, context variables affect the decisionmaking process of car drivers such as weather, having heavy luggage and travel purpose were incorporated in the study design. The results indicate that social safety, quality of the connecting public transport and relative travel times by transport modes are key attributes to the success of P&amp;R facilities. Contextual variables seem to have only a minor impact. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When planning experiments to examine how product performance depends on the design, manufacture and environment of use, there are invariably too few resources to enable a complete investigation of all possible variables (factors). We have developed new algorithms for generating and assessing efficient two-stage group screening strategies which are implemented through a web-based system called GISEL. This system elicits company knowledge which is used to guide the formulation of competing two-stage strategies and, via the algorithms, to provide quantitative assessment of their efficiencies. The two-stage group screening method investigates the effect of a large number of factors by grouping them in a first stage experiment whose results identify factors to be further investigated in a second stage. Central to the success of the procedure is ensuring that the factors considered, and their grouping, are based on the best available knowledge of the product. The web-based software system allows information and ideas to be contributed by engineers at different sites and allows the experiment organizer to use these expert opinions to guide decisions on the planning of group screening experiments. The new group screening algorithms implemented within the software give probability distributions and indications of the total resource needed for the experiment. In addition, the algorithms simulate results from the experiment and estimate the percentage of important or active main effects and interactions that fail to be detected. The approach is illustrated through the planning of an experiment on engine cold start optimization at Jaguar Cars.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a ‘Human in the Loop' evaluation of an early prototype mixed-initiative control system that generated plans for single operator supervision of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) missions. The objectives of the evaluation were to assess to what extent human operators were able to understand the plans generated by the automated controllers as well as to point to additional support requirements to drive further development of mixed-initiative planning systems. Six former fighter pilots served as test participants. Multiple convergent measures were utilized to evaluate the ability of users to understand and evaluate the plans generated by the automated controller. While test participants were able to understand the plans, the results provided compelling evidence for the need to communicate more effectively the rationale behind plan elements proposed by the automated controller and to provide ‘levers' to enable the user to modify the plan. These results point to important challenges for design of ‘mixed-initiative’ controllers to enable the human and automated controller to function as effective ‘partners’. </jats:p>",
