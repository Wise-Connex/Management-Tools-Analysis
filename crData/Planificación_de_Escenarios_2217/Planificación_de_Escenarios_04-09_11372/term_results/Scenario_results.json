It is indicated that the surface temperature, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature over China rise by 0.3~2.3°C, 0.1~2.0°C, and 0.5~2.7°C, respectively, and warming s generally larger toward high latitudes and gradually intensifies with time march. In addition, the warming of variables mentioned above is larger in winter than synchronizing summer, and the enhancement of minimum temperature is larger than maximum temperature in the corresponding period, which consequently leads to the smaller intra‐seasonal variation of surface temperature. The winter anomalies of sea level pressure over East Asia are confined within –1.0hPa to 0.4hPa and exhibit a belt‐like distribution, with the positive (negative) values in south (north) East Asia. Moreover, the anomaly will become larger, and the zero contour line will move southward with time running. At the same time larger negative values appear in northeast, north, and west China. The sea level pressure anomalies in summer generally resemble that in winter. It is also shown that summer precipitation will increase by 0.1~0.8mm/d over most parts of Qinghai‐Xizang Plateau, southeast China, and Hetao region during 2001~2030.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The clothing or garments industry has developed rapidly during the past some decades and has contributed to the economic growth of many nations, both developed and developing countries. This industry has been very much regulated by many bilateral agreements such as Multi Fiber Arrangement (MFA), a quota arrangement made by the importing countries. As MFA (quota regime) comes to an end by 2005 and integrates into the WTO regime, it will bring opportunities to highly competitive and proactive garment exporting countries whereas the challenges will be faced more by the less competitive countries. Issues related to environment and social compliance, technology requirements etc. have been brought into surface by the importing countries, which may worsen the condition. Under the above scenario, it is imperative that certain proactive measures be taken. Thus, the broad objective of this study is to analyze the response of the garment exporters from Indonesia towards the emerging issues related to environmental and social compliance, technology requirements etc. The present study is a questionnaire-based study. The samples have been selected from the Directories of largest exporters in the country. With reminders and persuasion, the final number of useable responses has been 115 Indonesian garment exporters. Seven factors of the emerging issues were identified by using factor analysis. In addition, factors of competitiveness, and the strategies adopted by the exporters have also been analyzed. The findings show that the overall perceptions of the Indonesia garment exporters indicate that Indonesia is less competitive as compared to other competing countries.</jats:p>"

A key is to have technology and work processes supporting the complex evaluation of projects as a whole, i.e. from subsurface to processing with economics, while preserving physical fidelity and interdependent uncertainties.

However, practical limitations and little theoretical guidance for individualizing instructional events to learners' needs have rendered difficult the realization of this potential. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for intelligent, scenario-based training that iteratively and adaptively tailors training events to the unique needs of the learner. Drawing from advances in assessment and psychometric theory, the proposed framework allows decomposition of scenarios into component elements, empirical investigation of how these elements influence training performance, and adaptive generation of scenario content that targets the occurrence of subjective learning events. </jats:p>",

To help non-programmers develop agent-based intelligent tutoring systems, PLASTIC includes GUI-based agent specification and performance visualization tools. PLASTIC agents provide instructional scaffolding by offering helpful hints that highlight task-relevant aspects of problems, help trainees think about tasks appropriately, guide trainees through unfamiliar problems, and encourage new strategy formation. To demonstrate how PLASTIC is used to implement agent-based instructional systems, a tutor incorporated into an Anti-Air Warfare Coordinator (AAWC) scenariobased training system is discussed. The technology through which PLASTIC tracks AAWC trainee actions and produces instructional scaffolding is discussed. The instructional impact of the PLASTIC tutor incorporated into the AAWC scenario-based trainer is illustrated with a discussion of training effectiveness data. </jats:p>",

In an effort to provide new insights on this important issue, the present study examined the appropriateness of four rating formats (i.e., checklists, frequency count, distance and discrepancy, and rating scale) for six performance outcomes, three process variables, and three purposes of scenario-based training. Expert judgments were collected via a short survey. The results indicated that for nine of the 12 variables a single measurement strategy was most appropriate. However, the results also indicated that experts tended to over rely on rating scales as their preferred choice.

The military would like to leverage this capability in training simulators, however scenario-based training (SBT) differs from classroom instruction in significant ways. This symposium focuses on ITS methodological extensions that support SBT. The paper by Neville and her colleagues (2004) describes, among other things, why scenario-based training is important in military domains. The remaining papers in the symposium (Douglass, 2004; Mangos, 2004; Dorsey, White &amp; Bolton, 2004) describe different ways of incorporating ITS concepts into SBT systems. While each paper describes a different system architecture / approach, all three systems focus on implementing two key capabilities of ITSs: student diagnosis and adaptive instruction. While most of the work discussed in this symposium is in a preliminary stage of development, the convergence of these two fields holds great promise for increasing military training effectiveness, as well as many opportunities for conducting future research. </jats:p>",

STRATA will use synthetic agents embedded in a virtual training environment when human players needed to play the part of team members are missing. As part of DARWARS, DARPA's Training Superiority program that is establishing persistent, online training worlds, STRATA will provide these training opportunities with low-footprint, portable hardware. An Event-Based Approach to Training (EBAT) is being used to facilitate highly context specific training and to support generalization to a variety of mission types. The first STRATA application demonstrates Close Air Support (CAS) training. A cognitive task analysis of representative CAS missions, identifying decision making requirements, radio communications, and coordination, has been conducted in order to develop our synthetic models and help identify observable triggering conditions necessary to measure performance targeted in the EBAT method. In order to support the project goals of individual and team-centered training, a generalizable training architecture, and the reuse of cognitive agents across mission types, scenario and training management systems, as well as a cognitive agent library (CAL) are being developed. </jats:p>",
