A variety of courts have upheld restrictive land-use controls, including some based solely on aesthetic considerations. Courts have also been friendly to tougher enforcement measures. The concept of impact fees has enjoyed more recent play in the literature than in the courts, while the friendly treatment of linkage requirements in the literature has not been supported by the courts. </jats:p>",

The development is also taking place in the Nordic countries alongside a ‘decentralisation’ of financial and managerial decision making to smaller units. The essay discusses possibilities to introduce clinical accountability on the Nordic scene. As a background to the anlaysis, clinical accountability is defined in terms of production targets, budget limits and preset standards of quality of care. Arguments for not using clinical outcome as result measure are presented. The product analogy is suggested as a means for the physician manager to control both clinical policies and resource management. The conclusion is that the possibilities to introduce clinical accountability in the Nordic countries probably are better than in the US or UK, for the following reasons: physician attitudes, interpreted indirectly by shown interest in management training are not unfavourable; the organisational structure with physicians in a line organisation gives the financially accountable Department Head professional as well as managerial authority; management policy stressing decentralisation increases autonomy and stimulates interest to involve in management; product control information is readily available through reliable information systems. Obstacles are also identified. Finally it is argued that the organisation structure found in Nordic countries enables clinical accountability still preserving clinical freedom in the singular doctor patient relation.</jats:p>",

A key objective of this ‘marketing orientation’ has been to effect responsible change in the way health services are designed, priced, advertised, and delivered. Implementation of such a philosophy—inconceivable just a few years ago—was originally motivated by the emergence of competitive market forces in the hospital and health care sector. In the current paper, a perspective on the precursors and facilitating factors that gave rise to these forces is presented. With this perspective, the review of two relevant books, one published at the beginning of the 1980s and one towards the end of the decade, will serve as a measure of the large and increasing impact of competition in the U.S. health care sector during the 1980s.</jats:p>",

The facilities to be\nlocated may be “primary facilities”, e.g. factories, but\nmore often, these are lighter “secondary facilities” such as\ndepots, warehouses or distribution centres. Routing decisions concern\nthe optimal movement of goods and vehicles in the system, usually from\nprimary to secondary facilities, and from secondary facilities to users\nor customers. Studies which integrate the two areas are more often than\nnot limited to the case where all deliveries are return trips involving\nonly one destination. There exist, however, several situations where\nvehicles visit more than one point on the same trip. In such cases,\nrelationships between location and routing decisions become more\nintricate. Strategies by which the two aspects of the problem are\noptimised separately and sequentially are often sub‐optimal. Also of\nimportance is the trade‐off between the cost of providing service and\ncustomer inconvenience. A framework is proposed for the study of such\ncombined location‐routing problems.

The US urban system of each of the above time periods is disaggregated into seven population-size classes and nine geographic regions. A total of fifty-one equations are estimated. Although the statistical results of the allometric equations classified according to population are not satisfactory, the equations classified according to region are superior. Among the major findings for the US urban system are: the existence of the dynamic similarity model, the existence of negative allometry, the lack of support for the hypothesized relationship between the allometric coefficients and the changes in the population density profiles, and that continental USA is divided into regions of ‘negative allometric’ or ‘toward isometric’ and ‘stable’ or ‘unstable’ growth patterns. </jats:p>",

As hypothesized, young adults with dependents and women regardless of whether they had dependents were more likely to have wills and have arranged for disposition of their bodies. However, contrary to expectation, they were not less likely to deny their own dying. Having dependents or being female correlated for young adults with concrete behaviors concerning, but not with a corresponding change in attitude toward, their own dying or death.

It is suggested that this can serve a wide variety of analytical, cartographic, and policy purposes, including the creation of spatial indicators of economic and social conditions and enhancing the value of census data.

This is the first of three papers in which the relationships involved in these processes are explored. A series of theoretical problems arising from the argument are dealt with, principally relating to its seeming economic determinism and to an inappropriately narrow treatment of crisis and social change. In the subsequent papers, in this journal, these various ideas will be used to reflect on housing market and related social change in Melbourne from the 1930s to the 1980s. </jats:p>",

The difficulty of measuring intangibles and the frustration inherent in commonly used methods of obtaining public input are major obstacles to correcting this unfortunate situation. In this paper we suggest a strategy for overcoming these difficulties. A procedure is presented for obtaining public input with respect to such intangibles as aesthetic values in the visual environment. Several examples illustrate how the approach has been applied. The procedure differs from current practice in a number of respects. The Reasonable Person Model, offered here as a psychologically more appropriate framework than the widely adopted Rational Man position, provides both a rationale for these differences and a guide to their implementation. This model‐guided procedure can (a) make public concerns more articulate, (b) make better use of the talents of the environmental professional, and (c) make the process considerably more satisfying for all concerned.</jats:p>",

The theoretical basis of the approach is presented, as well as the description of the equations. The model was successfully calibrated with socioeconomic data for Belgium, 1970–84. A simple scenario is used to make a preliminary exploration of the future evolution of Belgium, but this will be dealt with much more fully elsewhere. The main object of this approach is to develop a learning tool for the socioeconomic system, which will suggest what is ‘normal’ and what is not, and hence what further refinements or changes are required. </jats:p>",

It is shown that for regular triangular and irregular spatial patterns of firms, areas of intense spatial competition are larger when transport costs are proportional to euclidean distances rather than to block distances, but this is not true for a regular square pattern. In an irregular pattern of firms, for each metric, the proportion of a firm's market-area in the area of intense spatial competition varies markedly from firm to firm. The locational and pricing behavior of firms is expected to be influenced by the size and locations of these areas of spatial competition. </jats:p>",

The methodology uses five phases: goal setting, identification of reuse opportunities, development and evaluation of planning alternatives, assessment of water reuse linkages, and making decisions and recommendations. A tool called “input‐output modeling” is used in the third phase to present numerical data and choices. The methodology seeks to integrate the hydrologic and socio‐economic aspects of water resources planning in the area of study.</jats:p><jats:p>Water reuse may satisfy some of the increasing demands for water in the world, but water quality, economics, public attitudes, and legal and institutional constraints may impose limits on the extent to which it can be employed. The challenge in planning systems is to maximize the utilization of water reuse in the fact of these constraints. The importance of multidisciplinary collaboration cannot be overemphasized.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper assesses the potential for water reclamation and reuse in developing countries by considering the relationships among the pertinent technical, social, economic, and environmental parameters. Generally, the planning process for water reuse has focused on specific technological processes, but in order to ensure the efficient transfer of waste water reuse technology into the society, the methodology seeks to provide a conceptual model which integrates the hydrologic and socioeconomic aspects of water resources planning and water reuse within the study area.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the aftermath of the recession of 1981 – 82, change has been sweeping through corporate enterprise in Great Britain. Long-established companies have been taken to the brink of failure, and have drawn back to reorganize, recapitalize, and restructure. In this paper the broader underpinnings of this process of sharp reconfiguration are speculated upon, and it is hinted that it represents a fundamental ‘phase-shift’ in the process of economic development—by producing new forms and structures, new opportunities and threats, and new strengths and weaknesses. With regard to policy matters, it is suggested that the emergent new order offers a particular challenge in rendering past performance a poor guide to future outcomes, and demands a reconceptualization of the processes by which these policies seek to intervene to achieve regional or local advantage. </jats:p>",

It is often suggested that their reduced dependence on the financial and technological treadmills driving farm development leads them to have less impact than full-time producers on the farmed landscape. Some evidence in support of this view, drawn from a survey of landscape change between 1970 and 1985 on more than 200 farms in southern England, is presented. At the same time, the findings caution against generalisation and emphasise the need to disaggregate the results. In particular, it is essential to ascertain the different roles part-time farming is playing in the development of capitalist agriculture and the strategies of farm households. There is as much variation in the rates of landscape change between types of part-time business as between full-time and part-time farming. </jats:p>",
