      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The rationale for public involvement in the health sector lies mainly in realizing equity values. As the Gesellschaft relationship of utility maximization cannot be relied upon to arrive at a level of health care regarded as equitable in geographic and other terms, this article argues that there is need to focus on the Gemeinschaft relationship of humanitarian concern. Policy‐makers would, firstly, have to define explicitly the objectives at each policy level; and, secondly, to convince and educate the public and the health providers that such is the way forward. At the operational level, the Japanese‐style management with its emphasis on the mutual commitment of the management and the workers to the organization, would seem to offer a way to unify the fragmented interests within the hospital setting. A comparative study of the health systems of the UK, Japan and the US is made to evaluate the constraints and opportunities each country faces, or would face, in realizing the Gemeinschaft concept at the policy and operational levels. The conclusion reached is that, despite the difficulties, this concept appears to offer a viable alternative to the intensified conflict for resources in the health sector.</jats:p>",

This achievement has taken place in the context of a development strategy oriented, in part, to the elimination of the worst aspects of poverty. Using recent cross‐section data, this paper provides a statistical assessment of the extent to which health resources are evenly distributed in contemporary China, and the degree to which improvements in health resource availability may account for the observed variation in mortality levels. Contrary to expectation, the analysis finds that substantial inequalities do remain in the distribution of health resources, and that these differentials are principally associated with levels of urban income and urbanization. However, these differences in health resource availability do not appear to explain the significant variation which also persists in mortality levels, a finding consistent with the results of similar analyses for developed countries.</jats:p>",

At present, Canada is struggling to implement feasible reductions of expansionary pressures in the health care system. While provincial governments tend to see the issue as one of controlling chronic excess demand, federal government is still concerned to ensure free access to care on an equitable basis. Thus the problems of downsizing can be expressed by the provinces in terms of an ideological struggle with an unfeeling central government which does not understand their problems; although all know they are really about the feasibility of continuing to provide a service to meet demand.</jats:p><jats:p>The present economic recession enables provincial governments to appeal to their voters for support in a new way. Earlier, the appeal was to <jats:italic>consumers</jats:italic> to become involved in health service organization management and this policy succeeded, to a degree, where there were flourishing grass roots communities; albeit that the service continued to be driven by professionals. Now the appeal is to <jats:italic>taxpayers</jats:italic> for their strong support in cost cutting. This has been more successful. Provincial governments are now permitted to ‘touch the untouchables’, that is to downsize the medical profession and previously sacrosanct health care institutions. They also are exploring the feasibility of introducing a two‐tier system which would provide basic care for everyone and extra care for those able to pay, thus side‐stepping federal conditions. By reorganizing support in this way, provincial governments have extended the range of policy choices, and two types of planning, the rational and the political, have now become combined into strategic management activity.</jats:p>",

Procedures were developed to involve design, production, testing, and material personnel in the overhaul process from preplanning through completion of the production phase, with the resulting synergism and open communication. The systems approach was replaced with zone by stage sequenced work packaging with as much work as possible done off the ship. Computer Aided Design (CAD) and photogrammetry were applied to enhance preplanning and off-ship work. Puget Sound Naval Shipyard's application of zone logic is drawn from the research managed by the Maritime Administration's National Shipbuilding Research Program which has introduced the highly successful scientific shipbuilding systems developed in Japan. In brief, this concept represents a shift in logic from system to zone orientation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmentalism is an elusive concept with many meanings. In this paper its changing character is examined together with an analysis of how it is likely to influence public policy across a broad front. The major environmental issues which OECD countries are likely to face nationally, regionally, and globally over the next twenty years are reviewed and the type of politics that may emerge within the new environmentalism is discussed. The overriding global issues will be the tragic interconnection between poverty and environmental damage in the underdeveloped countries. In the developed but deindustrialising economies of the ‘North’, greatest attention will be placed on devising means for creating jobs and providing satisfying occupations for people forced out of a job or never in employment. Environmental rehabilitation can create jobs, but it will involve the denial of resources otherwise available to create jobs elsewhere. It will therefore be necessary to consider the ‘next job effectiveness’ of environmental policies. Another policy area that requires new thinking is the management of environmental hazards, notably how to dispose of toxic wastes in a manner acceptable to a majority of people. Finally, serious efforts will have to be made, not only to infuse environmental principles within all policy arenas, but also to ensure that departmental responsibilities and budgets are properly linked. The principle that those who exploit environmental resources should, by means of transfer taxes and payments, subsidise those who use environmental resources frugally and benignly should also become established. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the impact of consistency requirements upon the formulation of multidimensional population projection models is dealt with. The problem of internal consistency arises when certain output variables of the model have to be consistent with one another, as in models containing marital status (two-sex problem). External consistency problems arise when certain output variables have to satisfy externally specified restrictions. For instance, regional population projections may have to add up to national projections. The paper gives internal and external consistency algorithms, which control both for stock and for flow variables. Two approaches are discussed: a simple proportional adjustment for each relevant demographic component and an approach that minimises deviations in age-specific patterns of the input rates. Both algorithms are illustrated using data from the Netherlands. In the first illustration the internal consistency algorithm is applied to the age, sex, and marital-status-specific model of the official 1980 national population forecasts. In the second, external consistency is considered within the context of the multiregional projection model which was constructed for the regional population forecasts for the Netherlands. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One significant contributory factor to regional economic disparities in the United Kingdom is the much higher rate of new firm formation in the South East and adjacent counties compared with the peripheral regions. However, recent evidence tentatively suggests that contrasts between regions in the emergence of rapid-growth small firms might be a still more significant source of uneven regional development. In the absence of a suitable data source, recourse is made to listings of small firms that have been judged either on technological or on financial criteria as being ‘successful’ and, by implication, growing rapidly; this evidence confirms that such firms are disproportionately concentrated in the South East and parts of East Anglia and the South West and scarce in peripheral regions. This geographical pattern is interpreted as being largely an outcome of the underlying occupational structure of the United Kingdom which results in southern England having the greatest supply of new firm founders with the necessary abilities, skills, and motivation to establish businesses with the capability of achieving rapid growth. The economic milieu of southern England reinforces its structural advantage. Recent economic developments in Scotland support the view that policymakers can, over the longer term, achieve changes in regional industrial and occupational structures and economic milieu which make an area more conducive for the emergence of rapid-growth small firms. However, current UK regional policy makes no attempt to achieve such changes; it therefore seems likely that the geographical distribution of successful small firms will continue to be highly concentrated in southern England to the detriment of peripheral regions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The impact of selectivity bias on returns to migration between industries within or between regions is an important issue that remains more or less unresolved. Contrary to the commonly held belief that a migrant's decision to change his location is independent of his decision to change his industry of employment, this paper provides evidence that these movements are in fact interrelated. An analysis of migration that does not take account of this link may overlook the important implications of many socioeconomic variables in the migration process. Hence a comprehensive analysis of the various determinants of migration is performed. The determinants are classified under three groups—regional, industrial, and personal factors. The joint migration behaviour is considered as belonging to one of four mutually exclusive categories— change of location but not industry, change of industry but not the location, change of neither the location nor the industry, and change of both. The impact of individual determinants upon total as well as compound probability of each type of migration decision is analysed. Distinguishing among migration decisions provides a revealing picture of the returns to migration. The empirical findings reflect the presence of significant self-selection in migration decisions. The selectivity bias is found to be more pronounced in the case of industry migrants than for provincial migrants. Furthermore, it is also found that a positive bias is more likely to occur in the estimated earnings than is a negative bias. The existence of positive bias lends support to comparative advantages in migrant earnings. Given the estimates of earnings corresponding to various migration decisions, a rank ordering of the migrant categories is made. On the whole, migration between industries is found to result in a higher return than is migration between provinces. </jats:p>",

This model, derived from theoretical concepts, nevertheless has been used in practice by companies for the evaluation of their own specific business development and has also been used for training small firm advisers. Observation of the development process enables a characterization of methods of planning used and evaluation of their influence. This indicates clearly the absence of formal planning models but underlines the importance of the strategic awareness and personal commitment of the owner manager in pursuing particular objectives. Strategic awareness is defined and its relationships with forms of assistance are explored. Implications are then drawn for those who seek to assist small businesses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The problem of determining the appropriate stock replenishment quantity within a time‐phased requirements planning environment has received considerable research attention in recent years. Relative performance characteristics of lot‐sizing policies have been assessed as a function of the cost structure, the demand pattern, the product structure, forecast error, the length of the planning horizon, and the interaction between replenishment quantities and sequencing decisions. In particular, the relationship between lot sizing behavior and variability in the requirements profile has been intensely investigated. However, despite these efforts, the empirical evidence linking lotsizing performance with demand variability remains inconclusive. This article suggests that, in part, some of the ambiguity in the literature may be an artifact of a failure to adequately control for other important dimensions of simulated demand sequences. The features that have been thought to describe “lumpy” requirements profiles are discussed and the characteristic of periodicity or time‐dependency in the demand entries is identified as a variable that has been insufficiently controlled in prior work. A reanalysis of the demand sequences originally published by Kaimann, and subsequently used in a number of comparative lot‐sizing studies, reveals that the patterns differ not only in variability as measured by the coefficient of variation, but also in terms of correlation structure as described by the autocorrelation function. Alternative methods for simulating demand sequences are reviewed and a correlation transfer technique, which has the capability to simultaneously control both the degree of variability and correlation, is suggested as an improved method for the generation of synthetic sequences of “lumpy” demand. Using this technique, five of Kaimann's original sequences are rearranged, resulting in three sets of sequences differing only in the strength of serial correlation. Four lot‐sizing procedures are applied to each of these sets to discern if the correlation structure has any appreciable effect on lot‐sizing performance. Results indicate that, on average, higher total inventory costs are experienced when the demand environment is characterized by randomness. Economic order quantity and part‐period balancing achieve lowest average costs when confronted with highly autocorrelated demand or patterns of few runs; conversely, minimum cost per period and Wagner‐Whitin perform best under conditions of many runs. Both economic order quantity and part‐period balancing perform most favorably in comparison to Wagner‐Whitin when runs are few. In addition, there appears to be a potential interaction between the level of demand variability and the degree of serial correlation. This finding is somewhat disconcerting since high variability demand sequences used in some prior research were also characterized by relatively high levels of autocorrelation; hence it becomes most difficult to identify and decompose the unique influences of each demand pattern dimension on lot‐sizing behavior. Because of this phenomenon, it is suggested that future studies direct greater attention to the demand simulating methodology than has heretofore been accorded.</jats:p>",

The results demonstrate that the benefits of material requirements planning (MRP) are company-wide, and that when these benefits are quantified, the financial case for MRP is greatly strengthened. The paper also shows that MRP should not be viewed within the restricted concept of a technique which only improves shop floor efficiency. The use of the evaluation techniques within a number of major companies reveals that the ‘company-wide’ return on investment is much greater than has been previously suggested, and that the greatest potential benefits of MRP accrue outside production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although companies can obtain major benefits from material requirements planning (MRP) serious difficulties are usually encountered during the implementation phase. This paper highlights these difficulties and then goes on to show how they can be overcome if MRP is viewed as a ‘standard’ investment decision with quantifiable objectives. The financial evaluation techniques developed at UMIST are described and a comprehensive list of costs and benefits relating to MRP is given, with 76 factors being listed. These factors, selected to prevent double counting, ensure that each potential benefit is directly quantifiable, rather than being simply described as ‘positive but intangible’. The paper then goes on to describe a systematic method of defining and quantifying the benefits listed. Finally, because MRP represents a major investment decision, it is shown that the ability to conduct a comprehensive discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis enables the main savings to be identified, thereby ensuring that the implementation strategy can be designed to optimize both the operational and financial advantages. </jats:p>",
