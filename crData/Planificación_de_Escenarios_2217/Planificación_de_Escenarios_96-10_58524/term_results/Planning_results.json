These fields provide an average daily supply of approximately 1.5 Bscf/D to the Bontang LNG plant and Kaltim Fertilizer Plants. The four fields consist of more than 2,000 gas reservoirs with the majority occurring in the form of distributary channels and mouth bars. Currently, 467 wells have been drilled and completed in these fields as dual, dual selective or single completions. Typical reservoir and well completions are shown in Figure 2.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Because of the large number of reservoirs and wells with multiple completions, a specific computerized Depletion Planning (DEPLAN) program was designed by VICO to assist in the managing the development of these fields.

A detailed sequence stratigraphic study of the gas field that incorporated seismic, well log and core data provided the basis for the geological model used in the reservoir simulation model. The objective of the development planning studies was to determine production well locations, production well drilling schedules, the total number of wells required, the timing for the installation of wellhead compression equipment and the gas production profile for the field as a function of time. The reservoir is estimated to be able to sustain a 2,400 million standard cubic feet per day (Mscf/d) methane production rate for 30 years or more.</jats:p>",

However, managing partial orders represents and expensive overhead in plan construction and development. Simple solutions are only suitable for very small planning problems involving tens rather than hundreds of partially ordered elements. For more sophisticated planning languages allowing the representation of point-based intervals and abstraction it is necessary to manage far larger sets of temporal elements. In this paper is presented an approach and algorithm, TEMPMAN, for the management of partial orders which exploits the typical properties of planned partial orders to achieve a significantly better performance than existing solutions to this problem.</jats:p>",

Their recommendations include the increased funding and coordination of prevention services, allocating services according to need rather than popula tion size, greater use of social policy as a prevention tool, and a shift in primary prevention programming from senior high to lower grades and in program emphasis from information-education to psychosocial programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Interpretations of women's activism depend on the ways in which analysts conceptualize the relations between privacy, publicity, and politics, in this paper the relationship between women's standing in the public sphere and their activism is problematized. Women's activism is shaped by strategic, and sometimes opportunistic, choices to locate their activism either in public or in private spaces. These choices point to the importance of reconceptualizing publicity and privacy in ways that separate the content of actions from the spaces in which action is taken. Such a distinction creates the possibility of taking private actions into public spaces and of taking public actions in private spaces. When the content of action is separated from the spaces of action, women's activism is evaluated in terms of the efficacy of various actions in either public or private spaces, rather than in terms of women's presumed lack of access to the public sphere. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> What it means to be a child varies over space and time. Historically, the dominant Western construction of childhood has oscillated between representing children as the bearers of original sin‚Äîdevils‚Äîor as innocent‚Äîangels, in the United Kingdom in the 19th and for much of the 20th century it was this latter imagining of childhood that took hold. But the murder of toddler Jamie Bulger by two 10-year-old boys in 1993 has been pivotal in reengaging a demonised conceptualisation of what it means to be a child. The author begins by considering some of the contested meanings of childhood and then goes on to explore the contemporary ‚Äòothering‚Äô of children and some of the spatial restrictions being imposed on young people by adults in an attempt to (re)draw boundaries between ‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòthem‚Äô. </jats:p>",

In general each reservoir produces a mixture of associated gas, crude oil and water. These fluids are separated in a sequence of surface processing facilities in which oil is prepared for shipment or refining, associated gas is split into five products and water is disposed of or injected into the producing formations. Produced gas may be recycled for gas lift and additional water for injection obtained from a sea water processing plant. Some gas requires sweetening before the liquids recovery plant.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The optimal plan is determined with a Strategic Planning Model (SPM). The time horizon varies from five to 30 years. The plan specifies the production rate and surface processing route of all fluids produced from all reservoirs in every year of the horizon. The plan also specifies all investments in wells, gas lift equipment, water injection and supply facilities, surface separation, gas compression and liquid recovery facilities.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In addition to the desired crude offtake vector input for an optimization includes sales price of crude and products and escalated investment and operating costs vs time. Input also fixes the existing capacity in all reservoirs and of all surface processing equipment and defines the expansion alternatives available. SPM uses a generalized network flow model with side constraints to model the capacitated flow possibilities for all fluids. SPM's network solver determines the plan which maximizes discounted cash flow (NPV). The optimal plan is determined iteratively. On each iteration the network model is a linearized representation of the physical system for the current estimates of the optimal flows. At convergence the optimal flows correspond closely to those used for the latest linearization.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper explains the analytical approach and reports on computing experience. A brief review of current and planned applications is given.

To simplify the discussion we refer to the latter as SPMMOD.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>We sketch the computer layout of SPM, explain briefly how each module works and outline some of the mathematical procedures used to construct each system iteration's linearized SPMMOD. Given the extent of the underground and surface facilities, SPMMOD consists of a very large number of linear equations. However, because the bulk of these are contained in the network, solution times are reasonable. As a result it is feasible to apply SPM a broad range of planning problems, some of which encompass both exploration and development planning of multi-reservoir situations over a 30-year horizon subdivided into np = 15‚Äì20 periods. How SPM fits into KOC's management process is discussed along with benefits foreseen from current and projected applications.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>What SPM Does</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Investment decisions considered include:</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 509</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we argue that the geometry of urban residential development is fractal. Both the degree to which space is filled and the rate at which it is filled follow scaling laws which imply invariance of function, and self-similarity of urban form across scale. These characteristics are captured in population density functions based on inverse power laws whose parameters are fractal dimensions. First we outline the relevant elements of the theory in terms of scaling relations and then we introduce two methods for estimating fractal dimension based on varying the size of cities and the scale at which their form is detected. Exact and statistical estimation techniques are applied to each method respectively generating dimensions which measure the extent and the rate of space filling. These methods are then applied to residential development patterns in six industrial cities in the northeastern United States, with an innovative data source from the TIGER/Line files. The results support the theory of the fractal city outlined in books by Batty and Longley and Frankhauser, but with the clear conclusion that different scale and estimation techniques generate different types of fractal dimension. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent postmodern turn and concomitant reconceptualization of space in social theory have encouraged numerous investigators, cultural theorists especially, to augment, even to replace, material with metaphorical space; one whereby ‚Äògeographical imaginations‚Äô play constitutive roles in space-society relationships. A leading contributor has been Edward Said, who aims at refashioning spatial sensibilities not only in traditional ‚Äògeographic‚Äô terms but in a broader epistemological sense. Committed to transgressing established borders, Said invites us to imagine new topographies, in which units heretofore deemed separate‚Äîcultures, professions, realms of experience‚Äîbecome inescapably hybrid and interpenetrating. At the same time, Said's geography can be as opaque as it is suggestive‚Äîbetraying an eclectic form often left unstituatrd vis-√†-vis material practices. I invoke Aijaz Ahmad's work to situate Said's, tracing its affiliations to his trajectories as diasporan intellectual, Palestinian activist, and disciple of European High Philology. Ahmad thereby renders a portrait which is both enabling and self-cancelling, in which Said's generosity, complexity‚Äîand untenability‚Äîinhere from an unwillingness to vacate any spaces he has occupied; seeking instead to span often irreconcilable positions. Ahmad's stringency, however, fails to acknowledge possibilities inherent in Said's eclecticism; particularly the commitment to build bridges, oppose orthodox rigidities, and gain enrichment from that which one opposes. In this light, I invoke David Harvey's work as emblematic of a growing oeuvre that does not deny postmodernism its radical potential, but instead situates it within a revamped materialism designed to reconnect the Left. Harvey's work represents a serious‚Äîthough not unproblematic‚Äîattempt to rework modernity, viewed here as an unfinished project capable of galvanizing new and varied energies. </jats:p>",

The research method used was content analysis. The NYT was selected as the sample American newspaper. During the 40-year period under study, NYT published 249 population and family planning stories on India. Each of these news stories in the NYT was categorized into different themes. The study identified 11 themes which were then classified into themes more or less likely to get covered based on Westem news values. NYT, by and large, covered India's family planning efforts when they were associated with themes such as politics, civil unrest and religious differences (in line with Western news values) and not as part of the process of national development. </jats:p>",

The paper begins with a plea for a reflexive sociology of intellectuals, and after a brief review of early debates on the role of intellectuals, the author concentrates on Gouldner's grand vision of intellectuals as a ‚Äòflawed universal class‚Äô. In the next section the forces that have undermined such grand visions in the past few decades, precipitating the current crises, are discussed. The author then categorises a range of positions that have been recently developed to justify some continuing role for intellectuals as a social category in contemporary society. This discussion leads on to a focus on the work of Bourdieu, which seems to the author to offer the most productive framework for thinking about these issues. But in the last section he raises a number of problems that might be tackled through the incorporation of some feminist approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been largely overlooked that Henri Lefebvre in his book The Production of Space draws heavily upon Lacanian psychoanalytic accounts of the emergence of subjectivity in theorizing political relations, Lefebvre implicitly repudiates at the same time that he builds upon Lacan's distinctions between real, imaginary, and symbolic registers of subjectivity. For Lefebvre, Lacan's registers give primacy to visuality and heterosexualized familial dynamics while lived material, spatial, and political experience arc incidental to subject formation and systems of meaning Lefebvre transforms Lacan's registers by historicizing them in spatially dialectical terms, loosely replacing them with distinct forms of evolutionary spatialities which he calls natural, absolute, and abstract, In the process, he both subverts and reproduces Lacan's paternal‚Äìmaternal (heterosexual) order. We hold that Lefebvrc's critique provides powerful theoretical tools for understanding how alterity and signification are always and inevitably politically and materially mediated through corporealities and ‚Äòspace‚Äô. Nonetheless, Lefebvre can only work out his spatial dialectic of history in heterosexist terms: although he usefully identifies maternal‚Äìpaternal metaphors in different Western social formations over time, he fails to interrogate directly the very hetero-sexuality that gives these metaphors their relational significance and force. In short, he brings us to the brink of a nonheterosexist domain, but never enters it. In this paper then, we outline the striking parallels in the theoretical frameworks of Lefebvre and Lacan in order to illustrate how both theorists focus on gender construction as the fundamental social process through which alterity is achieved. At the same time, we unpack the underlying phallocentrism and heterosexism that sustain their versions of alterity, subjectivity, and agency, in the process showing how Lefebvre deftly undermines the apolitical stance of Lacan. In conclusion, we strive to recuperate the crucial liberatory aspects of Lefebvre's project through considering how we might go on to dislocate received versions of capitalism and sexual difference. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we introduce the concept of ‚Äòislands of sustainability‚Äô. The basic assumption is that the development towards sustainability can be introduced starting from sustainable islands'. An island is an area where sustainability is reached at a local or regional level. Exchange activities within the regional network and with the environment are key points in creating an island of sustainability. One of the main theses is that the concept of sustainability addresses not only the interactions between the economic system and the ecosphere, but also structural aspects of the anthropogenic system, such as the economic diversity and economic connectedness. Hence, sustainability is linked to the complexity of the regional network. In order to attain sustainability the intensity, the speed, and comprehensiveness of internal and external interactions, as well as the connectedness of the regional network, have to be changed. In this paper we examine the regional system. The structure, elements, interactions, and boundaries of the regional system are discussed in detail. This systems analysis is the basis of the definition of islands of sustainability. Once we reach sustainable development within islands, we then turn our discussion to the change of the whole unsustainable economic system. Islands of sustainability can be seen as ‚Äòtroublemakers‚Äô which infiltrate the whole unsustainable system and act as cells of development. </jats:p>",

The authors sought to determine whether this technique could identify optimal strategies for medical diagnosis and therapy. An existing model of acute deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities was encoded for analysis by the decision-theoretic refinement planning system (DRIPS). The encoding represented 6,206 possible plans. The DRIPS planner used artificial intelligence techniques to elimmate 5,150 plans (83%) from consideration without examining them explicitly. The DRIPS system identified the five strategies that minimized cost and mortality. The authors conclude that decision- theoretic planning is useful for examining large medical-decision problems.

In this paper we present empirical data from a nonrepresentative sample of 628 City of San Diego employees on key variables and relationships in that model. The relationships among possibility, preference, and choice are examined. A key finding is the existence of a large group of people (57% of the sample) for whom telecommuting is a preferred impossible alternative. Dichotomous and continuous constraints are distinguished, and three dichotomous constraints are defined. ‚ÄòLack of awareness‚Äô is active for 4%, ‚Äòjob unsuitability‚Äô for 44%, and ‚Äòmanager disapproval‚Äô for 51% of the sample. For 68% of the sample, at least one of these constraints is active. Even among those for whom none of the dichotomous constraints is in force, most people do not choose telecommuting because of the presence of active continuous constraints. For only 11% of the entire sample, telecommuting is possible, preferred, and chosen. The potential impacts of self-selection bias are estimated, and sampling bias is qualitatively assessed. This analysis provides a crude but useful estimate of the potential of telecommuting in the population, and more specifically, the relative share of potential telecommuters who are prevented by key dichotomous constraints from choosing that option. </jats:p>",

Similar data for 1976, 1980, and 1986 from another source, the Wharton Urban Decentralization Project, confirm many of these trends, and for a larger set of metropolitan areas. The results show that Los Angeles is more in the middle of the twelve CMSAs than it is an outlier.

One problem in carrying out such a restructuring is planning the new detailed design. The\n            <jats:italic>star diagram</jats:italic>\n            manipulable visualization can help a programmer redesign a program based on abstract data types. However, our measurements revealed that the view can be too large for a programmer to effectively assimilate. Also, design plans can be expressed only by restructuring, although our studies revealed that it is beneficial to preplan a restructuring. Finally, the tool user can build a star diagram for only a single data structure, although an abstract data type might actually have several components or have multiple instantiations.Exploiting basic properties of the star diagram can mitigate these problems. First, programmer-controlled elision can remove clutter from the star diagram view. Second, elision and annotation of star diagram components can mimic restructuring, thereby supporting the planning of a restructuring. Such support also allows for the planning of a non-restructuring maintenance task. Finally, to dynamically control what data structures are visualized, the tool user can union star diagrams.We built a star diagram planning tool for C programs, measured its elision capabilities, and performed a programmer study for the encapsulation of a widely-used data structure in a 28,000 line program. We found that the amount of elision can be substantial, but is not always adequate. In the study we found that each programming team successfully planned their restructuring in rather different, unanticipated ways.\n          </jats:p>",

The multicriteria decision making model allows the evaluation of options against a wide range of criteria, grouped in a hierarchical structure.

According to the literature, this trend is particularly evident in the case of high-order service functions: business services, finance, insurance, and real estate services, and head offices. In this paper, we argue that the decentralization of high-order service activities and the corresponding CBD decline may be neither as strong a trend nor as universal a phenomenon as certain authors have indicated. Rather, the growth of suburban office employment may reflect a strong CBD whose economic base is becoming increasingly specialized. Using data from the Montreal metropolitan area, we first examine intrametropolitan decentralization in a shift-share framework, then document the mobility of establishments and employment. Our findings suggest that, in spite of a certain level of intrametropolitan decentralization, the CBD continues to be the primary locus of high-order services. </jats:p>",

The Honeysuckle Development Corporation operates at the juncture between federal, state, and local government engagement with capital in the attempt to address the local impacts of economic restructuring. It provides an important case study of the shifting parameters of the relationship between various tiers of the state, and between these tiers and the interests of capital in contemporary urban redevelopment. It also addresses the problematic questions of sustainability, accountability, and equity in urban entrepreneurialism, while providing a long-overdue empirical study of Newcastle.</jats:p>",

In a related paper we developed a binary model of the preference for home-based telecommuting. Noting that there is a wide gap between preferring to telecommute (88% of the sample) and actually telecommuting (13%), in this paper we develop binary logit models of telecommuting adoption. Two approaches to dealing with constraints are compared: incorporating them directly into the utility function, and using them to define the choice set. Models using the first approach appear to be statistically superior in this analysis, explaining 63‚Äì64% of the information in the data. Variables significant to choice include those relating to work and travel drives, and awareness, manager support, job suitability, technology, and discipline constraints. The best model was used to analyze the impact of relaxing three key constraints on the 355 people in the sample for whom telecommuting was previously identified to be a preferred impossible alternative (PIA). When unawareness, lack of manager support, and job unsuitability constraints are relaxed, 28% of the people in the PIA category would be expected to adopt telecommuting. The importance of behavioral models to forecast telecommuting adoption accurately is emphasized and is suggested to have wider implications for predicting technology-based activity changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization of an economic indicator has traditionally been the sole objective function of mathematical programming models for power generation expansion planning. Recently, however, other evaluation aspects, such as environmental concerns, were also given an explicit role as objective functions in mathematical models. Models become thus more realistic so that decision makers are able to grasp the inherent conflicts and trade‚Äêoffs among the distinct objectives in selecting a best compromise plan. A significant change in the planning processes has also occurred concerning new planning methodologies integrating demand‚Äêside management (DSM) techniques, in an attempt to change the levels and forms of electricity use by the consumers. This paper presents a multiple objective linear programming model for power generation expansion planning incorporating DSM. The objective functions are the total expansion cost, the environmental impact associated with the installed power capacity and the environmental impact associated with the energy output. DSM is included by modelling it as a new generating group along with the generating alternatives from the supply side. Five categories of constraints are considered related to the reliability of the supply system, the availability of the generating units, the capacity of the DSM‚Äêequivalent generating group, the total capacity installed throughout the planning period, the pollutant emissions. Some results are presented derived by using an interactive method, aimed at assisting decision makers in a progressive and selective search of good compromise solutions.</jats:p>",

In industrially developing countries (IDC's) the emphasis was in the past on physical workload. With the introduction of computers there has been a sudden shift in interest, and the problems of HCI and usability of complex systems have become paramount. This panel will discuss the changes in ergonomics, and how they are affected by changing work ethics, and changing needs of the society. It is argued that ergonomics is well suited to adapt to new goals and respond to difficult challenges. As a result we need to prepare ourselves in education and training to meet the new demands in ergonomics. Can certification programs for ergonomists be flexible enough to consider current needs, and can teaching programs incorporate new knowledge? What are some effects on the type of research that will be conducted in the future. How will ergonomics professionals deal with design and applications. These are some of the issues that will be discussed in this panel session. </jats:p>",

The inputs to the model consist of the number of ECMO facilities, the number of patients presenting annually, the duration of treatment and the date on which patients present for ECMO treatment.

The paper presents a complete path planning algorithm and describes the procedure for constructing a collision-free path for a mobile robot constrained by its rectangular shape and kinematics. Emphasis is made on the techniques of reversal transfers, which are used to compensate the limited manoeuvrability of a car-like robot. The approach works entirely in the workspace, as opposed to building a higher dimensional configuration space (C-space). It starts by constructing a visibility graph and finding the shortest path for a point robot and then detects areas where collision may occur by minimum distance calculations between obstacles and between the selected path and obstacles. Robot configurations are placed along the shortest path and lemmas are developed for ascertaining transfers from one robot configuration to another. The transfer techniques include direct, indirect and reversal manoeuvres, and ensure that the path is feasible for the robot to travel with a given steering limit. The process runs in time O(nk + n log n) for k obstacles and n vertices. The algorithm is tested in computer simulations and results are given, demonstrating the versatility of the algorithm. </jats:p>",
