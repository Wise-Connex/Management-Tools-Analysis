      "abstract": "<jats:p> Scenario-based techniques have been receiving increased attention in the design of human-computer interaction. A cohesive methodology or framework, however, has yet to materialize, and scenario methods have not been well defined. Claims are being made about the ability of scenarios to play a role throughout the development life cycle. The objective of this paper is to examine the ability of scenarios to serve as the primary design representations early in the system design life cycle for envisioning the system, requirements specification, user-designer communication, and design rationale. These findings represent a case study in the design of a world-wide web site for the Human Factors Engineering Center at Virginia Tech. Example-based narratives were elicited using a “micro-scenario” generating task that involved prospective end-users brainstorming user-system interactions. Conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the technique for system development, and guidelines are provided for using scenarios to specify behavioral requirements. </jats:p>",
