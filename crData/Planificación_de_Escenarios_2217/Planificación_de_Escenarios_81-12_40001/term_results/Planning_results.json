Most conventional views of British postwar planning depict it as hopelessly weak and disorganized while French planning is seen as reasonably well-armed and effectively organized. However, these views reflect excessive attention on purely administrative as well as political–cultural explanations and tend to ignore the critical underlying role of domestic politics and power. The French planning effort was only one element of a broader, relatively uncoordinated collaborative process, carried on among bureaucratic state elites and large industry, which effectively accelerated industrial investment and economic growth. Its success hinged on the inability of organized labour effectively to defend its wage interests within the political structure. In the British case, manipulation of capital markets was only marginally productive given the power and autonomy of the finance sector while the alternative attempt to plan through manpower direction failed due to the ability of organized labour to defend its wage interests in the face of chronic inflation. In each case, the structure of political power was most important in determining the success of the divergent technical approaches to planning. </jats:p>",

In addition, it is argued that behavioural models provide a potentially more valuable approach for predicting consumer response to policy decisions with regard to spatial structure. Empirical evidence substantiating the claim that consumer evaluations bear some systematic relationship with objective attributes of spatial alternatives and overt choice behaviour is provided in the context of spatial shopping behaviour and residential choice behaviour. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> Environmental planning legislation in Australia has been primarily concerned with the formulation of detailed land‐use allocation plans. Changing circumstances are leading to a more broadly‐based view of the planning process centred around the delineation of development principles and the broad structure of land uses. The United Kingdom's experience with structure plans during the past decade is of value in reshaping environmental planning in Australia. Within the United Kingdom both the slow speed of structure plan preparation and its very broad scope have posed problems. By merging land‐use issues with the development plans of other government instrumentalities structure plans have exceeded the responsibility of the central planning agency. Simultaneously they have been seized upon by the public as the only formal means of dissent against governmental decisions in such areas as social service and housing. Reactions have been twofold. In Scotland regional reports have imposed an additional corporate plan which provides guidelines for subsequent control of land use. In England and Wales structure plans have become increasingly general, long‐term and land‐use orientated, thereby side‐stepping the problems their introduction created. To be effective in Australia, structure plans must achieve corporate liaison with other government departments and statutory undertakings. This will be achieved not by copying the English structure planning model, but by working towards regional reports prepared by a combination of State government agencies and reconciled through decisions at parliamentary level. Local, detailed land‐use plans, based upon written reports as in the United Kingdom, can fit readily into such a framework, supplemented where necessary by State‐wide guidelines pertaining to critical land‐use considerations. The coordination of development will be facilitated by the liberalization and increased availability of professionally recognized qualifications.</jats:p>",

With a capacity to project and solve business problems, Burger King Corporation has been able to upgrade and streamline restaurant operations, contributing significantly to the continued growth of what is now the second largest restaurant system in the world. Among the substantial changes in the last five years, the introduction of drive-thru service and new menu items has transformed a once simple operation into a sophisticated production process. Consequently, management turned increasingly to Operations Research for answers to operational questions ranging from the most efficient restaurant design to the optimum number of employees needed to serve customers as sales vary. The impact of simulation models has produced millions of dollars in savings, or profits, in a number of operational, design, and procurement areas. </jats:p>",

Through the restriction of center dialysis supply, more patients were encouraged to utilize home dialysis. Greater reliance on home dialysis could translate into an annual savings of at least $2.6 million and an additional 333 person years as a result of the enhanced life expectancy for home dialysis patients. The need model has also been useful in more equitably distributing dialysis resources to regions in Massachusetts which have previously been underserved. </jats:p><jats:p> The model has been successful in predicting the need for kidney dialysis services to within 1% of actual demand.

Changes in the structure of the provincial government seemed to be well calculated to support this program. Yet, ten years after it began, it collapsed. A deterioration in economic conditions in the province, lack of integration and consistency in the program over time, and its perceived association with a series of politically unpalatable events, all contributed. But the fundamental weakness of provincial planning lay in its failure either to become an integral part of the governmental system, or to win wholehearted support at the political level, within the provincial bureaucracy, or from any broader political or popular constituency. Furthermore, it appears that the practical, fiscal and, above all, political implications of putting plans into effect were not properly appreciated when the program was initiated. When these implications began to be apparent, the provincial planning program lacked either the institutional roots or the political and public support that might have enabled it to survive the inevitable adverse reaction. From the Ontario experience several conclusions are drawn about the requisites for a successful program of planning at this scale.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire. </jats:bold> Vers la fin des années soixante, le gouvernement de l'Ontario s'est lancé dans un ambitieux programme de planification provinciale au niveau de la province et de la région du Grand Toronto. Les changements dans la structure du gouvernement provincial semblaient bien calculés pour appuyer ce programme. Cependant, dix ans plus tard, le programme s'éroulait. Plusieurs facteurs ont contribuéà cet êchec; il y a eu, entre autres, la détérioration des conditions économiques de la province, le manque d'intégration et d'uniformité du programme au cours des années et le fait que ce programme a été associéà des événements politiques déplaisants. En définitive, la faiblesse principale de cette planification provinciale vient de ce qu'elle n'a réussi ni àêtre complètement intégrée au système gouvernemental ni à gagner l'appui total sur le plan politique de la bureaucratie provinciale ou de toute autre circonscription politique ou populaire plus vaste. De plus, il semble qu'au départ, on ne se soit pas vraiment rendu compte des implications pratiques, fiscales et surtout politiques que comportait l'application du programme. Or, quand on a commencéà réaliser la portée de ces implications, le programme de planification provinciale manquait de racines institutionnelles ou de l'appui politique et publique qui lui auraient permis de survivre à l'inévitable réaction hostile. Cette expérience du gouvernement de l'Ontario a permis de tirer plusieurs conclusions quant aux conditions indispensables au sucds d»un programme de planification de cette envergure.</jats:p>",

The instrument used in this study, Attitudes Toward Family Planning Education Scale, had reliabilities of .56 to .87 on the dimensions within the total scale. Data were analyzed using t‐tests, one‐way analysis of variance, and Scheffe range test. Findings indi cated that students were supportive of family planning education although females generally favored such education more than the males. As students matured and made normal progress through school, they had more favorable attitudes toward the concepts of family planning education. The students perceived their religion as providing a base of support for family planning education, and the higher the parents' occupational level, the more favorable were the students toward these concepts. Findings concerning relationships of variables to the dimensions will enable educators to develop more effective curricula for family planning education.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a study within the field of public budgeting. It focuses on the capital budget, and it attempts to model and analyze the capital budgeting process using a framework previously developed in the literature of incremental budgeting. Within this framework the paper seeks to determine empirically whether the movement of capital expenditure budgets can be represented as the routine application of incremental adjustments over an existing base of allocations and whether further, forward-looking adjustments can be found. Its setting is a British publicly-owned corporation. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper proposes an extended model of incremental budgeting which explains absolute change in budget allocations by introducing variables expressing: current expenditure outturn, over- or under-spend of previous allocations, previous budgetary cuts, and wider financial pressures in the corporation's environment. Planning variables are then included in an attempt to uncover purposive behavior. The analysis reveals different patterns of allocation for peripheral and for mainstream investments. The former appear to grow in an incremental fashion with no response to leading planning variables. The latter exhibit responsiveness to planning variables, and allocations do not take the form of routine incremental adjustments to the existing base. An interpretation of the results is undertaken. The analysis points to revisions of existing theory and suggests fresh ways of looking at, and systematically modeling, the organizational system of resource allocation. </jats:p>",

This paper starts with an overview of the situations in which they may be required. Lagged variables also pose serious problems from a statistical point of view: multicollinearity and the determination of the length of the lag. Some common approaches to these two problems are discussed and evaluated. As an alternative a linear structural equation approach is presented, where the lagged variables are compressed to latent variables in a measurement model. The relationship between the lagged variables, thus compressed, and the dependent variable is expressed in the structural model. Both the measurement model and the structural model are estimated simultaneously. The paper ends with an application. A model of urban immigration for the thirty-three largest Dutch cities is estimated. </jats:p>",

The reported research develops a relevant site quality assessment and measurement procedure called environmental threshold modeling. This modeling procedure is based upon the idea that individuals (i.e., recreationists) have specific, identifiable evaluative criteria which can be expressed as a mathematical function of various site characteristics. The function of interest is called a threshold function because it separates acceptable recreational settings from unacceptable settings. Individual specific threshold functions can be easily aggregated to form a population specific threshold function that estimates the proportion of a population that would find the recreational setting acceptable for some specific activity.
