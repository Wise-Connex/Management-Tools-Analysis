      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>With the increased emphasis on accurately representing geological variability / uncertainty in modeling heterogeneous reservoirs, the goal of modern history matching methods is not only to reproduce the past production behavior; it also aims at preserving geological realism. However, in complex geological environments, with limited access to the subsurface (e.g. deepwater/turbidite systems), the geological scenario governing the spatial distribution of important reservoir properties such as facies type / permeability is uncertain. Indeed, with few wells and limited seismic resolution, an accurate determination of the geological depositional system may not be possible. In this paper, we propose a new history matching technique that can account for this first order uncertainty. At the same time, this method can be regarded as a way to reduce geological uncertainty by means of production data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To model geological scenario uncertainty we rely on the field of multiple-point geostatistics, where each scenario is quantitatively depicted by a training image, a fully explicit reservoir analog of sorts. Given a training image, a geological model realization can be stochastically generated using geostatistical algorithms. A discrete set of such scenarios is assumed available from a careful geological uncertainty study. To solve the inverse problem of history matching one can no longer rely on the classical optimization with gradient formulation, due to the inherently discrete nature of the problem. Instead, we rely on stochastic search methods (such as the Neighborhood Algorithm), that search in the space of all geologically plausible model realizations for those that history match by considering a ‘similarity’ measure between such plausible geological model realizations. We show that the production response in the space defined by a suitable similarity measure is structured, i.e. not random, hence optimization/history matching with stochastic search methods is effective. Several realistic synthetic reservoir applications are presented to illustrate this methodology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of scenarios to depict forces of potential risk is demonstrated by economists alarmed by the imbalance between the debtor US and its creditors among Asia-Pacific central banks. One credible, if contested, pessimistic scenario until 2010 focuses on US debt, current account and government, which in the early 2000s had sustained growth led by consumer spending in the US and English-speaking countries. The crisis scenario over the current account deficit challenges the influence over risk thinking of alleged conventional wisdom based on favourable US economic performance data, IMF optimism about leading economies' future growth, and the questioning of the deficit itself as important and dangerous. The emerging interdependence of the US and China casts doubt on the feasibility of the radical economic and political changes that are needed to avoid a crisis that could seriously damage the global economy. Active preparation of risk management against the eventuality of a serious economic upheaval must weigh contested views of probability against less doubt about the severity of the damage if it were to occur. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This paper analyses the effect of spatial input data resolution on the simulated effects of regional scale landuse scenarios using the TOPLATS model. A data set of 25 m resolution of the central German Dill catchment (693 km2) and three different landuse scenarios are used for the investigation. Landuse scenarios in this study are field size scenarios, and depending on a specific target field size (0.5 ha, 1.5 ha and 5.0 ha) landuse is determined by optimising economic outcome of agricultural used areas and forest. After an aggregation of digital elevation model, soil map, current landuse and landuse scenarios to 50 m, 75 m, 100 m, 150 m, 200 m, 300 m, 500 m, 1 km and 2 km, water balances and water flow components for a 20 years time period are calculated for the entire Dill catchment as well as for 3 subcatchments without any recalibration. Additionally water balances based on the three landuse scenarios as well as changes between current conditions and scenarios are calculated. The study reveals that both model performance measures (for current landuse) as well as water balances (for current landuse and landuse scenarios) almost remain constant for most of the aggregation steps for all investigated catchments. Small deviations are detected at the resolution of 50 m to 500 m, while significant differences occur at the resolution of 1 km and 2 km which can be explained by changes in the statistics of the input data. Calculating the scenario effects based on increasing grid sizes yields similar results. However, the change effects react more sensitive to data aggregation than simple water balance calculations. Increasing deviations between simulations based on small grid sizes and simulations using grid sizes of 300 m and more are observed. Summarizing, this study indicates that an aggregation of input data for the calculation of regional water balances using TOPLATS type models does not lead to significant errors up to a resolution of 500 m. Focusing on scenario effects the model is more sensitive to input data aggregation as aggregation effects of current data and scenarios partly sum up. The maximum reasonable grid size for scenario calculations decreases to 200–300 m.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This paper presents an interdisciplinary scenario analysis to assess the influence of global and regional change on future water availability and water consumption in the Upper Ouémé catchment in central Benin. For the region three development scenarios were evolved. These scenarios are combined with climate change scenarios based on the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). In the modelling approach the quantification of the land use/land cover change is performed by the cellular automata model CLUE-S. The future climate scenarios are computed with the regional climate model REMO driven by the global ECHAM model. Using this data different land use and climate change scenarios can be calculated with the conceptual hydrological model UHP-HRU to assess the effects of global changes on the future water availability in Benin.  To analyse the future water availability also the water consumption has to be taken into account. Due to high population growth an increase in water need in the future is expected for the region. To calculate the future household water consumption data from a regional survey and demographic projections are used. Development of the water need for animal husbandry is also considered.  The first test run of the modelling approach was performed for the development scenario 'business as usual' combined with the IPCC scenario B2 for the year 2025. This test demonstrates the applicability of the approach for an interdisciplinary scenario analysis. A continuous run from 2000–2025 will be simulated for different scenarios as soon as the input data concerning land use/land cover and climate are available.\n                    </jats:p>"

A community sample ( N = 371) participated in an experiment examining the effects of alcohol on sexual assault resistance. Women received a high-dose alcohol, low-dose alcohol, placebo, or control beverage and then projected themselves into a dating scenario culminating in an attempted sexual assault. Participants wrote their own endings to the story, which were analyzed qualitatively. Content analysis found that verbal and physical assertiveness were the most frequently described actions; calling out for help was less frequent. Three major themes emerged from story endings: gendered sexuality, interpersonal concerns, and empowerment. Findings included contrasting elements: Women's projected outcomes to the sexual assault scenario involved both traditional and alternative sexual scripts. Results supported the position that the current social construction of heterosexuality plays a role in high acquaintance sexual assault rates. Implications for developing effective antirape programs and for sexual assault research are discussed.</jats:p>",

Conduction times exhibited very good agreement between standard and tele-ECG with reliability coefficients ( R) of 0.91, 0.86 and 0.89 for the PQ-, QRS- and QT interval, respectively. Rhythm analysis was correct in 99% of the cases. Negative T waves, ST-segment elevation and depression were detected with very high agreement in the tele-ECG exhibiting kappa ( κ) coefficients between 0.75 and 0.96. The correct ECG diagnosis of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was possible with excellent agreement between standard and tele-ECG, showing κ coefficients of 0.96, 0.99 and 0.99, respectively, for three investigators.

We describe a modelling approach which incorporates a spatial analysis of the results from regional simulation under different management alternatives. SOC stock changes in Flemish cropland soils, simulated with the DNDC model, were previously fitted to a large data set of SOC measurements for the period 1990–2000. Using the results of this study, simulations with DNDC of SOC stock changes during the period 2006–2012 including the Kyoto commitment period were carried out at the community level for a business‐as‐usual (BAU) scenario and seven alternative agricultural management options for SOC sequestration. The baseline SOC stock decreased during that period by 0.15 t OC ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> compared with 0.48 t OC ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> year<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> in the 1990s. All alternative scenarios resulted in net SOC storage compared with the BAU scenario, but none of the individual scenarios were able to increase the average absolute SOC stock. Overall, spatial variability in SOC storage for the selected management options was strongly dependent on the current distribution of crops and associated management. The modelling approach used in this study provides a case study in regional scale modelling of SOC sequestration and is applicable to other regions in Europe with comparable intensive agriculture.</jats:p>",
