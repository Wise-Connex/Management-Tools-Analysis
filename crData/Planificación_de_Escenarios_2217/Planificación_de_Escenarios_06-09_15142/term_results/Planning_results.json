      "abstract": "<jats:p> The conceptualizations of justice that have most influenced recent debates in planning theory have focused on procedural concerns, while questions of value and the good have been regarded as problematic given a world of plurality and difference. This article argues that questions of value are an inescapable part of the activity of planning and hence its purpose is to identify the key dimensions of a reconceptualized notion of justice for planning. The argument is presented through consideration of two key themes: the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the notion of “reasonableness” in relation to matters of public policy related to planning. The implications of this analysis lead on to consideration of the scope of collective obligations and the nature of judgment and reasoning in planning. The article concludes by arguing that justice in planning is about situated ethical judgment— a conceptualization of justice that raises significant issues in relation to future developments in planning thought. </jats:p>",

A global transformation of higher education is now underway and this poses new challenges for all academics. This article adopts an international perspective and locates current U.S. debates about performance measurement of planning schools in a broader context. A critique of the highly centralized approach to research performance measurement in higher education in the United Kingdom— known as the Research Assessment Exercise— is followed by a discussion of the trajectory of the values that have under pinned U.S. higher education. The very nature of “scholarship” is now highly contested and this creates new challenges for all faculty, including planning academics. By drawing on a case study, the article suggests that an inclusive approach to strategic planning at the college level may provide a helpful way of building unity of purpose and collegiality in a period when universities are being forced to rethink their role. </jats:p>",

In this article, the authors present the results of a survey of 386 local planning agencies regarding the knowledge and skills pertaining to land use law they expect in entry-level land use planners. The authors also report on a parallel survey of 27 planning educators who teach land use law regarding the knowledge and skills their students possess as they enter the job market. The authors conclude that planning educators generally are providing the essential knowledge and skills relevant to land use planning and law that agencies desire. Also, the authors have found that the expectations of planning agencies often vary substantially by region of the United States, size of community, and the local rate of population growth. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Some scholars maintain that academic planning has strayed from its technical and professional roots by becoming more aligned with the social sciences. Others suggest that the discipline has failed to develop a cogent identity. The authors evaluate these assertions by studying articles published in the Journal of the American Planning Association between 1963 and 2002. The authors' analysis confirms that academic planning has become more scientific with respect to intellectual contributions. However, it also indicates that the discipline is becoming more, rather than less, cohesive in terms of goals, methods, and standards for evaluation. These patterns suggest that planning is developing a distinct identity as it transforms from a “would-be” to a “diffuse” discipline. </jats:p>",

Preparation of such plans can take an inordinately lengthy period. Through both theoretical and case study analyses, this paper develops three hypotheses that relate limitations in the master planning process to its time inefficiency, including misdirected strategies, lack of effective decision mechanisms, and ineffective methods for conflict resolution. Based on insights from a review of alternative planning processes, suggestions for addressing the inherent limitations in the current process are presented.</jats:p>"

In addition, it addresses the question of whether certain urban forms contribute more than others to sustainability. A thematic analysis has been used to coop with the vast body of sustainable development and environmental planning literature. The analysis identifies seven design concepts related to sustainable urban forms: compactness, sustainable transport, density, mixed land uses, diversity, passive solar design, and greening. Moreover, it identifies four types of sustainable urban forms: the neotraditional development, the urban containment, the compact city, and the eco-city. Finally, this article proposes a Matrix of Sustainable Urban Form to help planners in assessing the contribution of different urban forms to sustainability. </jats:p>",

The research examined strategic planning in each country focusing in particular on its role in developing health sector reforms. The paper analyses the processes for strategic planning, the values that underpin the planning systems, and issues related to resources for planning processes. The resultant content of strategic plans is assessed and not seen to have driven the development of reforms; whilst each country had adopted strategic planning systems, in all three countries a more complex interplay of forces, including influences outside both the health sector and the country, had been critical forces behind the sectoral changes experienced over the previous decade. The key roles of different actors in developing the plans and reforms are also assessed. The paper concludes that a number of different conceptions of strategic planning exist and will depend on the particular context within which the heatlh system is placed. Whilst similarities were discovered between strategic planning systems in the three countries, there are also key differences in terms of formality, timeframes, structures and degrees of inclusiveness. No clear leadership role for strategic planning in terms of health sector reforms was discovered. Planning appears in the three countries to be more operational than strategic.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> State-led growth management has been criticized as inflexible in addressing the range of situations that communities face. A second issue is that while many of the goals of smart growth can be achieved through regulation, others require funding for implementation. In 2000, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts passed legislation called the Community Preservation Act (CPA), an experiment in enabling communities to tax themselves to implement growth management/smart growth actions at the local level. This article examines that act as to whether it demonstrates flexibility in its application across communities in the state, analyzed according to sub/urban to rural character. The act is found to appeal to a wide range of communities for overlapping but also divergent reasons and provides a flexible method to aid communities in implementing a limited set of smart growth goals. </jats:p>",

Defining areas as housing submarkets may be better for choosing, analyzing, and predicting the effects of revitalization policies than defining them as historically recognized neighborhoods if these neighborhoods do not reflect consumer behavior. The first key step in the submarket approach is to ascertain whether current definitions of neighborhoods adequately represent submarkets defined by consumer assessments of housing quality. This article uses the neighborhood planning of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to illustrate how quality-leveldefined housing submarkets compare to planners' administrative boundaries and historically recognized neighborhoods. The housing submarkets of the city diverge substantially from planner-defined geographic areas of analysis. This finding suggests that predefined neighborhoods, while valid for some purposes, do not define areas for predicting the housing-market response to policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Researchers have repeatedly observed satisficing by residential developers. The phenomenon has been attributed to their bounded rationality. In response, policy makers have designed policies that reduce risks to assist developers in overcoming bounds on their rationality. However, after decades of such policies, there is little evidence that developers have stopped satisficing. This article argues that bounded rationality is an insufficient explanation for satisficing by small developers. Lessons from behavioral economics suggest additional reasons for satisficing by developers. Satisficing is common because developers bracket projects one at a time, bracket each investment decision in isolation of others, create nonfungible investment accounts, establish self-imposed liquidity constraints, and temporally space projects. Policies that group risks to developers are likely to be the most effective. However, additional land-market-specific research is required to design policies that address these psychological traits. Academicians also need to design better survey instruments to investigate developer decision making. </jats:p>",

The development of management plans for lakes and their drainage basins is part of the ‘integrated management’ agenda. Challenging questions, however, arise in regard to what integration actually means within the context of planning processes and systems, and for the management plans themselves. The limited literature on lake management planning emphasizes the need for a lead agency for planning and implementation. A relevant question is how does lake management planning relate to planning by local governments, national government departments and other stakeholder groups. The integrated lake management efforts in Uganda have led to the development of lake management plans that build on, and complement, existing local government processes and plans. Lessons from early lake management experiences indicate that establishing clear linkages in the planning processes, and within the plans themselves between lake management structures and local government, is essential for sustainability, coordination and resource mobilization. The development of lake management plans also strengthens existing local government planning systems, by providing a forum for sharing information, ideas and lessons. The lake management planning also supports the introduction of local governments to participatory, community‐based planning, as well as promoting intersectoral coordination.</jats:p>",

With the powers under these acts, the local authority is responsible to ensure that any activity of development is carried out in an orderly manner so as not to cause immediate as well as long-term undesirable impacts on the neighbours, the surroundings and the environment. To do this the law requires that any person intending to carry out any development will need a planning permission and a building plan approval from the local authority. In giving such an approval the local authority has to check and ensure that the developer can and will carry out the development properly and according to a good set of by-laws, standards, regulations and guidelines drawn up to protect the safety, health and amenity of the people in the local authority area. However most local authorities, due to numerous valid reasons, have problems carrying out this task and are often accused of causing delays to the development process and hence to the economic progress of the country. Often, justly or unjustly, local authority officers and decision-makers have been branded as not transparent and corrupt for taking such a confusing and lengthy process in considering applications for development approval. Local authorities have hence an almost impossible task of protecting the environment and ensuring sustainable development and at the same time promoting further development and timely economic growth. In an attempt to overcome this problem the Municipal Council of Penang Island (MCPJ), with grants from the Development Application Grant Scheme (DAGS) of the National IT Council (NITC) of Malaysia, embarked on a project to develop an Electronic Local Authority Management System, or \"eLAMS\". This will assist in the day-to-day functions of processing and considering of applications for planning permission, building plans and earthworks plans, in accordance with a good quality management and environmental managen1ent system. This paper examines the problems of the development control process for sustainable development and the problems of adopting and adapting the electronic system faced by local authorities in Malaysia in general and the Municipal Council of Penang Island in particular.

The example of the “Flächenagentur Kulturlandschaft Mittlere Havel” in Brandenburg, which meanwhile is operating area-wide within this Federal State, serves to demonstrate different aspects that are relevant for a regional management of areas for purposes of nature conservation. In particular, it becomes apparent that for establishing a regional management of areas for nature conservation it is essential to choose the appropriate organisation form and that compensation pools may contribute to the implementation of concepts for nature conservation on a regional level. To assure an appropriate integration into extensive spatial relations, within the instruments of spatial planning above all landscape framework plans should stronger attend to this subject by setting respective targets and priorities.</jats:p>"

And what role will oil and gas play in that scenario? In spite of an impressive 150 year track record of increasing hydrocarbon production to meet exponential growth in demand, constraints have emerged. There will be a pinch in production rates relative to growing demand, necessitating the development and deployment of alternative energy technologies from more sustainable resources. As of yet there is no consensus on how to transition to alternative fuels, despite a great deal of talk about the need to do so. Nor is adequate consideration being paid to the pivotal role that oil and gas will continue to play well into the transition.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper addresses global energy planning at all organizational levels, as well as within energy producing corporations. Since future energy services will draw from an evolving mix of production sources and technologies, we propose a way for energy regulators and energy companies to optimize energy mixes, by evaluating the value added over time of each resource and applicable technology.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper maintains that oil and gas will continue to be important components in any energy mix for the foreseeable future. Alternative fuels will be hard-pressed to provide comparable net values either in terms of work from energy produced or in terms of environmental impact. As petroleum engineers, it is imperative that we make clear the character of the coming petroleum peak and the necessary role that petroleum must play in the coming transition period. It is essential to characterize clearly the energy value provided by our current resources and the value that will be demanded from alternatives as they do take up larger market shares.</jats:p>",

One consistent feature, a requirement that submissions address a practical “lesson learned”, helps make this journal especially useful in the promotion of hands-on evaluation practice, since even articles with a narrow focus must contain material that is relatable to the broader world of evaluation. Additionally, many issues also devote a substantial portion of the journal to a specific topic, making a wide range of subject-matter perspective easily available to the reader. The latest issue of Evaluation and Program Planning (volume 29 issue 2, 2006) contains a special topic section on “Program Capacity and Sustainability” that will be of particular interest to those involved/with non-profit sector organizations.</jats:p>"

There is a great deal of debate about both what a BIA should include and how it should be performed. However, defining ‘critical impact’ and then determining how to keep that definition in perspective is essential to any BIA process. This paper leads the reader through key considerations regarding how the BIA itself can determine what is truly critical, keep the definition of critical impact in perspective for the institution as a whole, and continuously adjust the definition of critical impact to the dynamics of an ever-changing institution.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Electrical energy planning of modern electric power system requires great attention for the air pollution problem. This is in accordance to the increasing tendency to optimise the production processes in the respect of their sustainability. Moreover, the advent of the deregulation in the electric energy market has involved substantial modifications of philosophy in planning and managing the electrical power system. These aspects together offer new challenge in defining proper system study methodologies and suitable planning strategies. One of the most complex problems in the planning strategies is the data management uncertainty related to load forecasting and environmental modelling. In this paper a robust optimal planning procedure is formalized, taking adequately into account the problem of stochastic variables presence, allowing to satisfy the air quality and load demand forecast constraints in spite of uncertainties. The proposed approach addresses generation planning, where the various aspects have been integrated to solve the problem in a feasible and realistic way. A numerical application to an electrical power system with respect to a regional area is reported in the final part of the paper, showing the applicability of the proposed methodology.</jats:p>",

The IP services support the NATO-wide deployment of core automated information systems (AIS), and the placement of specific functional area services (e.g., intelligence, logistics, C2IS for the services, etc.) at commands. To maintain and improve interoperability within NATO and with partners, NATO will transition from version four of the Internet Protocol (IPv4) to version six (IPv6). The transition to IPv6 will involve the IP network, the information exchange gateways, the core AIS, the functional area services, and the supporting CIS infrastructure. The IPv6 naming and addressing plan being developed supports the NATO command structure and interoperability with NATO partners. The critical issue in the planning process is to support the incremental introduction of IPv6 whilst maintaining network security and reliable interworking with existing IPv4 systems and limiting increases in operations and maintenance costs. To minimise costs and maximise effectiveness NATO is planning the transition in a timescale that is commensurate with commercial adoption in NATO countries, the technology refreshment points for major systems, and the availability of IPv6 security components. New NATO projects will prepare for the transition by detailing their IPv6 upgrade path and procuring dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6) equipment. NATO will develop and adopt standardised approaches for IPv6 protocols and network design.</jats:p>"

This paper suggests ways in which continuity planners can systematically deal with the potential economic consequences of such an outbreak. Thus far, much attention has focused on the potential health consequences of a pandemic outbreak, but limited attention has been paid to operational impacts. As a first-level response, continuity planners are modifying existing plans by benchmarking their approaches to a set of known events that have occurred in the past. One of the limitations of this strategy is that the nature of a pandemic is very different from the core characteristics of disruptive phenomena such as terrorism or events of severe weather. For this reason, planners will be called upon to adopt a revised planning framework. This will also be likely to move telework to the forefront of continuity planning. Indeed, integrating telework into the body of business continuity planning might be one of the most significant planning precedents established during the coming months, not just in the way it manages telework, but also as it institutionalises telework as standard operating procedure within the workplace.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">When an organisation has many demands competing for limited asset management resources, it must allocate such resources in a way that will have the most impact on its core mission while minimising business continuity risk. Logically, resources should go to managing those assets that are most important to the strategy and operations of the organisation. In reality, however, most business continuity/risk/facility managers lack a disciplined, data-driven approach for setting management and investment priorities. The difficulty in attempting to align funding/management attention with higher priority assets is that the often qualitative concept of ‘important’ must be quantified. This paper will explain how to develop a quantitative measure — an asset priority index (API) — to score each asset in the portfolio to reflect criteria important to an organisation. It also describes how the API can be used as part of an overarching asset portfolio management strategy, and how business continuity/risk managers can involve senior management in asset management decisions. The authors will explore three basic questions: • How can API help organisations better manage their assets? • What is the process for involving upper management and stakeholders in creating an API? • How have other organisations successfully implemented the API framework?</jats:p>"

The International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE) has developed competencies for all nurses, as well as online modules for meeting those competencies. In addition, other curriculum resources are available that range from face-to-face classes, web-based modules, and electronic journals, to complete pre-packaged materials. The author of this article describes competencies needed for emergency preparedness identified by Columbia University, Vanderbilt University, and the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education, as well as various curriculum resources for emergency planning and response and also processes to prepare nurses for emergency responses. Examples of international \"Best Practices\" feature programs that provide examples of innovative educational strategies for preparing nurses for emergency response are presented. The author concludes that while curriculum resources are widely available, a better centralized clearinghouse could be made available for both faculty and students.</jats:p>"

It illustrates why and how businesses are changing, demanding that traditional silos of risk thinking be broken down, and business continuity management (BCM) become a central and crucial tool for the board and its risk management team. The paper also sets out to explain an important need for traditional organisational barriers to be lowered among the risk community. As in all business change, there are drivers for that change. By exploring and understanding these drivers, it will be possible to fully appreciate why business continuity itself is changing, and why it must change further if it is to satisfy the needs and trust of its own stakeholders. That understanding will also help to forecast the challenges and opportunities for risk and continuity professionals that will evolve in years to come. It will also encourage some organisations to rethink how BCM is best skilled and positioned within their management structures.</jats:p>"

Consistent with this, I find that a firm's propensity to groom an internal candidate for the CEO position is related to firm size, degree of diversification, and industry structure. My results also suggest that succession planning is associated with a higher probability of inside succession and voluntary succession and a lower probability of forced succession. I also provide evidence that horizon problems are mitigated to some extent by having a succession plan.</jats:p>",

The company's philosophy is to operate as a virtual organization, outsourcing many aspects of its programme in order to leverage the capability of local and international service and technology providers to gain competitive advantage. With an approach such as this, driven by a very small central leadership team, an effective planning capability underpinning effective execution becomes a critical core competency.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Even in a small company such as Stuart, the exploration, development and production programme contains in excess of 5000 key items in any one year, including both office and field activities. Stuart Petroleum uses a state of the art MP-ReMS™ (Multi-Project Resource Management System) planning platform, which dynamically models the oil and gas exploration development programme across the enterprise, based on key corporate objectives.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This capability has yielded significant benefit in optimising resource and materials utilisation and has facilitated substantial cost reductions. Stuart Petroleum has successfully linked its planning strategies directly to its corporate objectives hence connecting the work programme directly to the outcomes achieved for its shareholders. The planning platform models the deployment of critical resources and also tracks milestones in the undertaking of each event, underscoring the priorities of the business.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A Constraint Management approach is employed to accelerate drilling and production hookup of a ranked seriatum of oil and gas prospects with minimal resource and material wastage.

Similarly, as service activities become standardized components of high-school programs, youth are empowered to becoming long-term contributors to local development efforts. Through this process youth engage in shared citizenship, leading to greater investment in their communities.  This research was based on the premise that youth, acting as central parts of the community development process, have the capacity to improve local well-being. It reflects input from 12 key informants and 418 youth who participated in a survey conducted on the development issues contributing to their involvement.  The findings of this study provide insights into the factors most directly shaping youth attitudes and involvement in their communities, as well as presenting direct implications for applied use.</jats:p>"

Families of five or more children are typical of traditional Pacific lifestyles, but in the majority of Pacific countries average population growth rates now exceed average economic growth rates, and there are growing rural-urban inequalities in access to services and wage employment opportunities. Some Pacific countries have used migration to offset natural population increase and earn remittances to supplement national income, but that strategy has several disadvantages, including a tendency to support high fertility. This article argues that despite efforts made by some Pacific countries to reduce their population growth rates, such strategies are unlikely to succeed unless families and communities can be convinced that future benefits from having smaller families will exceed the known advantages of a large family size. Recent initiatives to slow the rate of population increase in the atoll nation of Kiribati are examined and their prospects of success are evaluated in the light of Kiribati culture and prevailing attitudes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Daunting obstacles to the development of careers in academic medicine represent the most important threat to the future of academic neurology. The Long Range Planning Committee of the American Neurological Association has for the past 2 years considered what practical methods might be undertaken to enhance the attractiveness of careers as neurologist investigators and to ensure that aspiring clinician‐scientists are encouraged and retained. The deliberations have resulted in several recommendations. First, a plan has been developed to introduce flexibility during residency training in neurology. This will permit trainees who plan careers in academic medicine to have a substantial exposure to research during residency, shortening the subsequent transition to independent careers. Second, the American Neurological Association will create an annual course in clinical neuroscience research, to be held each summer for academically oriented residents. Improved mentoring and career guidance was identified as a third priority, addressed in part by the development of several new courses for trainees and mentors. Finally, planning is under way for a new postresidency training program in clinical research that will link small and large departments of neurology. Beyond these recommendations, the entire continuum of training for physician‐scientists should be reexamined, from the first days of college to the successful launch as independent investigators. The development of additional demonstration projects to improve the quality and reduce the total length of training would be highly desirable. Ann Neurol 2006;60:278–285</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent academic debates on transnationalism, immigration, and citizenship have largely ignored migrants' perspectives on citizenship. On the basis of ethnographic research in Germany and the United States between 1998 and 2001, we examine the values and meanings contemporary migrants assign to national citizenship and their citizenship practices. We argue that dominant discourses of liberal democratic citizenship and migrants' situated subject positions condition and mediate in complex ways their imaginings and practices of citizenship. We discuss how and why migrants' perspectives conform in significant ways across these two countries, while also varying among migrants. National citizenship remains meaningful in their struggle for mobility across borders, for equal protection under the law, and for equal access to social and political rights. However, migrants are also aware of the discrepancy between promises of equity and fairness associated with liberal democratic citizenship and the reality in which even naturalized migrants experience discrimination. Issues of belonging to and identification with the national community render national citizenship complicated for migrants as they negotiate multiple identities and allegiances, with varying outcomes. Differences among migrants notwithstanding, the majority can and do identify with multiple communities, and desire to participate and become members in more than one national community, suggesting that migrants challenge conceptions of bounded national citizenship. This does not entail, however, a deterritorialization of citizenship and identities. </jats:p>",

Results indicate that the individuals do not have a high level of career awareness, have done relatively little postsport career planning during their coaching careers, and moderately appreciate their career transition needs. However, a positive relationship is found between support systems for coaches and career awareness, career planning, and career transition needs. Results are discussed with regard to career transition theory, as well as previous research on career transitions among sports coaches and athletes. Recommendations for future research, as well as suggestions for career counseling practice, are suggested. </jats:p>",

In this paper I aim to broaden the empirical reach of the literature by examining the transformation of several municipalities from rural backwaters into powerful political and economic forces in Toulouse, France. I also aim to broaden existing theoretical approaches by closely examining the state's role in the empowerment of this particular patch of suburbs. In particular, I argue that changes in both local economic and state structures have presented officials across Toulouse, France with a broad range of opportunities. Actors with heightened strategic capacities, like those actors composing the suburbs under investigation, have been better able to acquire the wealth and power needed to become potent territorial forces. </jats:p>",

Due to the efforts of the bank’s Business Continuity Team and the Business Continuity Coordinators within the building, critical operations were recovered by the morning of the next business day. Clients were not impacted. As the Business Continuity and Crisis Manager for the bank, Jack was charged with the effort of building a comprehensive programme that would be tested on the largest scale to date. In this paper he presents the valuable lessons learned from the event including what went well and what did not. The paper details how various areas within the organisation were involved in the recovery effort including facilities, human resources, security, insurance, computing infrastructure, life safety and crisis management. The result of tireless planning was that, despite over US$50m in damage to the building and most departments being displaced for weeks without prior notice, the company did not file a business interruption claim with its insurance company.</jats:p>"

In contrast, this paper argues for an understanding which treats constructions of the capabilities of technology as interpretatively flexible and grounded within specific contexts. The paper begins with a review of perspectives towards understanding technological change. Next, I provide an overview of the discourse analysis literature. This locates the form of discourse analysis used here, systematic constructionism, within this milieu. Then, I introduce enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and evaluate the literature. This is followed by a description of the context in which an ERP system was introduced and the methods of data collection and analysis. The analysis elaborates how three interpretative repertoires used to justify the implementation of the ERP system were disrupted by counter‐constructions produced by individuals reciprocally positioned within them. Moving on, I discuss the contributions and limitations of this approach for understanding technological change, before reflecting on how my commitments affect the data presented here and my ability to contribute to debates on technology. Finally, I propose there is a need for further studies that focus on unravelling the rhetoric surrounding technological change.</jats:p>",

The primary focus of care during this time is on detecting and treating complications and may not necessarily include advance care planning discussions. This focus may leave clinicians unaware of the recipient's treatment preferences and place a burden on families trying to decide whether to undergo or forgo life-sustaining treatment when the recipient's medical condition deteriorates. We report the case of a woman with bronchiolitis obliterans who was admitted to the transplant center 37 times and died in the intensive care unit. Although progressive deterioration of her medical condition was well documented, her medical records revealed no evidence of advance care planning discussions with the patient and family. Incorporating timely advance care planning and integrating palliative care in the ongoing posttransplant clinical management may benefit patients, families, and clinicians as recipients approach the final stage of their illness. </jats:p>",

This paper mainly present a trajectory planning method of space manipulator that can track, approach and catch the USS in free-floating situation. According to the motion characteristics of USS, we plan a spiral ascending trajectory for space manipulator to approach towards USS in Cartesian space. However, it is difficult to map this trajectory into the joint space and realize feasible motion in joint space because of dynamics singularities and dynamics couple of space robot system. Therefore, we utilize interval algorithm to handle these difficulties. The simulation study verifies that the spiral ascending trajectory can been realized. Moreover, the motion of manipulator is smooth and stable, the disturbance to the base is so limited that the attitude control can compensate it. </jats:p>",

Frequency distributions were calculated for the prevalence of activities, and cross‐tabulations were used to compare prevalence by clinic characteristics.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Every clinic engaged in at least one activity to promote parent‐child communication, and nine in 10 offered multiple activities. Most of the clinics used counseling sessions to talk to adolescent clients about the importance of discussing sexual health issues with parents (73–94%, depending on the reason for the visit). More than eight in 10 clinics (84%) distributed pamphlets on how to talk about these issues. A substantial minority (43%) offered or referred interested individuals to educational programs designed to improve communication. Some of these exploratory findings reflect the prevalence of activities among all U.S. family planning clinics that serve adolescent clients.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> Evaluation and expansion of clinic efforts to promote voluntary communication about sexual health issues between parents and children could help encourage family participation.</jats:p>",

Archival and ethnographic research in Germany illustrates that assimilation discourses are central in the dialectical process of identity construction in which native-born Germans and immigrants from Turkey construct their respective ‘other’, and thereby themselves. I pay particular attention to the effects of assimilation discourses in negotiations over belonging and culture at multiple scales in Germany—from the national to the neighborhood level. Space figures prominently in these negotiations, as the spaces that immigrants occupy and create often become the focus of debates about difference, otherness, and the unassimilability of migrants in Germany. </jats:p>",

This paper examines how effective the former guidance has been, how it has been modified to form PPS 6, the likely impacts of the new guidance and what support from other policies will be necessary to achieve the stated objectives. Although PPG 6 has supported some successes in achieving objectives relating to accessibility of services by public transport, walking and cycling, and has supported some central areas, the overall picture is one of continued aggravation of the problems identified in it, principally the decline of many central areas, increasing problems of accessibility to services and deteriorating environmental quality. PPS 6 places greater emphasis on analysing relationships between central areas and on assessing development needs. These changes will help clarify the problems but will need the support of other policies outside PPS 6, in particular policies relating to the amount of travel. Increasing travel over many years has been accompanied by polarisation of central areas; the decline of many commercial centres, especially the smaller ones, is causing social exclusion, deteriorating performance on sustainability criteria, and results in greater demands for expenditure on transport infrastructure. A case study of Dudley in the West Midlands examines how the guidance might help a town centre severely affected by decline since the mid 1980s.</jats:p>",

The proposed framework combines insights from strategic management theory with novel quantitative valuation tools from finance. Strategic planning is viewed as a process of actively developing and managing portfolios of corporate real options in the context of competitive interactions. As such, the expanded valuation framework recognizes that future growth opportunity value deriving from the firm's resources and capabilities must explicitly account for uncertainty, adaptability, and competitive responsiveness. The resulting expanded valuation framework is able to capture the value of the adaptive resources and capabilities that enable a firm to adapt and re‐deploy assets, develop and exploit synergies, and gain competitive advantage via time‐to‐market and first‐ or second‐mover advantages. We show how two basic metrics in this value‐based framework, current profitability of assets in place and future growth option value, can be obtained from financial market data and how they can be used in active portfolio planning.</jats:p>",

Received histories of geography which give the impression of the production of geographical knowledge as a (near) universal male domain and the post-1960s critique of the regional approach as descriptive and nonhermeneutical have combined to make invisible the geographical work of most women (and some men) working in British universities in the first half of the 20th century. Despite this, insights can clearly be gained from biographical studies of both ‘ordinary’ geographers like Hilda Ormsby and the epistemology of the ‘ordinary region’. This allows for a richer and more-nuanced critical historiography of geography, but there is also a potentially fruitful reciprocity in conversation between that history of geographical ideas and explorations of economic alterity. Regional studies which may have been dismissed as ‘merely descriptive’ can be found to articulate detailed accounts of local socioeconomic practices giving evidence of the historical grounding for current economic standing, including complex and sometimes resistant interaction with dominant modes of economic ‘success’. </jats:p>",

The interplay of intra-field faulting and the layered geology mean that there is the potential for a high degree of compartmentalisation. A significant proportion of the reserves are thought to reside in the reservoirs of the Thylacine Sandstone Member, which are poor quality marine sands interbedded with successions of thinly bedded sand-shale and shale. Key to designing wells to achieve satisfactory deliverability was an understanding the distribution of net reservoir in the background of non-reservoir.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Thylacine development required a low cost, highly efficient development concept to tap these reservoirs. The Thylacine Alpha platform provided a base for drilling of these horizontal wells. The horizontal wells required careful positioning and design to best exploit the resource, due to a mix of the complex structure within the field and significant reservoir quality and distribution uncertainty. To better place the wells, and enhance the outcome predictability for the wells, deterministic and probabilistic amplitude –versus-offset (AVO) inversions were carried out. Simple acoustic impedance models showed improved resolution over the PSDM data, and provided insight into reservoir architecture and geometry and hence confidence in our ability to predict reservoir occurrence for drilling across the field. In parallel, a review of the available core and log data from the exploration/appraisal wells supported construction of a geological model with built-in predictability. The combination of predictive geological model, aimed at improving sub-seismic resolution, and seismic inversion to identify trends in seismic scale reservoir geometry, proved invaluable in both the well planning and execution phases of the project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper outlines the planning phase of the wells and influence of the geological model on resultant well designs and the preliminary outcomes of the execution phase.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A real-time joint trajectory generator for planar walking bipeds is proposed. In the near future this trajectory planner will be implemented on the robot “Lucy”, which is actuated by pleated pneumatic artificial muscles. The trajectory planner generates dynamically stable motion patterns by using a set of objective locomotion parameters as its input, and by tuning and exploiting the natural upper body dynamics. The latter can be determined and manipulated by using the angular momentum equation. Basically, trajectories for hip and swing foot motion are generated, which guarantee that the objective locomotion parameters attain certain prescribed values. Additionally, the hip trajectories are slightly modified such that the upper body motion is steered naturally, meaning that it requires practically no actuation. This has the advantage that the upper body actuation hardly influences the position of the Zero Moment Point. The effectiveness of the strategy developed is demonstrated by simulation results. A first simulation is performed under the assumption of perfect tracking by the controllers of the different actuators. This allows one to verify the effectiveness of the trajectory planner and to evaluate the postural stability. A second simulation is performed while taking the control architecture of the real robot into account. In order to have a more realistic simulation the proposed control architecture is evaluated with a full hybrid dynamic simulation model of the biped “Lucy”. This simulator combines the dynamical behaviour of the robot with the thermodynamical effects that take place in the muscle-valves actuation system. The observed hardware limitations of the real robot and expected model errors are taken into account in order to give a realistic qualitative evaluation of the control performance and to test the robustness. </jats:p>",

In order to achieve this, I examine Latin American immigrants' struggle for belonging in Toronto by looking at the Canadian Hispanic Day Parade. This multicultural celebration of ethnic diversity takes place in a marginalized suburban neighbourhood of the city, and I argue that Latin Americans use it to affirm the existence of a Latin American identity and community in Toronto. But, while the parade serves to contest dominant representations of immigrants, visible minorities, and the disadvantaged, it also reveals how forms of community mobilization can internalize neoliberal social relations and even promote a neoliberal agenda. The aim of the paper is to reflect upon the political potential of ethnic celebrations, as well as the constraints and complexities of immigrant citizenship practice within the contemporary context of Canadian multiculturalism and neoliberalism. </jats:p>",

In this paper we examine historical shifts in the representation of foreigners within Swiss state discourses and the effects of these shifts on the integration of immigrants into Swiss society. As state discourses regarding foreigners significantly changed after the First World War, the emphasis of immigration policies shifted from a facilitating to a constraining approach. Überfremdung, the notion that excessive numbers of foreigners can threaten Swiss identity, emerged as one of the most influential discourses in Switzerland and provided the foundation for a quantitative and qualitative strategy of defence against the immigration, settlement, and naturalisation of foreigners. In recent years, however, an agreement on freedom of movement between Switzerland and the European Union has been struck, and immigration policies have once again adopted a facilitating stance. As this applies only to citizens of the European Union, a stratified system of immigrant rights has been continued and perpetuated. At the same time, right-wing parties, which have recently risen to power, have successfully used Überfremdung propaganda to persuade Swiss populations to vote against the relaxation of conditions for the naturalisation of foreigners, thus ensuring that immigrants will be excluded from access to citizenship rights over generations. The politics of immigration in Switzerland is above all a politics of national identity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Past research on labour-market skills shortages indicates that employers report skills shortages or hard-to-fill vacancies for a variety of different reasons. Nevertheless, there is some consensus that skills-shortages analysis needs to examine such shortages within the context of the local labour market in order to understand the labour-market dynamics and structural factors that affect the propensity for unemployed people to fill ‘skills shortage’ vacancies. The traditional approach has been to utilise qualitative analysis and case studies. In contrast, in this paper we undertake a multivariate probit analysis of employer perceptions of skills shortages utilising a subregional dataset from a survey of Dorset employers undertaken in 1998. On a general level, we demonstrate the complexity involved in attempting to measure skills problems using the responses of employers to standard surveys. The key findings of the probit analysis are that: firm size is a significant determinant in skills-deficiency perception, growing firms have a higher skills-shortage perception, and reported perceptions of skills deficiencies vary significantly according to the position of the respondent in the organisation. This reinforces the message that great care needs to be taken when analysing measures of skills deficiencies that are derived solely from employer surveys at national or subregional level. </jats:p>",

In landscape and environmental planning, information can be presented in a number of ways, ranging from texts and statistics to realistic representations such as 3D visualisations. We assume that 3D visualisations of scenarios\n for landscape changes are a key element for informed decision making. In order to assess the role of 3D visualisation in the planning and decision making process, we have examined three case studies related to generating energy (i. e., hydro power, reclamation of a brown coal surface mine,\n and wind turbines). In the early 1990s when 3D visualisation technology was just becoming more widely available, the application was typically limited to large infrastructure projects that were often subject to an environmental impact assessment. At that time 3D visualisation was only used\n to show the results of the planning and decision making process. There are indications that this is now changing towards integrating visualisation already in the earliest planning steps. Such integration allows both planning experts and the public to engage on equal footing in the entire planning\n and decision making process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Because predicting and outlining guidance for all possible scenarios is difficult, advance directives are rarely sufficiently precise to dictate patient preferences in specific situations as a disease progresses. Nonetheless, advance care planning is an essential process that should begin at the time of diagnosis, if not already initiated, to ensure that all patient and family rights are preserved. Communicating effectively with the patient and family and having the patient designate a surrogate decision-maker are critical. Attention must be paid to resolving conflicts among patient values and preferences and those of family and the health care team. Patient-centered goals for care and expectations should be elicited at first assessment and reassessed frequently as conditions change. As a disease progresses, advance directives are rarely precise enough to predict all possible scenarios and outline guidance for care. Therefore, for patients with advanced metastatic cancer and a potential life expectancy of less than 1 year, converting patient-centered treatment goals into actionable medical orders while the patient maintains capacity is a more effective way to ensure that patient preferences are honored. Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) and similar medical order forms provide explicit direction about resuscitation status (“code status”) if the patient is pulseless and apneic. POLST also includes directions about additional interventions the patient may or may not want. A decade of research in Oregon has proved that the POLST Paradigm Program more accurately conveys end-of-life preferences that are more likely to be followed by medical professionals than traditional advance directives alone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is widely claimed that recent migration trends show increasing levels of transnational activity, but there is a need for a more detailed understanding of the relationship between transnationalism and citizenship participation, particularly from a gendered perspective. A study of immigrants from Hong Kong to Vancouver and Toronto, the largest group of immigrants to Canada in the period 1989 to 1997, shows that, although migration occurred in a context of anticipated political instability around reunification with the People's Republic of China, the most significant justification for emigration was to further the interests of the family, particularly children's education. Gender differences are subtle, but women tend to focus more strongly on family considerations, whereas men are somewhat more concerned with economic and political issues. Transnational activities focus around ties of family and friendship, rather than around political or economic ties. Women and men both seek formal rights of citizenship, and are beginning to express a desire for more participation in Canadian society. Contrary to theories of hypermobility among Hong Kong emigrants, transnationalism and citizenship participation are seen as a basis for settlement. Gendered approaches to transnationalism need to understand how the concept of citizenship, and citizenship participation, develops as a result of wider social relations that are structured differently for women and men. </jats:p>",

Public agency planners in Contra Costa County, California used the theory of change approach to organize service planning for a population of youth who had been arrested and involved with juvenile probation. The theory of change process described in this paper links community outcomes with planned activities with the assumptions or principles that underlie the community planning efforts. When complete, a theory of change logic model can serve as a guide for implementation, ensuring that community plans for service delivery remain true to their intent. The theory of change development process includes twelve stages and is based on a step‐by‐step approach. Theory of change logic models establish a context for articulating a community's shared beliefs and prompt local stakeholders to establish logical connections between the population to be served, expected results, and strategies intended to achieve those results.</jats:p>",

These worksheets are used by NRCS as part of the criteria for creating a conservation plan to qualify landowners for payments under the USDA Farm Bill Conservation Title. Presently, most worksheets are filled out by hand or in personal computer spreadsheets. If worksheets such as these were available over the web, landowners could also self‐assess the conditions on their farms or ranches before requiring assistance of NRCS conservation planners or technical service providers. Because many conservation worksheets have a similar style and behavior, we created an automated web‐script generator that produces a dynamic web‐page worksheet from a common template file and a configuration file. A worksheet‐specific configuration file provides the details for the worksheet. The template, configuration files, and web scripts are all in PHP (PHP hypertext processor). Each configuration file required approximately 5 h to program, a savings of more than 4 d compared with a web‐based worksheet programmed individually with a scripting language. In this way, various conservation worksheets can be quickly created for the web, as well as be easily maintained. As an example, we produced a suite of assessment worksheets used by Oregon NRCS with our automated web‐form conservation worksheet system.

These data contain commission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be present) and omission errors (when a species is mistakenly thought to be absent), and the rates of the two types of error are inversely related. Point locality data can minimize commission errors, but those obtained from museum collections are generally sparse, suffer from substantial spatial bias and contain large omission errors. Geographic ranges generate large commission errors because they assume homogenous species distributions. Predicted distribution data make explicit inferences on species occurrence and their commission and omission errors depend on model structure, on the omission of variables that determine species distribution and on data resolution. Omission errors lead to identifying networks of areas for conservation action that are smaller than required and centred on known species occurrences, thus affecting the comprehensiveness, representativeness and efficiency of selected areas. Commission errors lead to selecting areas not relevant to conservation, thus affecting the representativeness and adequacy of reserve networks. Conservation plans should include an estimation of commission and omission errors in underlying species data and explicitly use this information to influence conservation planning outcomes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past decade, sales of meat products labeled as natural (minimally processed) and produced without antibiotics and hormones have increased dramatically. In response to growing demand for meat products differentiated by various production attributes, many smaller-scale beef enterprises are considering direct marketing of their beef products to end-consumers as a viable approach to sustaining their family farming operations. This research uses survey data from Colorado consumers, and factor and cluster analysis to determine market segments for various (varied by production protocols and other meat attributes) natural beef products. Findings from the cluster analysis indicate that there are multiple segments of consumers who are likely to purchase natural beef, and that different segments are motivated by different factors. The most important factor explaining almost two-thirds of the differences among consumer responses relates to consumers' perceptions of the importance of meat attributes related to production practices (e.g. use of antibiotics, hormones and environmentally friendly grazing). Interestingly, the two consumer segments that are willing to pay a significantly higher premium for natural, local beef are motivated by different aspects of the meat and its intrinsic production attributes. One segment, representing 12.5% of consumers, ranked the importance of all production attributes significantly lower than the sample average. Consumers in this segment appear to be motivated by their perceptions of the extrinsic quality of natural beef products. The other segment, 13% of consumers, appears to be altruistic, ranking all production attributes such as ‘no antibiotics’, ‘no hormones’, and ‘humane treatment’, significantly higher than all of the other clusters. These results indicate the potential strength of production methods (and marketing of such quality differences) as product differentiation criteria. This paper illustrates the type of market research that may be useful for beef producers seeking value-added marketing opportunities, and portrays the types of consumers who are fueling the growth in natural meats in the United States. Such market analysis can facilitate producers' ability to effectively develop product concepts, labeling and promotional strategies targeted at the most receptive consumer segments, and illustrates that there is more than one type of consumer interested in purchasing products differentiated by sustainable production methods.</jats:p>",

The results reveal that husband-wife discussion about reproductive issues is fairly high in the study areas, with 59.2 percent and 66.4 percent of couples reporting spousal communication on family size and family planning respectively. The logistic regression models indicate that differences in spousal communication on desired family size and contraceptive use are associated with personal attributes such as demographic and social backgrounds of individuals and couples, including spousal age gap, joint educational attainment, religious affiliation of partners, type of marriage, frequency of couples’ exposure to radio and television as well as association membership. The major obstacles to spousal communication on fertility-related issues are cultural opposition and ignorance about modern norms and values. </jats:p>",

A model has been created illustrating the impact on the national red cell and platelet stocks using current assumptions made by the NHSBT Emergency Planning Group, NHS and the Department of Health (DH).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methodology </jats:bold> As no suitable model was available a model was created in Microsoft Excel, which is widely available within the National Blood Service (NBS) and NHSBT. This allows the user to change planning assumptions which will automatically recalculate the impact on the total NBS stock of red cells and platelets. The model can be used to view different scenarios, e.g.</jats:p><jats:p>Changes to demand (–10%)</jats:p><jats:p>Clinical attack rate–the % of total population contracting Flu (25%)</jats:p><jats:p>Possible duration and profile of pandemic wave as per NHS Flu Contingency Plan</jats:p><jats:p>% of population caring for victims (5%)</jats:p><jats:p>Deferral period for donors contracting flu (2 weeks ill and 2 weeks deferred)</jats:p><jats:p>Whole Blood and component donation supply (increased pre‐pandemic only)</jats:p><jats:p>Buffy Coat (BC) production (49%)</jats:p><jats:p>Starting stock (Red Cells 56 k, Platelets 958 doses)</jats:p><jats:p>% of population self deferring (based on NHSBT figures).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> The activities modelled in this particular scenario would increase red cell stock from 56 k to 62 k before the virus is isolated in the UK. Once there was widespread activity across the UK, red cell stock would fall to 40 k before recovering after the pandemic ends. Platelet stocks could be maintained if buffy coat production was increased to 49% (normally 29%). If a more extreme scenario is modelled e.g. the clinical attack rate is increased to 50%, red cell stock would fall to 4 k (without further demand reduction) and platelet stock could only be maintained if buffy coat production is increased to 85%.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion </jats:bold> This model is useful in illustrating the impact of flu planning assumptions on the ability of the NBS to maintain supply of red cells and platelets and could model other scenarios e.g. severe weather conditions or terrorist activity. As more information becomes available, the NBS and other Blood Services can use the model to illustrate the impact of revised assumptions and take appropriate action to mitigate problems. The model can be used to assess potential policy decisions e.g. donor deferral periods and it could be used in real time as a potential pandemic emerges to help inform decision‐making by predicting future stock levels. The model is being further developed to assist NBS and NHSBT in predicting impact on staffing resource levels. While the model is dynamic and easily manipulated the eventual output is determined by the accuracy of the assumptions. The ultimate accuracy of the model and the assumptions will only be fully understood if and when a Flu Pandemic develops.</jats:p>",

The deviation <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8761-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8761:mp8761-math-0007\" />MR‐FDTD<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8761-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8761:mp8761-math-0008\" />, and the HT phase/amplitude corrections depend on the type of phantom, certain channel groups, pattern steering, and the positioning error. Appropriate agreement between three‐dimensional specific absorption rate distributions measured by MR‐thermography and planning calculations is achieved, if the correct position and adapted feed point parameters are considered. As long as feed‐point parameters are uncertain (i.e., cannot be directly measured during therapy), a prospective planning will remain difficult. However, we can use the information of MR thermography to better predict the patterns in the future even without the knowledge of feed‐point parameters.</jats:p>",

Given subsequent increases in the numbers of clients served and contraceptive methods offered by the program, updated estimates of its impact on fertility are needed.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>METHODS:</jats:bold> Claims data on contraceptives dispensed were used to estimate the number of pregnancies experienced by women in the program in 2002. Medical record data on methods used prior to enrollment were used to predict client fertility in the absence of the program. Further analyses examined the sensitivity of these estimates to alternative assumptions about contraceptive failure rates, contraceptive continuation and contraceptive use in the absence of program services.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Almost 6.4 million woman‐months of contraception, provided primarily by oral contraceptives (57%), barrier methods (19%) and the injectable (18%), were dispensed through Family PACT during 2002. As a result, an estimated 205,000 pregnancies—which would have resulted in 79,000 abortions and 94,000 births, including 21,400 births to adolescents—were averted. Changing the base assumptions regarding contraceptive failure rates or method use had relatively small effects on the estimates, whereas assuming that clients would use no contraceptives in the absence of Family PACT nearly tripled the estimate of pregnancies averted.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> Because all contraceptive methods substantially reduce the risk of pregnancy, Family PACT'S impact on preventing pregnancy lies primarily in providing contraceptives to women who would otherwise not use any method.</jats:p>",

All studies were performed with the surgeon present. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p> An ICAVL-accredited vascular laboratory database of upper extremity noninvasive vascular studies performed during a 12-month period was reviewed. The study group consisted of 152 end stage renal disease patients who received Doppler ultrasound and/or noninvasive physiologic testing for the purpose of assisting in planning or maintenance of hemodialysis access. The study group yielded a total of 252 exams as follows: (1) preoperative evaluation to determine site and suitability for use in AV access creation (n = 133); (2) existing AV access (AV fistula or graft) with clinical symptoms indicating malfunction and need for identifying the location and/or nature of the problem (n = 98); (3) finger arterial pressures and wave forms (with and without access compression) in patients with clinical symptoms of steal syndrome (n = 21). </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> Of the 133 preoperative evaluations, 67 (51%) resulted in creation of an AV graft and 66 (49%) in an AV fistula. AV graft was chosen over fistula because of duplex findings of inadequate (&lt;2 mm in diameter) or deep (&gt;7 mm below skin level) veins. In all cases, the site and arm were determined by duplex findings and were marked preoperatively by the surgeon. In 72 (73.5%) of the 98 malfunctioning AV accesses, the etiology and site were identified by duplex ultrasound. These included thrombosing/failing access (n = 18, 25%), outflow venous stenosis (n = 16, 22.2%), inflow arterial stenosis (n = 15, 20.8%), anastomotic stenosis (n = 9, 12.5%), and miscellaneous causes (n = 14, 19.5%). Again, sites were marked by the access surgeon to guide intraoperative management. Steal was confirmed to be present in 11 (52%) of 21 patients and the surgeon determined the degree of arterial banding based on intraoperative changes in digital pressures. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> Preoperative duplex scanning of upper extremity vasculature with the access surgeon present allows for accurate and precise planning in the creation of AV access. This has the potential to improve compliance with K/DOQI guidelines. Success in rescuing failing angioaccess is also enhanced by non-invasive testing in the presence of the operating surgeon. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

The survey requested information related to respondent assessment and instructional practices, second language resource availability, satisfaction, and language decision procedures for ELL students. Results indicated many of the respondents assessed and instructed their students in English, lacked ELL training, experienced resource shortages, and did not include parents in the language of instruction decision. Additional findings revealed that teacher satisfaction was predicted by the availability of second language resources, and the administration appeared to have a significant influence on the inclusion/exclusion of parents in the language decision process. The implications of these findings are presented. </jats:p>",
