The quantitative methods which planners use are well known, well established in practice, and acknowledged by most as tools of the planners' trade. In contrast to this, most planners also use qualitative methods but these are rarely explicitly acknowledged. </jats:p>",

Overall, it can be concluded that the demand for analytic techniques by planning practitioners has grown and the demand for and supply of these techniques within the field of planning have converged </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The majority of energy modeling has been conducted for the purpose of forecasting the future. The experience has been, for the most part, a long record of erroneous forecasts misleading to public and private sector policymaking. An alternative use of models is for understanding and expansion of community debate. This article delineates some of the distinguishing features of the two modeling approaches and compares three sets of energy scenarios, generated in the mid-1970s using models developed as tools for understanding, to sets of energy forecasts. Comparisons are made for electricity and transportation energy use in Wisconsin and total primary energy for the U.S. Using the criteria of which of the two approaches has more closely matched actual outcomes, the modeling for understanding approach appears to be superior. Other advantages to a modeling for understanding approach are described, as are implications for planning education and practice. </jats:p>",

This article seeks to examine the main context of policy affecting the two health‐care systems, the means now used to achieve the systems' goals, and the validity of claims of convergence. The focus is conceptual, although a significant aim is to assess recent policies in a comparative framework.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The last 40 years has been a time of rapid demographic, social and economic change in most countries of the world. In Europe, the ageing of the population, a decrease in household size, and the reduced importance of parasitic and infectious diseases along with an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases are some of the most notable results of industrialization, urbanization and medical progress. These developments lead to changing demands not only for the services of hospitals but upon the health care system at large. Most recently, and in addition, these changes have had to be faced under resource constraints resulting from decreased economic growth.</jats:p><jats:p>This article focuses on the similarities and differences within and across the health care systems of European countries, and on their efforts to respond to the changes which have taken place and are likely to continue in the near future. In so doing, it relates the various demographic, social and economic changes taking place in these countries to the structural changes noticeable in the hospital sector.</jats:p><jats:p>The results obtained by statistical analyses of empirical evidence lead us to conclude that demographic and social variables may better explain the differences in hospital use within a given country over longer stretches of time than across countries at a given point in time. In the latter case, economic variables—differences in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita—serve as major explanations of the cross‐country differences found. Changes in demographic, social and morbidity factors are also mirrored in the relative importance of hospital departments, at a given point in time and also in changes over time.</jats:p><jats:p>Major changes have taken place within the health care systems. Hospitals are losing ground to other forms of health care: for instance, to institutions providing pre‐hospital and post‐hospital treatment. The need for more caring patterns of service, rather than for more curing, accounts for yet another overall trend. Hospitals have started to respond to this need by offering more ‘semi‐stationary’ and part‐time health care facilities. These developments go hand in hand with the establishment of closer relations between hospitals and other facilities within the health care system, and with improved non‐stationary health care services.</jats:p>",

Partners in the block are Conoco Norway Inc., Operator (30%), Den norske stats oljeselskap a.s, (50%), Arco Norway Inc., (10%), and Tenneco Oil Company Norsk A/S, (10%). Reservoir delineation has begun with three additional wells drilled to date.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Heidrun Field lies under 350 m (1150 ft) of water in Blocks 6507/7 and 6507/8. The average reservoir depth is 2375 m (7800 ft) subsea. The hydrocarbon bearing strata are predominantly unconsolidated sands which exhibit varied sedimentology, mineralogy and permeability through the section.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A variety of drilling and completion challenges will arise in order to fully exploit the reserves. Due to the relatively shallow depth of the reservoir and the areal extent of the sands. These include the following: High angle drillingPossible sand control measures over long sectionsHigh production rate completion practices</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper deals with preliminary drilling and completion considerations. Items covered include reservoir modelling for well requirements; well flow analysis for well capability; structure requirements to meet various alternatives; subsea well alternatives; and sand production prediction studies to help determine completion techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on urbanisation has been hampered by discrepancies between the administrative boundaries of towns and a meaningful spatial framework of urbanism that recognises both the true extent of the built-up areas of towns and the functional linkages between urban centres and their surrounding hinterland. An ‘urban area’ definition has been recently developed for British census statistics to represent the physical reality of urban boundaries in terms of land that is urban in use, whereas the functional approach to urban definition has been implemented in terms of a set of urban-centred labour-market areas. In this paper the spatial frameworks of physical and functional definitions are combined in order to investigate processes of population growth in small- and medium-sized towns in England between 1971 and 1981. As in other studies, a general tendency to counterurbanisation— higher growth rates for smaller urban areas (physically defined)—is demonstrated. However, a variety of types of ‘counterurbanisation’ also become apparent. In addition to growth of smaller towns in rural areas beyond metropolitan influence, there has been growth of towns in the labour-market areas of newer freestanding urban centres, and also in the decentralised commuter hinterlands of large metropolitan cores. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper a number of causal processes which may underlie different types of growth are investigated, setting this investigation within the standard and labour-market regional context of physical urban areas. There is evidence of ‘people-led’ growth in environmentally attractive locations (for example, through retirement migration). However, growth of small- and medium-sized towns also reflects employment decentralisation and deconcentration to freestanding or satellite towns, and the extension of commuter hinterlands linked both to a growth of car commuting and to availability of land for private-sector housing. Government policies encouraging growth are also demonstrated to be significant. Conversely, decline in a minority of small towns often indicates a diminishing employment base or policy restrictions on growth. The impact on modelling growth in urban areas of a diversity of causal processes and locational contexts for growth is considered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The major objective of the study of the dimensions of automobile demand (1981–1988) is to obtain reliable forecasts of the variables which drive the fundamental energy equation: energy consumed (litres) = efficiency of technology (litres per 100 kilometres) × utilisation rate (kilometres per period). Since the level of utilisation is unlikely to be independent of the state of technology, and since both dimensions are conditioned by the state of the economy and the nature of households as well as by the extent of corporate-sector support to the household sector, it is necessary to view the levels of vehicle usage and vehicle fuel efficiency as outputs of the broader household decision process. </jats:p><jats:p> This broader context can be represented by a study of the household's choice of automobiles (by number and composition) and level of utilisation. This perspective enables us to view vehicle efficiency and utilisation as derivatives of a study of the household's demand for mobility services, which is derived from the demand for end activities (consumption of goods and leisure). Since we are especially interested in the role of fuel prices and vehicle technology in the household's decision on the level of vehicle utilisation, it is desirable to monitor the response path of a sample of households over a period of time. A single cross-section approach cannot identify the influence of changing fuel prices on vehicle use, nor can it adequately accommodate the temporal relationship between vehicle purchase/disposal decisions and the utilisation rate. To represent satisfactorily the role of policy variables (for example, fuel prices, taxes associated with vehicle possession, standards for vehicle technology) in the context of the wider set of influences on household automobile possession and usage, the study members have developed an econometric model system which jointly models the household's choice of vehicles and utilisation level over the period 1981–1985. This paper provides an overview of the theoretical, methodological, and empirical dimensions of the project and, where appropriate, introduces some preliminary findings. The project in its entirety is due for completion in late 1988. </jats:p>",

This project was planned as a large hydrocarbon miscible flood. The basic project concept is to manufacture a miscible injectant from the field separator off-gas. This injectant is compressed and delivered to the EOR project area for injection in a water-alternating-gas (WAG) mode. The miscible gas supply will vary, generally increasing with time. Over the first 10 years of the project, an average supply of 200 MMscf/D [5.66×106 m3/d] is anticipated. The gas processing plant and the factors affecting miscible gas supply are described. The EOR project area was selected by a screening process. This led to a project area definition encompassing 4.9×109 RB [779×106 m3] PV containing 2.2×109 STB [350×106 m3] original oil in place (OOIP). The planned cumulative volume of miscible gas injected will be 10% PV. Reservoir studies indicate an incremental oil recovery by miscible flooding of some 5.2% OOIP or 115×106 STB [18.3×106 m3]. Aspects of these reservoir studies are described.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The Sadlerochit reservoir is both the ultimate source of the miscible solvent and the target reservoir. This introduces several reservoir/facility interaction effects. The planning of a major EOR project in the Arctic has also involved technical considerations not routinely encountered in conventional oilfield projects. Both aspects are discussed in the paper.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction and Background</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The ultimate recovery from the Sadlerochit reservoir of Prudhoe Bay is currently estimated at some 9×109 to 10×109 STB [1.4×109 to 1.6×109 m3], leaving more than 10×109 STB [1.6×109 m3] oil in place. At this projected abandonment, the Sadlerochit reservoir will still contain more oil than the original reserves for any other conventional oil reservoir (i.e., gravity greater than approximately 15°API [0.966 g/cm3]) in North America. Thus there is strong incentive to develop methods for increasing the recovery from the Prudhoe Bay field.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Severe economic and operational problems face any north Alaska EOR project. Ref. 1 highlights the relatively short window of opportunity for north Alaska EOR projects before operating economics and transportation costs curtail options. Early Prudhoe EOR screening studies were started shortly after the start of field production to investigate the applicability of the principal enhanced recovery methods. The possible recovery processes considered fell into four categories:surfactant flooding,enhanced waterflood techniques,thermal processes, andmiscible gas displacement processes.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Surfactant flooding is recognized as a potential EOR process. Recent reviews did not find a surfactant currently available that would be effective over the range of temperatures and salinities anticipated in the reservoir; however, laboratory studies of surfactants continue.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Enhanced waterflood techniques - such as carbonated, caustic, or polymer flooding - were found to offer limited potential for improving waterflood performance. Investigations indicated, however, that the techniques are not cost-effective because of the logistics of supplying large quantities of chemicals to the remote Arctic field location.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Thermal processes were eliminated because the depth and pressures of the Sadlerochhit formation make these processes economically unattractive for the light oil reservoir.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Two main types of miscible gas displacement processes were considered: vaporizing, or high-pressure lean-gas drive, and condensing, or rich-gas drive. The vaporizing process is not applicable at Prudhoe Bay because Sadlerochit crude is relatively low in intermediate components and because the critical pressure at which methane, or CO2, and Sadlerochit oil become miscible is well above reservoir pressure levels. On the other hand, the condensing process is viable. With the addition of intermediate hydrocarbons, principally ethane and propane, to separator off-gas, an injectant that is miscible with Sadlerochit oil at typical reservoir conditions can be obtained.2,3 The required intermediate hydrocarbon components can be obtained from produced fluids at Prudhoe.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The clients' personal physicians in the institution identified every chronic condition which required physician services, and recommended the kind of physician and frequency of visits for the management of each condition. Key informants reviewed these estimates and determined if there were sufficient physicians in their communities to provide this care. Thirty-two per cent of the conditions but only 8 per cent of the clients could be managed by a primary care physician. The most frequently required specialties were neurology, orthopedics, and ophthalmology. While primary care services and many of the necessary specialty services were available in the community to meet the needs of these individuals, several specialties essential to the medical care of this group were not available. These included orthopedics for the multiply-handicapped, neurology including behavioral neurology, and psychiatry. Deinstitutionalization policies which rely solely upon community physician services will lead to inadequate medical care in the community for some mentally retarded individuals. In these situations, alternative approaches to care must be developed. </jats:p>",

Intercity migration is assumed to take place based upon differences in utilities, where the utility function is expressed as a function of city size. It is revealed that a deterministic specification of the utility leads to an unstable distribution of city sizes, whereas a stochastic specification does not. Existence and stability of equilibria are examined for two representative stochastic migration models: the origin-constrained gravity model and the logit model. It is then argued that population concentration can be explained by an increase in urbanization economies, and population decentralization can be due to a decrease in intercity transportation and communication costs. </jats:p>",

Patterns of contraceptive choice and changing methods were determined among 36,298 women attending a family planning clinic between 1967 and 1976. This population was the largest concentration of US women who had DMPA available as a contraceptive option. By 1974, women in the age group 35–49 were as likely to choose DMPA as either oral contraception or an intrauterine device. Coincidentally, use of the most popular choice, oral contraception, declined in older women and IUD use dropped sharply in all age groups. On average, users of DMPA were more likely to continue their method than were users of IUDs or barrier methods. Among women in the 35–49 age group, DMPA users were the group least likely to change methods.</jats:p>",

Within both systems, the record of citizen participation in health planning has been mixed. Both the philosophical goals and political and economic realities of the two countries have contributed to the development of markedly different systems of health care delivery and for the perceived role of the citizens within this delivery system. While previous comparisons have primarily centered on the nature of the delivery systems and potential effectiveness and cost, this study focuses upon the citizen's role in effecting meaningful health planning in both societies. Furthermore, the study relates findings to implications for developing effective health education strategies based upon these understandings. </jats:p>",
