It was found that exporting was generally unplanned in the survey firms, and that the propensity to plan increased with size and the relative significance of export sales. Other variables, such as management commitment to exporting and the establishment of some export structure, also appeared to play a major role in accounting for planning activity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die berufliche Eingliederung der nachwachsenden Generation stellt seit Mitte der 70er Jahre eine der schwerwiegendsten Probleme gesellschaftlicher Entwicklung in der Bundesrepublik dar. Demographische Gründe (Eintritt geburtenstarker Jahrgänge in das Erwerbsleben) im Verbund mit geringerem ökonomischen Wachstum haben diese Situation hervorgerufen, die bis weit in die 90er Jahre anhält. In diesem Beitrag wird nun versucht, die regionale Dimension dieses Problemfeldes herauszuarbeiten. Es werden zunächst die regionalen Disparitäten beim Zugang zu betrieblichen und sonstigen Ausbildungsplätzen dargestellt. Im Anschluß daran wird die zweite Schwelle (von der Berufsbildung in die Berufsstartposition) am Beispiel der Entwicklung der Arbeitslosigkeit von jungen Erwerbspersonen im regionalen Vergleich untersucht. Bei beiden Schwellen zeigt sich, daß der berufliche Eingliederungsprozeß nicht nur global/zeitbedingt sondern auch durch regionale Gegebenheiten gefährdet ist. Im zweiten Teil des Beitrages werden die Mechanismen des Prozesses beruflicher Eingliederung angesprochen.Es werden dabei vier „Integrationsfelder“ unterschieden und zwarIntegrationsfeld „Generationenwechsel“Integrationsfeld „Berufliche und regionale Mobilität“Integrationsfeld „Selbständigkeit und neue Formen des Arbeitsplatzwachstums“.Abschließend werden die wichtigsten Prinzipien einer von den Regionen durchgeführten Politik zur Verbesserung der beruflichen Eingliederung angesprochen.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article analyzes and interprets an unpublished Spanish architectural treatise that was written for Philip II while he was Prince Regent (c. 1550). The manuscript did not previously attract attention because it was mistakenly described as written for the king's son Philip (later Philip III) in the 1590s. The treatise, which is by no means a masterpiece of architectural literature, derives mainly from L. B. Alberti's De re aedificatoria, but the anonymous Spanish author used his sources selectively to make an explicit connection between morality and a restrained and orderly classical style. He was not concerned so much with buildings as such but rather with their moral dimension and their relevance to the contemporary Spanish state. His concern to articulate the principles of a Catholic, as opposed to pagan, classical style is matched by his eagerness to reform Spanish architectural practice along the lines suggested by Alberti. Simply as an expression of Counter-Reformation aesthetics the treatise is precocious and exceptionally explicit. The treatise was prepared for Philip who, the author states, requested it, which makes it the only known piece of architectural writing prepared especially for him. It brings crucial evidence about Philip's concerns with architecture in the 1550s, before the beginning of the Escorial in 1563, a subject for which historians were reduced to conjecture. The treatise adumbrates a program for reform that is virtually identical to the one Philip actually adopted in 1559. The evidence of the treatise suggests that the strong ideological implications of the style of the Escorial are not simply a post facto gloss but were a deliberate factor in the inception of the design.</jats:p>",

The balanced growth of city and countryside which occurred in the Maoist era is now replaced by a relative emphasis on an elitist urban-based development strategy which manifested itself in the establishment of the four Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in 1980. Although the utilisation of foreign capital and the import of capitalist management skills are justified by means of Lenin's theory of state capitalism, it shows that problems such as the flourishing economic crime, the creation of housing classes, and the undermining of socialist relations of production have already emerged in Shenzhen SEZ after a few years of development. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper it is argued that the urban-based development strategy adopted by the new leadership should not be seen as a complete break with the Maoist strategy, as suggested by the employment of the dualistic approach—the radical line versus the revisionist line—in analysing Chinese development. In fact, the establishment of the SEZs and other commensurate measures do not necessarily indicate the Chinese road to capitalism or the complete victory of Deng Xiaoping and his followers, but they reveal that their ideas and policies continue to be counteracted and modified by the legacy of the Maoist vision. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the procedures are examined by which minorities in Quebec and Wales have sought to offer an alternative basis for the legitimisation of group rights and participation within the state structures. Attention is drawn to the pivotal role of language reproduction in these case studies and to the implications for the survival of the minority culture of this new form of local state dependency. Though the tangible benefits which have accrued to the minorities as a result of nationalist mobilisation are acknowledged, disquiet is expressed as to the primacy given to language-related policies and to the future prospect of extending the legitimacy of the minority tongue from public to private domains. In this respect, Quebec offers a more integrative pattern than Wales, where language intrusion is causing conflict within the Welsh-speaking minority and is creating new sources of class-based friction. However, it is concluded that both in Wales and in Quebec the reform of language policy is part of a wider restructuring of social and political relationships. Further research is clearly needed on the economic implications of language planning and on the class restructuring which postwar developments have produced within the Welsh and Québecois societies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Lange Zeit war es ein Dogma in der Planung der Kraftwerksstandorte, die fossil befeuerten Kraftwerke in der Nähe der Brennstoffvorkommen zu plazieren. Doch spätestens seit Mitte der 70er Jahre wird die Kostenschere, z. B. zwischen dem Transport von Strom über Freileitungen und dem Transport äquivalenter Mengen an Steinkohle per Bahn oder Schiff, immer größer. Seitdem ist der Brennstoffbezug über weite Strecken kostengünstiger als der Stromtransport. Es eröffnen sich hierdurch Chancen einer Dezentralisierung der früher ganz überwiegend brennstofforientierten Kraftwerksstandortstruktur. Werden durch die dezentrale, dem regionalen Strombedarf lastenspezifisch angepaßte Kraftwerkszusammensetzung komparative Transportkostenvorteile genutzt, kann in den stromimportierenden Stromhochpreisregionen das Niveau der angebotsstrukturbedingten Kostenunterschiede abgebaut werden. Der dezentrale, verbrauchsnahe Ausbau der Stromproduktion erfordert den geringsten Bedarf an Leitungstrassen. Dadurch werden Netzkosten eingespart, die sonst vor allem den stromimportierenden Regionen aufgebürdet würden. Weitere Kosteneinsparungen können darüber hinaus durch rationelle Energienutzung, hauptsächlich durch Anlagen der Kraft-Wärme-Kopplung, erreicht werden.</jats:p>"

The substantive criticisms include the treatment of technology and product innovation, stereotypes of spatial divisions of labour, ‘deskilling’ and feminisation, the role of the nation-state in the internationalisation of capital, and the social or institutional characteristics of capital.

Ein besonderes Interesse gilt daher aus Sicht der Regionalplanung den Auswirkungen auf das Baulandpreisniveau und im Zusammenhang damit der Frage nach der raum- und siedlungsstrukturellen Zielkonformität kommunaler Baulandbeschaffungsmaßnahmen.Die weitgehend entspannte Situation auf dem Baulandmarkt im Großraum Hannover rechtfertigt keine Pauschalforderung nach vermehrter Baulandbereitstellung, wohl aber erfordert sie einen gezielten Einsatz des Instrumentes kommunaler Baulandbeschaffungsmaßnahmen, sofern bestimmte raumstrukturelle Kriterien dabei berücksichtigt werden.Kommunale Baulandbeschaffungsmaßnahmen sind ein wichtiges Instrument, um auf das Siedlungsgeschehen im Hinblick aufStandort und Lage im Raum,städtebauliche Ordnung und Siedlungsdichte sowie die Wohnform,die Einwohnerentwicklung und Bewohnerstruktur der Gemeinde,das Temo der Planaufstellung und der Realisierung von Bauvorhabengezielter einwirken zu können.Die Untersuchung weist nach, daß die mit dem Instrument der kommunalen Baulandbeschaffung in dieser Hinsicht gegebenen Möglichkeiten oft nicht ausgeschöpft werden. Vielmehr laufen kommunale Baulandbeschaffungsmaßnahmen Gefahr,indem sie auf die jeweils günstigsten Verkaufsangebote reagieren, Baulandausweisungen zunehmend auf fiskalpolitischen Gründen bzw. zugunsten abstrakter Wachstumsziele vorzunehmen,sich der notwendigen siedlungsstrukturellen Prioritätensetzung und einer Abstimmung mit der Regionalplanung und den von dort her anzuhaltenden raumstrukturellen Kriterien zu entziehen.Bei schrumpfender Bevölkerung verstärkten Anforderungen an die Freiraumsicherung und einer wieder wachsenden Bedeutung der Transportkosten bekommen die raumordnungspolitischen Ziele einer Sicherung der zentralörtlichen Siedlungsstruktur, der kleinräumlichen Funktionsmischung und der Einheit von Siedlungsentwicklung und öffentlicher Nahverkehrsbedienung wieder mehr Gewicht.Daher sollten bei Anwendung kommunaler Baulandbeschaffungsmaßnahmen folgende Kriterien besonders berücksichtigt werden:Lage im Einklang mit einer längerfristigen gemeindlichen Entwicklungsplanung und in Übereinstimmung mit den raumstrukturellen Kriterien;Förderung flächensparender, verdichteter Wohn- und Siedlungsformen;Förderung von Zielgruppen aus sozial- und versorgungspolitischen Gründen sowie im Hinblick auf die Ergänzung der Sozialstruktur der Einwohner einer betreffenden Gemeinde.</jats:p>"

The data file has also proven useful in subsequent editions of the map. This paper describes the automation process and the software developed for this mapping project. </jats:p>",

The Left in opposition had taken up these demands and has implemented, since coming to power in 1981, a programme of decentralisation to all administrative levels. However, the reforms at the regional level can be seen primarily as an extension of the existing établissement public régional and thus have not satisfied the aspirations and demands of autonomist and separatist movements. This tension between national and regionalist views of decentralisation is then examined in relation to Corsica, the only region to be granted a statut particulier. </jats:p>",

After questioning of the premises upon which a conflict-based theory of nationality relations has been constructed, it is argued that by focusing on the cross-patterned reticulation model of social and ethnic stratification that we will be in a better position to understand why the politicisation of national identities cannot be assumed to be automatic or uniform. Ways in which the state controls the politicisation of ethnoterritorial cleavages are then explored, by focusing on the internal passport system, the federal structure, and language planning. The problems faced by a nationalistically sympathetic cultural intelligentsia in mobilising support around ethnoterritorial cleavages is also touched upon. The paper concludes with a summary of what socioeconomic and political changes are likely to fuel the engines for political action where easily identifiable ethnoterritorial cleavages and a sympathetic regional political leadership make this possible. </jats:p>",

Seven major areas are analysed: Shetland, Orkney, Western Isles, Cornwall, Wessex, the North, and North Devon, with some analysis also of Scotland and Wales. The existence of a considerable level of participation in regional identity in some regions, and a remarkable degree of success, by working through existing institutions, of movements in Shetland, Orkney, and North Devon will be demonstrated. For other regions, however, participation is ‘dormant’. </jats:p>",

This can be tackled by advancing a single model applying in highly diverse situations—as in Castells's The City and the Grassroots—or by constructing a series of submodels each of which applies in specific conditions. Castells's work is criticized for stressing movement characteristics at the expense of contextual characteristics, and an alternative approach is argued for in which urban movement experience is shaped by five contextual features: urbanisation conditions, state action, the political context, the development of middle class, and the general economic and social conditions. Submodels drawing on these features are used to make a comparative analysis of urban movement experience in France, Italy, and Spain. A typology of urban movements is drawn up: movements for the provision of and access to housing and urban services, for control and management, and for the defense of housing and neighbourhood. These relate to three distinct notions of urban—collective consumption, local political process, and spatial proximity—and the differential impact of the contextual features on each type of movement is shown. The paper is concerned with all types of urban movement, and uses the term ‘urban social movement’ to refer only to the extremely rare cases of a major change in urban power relations. </jats:p>",

Changes over time in the elements of the matrix occur according to the aging of population and according to constraints indicated by observed patterns of past household mobility. These patterns are listed as six possible household mobility types, which in turn, are viewed as constraints within which population growth takes place.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Reproduction of social relations has been most problematic in communities undergoing drastic and sudden economic and social change. Through the experience of one such community, the town of Consett, County Durham, this analysis is an attempt to draw out the broader implications of this reproduction. Two particular policy measures are highlighted as expressions of the general aim of the reintroduction of the commodity form: a conventional reindustrialisation strategy through a local development agency, and initiatives sponsored by the Manpower Services Commission. Given the lack of success of such measures in terms of their stated objectives, the question of why they are actively accepted is addressed. The answer lies in the dominance of the work ethic for routine action, seen in Consett through the legacy of the company town and in the nature of the anticlosure campaign. More generally, the broader consequences of this acceptance of unemployment in the marketplace can be seen through the development of a place market, demonstrated with reference to North East England. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A numerical method for classifying geographic data is presented which incorporates geographic location as an external constraint. The method was implemented by making minimal changes to an existing agglomerative hierarchical algorithm. This was seen as the simplest solution, both computationally and operationally. Given a matrix of similarities or distances calculated from the usual intrinsic variables, the classification proceeds normally with the constraint that only adjacent objects are allowed to form groups. The method has been implemented previously, but here the examination of it is extended to cover the effects of a range of different fusion strategies, and to consider changes in within-group heterogeneity as a result of imposing an adjacency constraint. Three other matters arising are discussed: the presence of regional as opposed to global outliers of a classification; the occurrence of reversals in similarity values; and a measure of the stress imposed on a classification with an adjacency constraint. </jats:p><jats:p> The method is seen as suggesting a possible general solution to the problem of constraints in numerical classification. Some examples of other constraints and the appropriate fusion strategies are given. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an Illustration of how different state practices have had a direct impact on uneven development between, and within, two adjacent regions in the United Kingdom. In one case, South Wales, state intervention has taken the form of regional assistance, nationalisation of the dominant industries, and public-sector employment. In the other case, the Bristol subregion, it has taken the form of defence activities, and especially support for the aerospace industry. These influences have had a major impact on the spatial pattern of investment, regional specialisation, and the internal articulation of each subregion. Defence procurement has resulted in an inflow of government spending to the Bristol area, which is greater than that going to South Wales via regional assistance. The paper concludes with a comment on the spatial significance of different coalitions of interests, and a suggestion that more attention should be given to the specificities of nation-states. </jats:p>",
