Many industries can learn from this IBM Consulting article’s presentation of trends, its recommended new business model and a scenario of what the industry will be like in the year 2010. The dilemma: digital technology that enables customers to easily copy and distribute new offerings threatens the economics of the industry but also opens new business frontiers. The need: to create an open media company. The closed and proprietary media and entertainment business models of years past will give way to open media business strategies that will enable forward‐looking companies to exploit significant opportunities for profitability within these trends. The economics: while, at present, digital technologies, such as those that permit easy copying, undermine the traditional economics of the media business they also can create new business models and opportunities. New digital technologies will support improved business intelligence, thus enabling the open media firm to identify higher‐value business components and assets. In the uncertain markets described in the scenario, companies will employ advanced data analytics to adapt and respond to changing conditions. Digital management capabilities will likely become a core competency and differentiator. The guidelines: ten strategic guidelines for players evolving toward becoming the open media company of the future are offered.</jats:p>",

Despite difficulties in choosing between these alternative (and not mutually exclusive) scenarios, the plausibility of the overkill hypothesis can be established by ecological models of predator-prey interactions. In this paper, I have developed a macroecological model for the overkill hypothesis, in which prey population dynamic parameters, including abundance, geographic extent, and food supply for hunters, were derived from empirical allometric relationships with body mass. The last output correctly predicts the final destiny (survival or extinction) for 73% of the species considered, a value only slightly smaller than those obtained by more complex models based on detailed archaeological and ecological data for each species. This illustrates the high selectivity of Pleistocene extinction in relation to body mass and confers more plausibility on the overkill scenario.</jats:p>",

One approach (that we call LT) uses historical data to estimate stochastic models (e.g., a time series model) of vital rates, and then makes forecasts. Another (we call it RS) began as a kind of randomized scenario: we consider its simplest variant, in which expert opinion is used to make probability distributions for terminal vital rates, and smooth trajectories are followed over time. We use analysis and examples to show several key differences between these methods: serial correlations in the forecast are much smaller in LT; the variance in LT models of vital rates (especially fertility) is much higher than in RS models that are based on official expert scenarios; trajectories in LT are much more irregular than in RS; probability intervals in LT tend to widen faster over forecast time. Newer versions of RS have been developed that reduce or eliminate some of these differences.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper a conception of the model for learning scenario determination is presented. We define the learning scenario as a sequence of the hypermedia pages, representing particular knowledge units, and tests related to them. The scenario determination is a dynamic process that begins when a new student takes up a course. The opening scenario for this student is chosen as the consensus of the final scenarios of the students, who have already finished this course, and who belong to a class of the learners similar to the new one. We have elaborated the consensus‐based procedure for the scenario determination. Since this procedure operates on a set of similar learners, we have developed the conceptions of learner’s profile and students’ classification. The learner’s profile is proposed to include the attributes describing students’ personal data (as name, birthday etc.), their cognitive and learning styles as well as their usage data (represented by the learning scenarios). The students’ classification is based on a set of the basic attributes that seem to influence the learning effects. Their significance is verified during the learning process. We have also elaborated the procedure of reducing undistinguishable values of the attribute and removing useless attributes from the set of basic attributes. A learning procedure proposed, describes generally the situations when the scenario is modified, and the methods used for its modification.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The integrated nitrogen model INCA (Integrated Nitrogen in Catchments) was used to analyse the nitrogen dynamics in a small rural catchment in Western France. The agrosystem studied is very complex, with: extensive use of different organic fertilisers, a variety of crop rotations, a structural excess of nitrogen (i.e. more animal N produced by the intensive farming than the N requirements of the crops and pastures), and nitrate retention in both hydrological stores and riparian zones. The original model features were adapted here to describe this complexity. The calibration results are satisfactory, although the daily variations in stream nitrate are not simulated in detail. Different climate scenarios, based on observed climate records, were tested; all produced a worsening of the pollution in the short term. Scenarios of alternative agricultural practices (reduced fertilisation and catch crops) were also analysed, suggesting that a reduction by 40% of the fertilisation combined with the introduction of catch crops would be necessary to stop the degradation of water quality.
