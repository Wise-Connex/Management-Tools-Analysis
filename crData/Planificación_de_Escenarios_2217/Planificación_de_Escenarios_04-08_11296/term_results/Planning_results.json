Set within a wider appreciation of the Americanization of Australian society, and drawing on cross-cultural urbanism and the international diffusion of planning ideas, the article chronologically explores a series of Australian encounters with American planning from the city beautiful era to the new urbanism. Parallels between American and Australian stories are clearly striking, but a major theme to emerge is the adaptation of American models to new spatial and social settings and the tensions embedded within these encounters. The borrowing process was not uncritical. Many interactions ended unhappily with planning ideology restlessly moving on to new panaceas. </jats:p>",

To gauge changes in opinion on these issues since then, some of the 1998 questions were asked in an omnibus 2003 survey. The results indicate continuing high support for requiring US health insurers to cover family planning services (87 percent in 1998 and 84 percent in 2003), but some loss of support (from 80 to 69 percent) for US sponsorship of family planning programs in developing countries. Opinion remains divided on the policy of prohibiting nongovernmental organizations from receiving federal funding for performing or actively promoting abortion services. The authors explore several possible explanations for these findings, including the role changing presidential policy may have had in shaping opinion regarding family planning aid for developing countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban planners need to have a flexible, interactive, and intelligent computer-based tool to support their use of analytical models and to structure their planning process. Existing spatial information systems have not developed appropriate procedures and mechanisms to enable easy construction and manipulation of models within their system environment, and to allow various information resources to be shared by different application systems and platforms. Recent research and development of planning support systems (PSS) provide a range of interesting concepts and frameworks that can be adopted by system developers to design a multifunctional and planning-specific decision support system to meet the multifaceted needs of the planning process. In this paper we aim to go beyond the current approaches of PSS and spatial decision support systems (SDSS) in designing a knowledge-based PSS (KBPSS) that uses the component-based software development (CBSD) approach. We introduce the features of CBSD and its technical advantages in the design of a multifunctional PSS. An architecture of a component-based KBPSS is subsequently proposed which incorporates four essential component systems: MapObjects GIS, Database Manager database management system, ModelObjects model-management system, and KBSAgents knowledge-based system. The first two components are based on proprietary components systems and can be easily adapted into the KBPSS environment. The ModelObjects and KBSAgents components were developed by the authors. Based on these components and their associated information layers, two application subsystems are constructed: a Model and Knowledge Development System and an Intelligent Model Selection System. These application systems can be used to assist users and model developers to build new models or to select predefined models from an existing model library for their problems. In order to implement these functions, we propose and define a number of procedures and techniques for component communication and model and knowledge development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on a number of inconsistencies that appear in space syntax—a well-known technique of urban analysis—when dealing with certain geometrical configurations. At a simple level, the analysis of regularly gridded urban textures (such as Manhattan's) reveals the difficulty of accepting the claim that space syntax allows the modelling of pedestrian choice making. In more complex cases, the distortion of two ideal textures produces a topological discontinuity, leading to the unacceptable situation where one single urban configuration produces two conflicting outcomes when analysed with space syntax tools. Several other points are also discussed, such as the difficulty of space syntax to take into account building height and land use, and its sensitivity to boundary conditions. Conclusions seem to suggest that the topological representation of cities, on which space syntax is based, discards precious metric information and is rather limiting. It is envisaged that with current increases in computational power new algorithms might allow a deeper understanding of urban texture, based on the full exploration of its metric and topological properties. This would contribute to answer the fascinating question which space syntax has helped to frame: what is the influence of urban configuration on social life? </jats:p>",

These changes led to the development of urban housing markets and a housing finance system. The bibliography then examines influences from legislative and administrative sectors, such as land use laws, governmental policies, and urban planning. In addition, the bibliography examines Hong Kong’s land use system that is based on market mechanisms in which, nonetheless, the city government, through land use laws and plans, plays a significant role. </jats:p>",

The author proposes the incremental integration of the two worldviews through an overall strategy of action and the use of a decision model that incorporates project and context information to identify appropriate method and role.

By comparing several underlying HIV risk factors, it explores the counterintuitive finding that married adolescent girls in urban centers in Kenya and Zambia have higher rates of HIV infection than do sexually active unmarried girls. In both countries, we find that early marriage increases coital frequency, decreases condom use, and virtually eliminates girls' ability to abstain from sex. Moreover, husbands of married girls are about three times more likely to be HIV‐positive than are boyfriends of single girls. Although married girls are less likely than single girls to have multiple partners, this protective behavior may be outweighed by their greater exposure via unprotected sex with partners who have higher rates of infection. These results challenge commonly held assumptions about sex within marriage.</jats:p>",

Arguably this imminent, global counterculture represents a dynamic synthesis of Eastern and Western versions of an image of utopia as the ideal decentralized community, based on cooperation and in harmony with nature. The formation of this syncretic set of Eastern and Western social-aesthetic ideals coincides with the participatory line of planning thought. It examines these ideas by tracing their origins, transmission, and transformation along lines that become increasingly interconnected with the rise of a global system leading to the emergence of modernism in the West by World War I and the formation of a global consensus on the concept of sustainable development in the 1970s and 1980s. The formation, transmission, and transformation processes involved leading Western and Eastern intellectuals whose ideas on community planning evidenced strong influences from Asia (and Japan in particular).</jats:p>",

I argue that generative representations, those which are capable of reusing elements of the encoded design in the translation to the actual artifact, are better suited for automated design because reuse of building blocks captures some design dependencies and improves the ability to make large changes in design space. To support this argument I compare a generative and a nongenerative representation on a table-design problem and find that designs evolved with the generative representation have higher fitness and a more regular structure. Additionally the generative representation was found to capture better the height dependency between table legs and also produced a wider range of table designs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Space syntax is a technique for measuring the relative accessibility of different locations in a spatial system which has been loosely partitioned into convex spaces. These spaces are approximated by straight lines, called axial lines, and the topological graph associated with their intersection is used to generate indices of distance, called integration, which are then used as proxies for accessibility. The most controversial problem in applying the technique involves the definition of these lines. There is no unique method for their generation; hence different users generate different sets of lines for the same application. In this paper we explore this problem, arguing that to make progress, there need to be unambiguous, agreed procedures for generating such maps. The methods we suggest for generating such lines depend on defining viewsheds, called isovists, which can be approximated by their maximum diameters, these lengths being used to form axial maps similar to those used in space syntax. We propose a generic algorithm for sorting isovists according to various measures, approximating them by their diameters and using the axial map as a summary of the extent to which isovists overlap (intersect) and are accessible to one another. We demonstrate our techniques for the small French town of Gassin used originally by Hillier and Hanson in a 1984 book to illustrate the theory, exploring different criteria for sorting isovists, and generating different axial maps by changing the level of resolution. </jats:p>",

In addition to national statistical data, the study uses the original medical files of 113 women, representing 74 percent of all women known to have died after undergoing an abortion in 1999. The number of abortions and abortion‐related maternal deaths fell fairly steadily during the 1991–2000 decade to levels of 56 percent and 52 percent of the 1991 base, respectively. Regional and urban–rural variation is limited. Nine percent of abortion‐related maternal mortality is due to spontaneous abortion; 24 percent is related to induced abortions performed inside and 67 percent to those performed outside a medical institution. In the latter group, older women, usually with a history of several pregnancies, are overrepresented. The high rate of abortion‐related maternal mortality is due largely to the number of abortions performed at 13–21 weeks' and 22–27 weeks' gestation both inside and outside medical institutions. Improving access to safe second‐trimester abortion, preventing delays during the abortion procedure, and adequate treatment of complications are key strategies for reducing abortion‐related maternal mortality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to assess the marginal effect of land-use locational externalities on the sale price of single-family houses, considering various spatial scales—in accordance with perception theories—and trade-off with accessibility to the city centre. From land-use and vegetation data derived from aerial photographs and Landsat TM satellite images, two sets of hedonic models, using OLS regression, are built from two samples of single-family properties sold in Quebec City. A standard model integrates property-specific factors, census factors, accessibility, and location attributes. In a second model, land-use and vegetation variables are considered on various spatial scales; a third step introduces the interaction effect of the surrounding land use with location, with car-time distance to the main activity centres being used as the main indicator. This allows for an analysis of the spatial variation of the environmental impact throughout the city considering relative proximity to the centre. The successful integration of environmental variables concerning location enhances our understanding of the local land-use and vegetation effects. It also improves the overall performance of the model while virtually removing spatial autocorrelation among residuals. Such models could be used in order to assess the fiscal impacts of various land zoning by law policies, thereby providing planning administrations with a useful decisionmaking tool. </jats:p>",

Moreover, physiological and social changes associated with pregnancy may have long‐term effects on mortality. Comparing these long‐term associations among women and their husbands may provide insights into the nature of such a relationship. In this cohort study, we examine the association between reproductive history and all‐cause mortality among ever‐married women and men after age 45 in Matlab, Bangladesh, using data collected between 1982 and 1998 for a unique demographic surveillance system. No association was found between parity and mortality among women, but a small decrease in men's mortality was found to be associated with their wives' parity. Survival for both sexes was greatly enhanced by an increasing number of surviving children, regardless of parity or other social factors. A “healthy pregnant woman effect” coupled with the social and economic advantages of having surviving children may explain the observed effects.</jats:p>",

Because research initiatives are based in institutions equipped with unique resources and staff capabilities, results are often dismissed by decisionmakers as irrelevant to large‐scale operations and national health policy. This article describes an initiative undertaken in Nkwanta District, Ghana, focusing on this problem. The Nkwanta District initiative is a critical link between the experimental study conducted in Navrongo, Ghana, and a national effort to scale up the innovations developed in that study. A 2002 Nkwanta district‐level survey provides the basis for assessing the likelihood that the Navrongo model is replicable elsewhere in Ghana. The effect of community‐based health planning and services exposure on family planning and safe‐motherhood indicators supports the hypothesis that Navrongo effects are transferable to impoverished rural settings elsewhere, confirming the need for strategies to bridge the gap between Navrongo evidence‐based innovation and national health‐sector reform.</jats:p>",

Some have warned of the dangers of too closely following practitioners’ agendas. This paper debates these issues and proposes that the academic marketing community should recognise the value of getting closer to practitioners. After reviewing literature on the issue, the paper makes the case for an overtly recognised applied researcher culture to sit alongside pure research colleagues. A theoretical framework is developed and applied to a “template” for research design that will allow researchers to generate and communicate knowledge more effectively.</jats:p>",

Empirical research reported in this paper reveals senior non‐marketers perceive marketers to be “unaccountable, untouchable, slippery and expensive” and this is further reflected in the domain literature. Exploration of the issues raises questions about whether marketing educators have failed to deliver the theory and frameworks that could address this problem. Since the 1960s, many tools have been developed and used by marketing educators, academic researchers and consultants that should have helped practitioners to become more accountable; yet something appears to have gone wrong. This paper synthesizes the most recent literature in these areas, contends that accountability is imperative to avoid the marginalization of marketers and proposes an agenda for further research to close the academic/practitioner divide.</jats:p>",

However, evidence suggests that academic marketing knowledge is only to a limited degree utilised in practical life. It is thus important to understand why this is the case, as well as how use of academic knowledge can be enhanced. This paper focuses on scientific knowledge about market orientation and explores a range of factors, which might impair its practical application. More specifically, it examines what types of knowledge marketing practitioners might perceive as useful and discusses a range of potential barriers to successful transfer of market orientation knowledge from academia to practitioners. Substantial barriers are identified which relate to attributes of market orientation knowledge itself and characteristics of both academics and practitioners.

This paper describes an application of this technique to mooring chain. In many cases, the technique is based on probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth in the structural components, and updating of the failure probability on the basis of inspections. The extension of this basis from a single component to very many components is necessary to tackle series systems, such as mooring chain, where a fatigue fracture can arise in any chain link. The theoretical basis for the analysis is described, including details of the model for stochastic dependency between the chain links. Results are shown that compare failure probabilities for a single chain link and a chain segment. The effects of various levels of inspection coverage are illustrated. An example of a cost optimal inspection plan is developed for mooring chain on an FPSO in the northern North Sea.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radiobiological treatment planning depends not only on the accuracy of the models describing the dose‐response relation of different tumors and normal tissues but also on the accuracy of tissue specific radiobiological parameters in these models. Whereas the general formalism remains the same, different sets of model parameters lead to different solutions and thus critically determine the final plan. Here we describe an inverse planning formalism with inclusion of model parameter uncertainties. This is made possible by using a statistical analysis‐based frameset developed by our group. In this formalism, the uncertainties of model parameters, such as the parameter <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> that describes tissue‐specific effect in the equivalent uniform dose (EUD) model, are expressed by probability density function and are included in the dose optimization process. We found that the final solution strongly depends on distribution functions of the model parameters. Considering that currently available models for computing biological effects of radiation are simplistic, and the clinical data used to derive the models are sparse and of questionable quality, the proposed technique provides us with an effective tool to minimize the effect caused by the uncertainties in a statistical sense. With the incorporation of the uncertainties, the technique has potential for us to maximally utilize the available radiobiology knowledge for better IMRT treatment.</jats:p>",

I argue that, although the ‘ethical complex’ of British supermarkets is the product of unique historical and geographic circumstances, it also testifies to the capacity of agro-food activists to amplify their influence through the popular media. More broadly, it complicates assumptions about the demise of the Habermasian ‘public sphere’ at a time when massive corporations control both the media and the food supply. Three case studies of NGO campaigns illustrate this point. At the same time, however, they point to tensions between the international scope of certain NGO campaigns for supermarket ‘ethical reform’ and the more localized concerns of their constituencies. </jats:p>",

Recent deliberations about airports define these spaces as free, empty of power and social relationships—open to mobility. The author questions these assumptions and explores the surveillance practices that work to control and differentiate movement, bodies, and identities within the airport. Four examples are discussed, ranging from techniques that ignore mobile passengers towards those that simulate them. The airport is argued to offer perhaps a blueprint for public space, intensifying the surveillance of movement through mobilised and combined forms of monitoring. The author concludes the paper by reflecting upon the implications for the mobility and identity of the passenger as spaces such as airports become increasingly reflexive. </jats:p>",

When the impact of views is assessed, it is usually done by adding a single dummy variable to a hedonic regression equation. This paper provides a detailed literature review as well as an empirical analysis of the impact of a view on residential property values with a very rich database of nearly 5000 sales in Auckland, New Zealand. Several dimensions of a view are analyzed: type of view, scope of view, distance to coast, appearance of immediately surrounding improvements, average quality of landscaping in the neighborhood, and average quality of structures in the neighborhood. It is found that wide views of water add an average of 59% to the value of a waterfront property but that this effect diminishes quite rapidly as the distance from the coast increases. Attractive buildings in the neighborhood of a property on average add 37% to value relative to properties in neighborhoods with only average-quality structures. Particularly attractive improvements in the immediate surroundings of a property add another 27% to value on average. In contrast, properties in neighborhoods with only poor-quality landscaping on average experience a – 51% impact on price. Our results lead to the conclusion that aesthetic externalities are multidimensional and can have a substantial impact on residential property values. </jats:p>",

These studies comprise a survey of 58 academic researchers, a qualitative study of ten marketing practitioners, and a qualitative study of eight academic researchers. Academic researchers in the field of business‐to‐business marketing believe that their work is of interest, potential value, and relevance to practitioners, and aspire to make a contribution to management practice. Practitioners claim not to be interested in academic research, and are more favourably disposed towards consultants, who they see as more responsive to, and understanding of, business pressures. It seems clear that although academics would like to get closer to practitioners, they are inhibited by institutional factors, such as academic reward systems and the “publish or perish” culture. Mechanisms for improving the degree of cooperation between researchers and practitioners are explored.</jats:p>",

Since finding a feasible solution of such problems is in general NP-complete, the classical approaches have been the use of heuristics to find good feasible solutions on the one hand, or branch and cut on the other hand. In the case of the former, a dual bound is not available, and there is no guarantee of solution quality. For the latter, the accent has been on improving the dual bound and only the simplest schemes have been used to find good feasible solutions. </jats:p><jats:p> Here we first show that such simple schemes may run into trouble, even when applied to very simple problems. This motivates the proposed heuristic, IPE, which is designed to be used within a branch-and-cut approach. We test the performance of the heuristic on various published lot-sizing and network-design problems, with and without tightened reformulations. We compare these results with other heuristics and with time truncated branch-and-bound searches. IPE appears to be the best choice for large problems with weak formulations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The National Socialist planning for a recolonization of Africa was based on a new social and labour policy and focused chiefly on the “labour question”. In designing their schemes, planners strove to mobilize wage labour and circumvent the much-feared “proletarianization” of the workers. The key problem in exploiting the African colonies had two main aspects: a shortage of manpower and migrant labour. Therefore, planners designed complex systems of organized, state-controlled labour recruitment, and formulated rules for labour contracts and compensation. An expanded labour administration was to ensure that the “deployment of labour” ran smoothly and that workers were registered, evaluated, and supervised. Furthermore, “white labour guardians” were to be assigned the responsibility of overseeing the social wellbeing of the African workers. As was evident not only in Germany but in the colonial powers, France and Great Britain, as well, these concepts all fit into the general trend of the times, a trend characterized by the application of scientific methods in solving social issues, by the increased emphasis on state intervention, and by the introduction of sociopolitical measures. Nazi planning was based on Germany's prewar politics but also reflected the changes occurring in German work life after 1933.</jats:p>",

Emphasis is placed on identifying a number of “hot” topics worthy of future investigation, accomplished by a brainstorming workshop involving a large number of distinguished marketing professors. Areas identified were global marketing strategy, consumer behaviour and marketing strategy. It is hoped that the identification and discussion of these topics will spark greater research on fundamental marketing issues, and that the allied explication of research rigour will likewise enhance the efficacy of research in marketing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I argue that certified-organic inspection agents play a key role in reworking transnational organic-product certification standards to the unique conditions found within Mexican (Oaxacan) organic-coffee producer villages. First, I document the steps through which transnational product-certification norms, under the International Organization for Standardization guide 65 rubric, are codified as practical standards by organic-product certifying agencies. These standards are found to embed contradictions between inclusiveness and transparency that lead to difficulties in field-level implementation: in essence, practices required to make organic production legible to transnational certifiers often have the opposite effect of making certification unintelligible at the village level. Second, I show how field-level certification inspectors, working under contract to certifying agencies, cooperate with village organic extension agents to make certification legible both to villagers and to transnational certifiers (thereby helping to ensure its success). A corollary methodological argument is made to the effect that the importance of field-level work becomes evident when inspectors are viewed—through the optic of labor-process ethnography—as ‘interactive service employees’. This work thus points to a need to understand with greater clarity how standards are enacted in local contexts and support the efforts of field-level workers with the often-difficult task of making standards legible. </jats:p>",

At the same time, through a case study of the Guatemalan sugar industry, I argue that these initiatives are constructed in differentiated ways that are rooted in particular class trajectories and geographies of production and social reproduction. Looking at these so-called ‘strategic development alliances’ as arising at least in part from specific geographies of work may allow us to see where possibilities exist to push for more inclusive social and political participation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The complexity both of the product ship and the shipbuilding process make planning tasks in long, medium, and short terms difficult and lead to serious uncertainties. Discrete event simulation can be used to test and evaluate different scenarios in investment planning, scheduling, and resource planning. Using a virtual shipyard environment, the cost to find optimum solutions and the risk related to wrong decisions in the real world can be drastically reduced. However, due to the special skills and efforts usually needed to develop simulation models, the practical application of production flow simulation in shipyards is still rather limited. Object-oriented simulation tool sets specially developed for shipbuilding needs provide the chance to drastically reduce these efforts. Object libraries containing general and shipbuilding specific components with defined interfaces shorten the time needed for development of models for similar purposes. Furthermore, the integration of discrete event simulation models for certain shipyard facilities into a holistic model of the entire enterprise is made possible by using a tool set. Because of costs, some shipyards shy away from investing in simulation techniques. Networking activities and joint projects on simulation issues help to overcome those obstacles. German Flensburger Schiffbaugesellschaft already uses a simulation tool set successfully and actively cooperates with universities and other shipyards, while Center of Maritime Technologies has gathered experience in this field during participation in several simulation projects with other shipyards, for example, Jos. L. Meyer and Aker Ostsee. The article revues practical applications of simulation, gives an impression of how object-oriented simulation tool libraries can be structured, and outlines collaboration possibilities for making simulation applications affordable.</jats:p>",

The main decisions deal with which areas to harvest during an annual period so that the wood-processing facilities receive the required amount of assortments. Each area has a specific size and composition of assortments, and the choice of harvesting areas affects the production level of different assortments. We need to decide which harvest team to use for each area, considering that each team has different skills, home base, and production capacities. Also, the weather and road conditions vary during the year. Some roads cannot be used during certain time periods and others should be avoided. The road maintenance cost varies during the year. Also, some areas cannot be harvested during certain periods. Overall decisions about transportation and storage are also included. In this paper, we develop a mixed integer programming model for the problem. There are binary variables associated with harvesting, allocation of teams, and road-opening decisions. The other decisions are represented by continuous variables. We solve this problem directly with CPLEX 8.1 within a practical solution time limit.

A value-based property tax would serve this purpose. Drawing upon North American experience, we analyze the issues involved in implementing such a system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we investigate the application of motion planning techniques to the untangling of mathematical knots. Knot untangling can be viewed as a high-dimensional planning problem in reparametrizable configuration spaces. In the past, simulated annealing and other energy minimization methods have been used to find knot untangling paths. We have developed a probabilistic planner that is capable of untangling knots described by over 400 variables. We have tested on known difficult benchmarks in this area and untangled them more quickly than has been achieved with minimization in the literature. In this work, the use of motion planning techniques is critical for the untangling. Our planner defines local goals and makes combined use of energy minimization and randomized tree-based planning. We also show how to produce candidates with a minimal number of segments for a given knot. The planner developed in this work is novel in that it is used to study issues arising in practical motion planning for high-dimensional and reparametrizable geometry. The use of energy methods, local goals and tree-based expansion is also novel and may suggest solutions in other planning applications. Finally, we discuss some possible applications of our untangling planner in computational topology, in the study of DNA rings and protein folding and for planning with flexible robots. </jats:p>",

Although recent changes in the relationships between US capitalists and US labor unions have undermined the US ‘labor accord’ that reigned during the cold war, the new, ascendant transnational neoliberal hegemony has not as yet completely transformed the relationships of labor unions in the United States to those elsewhere in the world, which poses ongoing challenges for international labor solidarity, even in a context of new possibilities. </jats:p>",

Interviews were conducted with 30 patients and their carers 4–5 weeks after coronary artery bypass grafting (phase 1) and 1 year after the initial interview (phase 2). Thematic analysis was used to identify the major concerns of participants.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings. </jats:bold> Almost half the patients experienced heart surgery as a huge personal shock. Adjusting to life afterwards was difficult, and they experienced a variety of changes, including pain. An unexpected finding was a heightened sense of body awareness and the need for postoperative physical adjustments. The financial implications of surgery were a major burden. Lifestyle adjustments were important and led to suggestions for support services, using telephone support and/or community patient networks. All participants recommended strengthening discharge planning with more accurate information about what to expect during recovery, to help them anticipate fluctuations in health and wellbeing. Carers experienced a wide range of unanticipated feelings during early recovery and had to deal with a number of personal changes.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions. </jats:bold> The findings suggest a need to improve discharge preparation and provide enhanced home support services. Further research should evaluate models of periodic follow‐up and mechanisms for mutual support, and compare the experiences of cardiac patients and their carers with those of other surgical cohorts.</jats:p>",

A similar trend was seen with the Opteron Cluster (consisting of 1400 MHz, 64‐bit AMD Opteron processors) on increasing the problem size. Because of the 64‐bit architecture Opteron processors are capable of storing and processing instructions at a faster rate and hence are faster as compared to the 32‐bit Athlon processors. We have validated our implementation with an in‐phantom dose calculation study using a parallel pencil monoenergetic electron beam of 20 MeV energy. The phantom consists of layers of water, lung, bone, aluminum, and titanium.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reflects on the conceptual issues involved in developing a methodology to study the role of computer-based technologies, and particularly farm planning and management software, in governing the practices of farmers. It represents the first stage of a larger project that explores how farm planning and management practices are governed through, and reconfigured by, such technology. In recent years, computer software has been encouraged by a range of government and nongovernment agencies and organisations as a useful technical means of supporting farm decisionmaking and improving farmers' managerial capacities, thereby improving their competitive position. The key question of this paper is how to conceptualise and study this link. Existing literature in the area tends to draw on either rationalist – technological determinist or social constructionist accounts which, we suggest, are limited in understanding such software as a type of governmental technology that has productive effects. We argue that a methodology drawing upon insights from governmentality and actor-network theory enables the role of software in programmes of agricultural governance to be more robustly explored as a sociotechnical process. Specifically, a ‘sociology of translation’ is outlined to demonstrate how computer software can be analysed as a material technology of government that constitutes and shapes the capacities of ‘users’ as calculable agents. In order to demonstrate how such a methodology might work in practice, we apply a translation methodology to decision-support software designed to improve the planning practices of dairy farmers in the State of Victoria, Australia. </jats:p>",

The proposed algorithm relies on a topological property that characterizes the existence of solutions in the subspace of configurations where the robot grasps the object placed at a stable position. It allows us to devise a manipulation planner that captures in a probabilistic roadmap the connectivity of sub-dimensional manifolds of the composite configuration space.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the authors first examine the concept of the rural area and the related typologies and then analyse changes in the internal structure of rural areas in Finland by using georeferenced data. Rural areas seem to have been defined on the basis of land use and population density for as long as they have been a topic of research, but no unambiguous rural – urban dividing line has ever emerged. Statistical areal typologies based on administrative divisions, as employed by the OECD and Eurostat, together with the national classifications prevailing in various countries, are the most commonly used tools for comparisons of spatial structures, but sociocultural analyses can also be used for defining rural areas. The empirical part of this work demonstrates that georeferenced data can be used for studying matters internal to rural areas without recourse to administrative boundaries. The example presented concerns the serious economic recession of the early 1990s, which is studied using the coordinate-based georeferenced census data collected annually by Statistics Finland from population registers. The results indicate that major changes in demographic and occupation structure and in the formation of incomes took place in the rural areas of Finland over a short space of time (1989–97) and that these affected different areas in different ways. Short-term developments of this kind cannot be observed on the basis of traditional census data produced at ten-year intervals. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transboundary air pollution, popularly known as the ‘haze’, is a recent but significant environmental crisis in Southeast Asia, and is primarily the result of Indonesian forest fires. We identify that the fundamental motivation behind the practice of clearing forestland with fire by the polluters is economic in nature. We then argue that the major victims of the forest fires and haze are likely to play a vital role in the solution of the problem, at least by motivating the polluters, even if they cannot force them not to pollute. Thus, the polluters and victims can be regarded as the ‘stakeholders’ who would take interest and participate actively in the policy regime. A regional model is developed to analyze and specifically to take account of the states responsible for and affected by the haze. The problems of the affected resident population, the forest industries, and the role of the regional governments are modeled. The model also highlights the importance of key variables in determining the severity of the haze, namely the magnitude of the investment in fire fighting, risk mitigation, and scale of fire operations; including forecasting weather conditions. We argue that optimal policy options should simultaneously satisfy the economic needs of the key stakeholders to be effective. </jats:p>",

This paper uses a hierarchical decomposition of decision-making, coupled to a predictive simulation model that estimates the probability distribution of the outcomes of candidate operational plans. The approach will generate, evaluate, and improve Blue plans while assuming that Red intelligently reallocates its forces, using stochastic optimization, to counter Blue's moves. Evaluation of each Blue plan is accomplished via a Stochastic Evaluator that draws multiple samples of potential outcomes and Red force levels for a given Blue force structure and combined target composition. The evaluation metric is the net discounted value from enemy targets hit. Linear programming heuristics and simulation generate Red's adaptively optimized responses, outcomes, and inferred relative marginal force values. The results of this two-player, multi-level simulation-optimization approach for operational planning and decision-making demonstrate that automated plan optimization and embedding of optimization algorithms into an operational planning cycle operating over a multi-period conflict can be made practical for current computers by hierarchical decomposition of planning and on-line decision and optimization problems into computationally practical tasks. </jats:p>",

Due to the complex surface shape of these parts, well-planned tool paths can significantly increase the machining efficiency. In this work a new principle of CNC tool path planning for 3-axis sculptured surface machining is proposed. Generic formula to calculate the steepest tangent direction of a sculptured surface is derived, and the algorithm of the steepest-ascending tool path generation is introduced. A single steepest-ascending tool path has been verified to be more efficient than a single tool path of any other type. The relationship between machining efficiency and three key variables, tool feed direction, cutter shape, and surface shape, is revealed. The newly introduced principle is used in planning tool paths of a sculptured surface to demonstrate the advantages of the steepest-ascending tool paths. This new tool path scheme is further integrated into the more advanced steepest-directed and iso-cusped (SDIC) tool path generation technique. Applications of the new tool path principle and the SDIC tool paths to the machining of sculptured parts are demonstrated.</jats:p>",

We conclude that the trend of corporate community involvement provides new opportunities for the development of partnerships between proactive corporate citizens, city government, and other (public or private) organisations. However, the results suggest that the actual number of such partnerships is lower than expected. This lack of partnerships can be explained by looking at the internal organisation of companies and their potential partners, and the barriers in the coalition-forming process itself. </jats:p>",

Within this heterogeneous sand, the while-drilling resistivity image and up and down deep Resistivity measurements allowed the geosteering team to stay in the \"sweet spot\" of the reservoir.

Our investigation must therefore begin with the analysis of a commodity” [Marx, 1967 Capital, Volume 1 first paragraph (International Publishers, New York)]. As Marx moves beyond the first paragraph of Capital, he famously argues that value makes the commodity a ‘hieroglyphic’. But his own opening is also a sort of hieroglyphic: it rings true for bourgeois economy as it does for his critique of that economy, but for entirely different reasons. The purpose of Capital is to obliterate this apparent corroboration, yet a hieroglyphic quality is maintained throughout, as Marx subjects his own successive claims to iterative, immanent critique. This chain cannot be said to be indefinite for Marx, but neither is it complete. Here, I hark back to Marx's opening gambit to ask: in capitalist society, what else accumulates besides commodities proper? The paper proceeds iteratively, offering a series of revised opening claims that mimic yet spiral away from Marx's original. I argue specifically that, although devaluation (decommodification) inheres in the production and circulation of value, it has its own accumulation logic. The example is of food banking. I explore this activity as simultaneously material, representational, and political, and examine the constitutive force of each of these modalities. I treat food banking, therefore, as a form of commodity afterlife, through which devaluation becomes (imperfectly) a positivity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The coexistence of residential and agricultural activities within ‘periurban belts’ characterises many modern metropolitan areas. Unfortunately, few theoretical works in standard urban economics take this type of mixed space into account. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap: we present a residential location model (standard in urban economics) that is based on a support provided by fractal geography. More precisely, on the one hand, a Sierpinski carpet is used to render the nested hierarchies of the rural and urban sites within a metropolitan area. On the other hand, a household maximises, subject to a budget constraint, a Cobb – Douglas/constant elasticity of substitution (CES) utility function, wherein sub-CES functions portray the consumer's taste for variety in urban and rural amenities according to their hierarchical rank. As the household's optimum depends on accessibility to these various amenities, we propose a coding scheme of the sites on the Sierpinski carpet and a procedure for computing the distances between each site and each amenity. The urban equilibrium solution in the case of an open city is analytically determined. Numerical simulations are performed. They reveal the link between the rent gradient and the accessibility to the rural and urban amenities. In particular, we show that the rent is not always monotonous in distance from the origin (central business district) and that the structure of the fractal city is very different from that of the Thünian city when (1) commuting costs are low, (2) preferences for rural amenities are high, or (3) the substitutability of urban (rural) amenities is low. </jats:p>",

LCSs are founded on the creation of local currencies and driven by local—but contested—circuits of consumption, exchange, and production. In this paper we are concerned with three interrelated sets of issues: the intersections of social and material relations and practices in the construction of economic geographies; the possibilities—constrained by these intersections—of creating alternative economic geographies; and the consequent possibilities of contributing to economic proliferation. We distinguish between three main forms of LCS—LETSystems, LETS schemes, and Time Dollars—differentiated along a range of institutional, organisational, ethical, and moral dimensions. These LCSs reflect and illustrate the diversity of meanings, understandings, and intentions brought to bear upon economic geographies. The existence—even if only temporary—of LCSs is testament to the (limited) possibilities of local economic self-determination and organisation; but their material ineffectiveness, decline, and uneven geographical spread reflect their formative links with mainstream practices and social relations and their internal contradictions and barriers. These characteristics illustrate the vulnerabilities inherent in all economic geographies and not just in those that are locally constructed. </jats:p>",

The authors begin by characterizing the changing nature of environmental governance by focusing specifically on the complexity surrounding the relationship between government administrative reform, demands for improved and increased environmental monitoring, and the role and function of citizens in monitoring activities. Then, building on the experience of one citizen-based environmental organization, Citizens' Environment Watch, as well as on two other local examples, they document possible new forms of collaboration that retain government responsibility while building community authority, knowledge, and power to improve local environmental quality. Suggested remedies include a recognition and public articulation of what government should do and what it does not do. In the case of the latter, government should commit to provide support for citizen monitoring efforts, and to heed the work of volunteer monitors. Finally, government needs to follow up on concerns about degraded environmental quality raised by local citizens through strong investigative and enforcement responses. </jats:p>",

Two people with learning disabilities and seven members of their circle of support were identified to participate in the study. They attended a stakeholder meeting to identify 36 valued activities. The 16 participants then completed a Q‐sort using photographs to represent these activities. These sorts were then interpreted using Q‐methodology.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results </jats:bold> There were a number of intercorrelations between the card sorts. Principle component analysis showed that two factors accounted for 73% of the variance of the data. The two clusters represented the members of each person's circle of support. Analysis and comparison of the factors have highlighted the similarities and differences between individuals and their circle of support.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions </jats:bold> This study shows that Q‐methodology is a useful adjunct to person‐centred planning. Looking at and interpreting the data, which emerge through Q‐methodology, hashighlighted both similarities and individual differences for goal planning. It has also highlighted potential areas for service change and development. Using Q‐sorts over time may be a way to demonstrate the subjective change in peoples' values that occur through person‐centred planning (PCP).</jats:p>",

This research addresses that question by investigating three dimensions of the planning process (political support for the concept, participation, and resource commitment), the organization of local land-use plans, and state planning mandates to determine how they influence the support plan policies have for principles of sustainable development. We use plan content analysis as well as survey data for forty-two communities across the United States to analyze factors which influence such support. Our findings highlight that the presence of a state planning mandate, most applicable to US planning, as well as having a variety of groups participating in the planning process, are key factors that increase overall plan support for the sustainable development principles. Recommendations for planning practice are offered based on our findings. </jats:p>",

Using factor analyses, path analyses, and a push – pull framework, the authors model the decision process of retirees in Australia in order to identify relationships between push – pull factors and predictor variables, using data from a national survey of retirement village residents. The push factors relate to change in lifestyle, home maintenance, social isolation, and health and mobility, whereas the pull factors relate to built environment and affordability, the locational attributes of villages, and the desire to maintain an existing lifestyle. The survey data also identify village attributes considered desirable or undesirable, or important or unimportant. Overall, resident satisfaction with moving is high. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper seeks to contribute to the broader debate on how to promote ‘better regulation’ by examining the origins and influence of different regulatory styles. More particularly it examines the extent to which economic theories of cooperation can help to explain the presence of the cooperative regulatory style that has long been associated with the implementation of environmental regulations in the United Kingdom. After reporting the results of empirical research that focused on these issues, it concludes that cooperative regulatory styles are likely to depend upon: (a) the presence of inter-dependencies between regulators and firms; and either (b) the presence of trust amongst stakeholders; or (c) the effective exclusion of those stakeholders from influence in the regulatory decisionmaking process. Highlighting the importance of recent changes in each of these three areas in the United Kingdom, it explains the factors that have led to a shift away from a purely cooperative approach towards what has been termed a more ‘responsive’ or ‘risk-based’ approach. Recognising that such changes have been driven by a desire to enhance the efficacy and the efficiency of environmental regulation, and by concerns about the lack of transparency and accountability in the regulatory process, it concludes that such evolutions represent an important contribution to the debate on regulation and its reform. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The New Deal for Communities (NDC) initiative forms an integral part of the British government's policy towards urban regeneration. An important provision within this policy programme allows for community representatives to be elected rather than selected to partnership boards. These elections were not contested by candidates representing political parties. This policy development may be used as a future template for a range of single-purpose elected authorities, including foundation hospitals, social services, leisure, and policing. The paper examines partnership board elections in terms of the candidates' experience and also the participation of voters. A feature of these elections has been the introduction of innovations in electoral procedure and practice as a means of engaging local communities and facilitating voter participation. Interviews with candidates sought to identify their motives for standing and their feelings about the electoral process itself. An analysis of voter turnout considers how these elections compare with local government council elections covering the same areas. The findings show a mixed picture. Some elections to NDC partnerships did result in a higher turnout than that for local government council elections. However, a majority of partnership elections had turnouts that were below the predicted level. It was noticeable that partnerships within the Greater London area generally had lower than expected turnout. A number of issues are identified that are relevant to the future conduct of these and similar nonpartisan elections. </jats:p>",

Clinical examinations and panoramic radiographs were performed pre‐ and postoperatively, whereas cross‐sectional tomography was performed only preoperatively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> The vertical magnification factor in the panoramic radiographs was very constant pre‐ and postoperatively with 1 : 1.27 and in the spiral tomograms with 1 : 1.52. In 11 of 77 implant sites, the mandibular canal could not be evaluated in the spiral tomograms. The additional information from cross‐sectional spiral tomography did not influence the original planning in 74 of 77 (96.1%) implant sites. Based on the postoperative panoramic radiograph, the average distance from the tip of the implants to the mandibular canal was 3.04±2.06 mm. In two cases (2.6%), transient postoperative altered tactile sensation of the mental nerve was found.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion: </jats:bold> The information from preoperative cross‐sectional spiral tomography has minor impact on treatment planning in standard implant cases in mandibular premolar and molar regions. The clinical examination provides sufficient information for selecting implant diameter and the panoramic radiograph provides sufficient information for implant length selection.</jats:p>",

However, the evaluation is not reliable, because the robot cannot swing a golf club like a skillful golfer. In this study, a new golf-swing robot that can adjust its motion to the characteristics of individual golf clubs by emulating a skillful golfer is investigated analytically and experimentally. The wrist is released freely, and the shoulder is controlled by a torque plan that considers the effect of the whole-body motion of a golfer. Thus, this robot can emulate skillful golfers and perform highly reliable evaluations of golf clubs. In this paper, validity of the torque planning of the shoulder is analytically and experimentally investigated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a result of various social and economic factors, many historic townscapes in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have declined over the last half century. There have been many attempts throughout the world to revitalise such urban heritage areas, but the actual effectiveness of few of these schemes has been systematically evaluated. Good public policy choices would greatly benefit from such evaluation. The UK's Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) decided in 1999 that their Townscape Heritage Initiatives would be an exception. A research team from Oxford Brookes University was engaged to undertake a ten-year study of the £52 million being spent in about sixty British towns and cities. A sample of about one third of projects receiving HLF support are being scrutinised. The evaluation methodology is outlined, along with explanations of some challenges faced in such a large programme. The four mechanisms for gathering research data are explained, the origin and rationale for the sixteen indicators being employed are described, and the approach to overall evaluation outlined. Finally there is an overview of the baseline stage of the work, highlighting key issues from a research perspective, and briefly reflecting on findings to date. </jats:p>",

A large para‐pelvic cyst compressing the PUJ and upper ureter was detected in one patient.
