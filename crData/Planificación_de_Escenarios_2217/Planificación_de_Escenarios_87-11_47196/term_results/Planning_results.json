      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this case study of population forecasting and planning practice in South Yorkshire, a number of insights are given into the issues involved in the application of quantitative methods to policy analysis. It is suggested that the users of population forecasts typically question the validity of the data and the assumptions made about future trends rather than the form of the forecasting model itself. In the case study it is also demonstrated to what extent analysts have to account for the judgements they have made about these matters when the accuracy of their forecasts is challenged by parties with strong vested interests in the outcomes. In this way the constraints that are placed on analysts working within the planning process are highlighted, and attention is drawn to some of the advantages and disadvantages of their position. </jats:p>",

The difficulties encountered in answering this question are discussed, liquidity is defined, and a variety of motives for maintaining liquidity are examined in depth. The major thrust of the paper is the development of a theoretical model of liquidity needs, which is then simplified in a stepwise manner through the inclusion of cash substitutes, need interdependence, and other devices. It is concluded that a significantly reduced liquidity needs model is hypothetically possible, permitting the planner to think in terms of substantially smaller client cash balances.</jats:p>",

Existing methodologies to generate NC tool path for face milling are employed everyday by manufacturing industries without considering the impact of tool path selection. A systematic study has been conducted in order to identify those critical control parameters affecting length of cut in face milling operations. Basic polygons, from triangles to heptagons, were planned using both window frame and stair case milling procedures. For each polygon, each vertex was introduced as a possible starting point for a single run in the window frame milling. The cutting orientation was further examined for stair case milling by enumerating the tool sweep angle from 0 to 180 (and 180 to 0 as well) degrees from each vertex. The results are analyzed and important conclusions are drawn noting the efficiency of the cutting process.</jats:p>",

Political pressure to offer family planning raised the question how best to organize services. Long-standing providers preferred a categorical approach in order to maintain a diverse political coalition for an historically invisible service. In addition, categorical funding meant financial support for non-traditional providers. A compelling argument was also made for service integration. Given an expanded definition of health and the medicalization of contraceptive technology, the health delivery system presented itself as the appropriate service provider. Neither group prevailed. By 1980, federally supported family planning services were provided in autonomous clinics but also were integrated into existing maternal and child health programs. The debate continues but, under the Reagan Administration, terms and motivations differ from those of the past. </jats:p>",

A separate series of experiments using CVC stimuli showed a difference in error patterns when the stimulus words are spoken in lists versus embedded in short phrases; stimuli like “leap note nap lute” elicit about the same proportion of errors in initial and final position, while the phrasal version (“From the leap of the note to the nap of the lute”) elicits far fewer errors in final position. If this difference between word lists and phrases extends to other aspects of error patterns, it might affect the word-position/stress-position results for mixed one- and two-syllable stimuli. However, results show that, when these stimuli are embedded in phrases, the error patterns remain remarkably similar. Moreover, when speakers are asked to generate sentences using the words of the stimulus, instead of reading or reciting the phrases provided by the experimenter, results again support the claim that word-onset consonants are more likely to interact in an error than are prestress consonants. These findings suggest that word structure plays a role in the production processing representation that is in force when single-segment errors occur.</jats:p>",

A base model is constructed which reduces all tax and benefit regimes to influences on the user costs of capital.

Indications of extensions of the model are given for nonmarginal situations, investments at different levels of risk and uncertainty, and the consequences of tax and benefit shifting away from the point of legal incidence. The resulting model provides a general framework for comparison of tax and benefit regimes between states and localities in one country, between state and local governments in one country, or between state and local governments in one country and those in another. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Quantitative methods for policy analysis were developed mainly by academic researchers during a period when there was widespread allegiance to ‘rational’ methods of policymaking. The interesting question arises now, however, as to what role these researchers have been playing as rational methodologies and quantitative methods have fallen from favour; as the context has changed, how have the researchers—in this case regional scientists—responded? </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper it is argued that many regional scientists who purport to be interested in policy analysis, and particularly in developing quantitative methods for use in such analysis, actually have very little direct interest. This lack of interest is demonstrated by their failure to give serious consideration to the policy context into which methods are to fit, a context which has changed dramatically since many established methods were developed. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper is an attempt to demonstrate the importance of context to the form and use of methods. Three sets of contextual changes are reviewed: philosophical, practical, and political. The conclusion contains a discussion of how methods can be tailored to contexts, and a plea for regional scientists to take a more genuine interest in policymaking. </jats:p>",
