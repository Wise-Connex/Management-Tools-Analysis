      "abstract": "<jats:p> Spatial planning at the regional level is a particularly good example of ‘centralization versus decentralization’ in a federal system. In one respect the region is dependent on the central level, as far as its legal bases, organizational forms, and planning tasks are concerned; but the cities and counties should be allowed to specify the functions they perform in their own region. This is the crux of the conflict in finding an effective balance between centralization and decentralization. Solutions to date in the FRG have favored a progressive centralization. Because of the increasing economic and ecological problems with which the regions are faced, this centralist solution is no longer tenable and decentralizing reforms are now required and under discussion. These concern the institutional organization and functions of the regions, a mobilization of the capacities available in the respective regions for solving their problems, plus a gradual shift to new region-specific planning. Thus, changes are occurring in regional planning which pave the way for a more decentralized planning process. However, in spite of the new understanding, even at central level, that the regions are capable of contributing efficient solutions to actual problems, these changes have not yet achieved a breakthrough in planning practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the privatization of the planning profession is examined. The analysis proceeds with an exploration of how planners represent their profession through text and speech. Three kinds of rhetoric dominate discussion: a rhetoric of instrumentalism, which is concerned with reestablishing physical planning at the core of the discipline; a rhetoric of negotiation, which often loses sight of why negotiation was initiated in the first place; and a rhetoric of performance assessment, which is content with a planning which achieves its sponsors' goals. None of these concentrations is intrinsically wrong, but their cumulative effect has been to permit a commodification of the functions of planning, which has subsequently facilitated the privatization process. Other elements of planning, not susceptible to commodification, have been dropped from the discourse. One such loss has been the rhetoric of reform, which has traditionally connected planning with its progressive roots and political action. Also absent is a rhetoric of theory, which would permit comparative analysis of the meanings of a postmodern planning. </jats:p>",

Modernist planning seems suspended between modernity and postmodernity. In order to resolve these tensions, planners need to refocus their work on the built environment (specifically the process of city building), to reestablish a mediative role between capital, labor, and the state, and to project a more democratic profile in public debates surrounding the meaning and consequences of urban and regional development. </jats:p>",

He was also a member of CIAM, and participated in the famous Athens meeting where its basic principles were formulated. But his plans for intensive cooperation with CIAM did not come to fruition, because of fundamental differences regarding the role of scientific evidence in decisionmaking and planning. CIAM members were looking for a solid bedrock on which to base design norms and principles. Neurath was a sceptic and emphasised the pluralistic nature of knowledge. He also held that decisions were to be taken on pragmatic grounds, reflecting one's chosen “path of life”. Experts had no superior skill in this. Neurath developed the Vienna Method of pictorial statistics to allow people to make their own inferences from such evidence as there was. Neurath's views of decisionmaking in planning are very modern, and suggest that the critique of positivism in planning needs to be reconsidered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The earliest ventures in applied geography and area research were developed during the Weimar Republic. In 1933 the first theoretical study appeared: the central place theory by Walter Christaller. Under National Socialism good research conditions existed for social scientists (at least, those who were not persecuted, exiled, or murdered) who wanted to implement their theories. Law and central planning organizations provided the political and institutional basis for scientific research. Power struggles and conflicts concerning competence between different institutions headed by Hitler, Himmler, and Rosenberg afforded scientists freedom to develop new approaches and conduct research within the control imposed by a central organization. Walter Christaller, who was too old for a university career, worked in such institutions under Himmler. His personal and political biography is imbued with paradoxes: a former member of the Social Democratic Party, he switched to the Nazi Party in 1940, in 1945 to the Communist Party, and once again to the Social Democratic Party in 1959. However, these events merely hint at the complex nature of the political context in which Christaller and other scientists worked from 1933 to 1945. This paper is an attempt to illuminate the ‘reactionary modernism’ of the Nazi State, drawing from archival material and recent historical studies on social science in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, federal regulations and internal safety policies effectively limit cost savings to improvements in productivity and scheduling. The purpose of this paper is to present a model that can be used by planners to both locate maintenance stations and to develop flight schedules that better meet the cyclical demand for maintenance. The problem is formulated as a min-cost, multicommodity flow network with integral constraints, and solved using a two-phase heuristic. </jats:p><jats:p> The procedure is demonstrated with data supplied by American Airlines for their Boeing 727 fleet. The results show a significant improvement over current techniques, and indicate that substantial cost reductions can be achieved by eliminating up to 5 of the 22 maintenance bases now in operation. Similar results were obtained for American's Super 80 and DC-10 fleets. Perturbation analysis confirms the robustness of these findings, and suggests that loss in flexibility due to interruptions in the flight schedule will be negligible. </jats:p>",

An ethnography of contemporary architectural practice in the USA portrays an alternative model of the design process as a social construction, comprised of dilemmas which, once resolved, pose new contradictions. An analysis of three case studies of buildings with design quality reveals that design participants invoke a series of dialectical strategies to respond to the uncertainties and contradictions of the situation. These strategies, introduced by quotations from the buildings' makers, are described in contrast to the approaches taken by participants in everyday design practice. The production of the built environment is seen as a complex, interactive, social process which is formative, constructed out of a loosely orchestrated constellation of key individuals in organizations, who together develop design solutions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present an application of mathematical programming for solving a complex multi-level production and distribution network optimization problem faced by a petrochemical company. Two liquified petroleum gas (LPG) products, propane and butane, are produced at refineries, from where they are shipped in bulk to plants for bottling. Then the company distributes the gas bottles to the customers either directly or via depots and transportation breakpoints. Transportation is carried out by the company's own truck fleet or by contract carriers. The own trucks can operate on different shift systems allowing for overtime. The problem is to find the location of the bottling plants and the depots, the production levels at the refineries and the plants, the stock levels at the plants and the depots, the transportation volumes on each link of the distribution network, the number of trucks and drivers, the transportation shift systems and schedules, and the customer assignments so as to meet LPG demand at minimal cost. The actual problem has 2 commodities, 2 refineries, 10 potential bottling plant locations, 40 potential depot locations, 40 breakpoints (transporters), and 200 customer regions. The problem was solved using a matrix generator designed for network-like problems and MPSARX, a state-of-the-art general-purpose mathematical programming software system augmented with advanced automatic reformulation and cut generation features. </jats:p>",

It traces the evolution of IS planning from a more reactive mode, with a steering committee deciding on future directions, to a value-added approach where incremental components of a total IS product are offered to user managers for consideration. This helps overcome problems with the strategic planning process itself which is both incremental and cyclical. The organisation often focuses on a direction, only to change as the economic environment or market conditions change. The IS function consequently must move away from plans set in concrete in spite of implementation difficulties associated with that approach. The problem is one of aligning the IS plan with an often mobile corporate plan. In order to respond to this situation, there has been a move towards a marketing of IS services, so organisations can avail themselves of IS opportunities that are within the capabilities of the IS function to deliver. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Poland is undergoing important political changes. The evolution of legal, political, and financial resources of local government since 1950 is discussed in this paper. In the last section are presented the Solidarity programme and governmental response at the historic ‘Round Table’ talks between the ruling Communist Party and the Polish opposition, which opened the way to the opposition's magnificent victory in the parliamentary elections in June 1989. In 1950 a very centralized organization of the state was imposed. But the postwar history shows expansions and limitations of local government power. These shifts and their causation are analyzed. The poor quality of the urban fabric, the need of social support for the ruling party, and important economic tasks of local government call for decentralization. Its implementation requires overcoming the barriers, which result from resistance by political and bureaucratic structures, bad economic situation, and lack of public interest in local democracy. Recently a decentralization policy is being implemented. Many legal openings have been made, but the political organization is still very centralized. It is argued that a deconcentration of tasks and means cannot be effective without changes in political structures. Therefore Solidarity asks for full self-government at the communal level, but the ruling Party has strong reservations against this. </jats:p>",

It has been suggested that one of the foremost benefits of a steering committee is that it can improve the information systems planning efforts of an organization. However, there is very little empirical evidence in the literature that deals with how such committees affect planning. This study investigates the impact of steering committees on three phases of information systems planning: strategic planning, systems planning, and implementation of planning. The greatest impact of steering committees appears to be the strategic planning phase, while a lesser effect is observed in the systems planning and implementation of planning phases.</jats:p>",

As it is difficult to decide whether this tendency increases or decreases welfare, a conceptual framework is developed that is based on an extended notion of costs in that it also allows a comparison of political with economic costs in the traditional sense. This approach allows the conceptual determination of an optimal degree of centralization/decentralization that depends on preference costs of citizens on the one hand [for instance, the costs of violated (‘frustrated’) values by a more centralized system] and resource costs (which increase with decentralization) on the other. This analysis also comprises as intermediate steps the derivation of certain principles that are elements of the theory of fiscal federalism. </jats:p>",

Throughout the paper it is stressed that such rhetorical analysis must be contextualised. Interpretation must complement, rather than replace, explanation. Providing complementary explanatory and interpretative analyses suggests a potential way of tackling ideological effects. Therefore the authors deal both with a general methodological issue—the analysis of ideological effects—and with a specific policy issue—green belts. </jats:p>",

It is argued that each of these competing theories is valid under specific circumstances and it is suggested that they are not necessarily mutually exclusive but can be complementary at a given point in time.

It is concluded that under present patterns of speech therapy provision, approximately 26 qualified speech therapists may be required per 100 000 population. However, it is argued that speech therapy may be trying to do too much and may be venturing into areas in which little, if anything, is known about its effectiveness.

A new methodology for measuring quality of life which is an attempt to satisfy this objective is discussed. It includes a perceptually derived set of weightings and ‘objectively’ measured indicators of social, economic, and environmental characteristics of the largest thirty-eight cities in Britain. The weighting system, the selected indicators, and the resulting rankings of British cities are assessed in comparison with the local prosperity index. The strength of the approach is shown to lie in the fact that this more closely reflects the evaluation process used by the public in assessing the quality of life. </jats:p>",

Those Victorian dentists who graduated in the 1960s, those who worked in multiple‐practitioner practices, or non‐rural areas, and those who had an added interest in removable prosthodontics were more likely to stress the importance of a greater number of attributes than those who graduated in the 1950s or 1970s, or those who worked alone, in rural areas, or had no particular interest in the discipline.

In this paper the social routes to tourism entrepreneurship are investigated, with emphasis on two major channels—those of the ex-employer and the ex-employee. Data are reported from a case study of Cornwall where 411 firms were interviewed as part of a stratified sample, representing different local economic environments and different sectors of tourism. An analysis of previous occupational experience and of access to capital only provides a partial explanation of entrepreneurship in Cornish tourism. Further analysis of business motivations and of migration patterns reveals an important dimension of noneconomic decisionmaking. This raises questions as to whether tourism entrepreneurship can be seen as a form of consumption rather than production and to its relationship with the entrepreneurial middle class as a whole. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Approaches from community and population ecology are adapted to study ‘homelessness’ in New York City, where long-standing and continued reductions of critical housing-related municipal services, particularly fire extinguishment, to levels below those needed for maintaining urban population densities have triggered waves of coupled contagious destruction of low-income housing and forced migration of population. Massive destruction of housing, after a delay occasioned by the outmigration of some 1.3 million non-Hispanic whites from the city between 1970 and 1980 has contributed significantly to a serious housing deficit, by direct loss of low-income housing and possibly by creating economic forces which encourage the conversion of remaining low-income units to high-income units. This deficit, which by some analyses approaches a quarter million housing units affecting perhaps a million people, has created a large ‘precariously housed’ population which, after a delay, is becoming overtly homeless as the decline of low-income housing supply collides with increasing numbers of the poor. Elementary mathematical analysis suggests the demographics of those precariously housed, but not yet homeless, strongly determines the dynamics of demand for emergency shelter, implying, for example, that under some circumstances the probability of avoiding homelessness may decline exponentially with time spent precariously housed, and that the number requiring emergency shelter may increase as rapidly as the square of the number precariously housed, depending on exact mechanisms. This paper provides prerequisites to a subsequent fuller exploration of the complex time dynamics of synergistic couplings between contagious urban decay, population migration, precariously housed population, homelessness, and public health deterioration in New York City. </jats:p>",

Scheduling operations are particularly critical to maintaining overall manufacturing system performance, and many researchers argue that humans should be retained in the control loop for this task. This paper critically reviews work done over the last 25 years on human scheduling abilities. The increasing amount of empirical work on human scheduling ability is widely dispersed, and many researchers are not aware of one another's work. Current work on manufacturing scheduling, field studies, and laboratory work on human scheduling abilities are reviewed. Methodological and conceptual problems are highlighted. The intention is to provide a sounder basis for future research on the human scheduling role by providing knowledge of what has been examined in the past and an awareness of the important issues for the future </jats:p>",
