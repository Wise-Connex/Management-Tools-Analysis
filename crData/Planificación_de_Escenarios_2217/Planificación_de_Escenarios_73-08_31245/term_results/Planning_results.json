National health insurance, low-income housing subsidies, grants for higher education and payments for income maintenance all emphasize the use of public expenditure to alter the distribution of real resources among income classes. The traditional cost-benefit approach, with its focus on the efficiency of resource use, is inadequate for dealing with such programs. Moreover, the basic problem of choice in these programs is not the selection of one of several mutually exclusive projects but the design of optimal income-related schedules of benefits and charges. </jats:p><jats:p> The current paper defines this problem more specifically and suggests a linear programming formulation for its solution.

Although the results are not conclusive, the study further suggests the potential value of using historical estimating behavior as a basis for “adjusting” the single time estimates made by an individual or group and/or using a single-estimate simulation approach rather than using a multiple estimate approaches such as PERT. </jats:p>",

Two variations of the doubly-constrained model—growth-factor and interactance (that is, gravity and entropy) models—are considered: The structural characteristics of these models are specified and several new solution properties are established. Then alternative parameter-estimation strategies are formulated and tested. The proposed techniques (which solve problems that are equivalent to existing models) are shown to be inferior to current methodology with respect to all criteria related to solution speed. However, it is shown that the proposed methods are more flexible than current approaches since a wider range of assumptions can be incorporated into the analysis. </jats:p>",

Gradually other objectives have emerged, and these in order of their emergence are regional income redistribution, environmental quality and social well‐being. These multi‐objectives have given rise to multifarious problems, and have made the planning process much more complex than ever before. The different objectives are not mutually exclusive, and, hence, contributions to one can only be made at the expense of others. Trade‐off studies between different objectives are difficult to make. It is suggested that one way to overcome this difficulty could be to design a system to perform optimally in terms of one objective, subject to a specified level of performance of the other, which in effect becomes a constraint. The paper also discusses the pros and cons of the desirability of public participation in our decision‐making processes, and the necessity of developing social sciences models to aid water planning and management.</jats:p>",

The matrix provides a means for determining the relative importance of water‐related problems, and for identifying the data needed to evaluate these problems for the purpose of urban planning. The matrix columns list nine categories of potential water‐related urban problems. The rows list 51 categories of data inputs which may be needed to evaluate the potential problems. The inputs include standard types of basic hydrologic data, information based on analysis and interpretation of these data, and information on the interfacing factors of climate, land, and culture. A system is described for ranking the relative importance of the problem categories and data inputs on a numerical scale of 0 to 3. From this, an index is derived that evaluates the relative importance of each input item to an overall program for water resource assessment. From the completed matrix the hydrologist can determine the availability of data to meet the identified requirements. Judgement can then be made as to priorities on work elements to provide the planner with maximum information in minimum time. The matrix also provides a basis for the development of programs and their funding in order to overcome critical data deficiencies.</jats:p>",
