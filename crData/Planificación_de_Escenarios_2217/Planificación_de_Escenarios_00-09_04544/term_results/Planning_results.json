The settlement house social workers pressed demands for neighborhood and housing improvements. They were followed by early city planners, who included neighborhood multipurpose civic centers within their comprehensive citywide plans. Clarence Perry’s neighborhood unit plan of the 1920s saw the urban neighborhood as a means to organize space and socialize residents. Today, with the rise of community development corporations, neighborhoods are again the focus of renewed interest. This commentary discusses the past and present of neighborhood planning within the context of a survey of ACSP faculty who are teaching neighborhood planning. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, it is argued that planning is normative and bound by sociocultural and political contexts, evidenced within the postindependence era by a rapid shift to political and fiscal decentralization and the pursuit of market capitalism, with negative consequences for social and economic development in Namibia. </jats:p>",

The findings indicate that many new professors in planning do not know what to expect and are generally not well prepared to assume their new roles. In particular, many new faculty were not trained in pedagogy or experienced in teaching, and so almost all of their first years are taken up with becoming reasonably proficient in their teaching. </jats:p>",

In San Francisco, elite fears that the Bay Bridge would lead to the exodus of residents and businesses to Oakland and the East Bay spurred new planning proposals in the 1930s. However, conventional planning efforts that focused on improving transit efficiency failed to generate much public support. Instead, merchants and other elites demanded that planning be used to create a cityscape of fantasies that would distinguish San Francisco from its rivals. The planning of new fairs and festivals re-created the city’s history and drew public support for other planning efforts aimed at attracting tourists. As a result, the creation of fantasies became a mainstay of planning in San Francisco and throughout the nation. </jats:p>",

This framework is then applied through a studio course that is taught annually in the Graduate Program in City and Regional Planning at the University of Memphis. </jats:p>",

This article argues that traditional approaches to land use planning hasten the pace of exurbanization in rural areas of the region. Building on this premise, the article presents a conceptual process-based model that links land use planning with exurbanization and uses the model in an empirical study of exurban development in Cochise County, Arizona. The analysis confirms expectations, with conventional planning approaches unintentionally fostering exurbanization and fueling the conversion of natural lands. Several principles are identified that should inform new approaches to land use planning in rural areas. </jats:p>",

In this article, the author uses the Baltimore-Washington region to examine how local jurisdictions manage aggregate minerals and the factors that help explain planners’ attitudes toward mineral protection. The study rests on a review of the region’s planning documents, examinations of specific planning practices in two counties, interviews of local planners, and statistical analysis. The author found that the sophistication of planning techniques for aggregate minerals ranges widely and that concern with mineral protection increases when both development pressures and resource supplies are high. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To estimate trends and determinants of sexual initiation and contraceptive use among adolescent women in Northeast Brazil, multivariate logistic hazard models are used that draw on data from three Demographic and Health Surveys conducted there between 1986 and 1996. Educational attainment is among the variables found to be associated most consistently with differential risk of engaging in first intercourse during adolescence, including premarital intercourse, and of contraceptive use during sexual initiation. Greater frequency of attending religious services and greater exposure to television are also associated with lower rates of sexual initiation and higher use of contraceptives. Seemingly diminishing returns of education on delayed sexual activity may help explain, in part, observed increases in the absolute level of adolescent sexual experience across survey periods, however. Multilevel modeling techniques pointing to the existence of cluster‐level random variances underline the need for further research into community influences on individual sexual activity.</jats:p>",

The model used in this analysis links the abortion rate to its direct determinants, including couples' reproductive preferences, the prevalence and effectiveness of contraceptive practice to implement these preferences, and the probability of undergoing an abortion to avoid an unintended birth when a contraceptive fails or is not used. An assessment of the tradeoff between contraception and abortion yields estimates of the decline in the total abortion rate that would result from an illustrative increase of 10 percentage points in prevalence. This effect varies among societies, primarily because the tendency to obtain an abortion after an unintended pregnancy varies. For example, in a population with an abortion probability of 0.5, a 10 percentage‐point increase in prevalence would avert approximately 0.45 abortions per woman, assuming contraception is 95 percent effective. If all unintended pregnancies were aborted, this effect would be three times larger. Eliminating all unintended pregnancies and subsequent abortions would require a rise in contraceptive prevalence to the level at which all fecund women who do not wish to become pregnant practice contraception that is 100 percent effective. A procedure is provided for estimating this “perfect” level of contraceptive prevalence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article presents an analysis of the potential impact of a program of regional fair share housing in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area: the Livable Communities Act (LCA). The author argues that fair share programs can be judged by two standards: (1) the degree to which they meet current and projected needs for affordable housing and (2) the extent to which they redistribute affordable housing opportunities throughout a region. The analysis shows that the LCA fails on the first of these standards and only minimally meets the second. Should program goals be fully met by all of the participating communities, the LCA will result in a decrease in the relative availability of affordable housing by 12 percent compared to a continuation of the status quo. In addition, overall, the program will not result in significant redistribution of affordable housing opportunities within the region. Only among rental housing units, which make up only 17 percent of estimated future residential development, is there the potential for progress toward fair share redistribution. </jats:p>",

Associated with increased vehicle usage are decreased levels of walking and biking, two valid forms of physical activity. The Surgeon General’s 1996 report, Physical Activity and Health, highlights the increasing level of physical inactivity as a growing cause of mortality. The costs and benefits of contrasting land development and transportation investment practices have been the subject of considerable debate in the literature. Findings have been refuted based on methodological grounds and inaccurate interpretation of data. Several of these studies, their methodological approaches, and their critiques are analyzed. While most agree that the built environment influences travel, considerable disagreement exists over the likely impacts of increased density, mix, and street connectivity on air quality, and on transportation system performance and household activity patterns. </jats:p>",

It has tended to have a poor image, partly because it involves relatively long periods of abstinence, and also because (since these are often not actually observed) it can have a high failure rate. However, in highly motivated, properly taught couples, the failure rate in use can be comparable to that of barrier methods. Many people dabble in the rhythm method: what woman has not at one time tried to calculate whether last night was ‘safe’ or not? However, this is precisely the worst way to go about it. If you are serious about using natural family planning, then it becomes a combination of an art and a science, with a proper training period. Indeed, it is quite impossible to learn this technique from a book, since practical guidance and learning on yourself are of paramount importance. At the back of this book you will find the address of organizations which offer teaching: most of the people involved in this are not in fact doctors, but lay people who are long-term users themselves and want to pass on their knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm to others.</jats:p>",

To address this assumption, research conducted in urban Southwest Nigeria combined qualitative and quantitative methods to examine men's sexual behavior, condom use, and STD experience in different types of sexual relationships (marital, casual, and commercial). Logistic regression analysis of survey data indicates that number of sexual partners and sex with sex workers are positively and significantly related to STD experience. Follow‐up in‐depth interviews with clients of sex workers indicate, however, that these men are actually more likely to report having contracted an STD from a casual sex partner than from a sex worker. Men are most uncertain about their vulnerability to STDs with casual partners. Men's condom use is highest in commercial sex, inconsistent in casual relationships, and lowest in marriage. STD/HIV‐prevention programs need to address the range of sexual relationships and the meanings and behaviors associated with them.</jats:p>",

Much discussion has ensued about the circumstances responsible for this decline and, in particular, about the contribution made by the national family planning program. For this study, qualitative interviews were conducted with 67 women concerning the factors influencing their reproductive behavior. The participants, residents of a rural area in southwestern Bangladesh, consisted of two groups: women who were currently practicing family planning and women who had never practiced or had not done so for at least four years. The findings suggest that the family planning program has played an important role in reducing family size, but also indicate that economic and social changes, and especially growing aspirations (particularly for a life outside agriculture) have combined with changes in the nature of family decisionmaking to make couples more receptive to the idea of family planning.</jats:p>",

The prevalence of pregnancy among sexually active women 15–49 declined significantly from 15 percent to 13 percent. Women practicing family planning for pregnancy prevention were predominantly in the 20–39‐year age group, married, better educated, and had higher parity than others, whereas women or men adopting condoms were predominantly young, unmarried, and better educated. Condom use was particularly high among individuals reporting multiple sexual partners or extramarital relationships. Contraceptive use was higher among women who desired fewer children, among those who wished to space or terminate childbearing, and among women with previous experience of unwanted births or abortions. Self‐perception of HIV risk increased condom use, but HIV testing and counseling had only modest effects. Contraception for pregnancy prevention and for HIV/STD prophylaxis are complementary.</jats:p>",

Additionally, the need to enforce these environmental costs into the industrial decision-making process at the formative stages of energy policies will result in a sound environmental policy. It is in the interest of industry to take a pro-active stance rather than oppose such measures.

The definition of natural capital by Costenza and Daly(1) is defined as a stock that yields a flow of valuable goods and services into the future. This is viewed as an environmental issue by the public at large but in actual fact it is a market failure, hence, it is an economic problem. This arises from the fact that whenever a commodity is undervalued there is a natural propensity to increase the demand until the price rises and restores equilibrium. Decisions will then be based on this new equilibrium position. On the other hand, if the commodity is continuously undervalued or is free it will result in an inefficient use of the resource. This is the basis to the problem of pollution.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Costs borne by society are in general invisible even though society continues to discard the wastes of economic activity into the environment. These externalities or third party effects, either positive or negative, are imposed on parties not directly involved in the production or use of the energy resource. This is one category of social costs and benefits which are usually not taken into consideration in an unregulated market or consumptive decision-making process. If air, land and water had always had a market price, their values would have been recognized in economic terms and pollution would be minimized.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

FixtureScout’s function is not to perform detailed fixture planning, but to find clamping surface information that will help in determining the setup sequence. This information is important in sequencing because it allows the planner to determine which setups destroy the clamping surfaces required by another. FixtureScout is a component of a larger process planning architecture, MAPP, which explores various ways of re-organizing the decisions and information flow in feature extraction and process planning, for example, by moving Fixture Scouts’ clamping surface analysis to a very early stage of planning. Our goal is to to improve planning effectiveness through these re-organizations.</jats:p>",

For practical reason, it is necessary for a quadruped to change its walking direction without slowing down or making a stop. In this paper, we formulate a gait planning which enables a quadruped walking in a straight line to change its gait to increase stability first, make a turn and finally recover to its original gait for straight-line walking. All of this is performed under a constant speed condition. The result shows that with some simple foot adjustments, the turning can be initiated at any foot lifting or placing event during a cycle.</jats:p>",

Since major manufacturing cost is determined in early design, it is critical to be able to assess manufacturability and cost as early as possible in the design process. The integration between process planning and design is critical to enable these analyses. A literature review of the current status of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) software technologies reveals the lack of interface standards to enable the integration of these systems. In order to develop interface standards, information models have to be first developed to define the interfaces. An initial information model for conceptual process planning has been developed. This model includes an activity model and an object model for manufacturing process selection, resource selection, and cost and time estimation. The activity model sets the context in which the objects are used for information sharing and exchange. The object model defines classes used in conceptual process planning. The main purpose of developing this model is to initiate the development of standard interface specifications that are necessary for design and process planning integration.</jats:p>",

These events entail a careful study of contact states of the parts being assembled. Recognition of contact states is crucial in planning and executing contact motion plans due to inevitable uncertainties. Xiao [3] introduced the concept of principal contacts (PC) and contact formation (CF) for contact state recognition. The concept of using CFs (as sets of PCs) has the inherent advantage that a change of CF is often coincident with a discontinuity of the general contact force (force and torque). Previous work [1,2] in contact motion planning has shown that contact information at the level of PCs along with the sensed location and force information is often sufficient for planning high precision assembly operations. In this paper, we present results from experiments involving planned contact motions to validate the notion of PCs and CFs, specifically that an abrupt change in general contact force often accompanies a change between CFs. We present results for the general 2D peg-in-corner problem.</jats:p>",

A similar pattern can be derived for specialisation. Against this background a discussion follows on whether specialisation trends will change after the completion of European Economic and Monetary Union and what would be the consequences. Finally, we present an empirical analysis of the prevailing trends with respect to regional concentration and specialisation for western Germany.  </jats:p>"

The stator only overlaps a very small area of the rotor, leading to a design that has a much wider range of unhindered motion than other spherical stepper motors in the literature. The problem with having a small stator is that it makes commutation and motion planning a difficult problem. We first explore the techniques and model used to construct the proper sequence of stator activations that result in the desired rotor trajectory. Experimental results are then presented for the model and prototype we have constructed.</jats:p>",

At the same time, it makes the generation of NC process plans more complicated and as a result the current process planning methods often fail in dealing with the new requirements. Based on agent theory this paper presents a new strategy for distributing a complex planning task to different relatively small planning units, so-called agents, which are defined considering both machine and workpiece structure. Instead of a central algorithm the agent based planning method generates NC process plans through some cooperative activities between different agents. The activity model and the cooperation rule are also discussed in detail.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines auditors' decisions to revise preliminary audit plans after analytical procedures performed during interim testing reveal significant, unexpected fluctuations. We examine the effects of two variables on these decisions: (1) the presence or absence of an explicit incentive for management to misstate the financial statements, and (2) the degree to which management's explanation for the fluctuation is independently corroborated. We hypothesize that these two variables interact. Auditors will be more likely to increase their planned tests when there is minimal corroboration of management's explanation for the fluctuation and there is an explicit incentive for management to misrepresent the financial statements. The results of an experiment are consistent with this hypothesis. While our results suggest that auditors are more likely to revise audit plans in these conditions, we also find that a relatively high proportion of auditors do not revise their plans when faced with increased audit risk signaled by significant, unexpected fluctuations. Future research is needed to better understand auditors' reluctance to expand testing and whether this reluctance jeopardizes audit effectiveness.</jats:p>",

As far as rail transport is concerned, counties in the “newLänder” (of the former East Germany) now on average have better connections to the network than counties in western Germany.

From the solid model and the tolerance specifications of the part, machining features are automatically recognized, and geometry-based precedence relations are obtained between these features. From this information, the machining sequence, tool selections, and machining conditions are determined. Machining tool paths are then generated automatically for each setup, combining local and global tool paths. Local tool paths to machine each feature are generated using successive offsetting operations. Global tool paths between features are generated incrementally by searching the adjacency graph of feature free spaces, which represents the current free space of the part. Feature free spaces are obtained by expanding the machining features through their fictitious faces. The start and end positions for the local tool paths of each feature are selected based on a heuristic method to minimize the cost of each segment of the global tool path. This automatic tool path generation method is currently being developed as part of a comprehensive machining process planning system.</jats:p>",

Assuming that the decision-maker is capable of responding to a paired comparison of alternatives, this algorithm is developed to, iteratively, reduce the feasible space of the weighting factor, which combines the two objectives. The algorithm terminates when the predetermined bounds on the weighing factor are reached. A graphical method is presented to help analyze the sensitivity of the optimum layout into small variations in the estimated value of the decision-maker’s preferred weight.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The proposed approach has been applied in a case study, which is an exhaust system factory (Engineering Company for Manufacturing Exhaust Systems) located in the 6th.

In order to satisfy the needs of assembly plants of exhaust systems, a new location in the 6th. October City has been chosen, modern machinery supplied and scientific techniques followed to accomplish optimum layout. By applying this approach the best layout can be generated.

Consensus was found for using a 4% inflation rate, an 8.5% rate of return on investments, and a replacement ratio of 70 – 89% of current income when making retirement projections. Nine-tenths of the experts agreed that families should have achieved 50–60% of their retirement savings goal by age 50 and 85–90% by age 60. Regarding asset allocation, over 60% felt it was prudent to start moving toward more conservative investments about 3–5 years before retirement. Recommendations were developed on the proportion of growth-oriented equities to hold at various points prior to and after retiring. While the level of consensus was high, occupational and gender differences were noted. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n</jats:p>"

As well as detailing the technological evolution of the can, he pays particular attention to the integral role that it played in the expansion and maintenance of Europe's empires in the Victorian era. Beginning with the demonstration of the can as part of the United Kingdom, Colonies, and Dominions exhibition at the Great Exhibition of 1851, the author examines its significance in several key events in the British imperial endeavour, including the Boer War and the marketing of the British Empire in the 1920s. The author also demonstrates the involvement of the can in the construction of new experiences of global space, as it both reduced the distance between sites of food production and consumption and perpetuated those distances by fetishising the geographies of the origins of foodstuffs. Although it is now one of the most mundane of artifacts in the burgeoning world of material culture, the author argues that the can was responsible for lengthening the networks of imperialism and globalisation, and that a retelling of its story can help us reconceptualise the ways in which such networks were built and do work. </jats:p>",

As a result, several recent research reports present genetic-algorithm-based mechanical-product assembly planners. However, genetic-algorithm-based assembly planners require an initial assembly-sequence population, and search efficiency greatly depends upon input-population quality. State-of-the-art genetic-algorithm-based assembly planners use one of two techniques for generating an initial assembly-sequence population: use a user-supplied assembly-sequence set or use a randomly generated assembly-sequence set. Generating a user-supplied initial population requires a substantial amount of manpower. Using a randomly generated initial population reduces search efficiency. As a result, we propose an algorithm for automatically generating an initial assembly-sequence population. Our algorithm calculates component assembly complexity and uses both component assembly complexity and component connectivity to automatically generate a valid assembly-sequence population. Using automatically generated initial populations, we achieve search efficiencies comparable to search efficiencies achieved when using user-supplied initial assembly-sequence populations, while eliminating manpower required to generate user-supplied assembly sequences.</jats:p>",

In this paper we discuss this argument from two main viewpoints: the level of percolation of transport benefits into land values and the presence of external economies in urban systems. We first propose and discuss measures of benefits in the transport system and in the land-use system. Then we analyse to what extent transport users' benefits percolate into land rents, showing empirical evidence that it may be limited. We then focus on the less-studied effect of three types of technological externalities: direct effects associated with traffic nuisance; location externalities, associated with economies of agglomeration of households and firms, which in some cities may be a dominant location choice factor; and land-use–transport interaction. We conclude by specifying in more detail the conditions under which the classical argument and current project appraisal methods are valid. </jats:p>",

The Virtual Simulation of RTP replaces the real Simulator machine with a virtual one by using the CT data sets of a patient instead of the real patient. In this paper, we present a collaborative virtual simulation environment of RTP, named EU‐VIRTUOSO, which is based on volume rendering and telecommunication techniques. The RTP procedure is visualised on a virtual patient, which is created by using the CT data of the patient. Different volume rendering and volume interaction techniques, such as DRR, MIP, gradient surface, and iso‐surface, supply physicians with high quality rendering images to simulate the real working environment of the Simulator machine. In the collaborative environment, physicians distributed at different locations can work together via network to plan the treatment or to validate the treatment plan on‐line by a collaborative application sharing approach. Both concepts virtualised planning and collaborative planning improve the efficiency and accuracy of a radiotherapy treatment while reducing the effort for an individual patient.</jats:p>",

While the results for judgments related to the extent of testing were consistent with professional guidance, auditors lacked consensus in judging the effect on the timing of tests. The results provide insight into the effect of two important elements of the control environment on preplanning and planning judgments and could prove useful in the development of work papers and risk assessment models.</jats:p>",

The development of innovative drilling fluids specific to these well conditions, and the rigorous laboratory testing necessary to generate detailed engineering guidelines, are described. Large-scale abrasion and pressure tests were also conducted. Modifications made to the rig design facilitated the management of drilling fluid properties at high density with high flow line temperatures. A portable drilling fluids laboratory, staffed with trained technicians, was installed on the rig to continually pilot test drilling fluid samples and treatments under simulated down-hole conditions. The importance of good communications and global technical support networks proved invaluable during the pre-well planning and for the execution phase of extreme high temperature and high pressure wells drilling.</jats:p>",

Fatigue was induced by “time on task,” with subjects performing a switch task continuously for 2 hr. Subjects had to alternate between tasks on every second trial, so that a new task set was required on every second trial. Manipulations of response–stimulus intervals (RSIs) were used to examine whether subjects prepared themselves for the task change. Behavioral measurements, event‐related potentials (ERPs), and mood questionnaires were used to assess the effects of mental fatigue. Reaction times (RTs) were faster on trials in which no change in task set was required in comparison with switch trials, requiring a new task set. Long RSIs were used efficiently to prepare for the processing of subsequent stimuli. With increasing mental fatigue, preparation processes seemed to become less adequate and the number of errors increased. A clear poststimulus parietal negativity was observed on repetition trials, which reduced with time on task. This attention‐related component was less pronounced in switch trials; instead, ERPs elicited in switch trials showed a clear frontal negativity. This negativity was also diminished by time on task. ERP differences between repetition and switch trials became smaller with increasing time on task.</jats:p>",

The study shows how the original Olympic plan that was sold to the International Olympic Committee with the slogan of a `Compact Games' won the bid, but was subsequently transformed due to changes in power balances among the domestic and international players who had conflicting interests. For example, the `Green Games' was not part of Lillehammer's original bid and only emerged as a central feature of the event after complex and protracted negotiations among competing interest groups. It is argued that some of the most important aspects connected to mega-events like the Olympics are due not only to `rational' planning processes, but also to how the attendant conflicts and compromises among interest groups lead to unintended outcomes. </jats:p>",

Drawing from institutionalist and regulationist approaches a geographical perspective is adopted which links processes across different sociospatial scales and stresses the importance of relative mobility differences in asymmetric power relations. By considering 28 individual case studies of firms in the Ruhr Area of Germany, it is argued: first, that as stakeholders in the firms respond to a changing environment and to increasing uncertainty, capital–labour relations in Germany are being downscaled and decentralised, profoundly changing the traditional power geometry between capital and labour; second, that the regulatory landscape is being ‘reworked’ in terms favourable to capital during a period in which the latter is in the ascendancy in the labour market; and, third, that there is a peculiar spatial dimension to the rearticulation of power relations and core institutions of the German model. As solidarity and trust appear to be increasingly produced and reproduced at the firm level in the emerging regulatory configuration, the scale of labour regulation is being recast. </jats:p>",

We show that testing for unboundedness is computationally at least as hard as these two subproblems. The new algorithm is the fastest known algorithm and is practical. We then present a framework for general translational assembly planning based on linear constraints. We show the relation of m-handed assembly planning to unboundedness testing and present a polynomial-time algorithm for m-handed assembly of polygonal part assemblies with no initially separated pairs of parts. For the general translational assembly–planning problem, we present a new algorithm that uses unboundedness testing and a cell reduction technique to significantly increase the search efficiency. Experimental results of our implementation on a variety of planar and spatial assemblies demonstrate the practicality of the algorithms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographical scholarship on the localization of labor regulation, militant particularism in class struggle, and labor-union activity has highlighted the need for workers to contest the scales over which their working lives are produced. Because these analyses have focused on the role of spatial competition and capital mobility in defeating labor struggle, and on the production of scale by manufacturing firms and workers, prescriptions for activism have tended to privilege interregional and international labor solidarity and regulatory mechanisms that might allow labor to operate at the same scale as capital. With a case study of service-sector activism in the US city of Baltimore, I argue for attention to the metropolitan scale of pro-worker labor-market regulation and organizing. By removing local labor activism from a juxtaposition against mobile capital, I add to existing geographies of labor regulation and resistance a theoretical and empirical focus on the importance of ‘spatial fixes' for workers at the local scale, and highlight the processes through which local struggles can be articulated both with each other and with overarching regulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Throughout Asia, there is a commitment by governments to sustainable development, yet economic development continues to degrade the natural resources of the region and pollute the environment in both urban and rural areas. Current thinking about sustainable development suggests that planners and development specialists should attempt to integrate social, economic and environmental dimensions at all planning levels. This paper examines work undertaken by the Asian Development Bank over the last 15 years in the area of subnational integrated economic-cum-environmental (E-c-E) planning. It evaluates five subnational E-c-E plans against a model developed by the Organization of American States (OAS). The study found that the Asian case studies (and six earlier Latin American case studies) often have common failings. Improvement of the E-c-E planning approach, building on the common success factors and improving on the common weaknesses, is proposed. An improved E-c-E planning approach at all levels may be pivotal in contributing to sustainable development. </jats:p>",

In an effort to halt this decline in health status, a model of interdisciplinary discharge planning is proposed to address the interface between Juvenile Justice Centres and adult correctional facilities and the community. Key features of the process are: collaboration through the development of links by establishment of a community liaison co‐ordinator position; open and continuous communication between service providers; continuous involvement of detainees and their significant others; and ongoing support to detainees once discharged. Evaluation of the discharge‐planning process ensures that the process is appropriate to meet the needs of this specific and diverse population of young people and supplies feedback to all service providers. The trusting relationship that is developed between detainees and registered nurses within centres leaves nurses ideally placed to co‐ordinate the discharge‐planning process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Returning geological samples from Mars is the next logical step as part of an integrated exploration program and is the critical subsequent stage in the search for evidence of life on the red planet. Analysis of such samples on Earth will generally produce data of superior accuracy and precision than can be accomplished in situ on the Martian surface, and such data will be invaluable in providing ground truth for remotely sensed observations. However, obtaining meaningful data requires that the samples returned to Earth suffer little (or preferably no) compositional or morphological changes during collection on Mars, transit to Earth, entry into Earth's atmosphere, impact on the surface, and long‐term curation. This paper presents recommendations from NASA's committee for Curation and Analysis Planning Team for Extraterrestrial Materials (CAPTEM) for preserving the integrity of Martian samples during a return mission. Potential contaminants include dead bacteria on the outbound spacecraft and materials that come into contact with the samples during collection and storage. Therefore it is recommended that the spacecraft be sterilized and cleaned at least to Pathfinder standards, with the components that interact with the samples having a higher degree of cleanliness. Furthermore, it is recommended that only pure, homogeneous materials should be used for components that come into contact with the samples. The adverse effects of temperature on the samples are explored, and it is demonstrated that heat sterilization or undue temperature increases in transit or reentry have the potential to destroy important mineralogical and geochemical information. Concomitant with this will be degassing of the samples and stable isotopic fractionation. Therefore it is recommended that samples be kept at 240 K or below during transit, reentry, and curation. It is further recommended that heat sterilization not be used, except in extreme circumstances, and other sterilization techniques, such as radiation, be explored. While the purpose of this paper is not to design a sample return mission, the recommendations presented here are intended to act as guidelines for returning Martian samples in their pristine state. In essence, any procedure or piece of equipment that has the potential to compromise the pristinity of Martian samples during the collection, transportation, or curation needs to be fully evaluated by a scientific committee with the requisite expertise prior to implementation. CAPTEM is willing to serve in such a capacity if requested by NASA.</jats:p>",

To gain better insights, the 1985–90 migrations are decomposed into three types: primary, return, and onward. Our major findings are as follows. First, lifetime labor migration was highly efficient in transferring labor into North Region from all other regions of Taiwan and contributed to Taiwan's transformation into one of the newly industrialized economies. Second, the 1985–90 labor migration in Taiwan responded quickly to the spatially unbalanced impacts of economic restructuring and globalization in the 1980s and resulted in a major turnaround in population redistribution: a shift from a long-lasting dual-pole (north–south) concentration pattern developed since the 1930s toward a single-pole concentration pattern in the north. Third, primary migration was much more voluminous than return and onward migrations, and rural prefectures had the typical pattern of a ‘loser’: a large net loss of primary migrants, countered by a small net gain of return migrants, and somewhat aggravated by a small net loss of onward migrants. Fourth, the greatest beneficiaries in terms of educational selectivity were Taipei city (the command center of the globalized Taiwanese economic system) and Hsinchu city (the so-called silicon valley of Taiwan). Fifth, the losses in the quantity and quality of human resources due to migration did not result in socioeconomic decline in rural prefectures because these losses were compensated for largely by the rural-ward financial transfer of central government and partly by the remittances sent back by rural out-migrants. </jats:p>",

Unlike most marketing situations, in which relatively low but sustained target audience coverage by advertising can help support long-term sales and profits, court rules and constitutional due process demand high class coverage within a relatively short time frame, often spanning 30 to 90 days. Yet judges and attorneys typically lack the expertise to determine the number of class members who are exposed to and read a mass media notice, and case law and official judicial guidelines provide minimal and thus inadequate information. The use of mass media notice without sufficient analyses of likely notice coverage among class members can jeopardize the rights of class members and the legal integrity of the proceedings. Therefore, courts should demand the use of state-of-the-art media planning procedures, as demonstrated in this study, to forecast due process performance of alternative notice plans. </jats:p>",

By linking data on R&amp;D activity at the firm level with GIS-based data on economic and other location features of regions, we are able to investigate the impact of local factors on R&amp;D involvement for various types of firms. The relative importance of local factors as determinants of the R&amp;D involvement of firms is estimated by means of a tobit model. Rather strong differences are found between zones in the same urban region. For example, modern manufacturing firms located in the centre of large cities have relatively low levels of R&amp;D, and the opposite holds for rings of zones at certain distances from the cities.

This paper forms part of a growing body of work in the geographical literature that seeks to contest this view, reinserting labour as an actor in the context of globalisation. Specifically, we consider labour as an autonomous agent in the corporate labour process, through an examination of the impact of current processes of organisational restructuring in multinational corporations upon employment relations. We argue that corporate restructuring is a socially embedded, and therefore highly problematic, process involving issues of negotiation, consent, and resistance between managers and workers, and that current restructuring is therefore destabilising established patterns of social relations by which corporations secured worker consent in the past. Our argument is developed using a case study from the international oil industry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The center of mass space is a convenient space for planning motions that minimize reaction forces at the manipulator’s base or optimize the stability of a mechanism. A unique problem associated with path planning in the center of mass space is the potential existence of multiple center of mass images for a single Cartesian obstacle, since a single center of mass location can correspond to multiple manipulator joint configurations. The existence of multiple images results in a need to either maintain multiple center of mass obstacle maps or to update obstacle locations when the manipulator passes through a singularity, such as when it moves from an elbow-up to an elbow-down configuration. To illustrate the concepts presented in this paper, a path is planned for an example task requiring motion through multiple center of mass space maps. The object of the path-planning algorithm is to locate the path with a bang-bang acceleration profile that minimizes the manipulator’s base reactions in the presence of a single Cartesian obstacle. To simplify the presentation, only nonredundant manipulators are considered and joint nonlinearities are neglected. </jats:p>",

Two monkeys were trained to perform a variant of the memory-guided saccade task in which any of four visible dots (rightward, upward, leftward, and downward) could be the target. On each trial, the cue identifying the target was either a spot flashed in superimposition on the target (spatial condition) or a foveally presented digitized image associated with the target (pattern condition). Trials conforming to the two conditions were interleaved randomly. On recording from 439 SEF neurons, we found that two aspects of neuronal activity were influenced by the nature of the cue. 1) Activity reflecting the direction of the impending response developed more rapidly following spatial than following pattern cues. 2) Activity throughout the delay period tended to be higher following pattern than following spatial cues. We consider these findings in relation to the possible involvement of the SEF in processes underlying attention, arousal, response-selection, and motor preparation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Multinational corporations (MNCs) are reorganising their production systems. Many MNCs are integrating their production on a continental scale and allocating specific responsibilities and tasks to their research centres on a global scale. Empirical research on the pharmaceutical industry suggests that the spatial reorganisation of the production system can be understood as a process of reterritorialisation and deterritorialisation on different scales. In this paper I outline how MNCs in the pharmaceutical industry are responding to the challenges of the changing economic environment. The ongoing restructuring and rationalisation in the Swiss pharmaceutical giant F Hoffmann–La Roche serves as an example. The recent acquisition of the German pharmaceuticals and diagnostics company Boehringer Mannheim by F Hoffmann – La Roche illustrates how such huge business transactions meet with trade unions which are completely unprepared. I also discuss the responses of trade unions in different affected locations to the ongoing spatial industrial reconfiguration. Whereas the executive committees of MNCs think, develop their strategies, and act on a global scale trade unions, social movements, and local governments are, in contrast, locally and nationally anchored. They have not been able to break out of the cage of localism and the national state with their concepts and activities. This structural inequality is one of the reasons for the loss of importance and credibility of trade unions. Therefore, labour must adopt a new approach to the spatial and social scales of its political practice. </jats:p>",

From October 1997 to May 1999, 335 patients were discharged; 23 patients (6.9%) were referred. The referred patients were older and more frequently diagnosed with malignancy, dementia and respiratory infection. In addition, they had lower activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL scores. Those characteristics, which may be related to the longer hospital stay and lower rate of returning home of the referred patients, can be assessed early in hospitalization to identify patients at risk for difficult discharge planning. It is important to identify patients who need earlier intervention by formalized discharge planning so that the current situation of overly long hospitalization in Japan will improve.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The non‐invasive Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique (EDAT) was evaluated as a method of assessing the aetiology of dysphagia in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Data were collected from a group of 20 typically developing children (nine girls, 11 boys; age range <jats:italic>7</jats:italic> to 14 years) for comparison with 125 dysphagic children with CP (81 boys, 44 girls; age range 1 to 18 years). The swallowing mechanism has been separated into physiological phases: anticipatory, delivery, oral transit, and oral‐pharyngeal. Normal or abnormal function in each phase was recorded and the common causes of any impaired phase were considered, starting with generalized possibilities before focusing on specific parts of swallowing physiology. Data from 125 dysphagic children with CP show marked differences from the data for the typically developing children. Interpreting individual results was valuable in assisting the assessment team to formulate management strategies; two examples are presented. The technique appears to provide a cost‐effective, non‐invasive, and valuable clinical tool.</jats:p>",
