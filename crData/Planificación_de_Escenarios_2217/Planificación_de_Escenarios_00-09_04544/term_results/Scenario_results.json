      "abstract": "<jats:p>Availability of adequate and proper mix of farm power is a critical input for determination of the quality and pace of mechanization in agriculture. In the state of undivided Uttar Pradesh, farm mechanisation grew slowly after green revolution and accelerated recently due to increased need of timely completion of field operations, better utilization of costly inputs, need to handle large volume of agro-produces and improved quality of work. The unit farm power availability in the state has increased from 0.43 kW/ha in 1971-72 to 2.12 kW/ha in 1998-99 at the rate of6.09 per cent and is likely to reach to 2.86 kW/ha by the year 2005. Also, unit power availability in the State had been 145.8 per cent of the national average in 1971-72 and is likely to be 190.7 per cent by the year 2005. Consequently, food grains production in the State increased from 11.797 million tonnes in 1950-51 to 40.15 million tonnes in 1998-99 at annual growth rate of2.58 per cent being marginally higher (1957 kg/ha) than all India average yield (1620 kg/ha) inI998-99. The unit power-productivity relationship for the State indicated that with increase in unit power availability, the crop productivity had increased as in the case of national scenario. Reliance on animate power in the state has decreased from 66.25 per cent of total power in 1971-72 to 10.49 per cent in 2000-0 I indicating strong shift to mechanical power sources. The higher yield response to farm power availability in the state as compared to the national average reflect the importance of timely completion of field operation through farm power availability.</jats:p>"

The traditional FMEA uses three factors, Occurrence, Severity, and Detection, to determine the Risk Priority Number (RPN). This paper addresses two major problems with the conventional FMEA approach: 1) The Detection index does not accurately measure contribution to risk, and 2) The RPN is an inconsistent risk-prioritization technique.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors recommend two deployment strategies to address these shortcomings: 1) Organize the FMEA around failure scenarios rather than failure modes, and 2) Evaluate risk using probability and cost. The proposed approach uses consistent and meaningful risk evaluation criteria to facilitate life cost-based decisions.</jats:p>",
