Possible applications discussed are the identification of factors for predicting success in planning applications, measurement of zone separation, assessment of the effectiveness of the planning system in tackling externalities, verification of economic theories of the behaviour of planning authorities and evaluation of public participation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The legitimization of planning has, in the period since the Second World War, rested on the proposition that the state’s intervention in land and property development is necessary to safeguard the public interest against private and sectional interests. What constitutes the public interest has always been contentious but its value as a legitimizing concept has increasingly been called into question in the recent past for the reason that it cannot be given operational meaning either by those who make policy or by those who evaluate it. The purpose of this article is to explore the ‘public interest’ justification of planning and whether it has outlived its usefulness in an increasingly fragmented society. Following an introduction, the argument is presented in three stages. First, we explore the concept of ‘interests’ in the modern period. Second, we consider the way in which the ‘public interest’ has been regarded in the planning literature. Third, an evaluative framework is established which distinguishes deontological as well as consequentialist conceptualizations of the public interest through which we seek to demonstrate that it remains the pivot around which debates concerning the role and purpose of planning must revolve. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article conceptualizes two interrelated constellations of effects produced by practices of power in New Zealand planning. These are symbolic violence and institutional victimization. This article contends that acts of submission and obedience become symbols of violence when the state’s planning regimes allow no elements of choice, or freedom to resist, for those acted upon. This is compounded further into institutional victimization when the oppressors are also the final practicable, or actual, arbiters of appeal. We provide evidence that suggests this is a regular occurrence in New Zealand and, further, is indicative of a wider ranging consequence of modern governance that Foucault called governmentality. In New Zealand, the provision of a theoretically consultative statutory planning process obscures the actual rationality of exclusion underlining many of its planning practices. </jats:p>",

However, little is understood about the operation of hospital markets outside the USA and the UK. This paper assesses the degree of competition for hospital services in two hospital markets in Zambia (Copperbelt and Midlands), and the implications for prices, quality and efficiency. We found substantial differences among different hospital types in prices, costs and quality, suggesting that the hospital service market is a segmented market. The two markets differ significantly in their degree of competition, with the high cost inpatient services market in Copperbelt relatively more competitive than that in the Midlands market. The implications of these differences are discussed in terms of the potential for competition to improve hospital performance, the impact of market structure on equity of access, and how the government should address the problem of the mine hospitals.

German development assistance also reflects a new ethos of partnership and the shift to programmatic and sector based development approaches.

First, on the development of the policy, they look at how the need for affordable housing is assessed, how the policy evolved, and how it is currently operated. Second, on the principles and potential outputs of the policy they look at how the approach fits into the principles of betterment taxation, what the results are likely to be ‘on the ground’ in terms of price and output of housing, and whether these are consistent with taxation principles. Third, they examine what the evidence is so far on the impact of planning obligations on affordable housing provision. Finally, the authors develop a typology of likely outcomes, particularly regarding who pays for affordable housing. </jats:p>",

The groups show each patient's own case‐mix in terms of illness. Grouping was carried out using the case‐mix instrument adjusted clinical groups (ACG), developed by the School of Hygiene and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, USA. The resulting pattern provided a more adequate reflection of the scope of primary care's task than that yielded by diagnoses alone. Changes over time in terms of illness patterns for a population could be described, analysed and assessed from medical and health economic perspectives. One of the conclusions from this study was that the ACG instrument is a relevant tool in describing the outcome of work by the primary health care centre. The ACG is of interest in the improvement of the quality of primary care in Sweden. The ACG should be a driving force in the development of health indices in both national and international comparisons, as a result of its focus on the health status of patients and populations instead of on diagnoses and diseases.

This paradigm is different from the traditional method of accessing Web content – a method that requires an individual to seek out information via a search engine or URL. Webcasting does not require active participation by the viewer and in this sense it is more like the television mode of information delivery. After reviewing the evolution of Webcasting, our paper considers the implications of Webcasting for the marketing decision support system and the marketing mix. An extranet is a private Internet site that enables several companies to securely share information and conduct business. An extranet extends the reach of push technology and hence magnifies the marketing impact.</jats:p>",

The field has started to settle into    a methodology for such comparisons, which for obvious practical    reasons requires running a subset of planners on a subset of    problems.  In this paper, we characterize the methodology and    examine eight implicit assumptions about the problems, planners and    metrics used in many of these comparisons. The problem assumptions    are: PR1) the performance of a general purpose planner should not be    penalized/biased if executed on a sampling of problems and domains,    PR2) minor syntactic differences in representation do not affect    performance, and PR3) problems should be solvable by STRIPS capable    planners unless they require ADL. The planner assumptions are: PL1)    the latest version of a planner is the best one to use, PL2) default    parameter settings approximate good performance, and PL3) time    cut-offs do not unduly bias outcome. The metrics assumptions are:    M1) performance degrades similarly for each planner when run on    degraded runtime environments (e.g., machine platform) and M2) the    number of plan steps distinguishes performance. We find that most of    these assumptions are not supported empirically; in particular, that    planners are affected differently by these assumptions. We conclude    with a call to the community to devote research resources to    improving the state of the practice and especially to enhancing the    available benchmark problems.</jats:p>"

Technically, the Internet minimises customer’s transaction costs such as time spent travelling to a store to purchase a product.

The principles and system components are presented, not as a solution, but as a point of departure in stimulating professional dialogue toward a new system for fire management and planning.</jats:p>",

Isolates and examines three components identified in earlier studies as areas of consumer concern. Within these parameters a number of consumer characteristics potentially might affect trust levels; this initial exploratory study examines whether consumer trust appears to vary by gender, and it is the authors’ intention to investigate other characteristics in future studies. Seeks to evaluate whether consumer trust is increasing or declining and whether one or other gender might potentially be more responsive to e‐marketing activities. Earlier studies suggest discernable differences between male and female perceptions of online shopping; however, the present study detects only minor (insignificant) gender‐based variations, registering a high level of concern overall, regardless of gender.</jats:p>",

The potential impact of the funding shortfall resulting from the phasing out of funding by the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), and the strategies being adopted by the selected countries to cope with this, are considered. Stratified random sampling methods were employed to select eight Caribbean countries and a pre-designed questionnaire was administered to the agency responsible for family planning services in each country. The sample was stratified geographically to include countries from different parts of the Caribbean. The questionnaire was designed to collect information on the services provided, the name of the agency responsible for the provision of services and, where possible, the number of users of each type of service in 1998 and 1997. Vast disparities were found in the provision of family planning services in different Caribbean countries, in terms of the groups involved, the services available in each country, as well as methods of data collection and compilation. Anguilla and Bermuda were found to provide only limited family planning services, while Barbados, Jamaica and Grenada provide much more sophisticated services. A salient finding was the innovative approaches that various countries in the region have adopted to fund family planning programmes in anticipation of the phasing out of IPPF funding. The standpoint taken in the study is that countries such as Anguilla and Bermuda must strive to improve their provision of family planning services, and that they could learn from Barbados, Grenada and Jamaica, which provide much more comprehensive services. It is also concluded that, unless alternative funding sources are identified and accessed, the provision of family planning services in the Caribbean is likely to decline in the future.</jats:p>",

Hong Kong's approach to environmental policy has been based on the conventional ‘command and control’ model of environmental management. It has, however, become increasingly apparent that many of Hong Kong's environmental problems cannot be effectively addressed solely by local initiatives but must involve broader collaborative efforts with authorities in neighbouring Guangdong Province. Furthermore, the Hong Kong SAR's efforts to address sustainability issues, which are still at an early stage, may also be facilitated by a regional rather than purely local perspective as well as by one that explores the utility of the ecological modernization model. This paper discusses the recent evolution of environmental policy in Hong Kong, the emergence of a regional environmental management agenda and the potential of ecological modernization as a basis for the development of a broader strategy to manage the environmental problems of the Pearl River Delta Region.

In the participatory planning process, which puts into use the knowledge and skills of individuals through active interaction, the study of social cognitive abilities seems relevant. The objective of this article is to review the social cognitive factors and their implications in participatory planning and designing. Social cognitions are observed early in childhood and they develop over decades through experience. It appears that they are partially independent of formal intelligence. The existing data suggests that social cognition may have a biological basis in the form of neurophysiological substrates and genetic loci. Social cognitions help in comprehending, adjusting interpretations, thinking of multiple alternatives, social problem solving and in various other processes. Social cognitions are instrumental in dealing with a variety of interpersonal problems observed during interactions in the group and in coping with potential stressors like negative outcomes. Various factors like positive mood states, belief in self‐efficacy and goals may affect social cognition and planning and decision‐making processes. These findings suggest that practitioners and researchers of participatory change processes should pay attention to social cognition. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent decades, increasing entrepreneurial activities among women have contributed to shifting livelihood strategies at the household, community, and regional scales. In this paper I examine home-based work in an economic network to highlight the intersection of gender and economic practices in rural Appalachia. The research demonstrates that these livelihood strategies both construct and are shaped by dynamic material conditions and social processes in place. Economic restructuring in the central Appalachian region has led to the reworking of economic strategies, despite a continued reliance by households on homework and informal activities. The case study for this project is an economic network comprised of sixty home-based workers who produce knitwear for regional and national markets. In-depth interviews and extensive fieldwork are used to examine the complexity of shifting economic livelihoods in the rural Appalachian context. The analysis focuses on the (re)negotiation of gender identities by home-based workers in the context of economic restructuring. The discussion also shows how participation in these activities contributes to economic and social empowerment. Overall, this study offers a critical approach to the economy, work, and gender in a way that analyzes diverse economic practices and the construction of gender identity in a rural, economically marginalized region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radiation dose escalation may be a means to increase the local control rate of inoperable lung tumors. Treatment plans involve the creation of a uniform planning target volume (PTV) to ensure proper coverage despite patient breathing and setup error. This may lead to unnecessary radiation of normal tissue in shallow breathers or target underdosing for patients with excess internal motion. Therefore, the nature of tumor motion for each patient should be measured in 3D, something that cannot be done with CT alone. We have developed a method that acquires 2D real‐time fluoroscopic images (loops) and coregisters them with 2D digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) formed from the CT scan. The limitations of CT to encompass motion can be overcome by merging the two modalities together. The accuracy of the coregistration method is tested with a stationary grid of radio‐opaque markers at various spatial positions. The in‐plane (at‐depth) displacement between markers on the fluoroscopic image versus the DRR varies with position across the image due to slight misalignments between the x‐ray source used in fluoroscopy and the virtual source used for the DRR relative to the test object. At clinically relevant positions, the maximum, measured in‐plane displacement, is 1.1 mm. The method is applied to the thorax of an anthropomorphic phantom and a good fit is observed between the appearances of the bony anatomical structures on the coregistered image. Finally, a series of motion measurements are carried out on two oscillating cylindrical objects. The degree of motion as measured by fluoroscopy is accurate to within 1.0 mm, whereas the DRR is inconsistent in predicting motion. The coregistration of fluoroscopic loops with the DRR shows at what point within the oscillation the DRR fails to encompass motion. For any treatment site involving target motion, this real‐time imaging is a useful asset in the planning stage.</jats:p>",

He uses theories and methods drawn from the literature concerning political ecology and moral economies to argue that many assumptions regarding state capacity, individual and collective identities and motivations, and economic and historical relations in advanced capitalist countries are mistaken or incomplete in ways that have led to important dimensions of environmental conflicts in such locales being overlooked. The argument is based mainly on the author's own research on the Wise Use movement in the rural American West of the 1980s and 1990s but also draws on other recent work in political ecology, historical and economic geography, and environmental history. </jats:p>",

It examines the spatial frameworks and the territory‐specific approaches adopted in Hong Kong since the 1970s. Despite the claim of a non‐interventionist approach, government intervention for the purposes of promoting economic growth was evident in the development model of Hong Kong under the British rule. Additionally, the notion of strategic planning at the regional level was absent from the spatial framework. This was so even with the growing economic interaction between Hong Kong and the other cities in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR) in the 1980s and remained so in the early years of the SAR government. With economic integration between Hong Kong and the PRDR, strategic planning has to take on a different form. The diversity of the socio‐economic context and the complexity of political processes in the PRDR offer enormous opportunities to all stakeholders. Hong Kong should be more proactive in bringing the region together with a view to attaining regional sustainability. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

In sequel, the paper presents an application of the conceptually new computer program, based on the symbolic analysis of load flows in power system networks. The network parameters and variables are defined as symbols. The symbolic analyzer which models analytically the power system DC load flows enables the sensitivity analysis of the power system to parameter and variable variations (costs, transfers, injections), a valuable tool for the expansion planning analysis. That virtue could not be found within the conventional approach, relying on compensation methods, precalculated distribution factors, and so on. This novel application sheds some light on the traditional power system network expansion planning method, as well as on its possible application within the system network expansion planning in the new environment assuming the competitive electric power market.</jats:p>",

Water reclamation offers a viable means of providing for the future water needs of the microelectronics industry while reducing demands on the public water system. Water reclamation has great potential for implementation in new and existing factory design, can be accomplished using available technologies, and is cost‐effective when the operational savings from reduced consumption, discharge reduction, and discharge quality requirements are taken into consideration. This article describes the development of a water reclamation plan for a large‐scale production facility and includes system descriptions, diagrams, and flow analyses.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is widely acknowledged that the geography of film exhibition in the urban West has changed significantly as ‘traditional’ town centre and suburban cinemas have been supplemented, and in some cases supplanted, by multiplex cinemas in out-of-town locations. In this paper I explore the reasons for this shift, using case-study data from Leicester (United Kingdom) to explore the forms of sociality played out in different sites of film exhibition. These data suggest that multiplex cinemas are frequented predominantly by consumer groups seeking an ‘exopolitan’ leisure experience that is predictable and riskless. In contrast, it appears there are many who continue to frequent city-centre and suburban cinemas because they prefer the less predictable ambience of ‘urban’ leisure. The coexistence of these different forms of cinemagoing is discussed in relation to unfolding debates about the postmodern city—a city that accommodates consumers' predilection for ‘riskless risks’ by holding different forms of sociality apart. </jats:p>",

This study investigated the effect of the reconstruction techniques and the form of the cross‐section libraries used by the two treatment planning systems on the thermal neutron fluence distributions. Six mono‐directional neutron sources of 0.0253 eV, 1 keV, 5 keV, 10 keV, 100 keV, and 1 MeV were directed onto simple geometric phantoms filled with water. The general‐purpose Monte Carlo radiation transport code MCNP was used as a reference tool in this study. For the examples studied, it is found that the methods used for geometry representation (in MacNCTPlan) and for cross‐section representation (in SERA) were found to impact directly on the accuracy of the calculated results.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author argues that organic-coffee certification enacted under the rubric of transnational certification norms alters the logic and practice of economic management and governance in an Oaxacan (Mexican) peasant producers' union. As the title indicates, these changes are productive of social and economic tensions. An economic and ethnographic analysis of ‘certification labor’ demonstrates (a) that the work of certification is distributed within producer organizations such that village and regional leaders become burdened by significant new responsibilities, and (b) that practical changes—including a new producer logic (‘market-price interdependence’) and village certification-service providers (‘peasant inspectors’ and ‘community technical officers’)—have a significant qualitative impact upon household and village economic governance. In addition, certification (c) affects the operation of statewide producer unions, altering the ways in which these interact both with their member organizations and with certifiers: unions must intervene to aid (regional) member organizations in their efforts to certify, yet also find that certification norms, such as conflict-of-interest provisions, constrain the union's ability to promote producer interests. Thus a qualification to an organic and ethical-products literature that conflates quality certification with the protection of smallholder cultural and economic independence is provided. The author concludes that a rethinking of certification norms, together with efforts to assist producer certification, should be a priority for supporters of sustainable agriculture. </jats:p>",

The results suggest that residential mobility rates differ widely across local housing markets, substantiating the view that residential relocation is intimately intertwined with conditions at the local level. Local housing-market conditions also have different effects on mobility rates for renters and owner-occupiers. The results suggest that variation in residential mobility rates across housing markets can be in part explained by level of urbanization, the tenure structure, the degree of government intervention, and the size of the housing market. Remarkably, these differences in local housing markets cannot be seen to be related to housing-market features only. The results suggest that these differences can also be attributed to the behavior or attitude of households with respect to housing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Since the demise of the ‘cold war’ that pitted Western Europe and the United States against the Soviet Union, the world's attention has been dominated by smaller inter‐state and intra‐state conflicts often centered on ethnic differences but with roots in superpower rivalries. An instructive example of such conflicts exists in Cyprus, which arose during the height of cold war politics and has outlasted both the cold war and many of the disputes that have consumed the majority of the world's attention in recent years. Since the physical division of the island in 1974 into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot zones, communication between ordinary citizens has been cut off, creating a serious obstacle to the development of a citizen peace‐building movement. Beginning in 1994, participatory planning and design methodologies have been applied with several groups of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in a systematic attempt to develop and implement an agenda for citizen peace‐building activities. Using these methodologies the groups developed a heightened mutual understanding of the situation in Cyprus and a stronger sense of teamwork, while carrying out a variety of projects related to citizen peace building. This paper summarizes the activities involved in these efforts, poses a number of research questions about the applications of such methodologies, and draws upon the work in Cyprus to address these questions.

A clustered nationally representative survey was used to collect data on contraceptive use and access to services in each cluster.

In the area of communication assessment, these questions need to include information about how the child communicates, what the child communicates, and how successful the child is in her communicative attempts. The process should be individualized, pragmatically oriented for classroom application, grounded in a basic understanding of communication, culturally relevant, and should include information from a collaborative team of practitioner and parents.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Neighbourhood spatial accessibility (NSA) refers to the ease with which residents of a given neighbourhood can reach amenities. NSA indicators have been used to inform urban policy issues, such as amenity provision and spatial equity. NSA measures are, however, susceptible to numerous methodological problems. We investigate one methodological issue, aggregation error, as it relates to the measurement of NSA. Aggregation error arises when, for the purpose of distance calculations, a single point is used to represent a neighbourhood, which in turn represents an aggregation of spatially distributed individuals. NSA to three types of recreational amenities (playgrounds, community halls, and leisure centres) in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada is used to assess whether aggregation error affects NSA measures. The authors use exploratory spatial data analysis techniques, including local indicators of spatial association, to examine aggregation-error effects on NSA. By integrating finer resolution data into NSA measures, we demonstrate that aggregation error does affect NSA indicators, but that the effect depends on the type of amenity under investigation. Aggregation error is particularly problematic when measuring NSA to amenities that are abundant and have highly localized service areas, such as playgrounds. We recommend that, when analyzing NSA to these types of amenities, researchers integrate finer resolution data to indicate the spatial distribution of individuals within neighbourhoods better, and hence reduce aggregation error. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since their first elections in 1973, the thirty-six metropolitan borough councils in England's six metropolitan counties have been dominated by the Labour Party. In part, this domination reflects the normal exaggerative features of the first-past-the-post electoral system: the largest party in terms of vote share tends to get a diproportionate share of the seats. As well as an exaggeration effect, however, that electoral system is also prone to produce biased outcomes—in that with the same share of the votes cast one party tends to perform much better than the other. This has been the case in the English metropolitan boroughs throughout their existence, with consistent—and often very substantial—pro-Labour biases. As well as indicating the extent of those biases, this paper also decomposes them and shows to what extent Labour's significant electoral advantage there is a function of variations in ward size, turnout, the pattern of voting for the Liberal Democrats, and the efficiency of its own vote distribution relative to that for the Conservatives. </jats:p>",

The water balance model, which makes use of GIS and remote sensing, simulates the average yearly recharge of the aquifer system in relation to the land use changes for average meteorological conditions, to help understand the current situation; the planning model, which makes use of mixed integer programming, simulates the reaction of farmers towards the changes in the present subsidy schemes and helps formulate a proper policy instruments; and finally the evaluation model, which makes use of multicriteria decision analysis to support the evaluation of developed policies and selection of attractive scenarios based on the identified criteria and the preferences/opinion of various decision makers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The fast neutron beam, used for fast neutron therapy in Essen, is produced by the nuclear reaction of a 14 MeV cyclotron—based deuteron beam on a thick beryllium target. The resulting neutron beam has a continuous energy spectrum with a mean and a maximum energy equal to 5.5 and 18 MeV, respectively. The dose delivered to the patient is computed by a treatment planning system (TPS) based on an empirical model, in which the dose components (neutron and photon) are described by analytical functions. In order to improve the dose calculation, and thus to use the fast neutron beam for other applications (e.g., Boron Neutron Capture Enhancement of Fast Neutron Therapy), in this work we aim to develop a new TPS. For this purpose, a model based on pencil beams of mono‐energetic neutrons has been created. The neutron energy ranged from 0.25 MeV up to 17.25 MeV by steps of 0.5 MeV in order to cover the energy range of the Essen facility. The Monte Carlo method was then used to simulate the transport of neutrons within such pencil beams in a homogeneous water phantom. By using Monte Carlo techniques, it is possible to distinguish the energy deposition due to a primary collision in water to that due to scattered neutrons. The energy deposition due to pencil beams of 2.224 MeV photons, coming from hydrogen neutron capture reaction in the phantom or in the collimator, was also determined. In order to complete this work, air filled cylinders have been introduced in the water phantom. It is shown that the resulting depth dose curves for primary neutrons can be easily derived using the homogeneous phantom, and that the description of the effect on scattered neutron dose distribution is more complex. In this work we demonstrate the relevance of Monte Carlo simulations of mono‐energetic neutron pencil beams for purposes of neutron treatment planning. Some additional work is still required to describe a clinical situation (continuous energy neutron spectrum) as well as to experimentally validate the method described here.</jats:p>",

The study reveals also that most of the decisions are system specific, so that they should be evaluated in a quantitative manner through simulation.
