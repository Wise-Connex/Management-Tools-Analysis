In this paper I examine metaphor and analogy as sources for creative ideas and examine the difficulties in instrumentalizing them as methods of planning. By tracing metaphor and analogy to their epistemological roots I show that these difficulties are overcome by using similarity as a framework for thinking about planning. An explicit idea of similarity legitimates the examination of key relationships and opens up issues in planning. The discussion suggests a teleologically driven search for similarities among different fields of inquiry and cautions against over reliance on Newtonian morphological thinking in planning. The argument is exemplified by the war on poverty metaphor in American public policy. </jats:p>",

During the hard times of the 1930s it earned a substantial 30% return on its investment. Its success derived not from conspiracy between Southern Pacific Company and General Motors Corporation to loot lucrative rail markets, as is commonly believed, but by corporate planning that stressed cost control and economies of scope. Because of such economies, achieved through planning, it contributed more to public welfare than small, competitive bus entrepreneurs of the type favored by adherents of deregulation. </jats:p>",

Management reform at the hospital level implies a decentralization of responsibility and power to the departmental level. Along with increased responsibility and power, departments get the message: keep your budgets and keep your output level. This preliminary analysis indicates that departmental budgets can be a way of containing costs in clinical departments. Non‐staff expenditures especially are subjected to reductions. The system still seems to ‘favour’ doctors and nurses, but less than in a system with traditional budgetary institutions</jats:p><jats:p>The behaviour of the top‐management teams shows that the output constraint is not seriously meant. Departments are allowed to reduce capacity, with declining output, with the knowledge of the top‐management team. The declining output makes it easier to departments <jats:italic>ceteris paribus</jats:italic> to keep within their budgets. And that makes it easier for the top‐management team to keep the overall hospital budget</jats:p><jats:p>The obligation to keep the overall hospital budget is thus an important criterion of success in the eyes of the political masters of hospitals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of downtown public space has been increasingly defined by agreements negotiated between the public and private sectors. In the last decades the majority of downtown public space has occurred in the form of urban plazas, built as integral parts of privately owned office and retail complexes. In this paper we document the private production of public open space in the downtown areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco—two cities that have used distinctively different policy approaches in forming public-private partnerships. We examine how the process of public open space creation is affected by the culture of planning and development, and discuss similarities and differences in the imagery and form of plazas in the two cities. It is found that urban plazas are the reflection of a market-driven urbanism. As such they are quite homoge neous in their form despite differences in the planning style and development process encountered in the two California cities. </jats:p>",

The World Health Organization is promoting advanced health centres, or ‘reference centres’, as part of a strategy to develop urban health systems and to reduce primary contact care at hospitals. However, hospital‐based information to assist city health service planning is limited in many countries. This study examined user characteristics, patient flow and prescribing quality at the national referral hospital in Maseru, Lesotho, using simple and replicable methods. The study found that most users were self‐referred and came from the city. The majority of respondents were aware of their local health centre but reported they would normally use the hospital when they were ill. Examination of patient flow showed that, on average, patients spent a total of 3.7 h waiting. Quality of care was compromised by a tendency to over‐prescribe, particularly antibiotics and sedatives</jats:p><jats:p>The study suggests that in Maseru, the perception of ‘overuse’ is due to congestion and that improved patient flow management will reduce the numbers of patients waiting. Quality of care could be strengthened by regular audit of prescribing practices by clinicians in the hospital.</jats:p>",

Technologies and strategies that are expected to have a positive impact on future developments are discussed. Development trends are considered from the perspective of future oil price changes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The information provided in the paper supports the following observations and conclusions: There is likely to be a high level of exploration and development activity in the Norwegian North Sea over the coming decades, but the trend will be clearly toward development of smaller fields supported by existing infrastructure.Commercial conditions for utilization of infrastructure are critical for development decisions and the selection of technology.</jats:p>",

Using contingent valuation techniques, we have measured the benefits and costs of different reliability levels in terms of water users' willingness to pay (WTP) for increases in reliability and in terms of their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation in the form of lower water bills for lower levels of reliability. Three cities in northern Colorado with diverse baseline levels of water supply reliability (Aurora, Boulder, and Longmont) are the study sites. Contrary to our hypothesis that water managers are unjustifiably risk averse, we find that water managers' preferences are consistent with customer WTP (WTA) values associated with the risk of water shortages and the system costs associated with reliability. Water managers in Boulder (high reliability) were willing to consider reductions in the level of system reliability while water managers in Aurora and Longmont (low reliability) favored the status quo or increased reliability. While these attitudes were sometimes contrary to a majority of customers' expressed interests in change, they were shown to be justified by comparison of supply system costs (savings) with aggregate WTP for additional reliability (WTA for less reliability).</jats:p>",

It is argued that substantive specification and the modelling of overdispersion are closely interrelated. Simplified ways of estimating the form of overdispersion—moments methods and pseudo-likelihood—are considered wherever possible. Overdispersion is set within the broader context of correlation effects which relate to migration—correlation across different destinations, between spatially adjacent origins and destinations, and between different time periods. The data used to illustrate the modelling development are drawn from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Longitudinal Study, the decennial Census, and the National Health Service Central Register. </jats:p>",

Last, the conjunction of ‘race’, gender, marital status, and migration is investigated to see whether certain subgroups suffer a treble jeopardy and whether this is exacerbated or alleviated by different gender roles within the Afro-Caribbean and Pakistani populations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How useful is the concept of urban community in modern society? The author considers the arguments of some observers of modernity who view local community as insignificant. Although the economic foundations of such community might well be eroded, definitions of local identity continue to have significance in lived culture and are important in shaping the political views of those who live in traditional working-class neighbourhoods. The history of London's Docklands is examined. The defence of local labour markets and the wish for the community to be viewed as respectable rather than rough, largely account for the residents' desire to mark out the boundaries of locality. The spatial limits of specific communities cannot themselves be objectively deduced from structural forces such as class or ethnic relations. Yet on a subjective level the popular desire to mark out the limits of community can be understood with reference to such forces. From the 1970s the Docklands economic base was destabilised and the foundations of the traditional community was weakened, In Bermondsey, large numbers of new residents took up residence in the 1970s. They were seen by the locals as threatening to undermine an authentic local identity. The conflict between traditional and newer residents was evident in the struggles within the Bermondsey Labour Party branches in the early 1980s, which preceded the endorsement of the ‘newcomer’ Peter Tatchell as the official Labour Party Parliamentary candidate. Tatchell was subsequently attacked by the tabloid press for his sexuality, his appearance, and his ‘trendy’ inner-city radicalism. He was presented as the very antithesis of the authentic Bermondsey worker. This campaign of villification resulted in the defeat of Tatchell in a safe Labour seat in the by-election. This defeat demonstrates how the moral politics of the New Right, which were being given expression by the press, converged with the frustrated respectability of the white working class in the area. </jats:p>",

The three tools were the Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, PULSES Profile, and Physical Self-Maintenance Scale. Using the results from each tool, scored for a simulated patient with a right cerebrovascular accident, as well as medical information about the patient, the jury members were asked to plan a treatment program. The consensus of the jury was that the results from each tool did not provide enough information to help them identify the patient’s specific performance problems or the causes of those problems. Therefore, the three tools were considered to have low clinical utility for planning individualized occupational therapy treatment. For use in planning an individualized treatment program, an activities of daily living assessment tool should provide specific information about which component of a task the patient found difficult or was unable to do and the type and level of assistance required.</jats:p>",

The main fields of concern are: difficulties in the participation of Greek regions in the emerging Mediterranean are of development; retardation of growth in rural areas (as a result of the new CAP) and the increase of intraregional inequalities; and aggravation of the conditions in the fields of land uses and the urban environment (because of the increasing competition between the southern European regions, and between the European cities). </jats:p>",

Canadian policymakers advocate strategic alliances as mechanisms for domestic firms to participate internationally. However, little is known about the implications of these partnerships for small R&amp;D-intensive firms. The role of government in promoting alliances is first considered. Anticipated outcomes of partnerships, along with the actual implications of alliance relationships, are considered in some depth. A series of case studies made it possible to identify factors that affect the benefits, costs, and risks associated with international strategic alliances. Safeguarding technology is a primary consideration because technical capability is at the heart of each firm's competitive advantage. The paper concludes with an overview of the important factors affecting the competitive position of small firms involved in strategic alliances. It is possible to identify issues warranting closer consideration both from corporate executives and from policymakers interested in international involvement through strategic partnerships. </jats:p>",

In the westernmost fault block of the field, the Troll WestOil Province, the oil zone is at its thickest; 22–26 m. The oil in place of this province is estimated at 121x10 6 Sm3.The reservoir contains several highly permeable, unconsolidated sands separated by low permeability micaceous sands. Impermeable calcite cemented horizons with imperfectly known spatial disposition and extensions occur within the high permeability sands. The oil production from Troll may be limited by gas coning, resulting in a limited available drawdown for the well. Since the oil rim is only 22–326 m thick, the drawdown can only be in the range of 1.5 to 2 bar in order to avoid the production of free gas-cap gas. The recoverable oil in the Troll West Oil Province is located in high-quality sands with permeabilities ranging from3000 to 10 000 md, so high liquid rates were expected(Fig. 2). With the combination of limited drawdown and high rates, wellbore friction pressure loss was considered to be of importance [1].The subject has been studied analytically by Dikken [1]. However, implementation of the effect of horizontal well friction in simulators with subsequent application for well planning and design purposes has previously not been reported. Horizontal well friction was given due attention during the planning of a 500 m horizontal well in the Troll field. The well was drilled and completed in late1989, and has been on production since January 10th 1990. The cumulative oil production as of early June1990 was 500 000 Sm [2].</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Troll field covers an area of 700km2 .

This is an especially important phenomenon in small and medium-sized firms. A critical depiction of networking at the interregional and, more especially, the intraregional levels then follows. Detailed accounts are provided of network interactions in the economically strong regions of Baden-Württemherg and Emilia-Romagna, The experiences of regions that have sought to learn from strong regions are explored, the cases of the Basque Country and Wales being highlighted. It is concluded that, although it is unreasonable to expect regional networking policies to enable reconversion regions to reproduce the accomplishments of strong regional economies, it has become normal for such regions to be engaged in a productive learning and adaptation process based on the analysis of key mechanisms of intraorganisational and interorganisational networking. </jats:p>",

Overall, 6% of men and 8% of women aged 65 years or over in 1971 and then in independent households were by 1981 living in a supported private household, slightly higher than the proportion who had moved into institutions. Children predominated among the coresidents of elderly people in supported households. Rates of transition to supported private households were higher in older age-groups, higher among the widowed than the currently or never-married, and, in general, higher for owner-occupiers and private renters than for local authority tenants. Elderly people living in Wales in 1971 were more likely to be in supported households ten years later than their counterparts in England. Transitions to supported households were strongly associated with geographic mobility. Among elderly people aged 75 years or over and in independent households in 1971 over half of those living at a different address in 1981 were by then in supported private households or institutions. LS members who moved from independent to supported private households between 1971 and 1981 had an elevated mortality rate, observed over the period 1981–85. However, the mortality of those who had moved to institutions was even higher, suggesting that in terms of health status the elderly population living with relatives is not equivalent to the institutional population. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an analysis of the way in which the changes in the labour market and in the occupational structure in Europe affect the situation and the role of Third World migrants, The author singles out, first, the main differences between the present migratory waves and the intra-European migrations of the 1960s and 1970s. Not only are the numbers of nationalities and ethnic groups who participate in the new migratory experience greater now than before, but also the destinations are different. At the time of the great intra-European migrations the receiving areas were the most developed European industrial countries: now Spain, Italy, and Greece also attract a large number of migrants from the Third World. </jats:p><jats:p> Intra-European migrations were industrial migrations because manufacturing and building industries were the most important and growing economic activities. While industrial employment increased, the working class and the industrial conflict were the basic factors of those societies. Present-day migrations are postindustrial migrations. Immigrants work mostly in service activities and not infrequently in the informal economy. In any case migrant workers are located in the secondary labour market. The picture is made more complex by the fact that many immigrants are alegal or illegal because of the restrictive immigration policies in European countries. </jats:p><jats:p> The casual character of the migrants' occupations, coupled with the fact that some of them are not settled, but keep migrating within the hosting countries, makes more difficult their union organization. Besides that, the forms of solidarity which are developing now are less and less class based, but are based on ethnic and religious bonds. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data from the Longitudinal Study (LS) of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys are used to examine patterns of regional migration in England and Wales between 1939 and 1971. The source of information on region in 1939 is from a national population register established shortly after the start of the Second World War. Of the 146 444 women and 129 267 men in the LS born before the register was established, 83.5% of the women and 50.1% of the men could be assigned to a region in 1939 and were included in the migration analyses. The effect of the exclusion of a considerable proportion of the study group from the analyses is discussed, as is the effect of wartime evacuation. It is concluded that although these factors may affect the results, they are unlikely to have a substantial impact. Overall, 18% of persons in the analysis moved between region from 1939 to 1971. Migrants tended to be socioeconomically advantaged compared with nonmigrants. Moreover, those moving to regions where the nonmigrants were the most advantaged, were themselves the most advantaged of the migrants. This paper illustrates a new source of data on long-term migration that deserves further exploration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Several countries in Western Europe have experienced a restructuring of local and regional government. In Scandinavia local government has been a cornerstone in the building of the welfare society. In the last couple of years Poland (and other Eastern European countries) has been restructured to reduce the central state and to give more power to the private sector and the local government. It is argued that coordination at the local-government level is important for a relevant economic and political response to local problems. A framework is provided for an understanding of the development of the central and local states at the cost of activities performed earlier by the family and the local community, but also as a support (in service and regulation) to activities of the private sector. </jats:p><jats:p> Second, it is argued that the new EC slogan, ‘a Europe of regions’, has the purpose of strengthening the regional level economically and politically and thereby of dismantling and weakening the national state in order to strengthen the EC. Third, the problems and scope of the Polish local-government reform are illustrated, from vertical control to horizontal coordination. There are difficulties in building powerful local governments at a time when they have nearly no money and are unable to provide the social services which used to be provided through the state firms. There is now a political vacuum for which the upcoming new private sector and the new local governments fight. </jats:p>",

Only 43% of the variation could be accounted for statistically by a simple classification of disciplines into clinical, science, and social science/humanities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Enhancements in shipboard automation offer the prospect of crew size reductions for navigation tasks. This work was concerned with comparing the structure of navigation tasks using paper charts with the same tasks accomplished using an electronic chart display information system (ECDIS). Voyage planning with paper charts is based on drawing specific voyage segments, measuring distances between waypoints, and annotating the chart with voyage specific information. These tasks change substantially with electronic charts, particularly in terms of how the task is accomplished. Similarly, the manual activities of track keeping are reduced, but the need for a continuous record maintains the use of the paper chart. For both navigation tasks, there is less ability to visualize geographic features continuously with electronic charts because of the keyhole effect created by a CRT display. It is concluded that the design of automated navigation aids should be based not only on the informational aspects of task performance, but also the functional means by which navigators carry out their tasks with conventional technologies such as paper charts. </jats:p>",
