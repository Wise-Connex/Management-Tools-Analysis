      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article analyzes the meaning of postmodernism in planning through the in-depth study of the evolution of planning and zoning in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland was selected because of its innovative and highly visible planning tradition, which has weaved through the main historic stages of American planning, and has served as a planning laboratory nationwide. The article investigates whether a postmodern planning transition in Cleveland is detectable and what its key aspects and contradictions are. It concludes that the postmodern shift in Cleveland is notably stronger in planning discourses than in planning policies. In so doing, the article demonstrates a key characteristic of the postmodern shift generally and in terms of planning, more specifically, that postmodernism is still more about a shift in attitudes than in actions. </jats:p>",

The article discusses the theoretical underpinnings of each concept and explores the advantages of a continuum between these terms to help bridge the gap between policy planning and physical design and to move toward a meaningful urban design. The study also examines the application of the proposed constructs of place to a sophomore-planning studio, focusing on the University of Cincinnati campus, which was offered at the School of Planning during the fall quarter of 2002. </jats:p>",

Family planning is a standard component of most antenatal care and maternal–child health programs within which PMTCT programs are offered. Yet PMTCT sites often miss opportunities to provide HIV‐positive clients with family planning counseling. Demand for family planning among HIV‐positive women varies depending on the extent of communities' openness about HIV/AIDS, fertility norms, and knowledge of PMTCT programs. In Kenya and Zambia, no differences were observed in use of contraceptives between HIV‐positive and HIV‐negative women in the study communities, but HIV‐positive women have more affirmative attitudes about condoms and use them significantly more frequently than do their HIV‐negative counterparts. In the Dominican Republic, India, and Thailand, where HIV prevalence is low and sterilization rates are high, HIV‐positive women are offered sterilization, which most women accept. This article draws out the policy implications of these findings and recommends that policies be based on respect for women's right to informed reproductive choice in the context of HIV/AIDS.</jats:p>",

The organizations involved posited that integrating family planning into a resource management and community development project would facilitate male involvement by diffusing information, by referring men and women to services, and by expanding method choice to include the new Standard Days Method through networks established around issues men cared about and were already involved in. This article examines data from a community‐based household survey to assess the impact of the intervention and finds significant changes in contraceptive knowledge, attitudes, and behavior from baseline to endline. Because the differences between baseline and endline are greater than the differences between participants and nonparticipants at endline, the study demonstrates the power of informal networks for spreading information.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The problems of urban sprawl have long been recognized. The classic response to sprawl has been compact settlements of one form or another. Yet the profession’s modern origins stem from responses to overcrowding. Relieving crowding by letting in more light and air led to less compact urban form. This paradox remains unresolved despite recent compact city, smart growth, healthy community, and new urbanist efforts. This article reviews empirical data of whether compact cities are sustainable. Then, after reviewing current debates on sprawl and the compact city, it outlines the intellectual origins of sustainability and analyzes whether its theory supports the compact city hypothesis: compact is more sustainable than sprawl. It concludes that conceiving the city in terms of form is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve the goals ascribed to the compact city. Instead, conceiving the city in terms of process holds more promise in attaining the elusive goal of a sustainable city.</jats:p>",

This article provides a conceptual framework for evaluating the intermediate outcomes of a safe abortion program, including laws and policies, women's care‐seeking behavior, and the quality of, access to, and use of services. The methodological challenges in evaluating these outcomes are described. For each outcome, key indicators for measuring progress in program implementation are offered, along with country examples of successful evaluation approaches. The article concludes with recommendations for improvements in infrastructure, resource availability, and political commitment to support evaluation of safe abortion programs.</jats:p>",

This article shows how four members of a partnership framed a dispute in rural California and examines how they resolved tacit, divergent expectations about communication, decision making, and authority. The dispute prompted a transition from informal to intentional decision making and helped members clarify their expectations of each other. Unclear purposes and practices lead to confusion, but deliberation and a willingness to learn enable partners to gain understanding and work together more effectively. The article concludes with implications for improving working relationships in community-university partnerships and collaborative planning. </jats:p>",

The study uses tract-level data for the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The analysis uses an instrumental-variable approach to correct for the simultaneity of employment and car ownership. Results indicate that transportation mismatch is the more important factor in generating poor labor-market outcomes, particularly for disadvantaged neighborhoods. Areas with relatively more jobs increase female employment rates but not male employment rates. On the other hand, lower car ownership rates significantly decrease the employment ratio and increase the unemployment rate for both sexes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There have been relatively few attempts to construct local housing market models in the United Kingdom—particularly models with an explicit treatment of land supply. In this paper we report the results of a pilot study designed to test the practicability of estimating a system of equations which describe housing market dynamics at the local level. Former district council areas in Central Scotland are used as a proxy for local housing markets within a region, thereby providing a panel dataset. A simple supply — demand system with separate equations for inward and outward household migration is modelled using two-stage least squares. The empirical results are varied, with some equations and coefficients performing more closely in line with prior expectations than others. House price levels are explained largely with reference to household income, socioeconomic status, and past levels of house price growth. Higher price levels and higher deprivation diminish inward migration. There are also suggestions in the results that higher rates of new-build supply partly cause higher inward migration. The rate of outward migration increases with ethnicity and wealth and decreases with deprivation. The empirical performance of the new-build supply equation is poor although the results do yield some interesting insights. House building output generally decreases as the proportion of ‘small’ sites in the land supply increases. There is also evidence that house building output decreases as land supply in neighbouring areas increases. We conclude the paper by outlining further directions for modelling prices, supply, and migration at local housing market level. In particular, the case is made for further work involving the collection of wider and longer panel datasets and for extending the pilot study work beyond Scotland. </jats:p>",

The framework is guided by the General Environmental Code. The Ministerial Committee on the Environment (MCE) coordinates the environmental assessment of plans, policies and programmes prior to approval. However, the framework tends to focus on plans and programmes at the national level with little or no explicit provision for ensuring the assessment of municipal plans, policies and programmes. This paper evaluates the integration of environmental assessment into the municipal planning process and the plan documents. The findings indicate that the implementation of environmental assessment at the municipal planning level is minimal. Inadequate institutional framework and lack of effective environment assessment legislation are the main barriers to the implementation. Overall, the assessment shows that there is the need to improve sustainability planning practice in the Kingdom.</jats:p>",

Limited access to and poor quality of reproductive health services and gender‐related problems comprise the major explanations for these poor indicators. The authors designed an intervention to address some of these issues and implemented it on a quasi‐experimental basis in Bhalwal Tehsil of the Sargodha district of Punjab. The intervention introduced a client‐centered approach to providing reproductive health services, including family planning and infant, child, and maternal health care. The intervention consisted of training health‐care providers based in fixed‐location clinics and in communities. It introduced the concept of SAHR (an acronym for salutation, assessment, help, and reassurance), to inculcate a client‐centered approach to care that acknowledges explicitly and addresses a client's gender and power relations within her family and household. Results of the intervention indicate significant effects on providers' behavior related to SAHR elements. The changes provide demonstrable evidence that the public sector can shift toward client‐centered services in reproductive health care in a challenging setting.</jats:p>",

From 1999 to 2003, three Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) provided services for 784,000 people in four northern states. The program established health committees in 620 villages, recruited and trained 1,850 community health volunteers, and added 232 sites to extend government services. Using three strategies—demand creation, increased access to services, and local capacity building—the NGOs increased contraceptive‐use rates by 78 percent, on average; child immunizations by 67 percent; and antenatal care by 78 percent among the populations served. Community resources—such as local health personnel, community‐supplied clinic sites, and community drug funds—added 40 cents to every dollar provided by donors. This model proved to be a suitable platform upon which to build health‐care service delivery and create behavioral change, and the NGOs quickly found ways to sustain and expand services.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, these activities have received relatively little attention from the research community. The prototype interface has been designed to assist the commander in performing these activities. This interface highlights key elements of the battle plan (i.e., the intended course of events), the battle execution (i.e., the actual course of events as they unfold over time), and the differences between them. </jats:p>",

Linear, cause-and-effect strategic planning does not work well in today's world. Given these uncertainties, how can utilities develop meaningful and useful strategic plans? Faced with these challenges, a group of 18 leading international utilities, assisted through IWA, has developed new ways of strategic planning. This project, sponsored by AwwaRF and conducted by EMA, has created a dynamic and flexible strategic planning framework. A new framework, coupled with many of these utilities' experiences in strategic planning, is the subject of this paper.</jats:p>",

Thus, comprehensible and reliable failure prediction models are required for operational and strategic planning purposes in order to guarantee a sustainable water network development. A lot of research work has been done in this field and the developed failure prediction models can be applied under various circumstances. However, most of the existing models have two major limitations: they consider a static state of the network without taking future developments into account, and they can hardly be applied to networks where only limited data on single pipe level is available. This paper describes a failure prediction model on the network and pipe type level, which is integrated in the KANEW framework for strategic rehabilitation planning. First testing results with this approach are promising.</jats:p>",

The empirical basis refers to biosphere reserves. After clarifying shortly the main concepts used (regional governance, collective goods, place-making, biosphere reserve) and after summarizing the sparse literature on the subject the article discusses the lead question on the basis of the approach of “actor-centred institutionalism” (Scharpf). Linking the concept back to empirical findings we come to the conclusion that Regional governance is principally possible and effective if supported by place-identity of regional actors and promotors to channel the resulting powers into collective actions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Duty drawback refers to a full or partial refund of paid import duties when an imported merchandise is destroyed, exported, or consumed as a raw material to produce an export. Despite their extensive international trading operations, many manufacturers fail to save costs by claiming duty drawbacks. In the United States alone, estimates of unclaimed duty drawbacks range from US$1.5–10 billion per annum. In light of this hefty sum of unclaimed duty drawbacks, it is astounding that only one existing production–distribution model in the literature has attempted to include duty drawback. This article is the first to address this neglect of duty drawback in supply chain research by industry practitioners and academicians. To this end, it introduces the key concepts of duty drawback and explains its importance in the new economic era. Second, it presents a linear programming model incorporating three key regulatory factors—corporate taxes, import duties, and duty drawbacks—for solving a production–distribution problem in the chemical industry. Finally, through illustrative examples, it demonstrates the importance of incorporating duty drawback and other regulatory factors in production–distribution planning models. © 2005 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2006</jats:p>",

Yet it was also in the late 1960s that the federal government was forced to concede its long-standing, yet unofficial, control of regional planning for the Ottawa area to the newly created Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton (RMOC). Accordingly, creation of the RMOC’s first official plan was a contentious process that, in the end, enabled the continuation of postwar suburban development trends while also incorporating a \"transit first\" philosophy granting precedence to public transit over all forms of road construction and widening. The direction taken in its first official plan also enabled the RMOC to demonstrate that it, rather than the federal government, would from then on play the lead in regional planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background : Cryosurgery is the destruction of undesired tissues by freezing, as in prostate cryosurgery, for example. Minimally invasive cryosurgery is currently performed by means of an array of cryoprobes, each in the shape of a long hypodermic needle. The optimal arrangement of the cryoprobes, which is known to have a dramatic effect on the quality of the cryoprocedure, remains an art held by the cryosurgeon, based on the cryosurgeon’s experience and “rules of thumb.” An automated computerized technique for cryosurgery planning is the subject matter of the current paper, in an effort to improve the quality of cryosurgery. Method of Approach: A two-phase optimization method is proposed for this purpose, based on two previous and independent developments by this research team. Phase I is based on a bubble-packing method, previously used as an efficient method for finite element meshing. Phase II is based on a force-field analogy method, which has proven to be robust at the expense of a typically long runtime. Results: As a proof-of-concept, results are demonstrated on a two-dimensional case of a prostate cross section. The major contribution of this study is to affirm that in many instances cryosurgery planning can be performed without extremely expensive simulations of bioheat transfer, achieved in Phase I. Conclusions: This new method of planning has proven to reduce planning runtime from hours to minutes, making automated planning practical in a clinical time frame.</jats:p>",

However, most protected areas have been designed to represent (and in theory protect for perpetuity) specific natural features, species and ecological communities in-situ, and have not taken into account potential shifts in ecosystem distribution and composition that could be induced by global climatic change. This paper provides an overview of the policy and planning implications of climate change for protected areas in Canada, summarizes a portfolio of climate change adaptation options that have been discussed in the conservation literature and by conservation professionals and provides a perspective on what is needed for the conservation community in Canada to move forward on responding to the threat posed by climate change.

The moisture content of soil has become a most important variable, given its great impact on placing structures in Bogota. This is why this work on city zoning aimed at orientating planning and designing civil engineering work has been done according to the percentage of moisture in soil. Information from 43,000 initial samples was used for geostatistical analysis to predict soil moisture content through the whole area.\nFour ranges of depth were used for establishing this variable's correlation with other physical variables. Factors were identified which led to understanding results regarding soil moisture content and its behavior in the area being studied. Areas were found having high percentages of moisture content in soil in the northeast of Bogotá and less moist areas in the soil towards the southeast and the east of Bogotá (Bogota’s eastern heights). Different behavior was found for moisture content at depths greater than 6 meters.</jats:p>"

The author analyses changes in commuting compared with the late Soviet period, and clarifies the compositional differences between commuters and noncommuters. Data analysis is based on anonymous, individual, 2000 Census records, and bivariate and multivariate methods are employed. The major conclusions are that the commuting field of Tallinn enlarged and the intensity of commuting from the suburbs to Tallinn increased in the 1990s. Commuters differ from noncommuters both in Tallinn and in the suburbs in regard to most of the social, demographic, and housing variables studied. People who suburbanised in the 1990s were more likely to be commuters than were people who already lived in the suburbs at the end of the Soviet period; high-unemployment areas did not send more commuters to Tallinn than did low-unemployment areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers have increasingly recognised that communities are not homogeneous social formations but contain great diversity and are meaningful in a variety of material, relational and political ways. This has resulted in the apparently contradictory notion of “community with difference”; that community may be performed even while heterogeneity and disagreement are present. But geographers have yet to address satisfactorily the question of why communities continue to be the subject of fascination and study when attempts at definition have proved so problematic. Following on from Young's critique of community, this paper first engages the work of Nancy and Secomb to consider Nancy's conceptualisation of ‘singularity’ as a way to explain the human construction of—and possible need for—notions of community. In short we address the why community? question. Using a rural Australian case study, we demonstrate that meanings of community reflect many differences. This case also illustrates the role of human singularity in the negotiation of these differences, defining the manner in which individual perspectives of community are articulated as well as underpinning people's responses and struggles when ideas of community are challenged. </jats:p>",

This article argues that (a) when used appropriately, personnel evaluation can become an integral component of school improvement initiatives; (b) evaluations of school-reform (and other educational) programs should focus far more on personnel evaluation systems; and (c) the benefits to rendering greater attention to personnel evaluation include a likely increase in the success of school improvement interventions. </jats:p>",

A scalar objective function and a direct search algorithm were used to produce near real‐time calculation results. The algorithm allows the user to set and vary the total number of plugs for each shot to limit the total beam‐on time. We implemented and tested the algorithm for several multiple‐isocenter Gamma Knife cases. It was found that the use of limited number of plugs significantly lowered the integral dose to the critical structures such as an optical chiasm in pituitary adenoma cases. The main effect of the source blocking is the faster dose falloff in the junction area between the target and the critical structure. In summary, we demonstrated a useful source‐plugging algorithm for improving complex multi‐isocenter Gamma Knife treatment planning cases.</jats:p>",

The detonation of devices at multiple sites and in densely packed, enclosed areas was intended to maximize the number of fatalities and inflict severe injuries on survivors. Indiscriminate outrages such as those perpetrated in London on 7 July are unlikely to be ‘one offs’ and may be repeated in the near future. </jats:p>",

Yet, NPD management is becoming increasingly decentralized, both within the firm and across the supply chain. Hence, planning for NPD uncertainty often results in path‐dependent scenarios cutting across the strategic, tactical, and operational levels of planning. To coordinate this resulting complexity, we propose a stochastic hierarchical product development planning framework with multiple recourses, i. e., corrective actions, to maximize performance across a firm's entire NPD program. We also argue the necessity for a fourth planning level, the infrastructural, that reestablishes norms for market projections, technological forecasts, scheduling, and requirements as latent uncertainty in the environment is continually revealed. An illustration from the automotive industry is presented to demonstrate a deployment of our framework. We additionally discuss the applicability of this framework for managing NPD capabilities over time. </jats:p>",

The efficiency depends, however, on the sampling fractions within each stratum. Our aim is to present a strategy for obtaining an optimized design, i.e. sampling fractions, that makes use of available phase‐one data of an existing case–control study considered as the first‐phase sample when the focus is on estimating a parameter vector. No global optimal design exists and local optimal designs depend on scenarios comprising the true disease model and the association between the phase‐one and phase‐two information. We develop an admissibility test that rejects scenarios inconsistent with the phase‐one data and, for the selected scenarios, determine a minmax D‐ or A‐optimal design that protects against worst‐case scenarios.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Resources are crucial for the technological and economic development of firms in spatial perspective. In this paper we contrast two ways of conceptualizing resources, and argue that a conventional, substantive understanding implies a number of shortcomings which can be overcome through the application of a relational conception of resources. In examining four types of resources—material resources, knowledge, power, and social capital—our argument is that resources are constituted in a relational way in two aspects. First, resources are relational in that their generation, interpretation, and use are contingent. This depends on the particular institutional structures and social relations, as well as on the knowledge contexts and mental models of the agents involved. Second, some types of resources, such as power and social capital, are also relational because they cannot be possessed or controlled by individual agents. They are built and mobilized through day-to-day social practices. Individuals or groups of agents may appropriate the returns, but not the resources themselves. We conclude that a relational concept reflects the contextual and interactive nature of the selection, use, and formation of resources. This offers new insights into the explanation of heterogeneity in firm strategies and trajectories, as well as regional differences in the development of localized industry configurations, such as clusters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Traditionally, for complicated systems, such as a gas turbine power plant, maintenance cost and online availability are two of the most important concerns to the equipment owner. However, in the deregulated electric power market, cost and reliability are not the only concerns. The ultimate goal is to maximize plant profitability, and this requires the evaluation of many different factors, including system performance, the aging and reliability of equipment, maintenance practices, and market dynamics accounting for the price and availability of fuel as well as the generation of revenues in competing markets. Thus, gas turbine power plant planning optimization is a complex problem, and comprehensive operational modeling and optimization methods are required. In this paper, a profit-based power plant outage planning approach is presented that reflects the new challenges posed by deregulation. Specifically, particular attention is paid to modeling power plant aging, performance degradation, reliability deterioration, and, importantly, the energy market dynamics. A multiple time-scale method is developed for coupled short-term, long-term generation scheduling and outage planning for this profit-based outage planning approach. The procedure is implemented for a base load combined cycle power plant with a single gas turbine, with the results demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The unilateral militarism of the George W Bush administration has rekindled interest in imperialism within geography and elsewhere in the social sciences, leading some authors to refer to a new imperialism, or neo-imperialism. This paper critically interrogates the notion that the foreign policy of this administration represents a significant break from past US practices, with the use of concepts from Gramsci and Poulantzas to analyze the class and class-fractional bases of US foreign policy both during and after the Cold War. It is argued that there are certain important continuities in contemporary US imperialism and that there are also differences that owe to the present, post-Cold-War context. It is suggested that if this analysis of continuities is correct then the problems and dangers posed by the “new imperialism” may not be as readily resolvable within a capitalist framework as is suggested by various contemporary commentators. </jats:p>",

The class was composed of junior- and senior-level students who all had access to laptop computers. Pedagogy was an application approach resulting in a sales plan that students peer reviewed and analyzed using retail trade averages. Student assessment measures incorporated portfolio presentation and rubric analysis. Students' and professor's comments were included for further consideration. The result of the students' projects using industry-based sales planning and analysis software was of professional quality, demonstrating strengthened analytical skills. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Community currency originated as a means to empower the economically marginalized. This paper studies the US population of community currency systems using locally printed money. Eighty-two systems are identified that have been attempted in the United States since 1991. Internet searches and contact with system coordinators indicate that only 20.7% of all systems are active. Regions in which they occur are described; more than one quarter are in Pacific states. City-level Census 2000 data are employed in analyses of environmental conduciveness to determine in which types of social environments local currencies emerge and survive within. Social movement theory is engaged to identify general, population-based resources for local movements. Economic marginality and labor-market-independence hypotheses are also formulated and tested. The major findings indicate that cities with local currencies are characterized by populations with lower household incomes, higher poverty rates, higher unemployment rates, and larger self-employment sectors. Evidence is also presented indicating that community currencies tend to survive in places with younger populations, higher educational attainment, fewer married people, and less residential stability. Implications concerning the future of the community currency movement and its ability to empower the marginalized are drawn.</jats:p>",

The DataManager allows the full integration of different kind of data, particularly medical imaging data, both static as CT, SPECT or MRI, or time-varying as fluoroscopy or dynamic MRI, with motion analysis data, but also 3D computer and finite element models of bones, joints and also soft tissues. All the data can be visualized with highly interactive and specialized modalities and can be integrated to offer a complete representation of the patient anatomy. Several algorithms are implemented to allow registration and synchronization of the data. A fully 3D environment is offered to the surgeon to navigate inside the medical imaging dataset. To exemplify the use of the software we document in this paper the data processing used to investigate different specific clinical cases in the field of orthopedic oncology. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large-scale redundancies have been a common feature of the UK industrial landscape in recent years and a changing labour market and institutional context supports the need for ongoing research into this important area. In this paper the authors examine the postredundancy experience of workers who were made redundant from Harland &amp; Wolff in Belfast in 2000 to identify the factors that affected the employability of those workers and to consider some aspects of state intervention. These workers might be regarded as being potentially disadvantaged with high risks of long-term unemployment and so provide a stiff test for policies for successful postredundancy transitions into the new economy with its demands for employability and flexibility. Employability is usually associated with supply-side measures, but the role of labour demand also needs to be explored, and the adjustment process is thus considered against the background of overall labour-market change that has occurred in Northern Ireland in recent years. The authors suggest that state intervention through the provision of job-related training can be a successful response to redundancy but that general skills training is questionable because of low uptake and perceptions of irrelevance. Job-specific training was not sufficient on its own to explain the relatively high rates of reemployment in this case. The presence of a group of engineering employers provided both the conditions for job-related training and then the vacancies for the redundant workers to fill. In debates about employability it is important that the demand-side of the labour market should receive sufficient attention. The authors also suggest that there are wider merits in taking a geographical approach to labour-market policy even if only restricted to the supply side. They suggest that employability should be developed in ways specific to local conditions and groups of workers. The differences in the characteristics of the workers who followed different postredundancy paths led to the conclusion that interventions could be precisely targeted to clearly defined groups of workers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Embedded Audit Modules (EAMs) are a potentially efficient and effective compliance and substantive audit-testing tool. Early examples of EAMs were implemented in proprietary accounting information systems and production systems. Over the last decade, there has been widespread deployment of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems that provide common business process functionality across the enterprise. These application systems are based upon a common foundation provided by large-scale relational database-management systems. No published research addresses the potential for exploiting the perceived benefits of EAMs in an ERP environment. This exploratory paper seeks to partially close this gap in the research literature by assessing the level and nature of support for EAMs by ERP providers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We present five model EAM-use scenarios within a fraud-prevention and detection environment. We provided the scenarios to six representative ERP solution providers, whose products support “small,” “medium,” and “large” scale clients. The providers then assessed how they would implement the scenarios in their ERP solution. Concurrent in-depth interviews with representatives of the ERP providers address the issue of implementing EAMs in ERP solutions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The research revealed limited support for EAMs within the selected ERP systems. Interviews revealed that the limited support for EAMs was primarily a function of lack of demand from the user community. Vendors were consistent in their view that EAMs were technically feasible. These results have a number of implications for both practice and future research. These include a need to understand the barriers to client adoption of EAMs and to build a framework for integrating EAMs into firm risk-management environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Communicative planning initiatives are being increasingly implemented across both the North and South of the globe. Influenced by Habermas’ theory of communicative rationality, this form of planning concentrates upon consensus building between different signified interest groups. The paper explores how communicative planning in the eastern Caribbean country of St Lucia disciplines people's conduct from the perspectives of Foucault's concept of governmentality and Laclau and Mouffe's theorization of hegemony. Linking the latter to an analysis of Massey's non‐bounded conceptualization of the local, it is argued that, as geographers, we may do better to concentrate less upon the deterministic effects of common styles of government and more upon the moments which bring their themes temporarily and spatially into being. In doing so, some initial steps are made toward proposing the concept of space‐time‐politics, drawing upon Wittgenstein's work on ‘aspect‐seeing’. In concluding, I argue that we should not see terms such as ‘consensus’, ‘empowerment’ and ‘the local’ as pre‐existing moral justifications for political action, but instead as the product of relations of space‐time‐politics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many advanced economies have an aging population that relies heavily on government pensions, social security, and privately held investment-based income. In the United States the geography of social security and investment income (collectively called nonearnings income) is uneven. Furthermore, the ways in which migration serves to redistribute such income across space remain unstudied. This paper highlights regions in the United States that are becoming increasingly attractive to nonearnings income through migration. Overall, there is a consistent Rustbelt-to-Sunbelt shift in nonearnings income due to migration. These income shifts, however, are quite distinct between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. Starting in the late 1980s, nonmetropolitan portions of the Rustbelt enjoyed net gains in nonearnings income through migration processes. Therefore, it appears that the migration systems which drew income away from the nonmetropolitan north during the 1970s are now shifting to some degree. Analysis further indicates that migration contributes to greater levels of economic disparity across space. Whereas flows of social security income are highly influenced by the aggregate level of migration, flows of investment income are more influenced by differentials in migrants' per capita income levels. Regions such as the Plains are attracting migrants with relatively low per capita nonearnings income whereas the Rocky Mountain and New England regions are attracting individuals with high per capita income. Destinations such as the Rocky Mountains and New England are likely to enjoy significant economic benefits as new sources of income arrive which are tied to migration, but the Plains region is left with less-well-off populations, which pose significant social and economic problems in such sending regions. As the population in the United States and other advanced economies ages, these processes of nonearnings income migration become increasingly important in shaping local and regional economic conditions. </jats:p>",

They can be used to solve complex planning and management problems. All phases of emergency management (reduction, readiness, response and recovery) can benefit from GIS, including applications related to transportation systems, a critical element in managing effective lifelines in an emergency. This is particularly true immediately before and during a volcanic eruption.&#x0D;\nThe potential for volcanic activity in New Zealand is high, with 10 volcanoes or volcanic centres (Auckland, Bay of Islands, Haroharo, Mayor Island, Ruapehu, Taranaki, Tarawera, Taupo, Tongariro (including Ngauruhoe) and White Island) recognised as active or potentially active. In addition there are many active and potentially active volcanoes along the Kermadec Island chain. There is a great deal of background information on all of these volcanoes, and GIS is currently being used for some aspects of monitoring (e.g. ERS and Envisat radar interferometry for observing deformation prior to eruptions). If an eruption is considered imminent, evacuation may be necessary, and hence transportation systems must be evaluated. Scenarios have been developed for many centres (e.g. Taranaki/Egmont and Bay of Plenty volcanoes), but so far the use of GIS in planning for evacuation is limited.&#x0D;\nThis paper looks at the use of GIS, indicates how it is being used in emergency management, and suggests how it can be used in evacuation planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The maximum width of an intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment field is usually smaller than the conventional maximum collimator opening because of design limitations inherent in some multileaf collimators (MLCs). To increase the effective field width, IMRT fluences can be split and delivered with multiple carriage positions. However, not all treatment‐planning systems and MLCs support this technique, and if they do, the maximum field width in multiple carriage position delivery is still significantly less than the maximum collimator opening. For target volumes with dimensions exceeding the field size limit for multiple carriage position delivery, such as liver tumors or other malignancies in the abdominal cavity, IMRT treatment can be accomplished with multiple isocenters or with an extended treatment distance. To study dosimetric statistics of large field IMRT planning, an elliptical volume was chosen as a target within a cubic phantom centered at a depth of 7.5 cm. Multiple three‐field plans (one AP and two oblique beams with 160° between them to avoid parallel opposed geometry) with constraints designed to give 100% dose to the elliptical target were developed. Plans were designed with a single anterior field with dual carriage positions, or with the anterior field split into two fields with separate isocenters 8 cm apart with the beams being forcibly matched at the isocenter or with a 1 cm, 2 cm, 3 cm, and 4 cm overlap. The oblique beams were planned with a single carriage position in all cases. All beams had a nominal energy of 6 MV. In the dual isocenter plans, jaws were manually fixed and dose constraints remained unaltered. Dosimetric statistics were studied for plans developed for treatment delivery using both dynamic leaf motion (sliding window) and multiple static segments (step and shoot) with the number of segments varying from 5 to 30. All plans were analyzed based on the dose homogeneity in the isocenter plane, 2 cm anterior and 2 cm posterior to it, along with their corresponding dose‐volume histograms (DVHs). All the dual isocenter plans had slight underdosage anterior to the match point and slight overdosage posterior to it, while the dual carriage plan had a nice blending of the dose distribution without the accompanying hot or cold spots. Based on the dose statistics, it was noted that the dual isocenter plans can be clinically acceptable if they have at least a 3‐cm overlap. In the case of step and shoot IMRT, the number of segments used in a dual carriage plan was found to affect the overall plan dosimetric indices.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Proton beams can destroy tumors better than other radiation treatment options because they deliver their energy in a very accurate way, while leaving the surrounding tissue undamaged. However, it requires a very accurate prediction of the Bragg peak position within the patient's body. In existing proton treatment centers, the dose calculations are performed based on x‐ray computed tomography (CT) and the patient is positioned with x‐ray radiographs. During the 1970s and early 1980s, it was shown that the use of proton beams rather than conventional x‐rays could have some advantages. With the development of specialized medical proton gantries at Loma Linda University Medical Center (USA) and several other proton treatment centers worldwide, interest in this question has been renewed. The modern approach has advanced from simple proton film radiography to CT reconstructions from proton energy loss measurements employing individual proton tracking techniques. This permits image degradation due to multiple Coulomb scattering, one of the main problems of proton CT, to be reduced. Current work is devoted to the comparison of conventional x‐ray CT and proton computed tomography (pCT) as two alternative tools for measuring the physical properties of the human body, required for proton treatment planning. In this paper, a brief comparative overview of the physical basics of both methods are followed by the analysis of Monte Carlo simulation results. The first‐generation CT scheme was assumed for simplicity. The precisions relative to water volumetric electron density distributions, extracted from CT and pCT images, and the sources of absolute errors are discussed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the well‐known benefits of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, the poor spatial resolution of PET has limited its use in radiotherapy planning. Methods used for segmenting tumor from normal tissue, such as threshold boundaries using a fraction of the standardized uptake value (SUV), are subject to uncertainties. The issue of respiratory motion in the thorax confounds the problem of accurate target definition. In this work, we evaluate how changing the PET‐defined target volume by varying the threshold value in the segmentation process impacts target and normal lung tissue doses. For each of eight lung cancer patients we retrospectively generated multiple PET‐target volumes; each target volume corresponds to those voxels with intensities above a given threshold level, defined by a percentage of the maximum voxel intensity. PET‐defined targets were compared to those from CT; CT targets comprise a composite volume generated from breath‐hold inhale and exhale datasets; the CT dataset therefore also includes the extents of tumor motion. Treatment plans using Monte Carlo dose calculation were generated for all targets; the dose uniformity was approximately <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20065-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20065:acm20065-math-0001\" /> within the internal target volume (ITV) (formed by a uniform 8‐mm expansion of the composite gross target volume (GTV)). In all cases differences were observed in the generalized equivalent uniform doses (gEUDs) to the targets and in the mean lung doses (MLDs) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCPs) to the normal lung tissues. The magnitudes of the dose differences were found to depend on the target volume, location, and amount of irradiated normal lung tissue, and in many instances were clinically meaningful (greater than a single 2 Gy fraction). For those patients studied, results indicate that accurate dosimetry using PET volumes is highly dependent on accurate target segmentation. Further study with correlation to clinical outcome will be helpful in determining how to apply these various PET and CT volumes in treatment planning, to potentially improve local tumor control and reduce normal tissue toxicities.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.52.Tf</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Radiation therapy for cervical cancer involves a team of specialists, including diagnostic radiologists (DRs), radiation oncologists (ROs), and medical physicists (MPs), to optimize imaging‐based radiation therapy planning. The purpose of the study was to investigate the interobserver variations in tumor delineation on MR images of cervical cancer within the same and among different specialties. Twenty MRI cervical cancer studies were independently reviewed by two DRs, two ROs, and two MPs. For every study, each specialist contoured the tumor regions of interest (ROIs) on T2‐weighted Turbo Spin Echo sagittal images on all slices containing tumor, and the total tumor volume was computed for statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the differences in tumor volume delineation among the observers. A graph of all tumor‐delineated volumes was generated, and differences between the maximum and minimum volumes over all the readers for each patient dataset were computed. Challenges during the evaluation process for tumor delineation were recorded for each specialist. Interobserver variations of delineated tumor volumes were significant <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20106-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20106:acm20106-math-0001\" /> among all observers based on a repeated measures ANOVA, which produced an <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20106-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20106:acm20106-math-0002\" />. The median difference between the maximum delineated volume and minimum delineated volume was 33.5 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> (which can be approximated by a sphere of 4.0 cm diameter) across all 20 patients. Challenges noted for tumor delineation included the following: (1) partial voluming by parametrial fat at the periphery of the uterus; (2) extension of the tumor into parametrial space; (3) similar signal intensity of structures proximal to the tumor such as ovaries, muscles, bladder wall, bowel loops, and pubic symphysis; (4) postradiation changes such as heterogeneity and necrosis; (5) susceptibility artifacts from bowels and vaginal tampons; (6) presence of other pathologies such as atypical myoma; (7) factors that affect pelvic anatomy, including the degree of bladder distension, bowel interposition, uterine malposition, retroversion, and descensus. Our limited study indicates significant interobserver variation in tumor delineation. Despite rapid progress in technology, which has improved the resolution and precision of image acquisition and the delivery of radiotherapy to the millimeter level, such “human” variations (at the centimeter level) may overshadow the gain from technical advancement and impact treatment planning. Strategies of standardization and training in tumor delineation need to be developed.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s):</jats:p>",
