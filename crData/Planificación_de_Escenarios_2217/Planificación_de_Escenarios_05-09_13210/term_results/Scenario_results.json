The objective of the paper is to envision this \"highly sensitive challenge\" as an \" appealing sustainable opportunity\" and thereby balance the scales of ‘environment’ and ‘development’ in this sector.

In the absence such rating systems, the Government, Industry and Conservation organizations shall continue to grapple over a series of bargains over accessibility, funding and conservation options in these areasFormation of \"Merger initiatives\" in India as \"Sustainable Development Partnerships\" under aegis of Ministry with various stakeholders as members</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>These shall Pave way for a consistent policy in dealing with bio diversity management in this sectorEnsure transparent workable relationships between industry/government/public to achieve sustainable equitable sharing of benefits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Power transformers’ failures carry great costs to electric companies. To diminish this problem in four working 40 MVA transformers, the authors have implemented the measurement system of a failure prediction tool, which is the basis of a predictive maintenance infrastructure. The prediction models obtain their inputs from sensors, whose values must be conditioned, sampled and filtered before feeding the forecasting algorithms. Applying Data Warehouse tech- niques, the models have been provided with an abstraction of sensors the authors have called Virtual Cards. By means of these virtual devices, models have access to clean data, both fresh and historic, from the set of sensors they need. Besides, several characteristics of the data flow coming from the Virtual Cards, such as the sample rate or the set of sensors itself, can be dynamically reconfigured. A replication scheme was implemented to allow the distribution of demanding processing tasks and the remote management of the prediction applications.</jats:p>"

The distribution of these basic structures in the parameter space and their geometrical properties constitute a complete homoclinic bifurcation scenario of this system. Furthermore, these structures and the scenario are theoretically demonstrated to be generic to a large class of dynamical systems that presents, as the Chua circuit, Shilnikov homoclinic orbits. We classify the complexity of primary and subsidiary homoclinic orbits by their order given by the number of their returning loops. Our results confirm previous predictions of structures of homoclinic bifurcation curves and extend this study to high order primary orbits. Furthermore, we identify accumulations of bifurcation curves of subsidiary homoclinic orbits into bifurcation curves of both primary and subsidiary orbits.</jats:p>",
