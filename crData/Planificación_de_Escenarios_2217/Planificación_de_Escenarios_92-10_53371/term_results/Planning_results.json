      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a comparison of American planning education and professional practice with the modes of education and practice prevalent in European countries. American planning education, encompassing the world's largest community of planning schools in a single country, can be described as mature, rich, and energetic in production of knowledge, and exhibiting a large variety of formats and approaches that reflect its \"bottom-up\" evolutionary process. It is high on the generic aspects of planning and relatively low on substantive spatial focus. It is also flexible and open-ended in terms of the jobs graduates take, but is lukewarm on professional organization and professional support. This profile is in many ways different from the profile of planning education and the planning profession in other countries The latter part of the paper presents an initial research agenda for planning theorists who may wish to use the challenging lever of cross- national research for boosting our understand ing of planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many universities are engaged in strategic planning. A natural part of that process for a college that contains architecture and planning is the reconsideration of the administrative structure and the respective roles of each within the university. As part of such an exercise, we reevaluated the rationale for locating planning and architecture in the same unit. This paper is a result of that endeavor. We begin by inventorying the current administrative homes of the accredited programs of architecture and planning and then explore both the disciplinary and the administrative reasons for the obvious tensions between the two fields. We conclude that the disciplines have become radically different and continue to reside together only for pragmatic reasons. Finally, we suggest the beginnings of a new common discourse which may be of value to each of the disciplines, their respective professions, and the city which both disciplines profess to serve. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Impact assessment skills are used in a variety of ways in planning practice, reflecting expansion in society's concern with externalities associated with growth and development, improved methods for predicting impacts, and wider acceptance of impact mitigation as a goal of growth management. This article reviews the status of impact assessment in planning pedagogy and describes a new way of teaching this subject. At present, few planning education programs address development impact assessment in a comprehensive way. Instead, most curricula either have courses dedicated to teaching methods related to a few categories of impacts, such as environmental or fiscal, or treat impact assessment in passing in courses that cover broader subjects. Here I argue that a comprehensive impact assessment course can have several advantages, and I present the design of such a course and report on initial classroom experience with it. The course combines instruction on causal relationships between characteristics of the built environ ment and a variety of impacts with the use of computer-based models to give students first- hand experience with predicting impacts and testing alternative mitigation strategies. </jats:p>",

The paper explores the merits of this view by analyzing Common wealth Edison Company's hotly-contested effort to persuade the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC) to approve an innovative rate increase for three large nuclear power plants. The analysis concludes that Edison failed to persuade the ICC and others because the company's story had crucial weaknesses in plot, point of view, and character develop ment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the long-standing discussion of how to best prepare urban planning students to practice effectively in other countries, scholars generally fall into two camps: those that take a general principles approach and those that argue that planning is best taught within a specific context Many argue that North American planning education is irrelevant for practice in other countries, but little empirical evidence has been put forward to test their assertions. A survey of graduates of accredited planning programs working overseas indicates that these practitioners see themselves as successful, and report that their education played a key role in that success. Moreover, they report having less difficulty adapting what they have learned to other contexts than is generally thought. The authors suggest that a key to educating international as well as domestic students is to focus on ways of translating the theoretical and abstract into solutions applicable to real world situations. </jats:p>",

Viewed against the background of racial segregation and inequalities in the South African health system, effective community involvement in health development would be an extension of ongoing democratization in which previously marginalized people in the majority population group are given the opportunity to participate in decisions and programmes affecting their health. This situation calls for sensitivity with respect to the criteria for adopting given models of community involvement and the political correlates of particular health programmes. Also, considerable patience would be required until the belated efforts to produce adequate personnel support for community involvement begins to yield returns, and until the communities experience a level of economic development which can support community health programmes financially.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Between October 1988 and December 1989, the district health management team (DHMT) of Same District, in Tanzania, tested out an action‐based learning strategy to improve its management capability. The initiative was led by the Centre for Educational Development in Health, Arusha, which was seeking alternatives to institutionbased management training, with support from WHO. The strategy involved the DHMT in an iterative process of problem analysis, action research, problem solving and review. The process combined start‐up and review workshops with on‐going work by the DHMT to tackle problems of primary health care (PHC) implementation. The team monitored its own progress in solving its problems. By December 1989, the team could identify a number of achievements, the most striking being the team spirit it had developed, and its ability to tackle a range of minor problems, and some major problems, facing its PHC work.</jats:p><jats:p>Following the encouraging results in Same, the Ministry of Health endorsed the strategy, and secured funds to implement it on a wider scale. A further eight districts were introduced to the process. However, whilst there was enthusiasm for the start‐up workshops, the important follow‐up work necessary from regional level failed to take place in time. Insufficient time was given to preparing facilitators, and effective monitoring was not done. Remedial strategies must now be formulated to bring the process back on course. This article demonstrates the importance of ensuring that certain necessary conditions can be met when introducing action‐based learning, as a key continuing education strategy for improving management at district level.</jats:p>",

The debate has consisted of attacks on centralized land-use regulation from the right, and defenses by liberal reformers. A third, but oft ignored, position in the debate is presented by leftist political economists. Authors working in this tradition emphasize the relative power of class interests in land use politics. They suggest that quiet revolution reforms frequently promote the interests of large-scale industrial capital. Two cases of quiet revolution reform from the northeastern United States, New York's Adirondack Park Authority and Maine's Land Use Regulation Commission, provide an opportunity to assess the leftist critique of the effects of centralized land use reform. </jats:p>",

However, to date, few empirical studies have explored the relationship between decentralization and such projected outcomes.</jats:p><jats:p>In this article we present a conceptual framework for analyzing possible consequences of decentralization on dimensions of quality of primary health care.

Health centres in the Netherlands already bear some resemblance to health maintenance organizations in the USA. However, managed care challenges provider autonomy, and the strategic development of managed care plans may be hampered by providers' perceptions. We draw a distinction between managed care within an insurance arrangement and managed care as a package of methods. Both options are evaluated as suitable for Dutch health centres, though with differences in terms of strategic logic and cultural fit. Lastly, some general conditions are formulated that should be considered before care management processes can be implemented. These include: specify clear objectives for introduction of managed care; strengthen corporate culture; develop internal motivation for change; develop a practice criterion with health centre professionals; reduce workloads in order to provide development time; and, promote better cooperation between general practitioners and specialists.</jats:p>",

Risk assessment allows for evaluation of clean up levels at contaminated sites based on reducing human health risk to acceptable levels while selecting the most cost effective remedial approach. The use of this approach gives consistency to the management of environmental risks and allows the risk manager to allocate resources so that they will have the greatest impact on reducing risk to human health. This paper discusses the risk assessment process and uses two examples to show how it can be applied to solve environmental problems in the oil field.</jats:p>",

The techniques discussed here are traditional engineering modelling techniques that have lately been applied to management2,3,4,5 and petroleum problems,1 and hold promise of broad applicability in drilling management. The specific problem of manpower planning was chosen as a test case for other drilling applications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The concept behind these techniques is to quantify the behavior of the system describing the specific problem at hand. In this way, the consequences of assumptions about a process are explicitly tested. The manpower planning model described here is the result of an iterative process, whereby the model's basic form and predictions were compared with actual results. The scope, purpose, and benefits are described on the following pages. The study showed that System Dynamics techniques are useful tools for planning drilling manpower requirements.</jats:p>",

In line with the wheel, the gravity model commenced as a simple conceptualisation of consumer spatial behaviour, became increasingly sophisticated through time, and thereby created conditions conducive to the reemergence of the basic interaction model. The wheel theory, however, describes but does not explain the processes of change, and the need for a more comprehensive model of the evolution of retailing thought is discussed. </jats:p>",

On paper there remains a series of largely unrealized proposals designed to promote an image symbolic of national identity. Successive federal and municipal agencies worked to various degrees of success to augment Ottawa's appearance and amenity. British planner Thomas Adams' departure from, and the subsequent demise of the Federal Commission of Conservation in the early 1920's marked a low point in efforts to evolve comprehensive planning strategies. The career of Noulan Cauchon, first head of the Ottawa Town Planning Commission, aimed to keep the notion of planning alive in the city. Certain of his little-acknowledged proposals bear remarkable similarity to the pre-W.W. H planning efforts of MacKenzie King and Jacques Greber. Cauchon's legacy endures in proposals which appear to have been incorporated into federal planning activities during the post-war era. </jats:p>",

Many organizations are working in this area and producing novel implementations, but for the general company there is little that is of help in planning for these systems. In order to overcome this deficiency, this article presents a detailed analysis of electronic data interchange (EDI) undertaken by a large number of U.S. companies. The results suggest a model of strategic implementation which illustrates how factors such as the nature of markets and distribution channels, organizational structure and process and buyer power influence the implementation of EDI with suppliers and customers. Five generic EDI strategies have been identified and the impact of market share and IT expertise on these are discussed. Finally, the authors give their views on some of the long–term issues and suggest some possible outcomes.</jats:p>",

This line of research has drawn heavy criticism from reviewers on methodological grounds, and has produced confusing, apparently contradictory results. This article reevaluates the planning‐performance relationship from a resource perspective, arguing that strategic planning does not satisfy the criteria for sustainable competitive advantage– although it may produce economic value, it is easily imitated and may be substitutable. The article suggests that previous studies produced inconsistent results because they did not account for the dissemination of strategic planning over time, or for industry differences in strategic planning factor markets. An empirical test in two industries finds that formal strategic planning and financial performance are unrelated in a ‘planning equilibrium’ industry, but positively related in an industry with strategic planning factor market imperfections.</jats:p>",

It has been widely suggested that any ‘new’ human geography will require ‘new’ textual strategics for representing its subject matter. In what follows I look at one of these suggested ‘new’ textual strategies; one emphasizing the need for multifibred, multivocal texts, a form of composition which, using a term borrowed from the fields of music composition, novel writing, and most recently anthropology's so-called ‘new ethnography’, has been labelled as ‘polyphonic’ in character. I am rather ambivalent about the usefulness of such calls for polyphony in human geography. So in the first part of the paper I trace out what the term has been used to mean in the cultural fields from which it has been borrowed, and, quite deliberately putting aside my rapier-like academic cynicism, I try to highlight and enthuse about some of the possibilities polyphonic practices elsewhere might suggest for human geographers. In the second half of the article I try to think through more critically some putative objections to the calls for and the actuality of polyphonic texts; objections which I think serve to emphasize that newfound sensitivities to textual poetics in no way dissolve the problematic politics of representation, but instead reconfigure them, in this case around power relations of cultural capital. </jats:p>",

These measures often involve the construction of very large and costly facilities, and computer simulation during plan development is essential to cost-effective facility sizing. An effective approach to CSO system modeling focuses on detailed hydraulic simulation of the interceptor sewers in conjunction with continuous simulation of the combined sewer system to characterize CSOs and explore storage-treatment tradeoffs in planning abatement facilities. Recent advances in microcomputer hardware and software have made possible a number of new techniques which facilitate the use of computer models in CSO abatement planning.</jats:p>",

Rural Americans have gone from being the first majority to the last minority, to paraphrase historian John Shover (Shover,1976). All through this time policies directly and indirectly oriented to rural areas and rural people have been enunciated by the federal government. Rarely was the coordination of policy sought or achieved, however. Also, for generations the easy assumption was made that agricultural policy constituted rural policy. Further, a form of rural fundamentalism, closely related to a neo-Jeffersonian social outlook, reinforced a false sense of ‘rugged individualism’ as the essence of personal and collective success. Such gross oversimplifications have tended to mask some of the truly substantive problems of poor housing, race and gender inequities, unemployment, illiteracy, poor health, and malnutrition faced by rural and small town populations.</jats:p>",

Measurement of demographic change in several geographical areas simultaneously is presently not supported by a structured conceptual framework other than the cohort component model. This poses a problem since application of the cohort component model to multitudes of very small populations, such as those in neighbourhoods or census tracts throughout a city, is questionable. Considering the ultimate use of demographic information in urban planning, an alternative reference framework is being proposed along with an application procedure. It is aimed at measuring change between two census dates in four demographic parameters, throughout a conglomerate of subareas. This enables the simultaneous monitoring of demographic change across the conglomerate, listing the subareas by a fuzzy value of change in any of the four parameters. The fuzzy measurement of several demographic parameters compensates for the precision measurement of survivorship, fertility and migration in cohort demography. The degree of fuzziness in the selected parameters, furthermore, allows us to view the record of demographic change in each small area as a fractal relating to the whole city. The degree of fuzziness and the size of small-area populations are related to the fractal dimension of demographic change in the city as a whole. </jats:p>",

First, the individual finds an optimal consumption bundle for each one of the feasible consumption sets that correspond to the locations considered. Second, he or she compares the resulting location-specific optimal utility levels and chooses a location for which the optimal utility level is a maximum. It is imagined that an observer applies costless sampling of the feasible consumption sets involved and records the individual's utility level associated with each trial. As the sample can be arbitrarily large, the asymptotic theory of extremes may be used in order to compute the probability that the consumption bundle associated with the highest overall utility level will correspond to any particular location. The way in which different sampling designs generate different choice probability models either in discrete or in continuous geographical space is explained. The multinomial logit model emerges when perfectly even sampling is applied on a discrete spatial choice set. </jats:p>",

In particular it is suggested that, in focusing on aesthetics, reflexive anthropologists evade rather than resolve questions both of ethics and of epistemology. This contention can be understood in terms of the responsibility of the author/scriptor with reference to the presence of anger in academic prose and to The Satanic Verses controversy. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper questions the manner in which anger routinely disqualifies writing from academic status. In talking theoretically about presentational style, I want to address substantively issues of research ethics. What angers me about ethnographic work generally is that a sustained vogue for reflexivity so commonly casts a crisis of representation in terms of the relation between subject matter and narrative to the cost of consideration of the relation between representation and audience. The smugness of the academy sits comfortably beside ostentatious angst over the academic method. Reflexivity decays into narcissism. What angers me specifically about ethnography in geography is that in the identity crises of everyday rites of credentialism geographers cast themselves as an ‘Other’, pursuing an elusive vogue in social theory, sociology, or, perhaps this week, anthropology. Yet ethnography is neither a passport to a ringside view of the exotic nor a form of methodological avant gardeism. Such issues are discussed here in the context of my own participant observation work with the police; research that was arguably deceitful, unrepresentative, undemocratic, and perhaps indefensible. Reflexively so. </jats:p>",

In this field, a relatively large accumulation of oil (approximately 100 million barrels in-place) is contained within a complex structure of sandstone, carbonate, and sulphur-bearing formations lying directly above a shallow piercement salt dome at depths ranging from 1200 to 1532 feet subsea. The sulphur-bearing formation has the largest sulphur reserves (67 million tons) of any mine in North America and is one of the largest mines in the world. As part of the sulphur mining operation, 240,000 barrels per day of 325 °F water will be injected into the formation. Much of this water will contact and heat up the oil, significantly reducing the oil viscosity and greatly enhancing the ultimate oil recovery. Main Pass 299 is located about 90 miles southeast of New Orleans in 220 feet of water (Figure 1).</jats:p>",

The recent writings of Edward Said are then considered for clues to an adequate position from which to investigate the world. Said's idea of a regime of essentializations, his continued commitment to a humanism which acknowledges its extra-European dimensions, and his call for a closer geographical imagination of homeland and nation together suggest a possible way forward.

The tensions and reorientations in the macrological sphere resonate in social and cultural discourse where feminist theory, poststructuralism, and subaltern studies have called into question the subject positions associated with these relations of power. Rather than making clear that all observers and commentators stand someplace, this ‘sea change’ left many intellectuals adrift, flirting with disabling relativism. Given the projects of representing how others stand and understanding the ground on which they stand, ethnographers have been late to recognize their complicity in masking their own positions as they construct the objects of their inquiry. As intellectuals operating in a postcolonial world, we must take seriously Spivak's admonition about representation as a staging of the world in a political context and begin to connect the ‘micrological textures of power’ with larger political-economic relations. In this expanded field, we can no longer valorize the concrete experience of oppressed peoples while remaining uncritical of our role as intellectuals. Neither can we presume to speak for or about peoples and nations as if they were outside of the contemporary world system, refusing to recognize that our ability to construct them as such is rooted in a larger system of domination. In this paper the author develops these themes by offering a critique of familiar modes and practices of representation and draws on ethnographic research in New York City and rural Sudan to argue that by interrogating the subject positions of ourselves as intellectuals as well as the objects of our inquiry we can excavate a ‘space of betweenness’ wherein the multiple determinations of a decentered world are connected. Appropriating this knowledge we may develop enabling analyses of power and difference to find collective paths toward change. </jats:p>",

The obstacles and robot segments are represented by a set of convex polyhedra. The collision detection is performed at each discretized robot configuration by an efficient procedure devel oped with the computational geometry method, which computes a distance function of the robot segments and the obstacles. By introducing this function for specifying the collision-free con straint, the path-planning problem is formulated as an optimal control problem using the augmented Lagrangian, which may be considered as a combination of the duality, penalty and con straint relaxation methods. The problem is solved by a robust UZAWA-like algorithm, where a subgradient method is applied for the primal optimization, as the distance function is not ev erywhere differentiable. An example is given for the trajectory planning of a robot arm with three revolute joints. </jats:p>",

It is demonstrated how discrete choice experiments and universal logit models may be used to predict a choice sequence. The approach is illustrated for the problem of trip chaining.

This matrix of 260 × 260 flows was used to calibrate a set of Poisson regression models by utilizing flows for the aggregate population. In this paper, the relatively high spatial resolution is used to test for aggregation effects as the original 260 units are combined to form fewer, synthetic regions with larger areas. A series of simulation experiments are performed with three different aggregation algorithms to create 130, 65, and ultimately 10 (corresponding to the provinces) synthetic regions. Average results from the experiments are compared with the original model. Results are obtained that suggest that, in this case, obvious aggregation effects similar to those observed elsewhere (by Openshaw) are not observed. </jats:p>",

In addition, the intention of human operators must be transmitted precisely and easily to the robots. A variety of R&amp;D is underway in order to realize such requirements. This R&amp;D falls into two categories: (1) R&amp;D on intelligent functions applied for the preparation phase of task execution and (2) that applied for the real time task execution. Motion planning based on geometrical information is a typical function for the task preparation phase which has been studied for the past ten years. Thanks to the rapid progress in computing power, the analysis of real problems has progressed and has permitted the practical application of such planning. Thus, its application to operational use is not far off. R&amp;D on a comprehensive system including the geometric environment modeling, motion planning, and real time task execution is also underway. Intelligent functions necessary for task execution must include a task execution mechanism and a control method which guarantee reliable task execution in the presence of unpredictable errors. The solution to this problem will be realized through the implementation of skillful manipulator motions which utilize various sensors and constraints being complied in the real world, most as key technologies. This special issue has compiled reviews and articles which focus on the above mentioned issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When people have trouble finding their way through office settings, there are costs in terms of poor communication, lost efficiency, time, and stress (Brill, et. al., 1984; O'Neill, 1991; Weisman, 1981; Zimring, 1981). To cope with wayfinding problems, facilities managers often have to resort to partial solutions, like complex signage, color coding schemes, and other methods to guide people. AutoNet is an experimental computer-aided design and planning tool that predicts the paths people will take through a building based on the layout of the space and their level of experience. AutoNet represents environmental information by using an artificial ‘neural network’ simulation. The mechanisms of this simulation are based on the physiology of the brain. Knowledge about the layout of the environment is represented through a network of interconnected processing elements, modeled on the behavior of groups of neurons in the brain. Thus it can create its own rules for predicting worker behavior rather than using predetermined sets of rules that a typical expert system would rely on. This system has great flexibility since there are no rules to rewrite for each setting it evaluates. The predictive validity of this simulation was empirically validated (O'Neill, 1991). This software runs within a popular and commonly available CAD software package in an MS-DOS environment. AutoNet is viewed as a “macro-ergonomic” tool to enhance the office work environment (Hedge &amp; Ellis, 1990). </jats:p>",

Alternative versions of these tools have been implemented in the Flight Planning Testbed (FPT), a part-task simulation environment for studying interactions with flight planning tools. This testbed, which runs on a Macintosh IIfx, presents scenarios and records all interaction with the operators. Thirty commercial airline pilots participated in a between-subjects experiment involving three alternative system designs and four flight planning scenarios. The results provide some very interesting insights into planning strategies and the effects of cognitive tools on those strategies. </jats:p>",

One hundred and ten cases were reviewed (8.4% of all inpatients); median age 73 years (range 26–99), 59 female. Fifty‐five percent were medical patients (general or geriatric) and 16% were general surgical. Six remained inpatients after 6 months. Sixteen died, of whom 10 had macrovascular disease. Median length of stay was 22 days (2–300), significantly above the district average in all specialties (&lt; 10 days). Of 15 patients with foot problems, 5 died and 3 had major amputations. Only 23% of all patients had documented evidence of screening for diabetic complications. The discharge diagnoses failed to acknowledge diabetes in 54 cases (including 10 deaths). Only 10% had formal advice from the diabetes team and subsequent audit revealed that metabolic management was commonly suboptimal in non‐physician units. These data suggest that inpatient diabetes is costly and carries a high mortality. The incidence is substantially underestimated by conventional episode statistics. The evidence from this cohort of diabetic inpatients suggests that improved communication and recognition of the importance of diabetes could usefully contribute to the quality of care achieved.</jats:p>",

Data, collected from three genetic centres in England and Wales from August 1986 to July 1990, are used to describe trends in demand for DNA testing, the impact of DNA tests on carrier risk assessment, and the use of DNA tests in relation to pregnancy outcome. Altogether the data include 23 388 subjects and 681 pregnancies in 8738 families divided into five cohorts by year of entry and referral. The most frequent gene disorders referred to the genetic centres are currently being tested or will soon be tested. For these disorders the initial high level of activity has declined and may have reached steady state. Demand for DNA services is high for cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, intermediate for Huntington's disease, and low for adult polycystic kidney disease, phenylketonuria and tuberous sclerosis. Based on these findings we suggest that demand for DNA tests will be high in serious, untreatable and slow progressing conditions with early onset; intermediate for conditions affecting intellect and neurological integrity with later onset; and low for treatable, late‐onset conditions, or those for which there is evidence of heterogeneity, and variable penetrance. It would be helpful to assess the extent to which this view of demand is confirmed when the new disorders being DNA tested are considered and for the pattern of activity of DNA testing for some types of cancer. Since no DNA centre could offer a fully comprehensive testing service, it is recommended that a structure is created to audit overall activity, assist in policy formulation, and influence supraregional service organisation, in order that the spread of DNA services be planned as effectively as possible. This structure would facilitate monitoring of the evolution of contract specifications agreed by commissioners and providers on a regional basis.</jats:p>",

Technical assistance was provided in all phases. Results from the field studies indicated that all of the tested educational interventions had at least some short-term impact. Health talks with waiting maternal and child health (MCH) clients doubled the proportion adopting family planning; a simple educational package for clinic supervisors, along with a day of training, raised the proportion of family planning clients receiving education and referral for voluntary surgical sterilization (VSC) and increased the number of tubal ligations at a referral hospital. Waiting time was reduced. The Division of Family Health of the Ministry of Health has submitted plans to introduce these interventions into several districts of the country in the near future. Full institutionalization of OR requires additional cycles of program activities. </jats:p>",

For nonirrigated production of cotton, nitrogen fertilizer applied during the fall or the spring realizes a significant loss compared with that applied during the growing season. There is no (statistically) significant evidence that more nitrogen fertilizer applied in the fall is unavailable for plant use relative to nitrogen fertilizer applied in the spring for either nonirrigated or irrigated production of cotton. Irrigation practices result in a significant loss of nitrogen fertilizer because of the increased leaching associated with the irrigation process. Irrigation does reduce, however, potential loss of nitrogen fertilizer by increasing its uptake by plants. </jats:p>",

In the configuration graph, each arc represents an angle difference of the manipulator joint; therefore, an arc sequence represents a continuous sequence of robot motions. Thus, the algorithm can execute a continuous sequence of collision-free motions. Furthermore, the algorithm expands the configuration graph only in space which is to be cluttered in the implicit configuration joint-space and which is needed to select a collision-free sequence between the initial and target positions/orientations.
