      "abstract": "<jats:p>Robert Campbell's article \"Will the real scenario please stand up\" comes at an interesting time for me because I have just begun work on a project concerned with HCI issues on the aircraft flight deck and I think I may have come across yet another use of the term 'scenario'. In this domain, the term is used to refer to a detailed and sometimes complex sequences of events. Mission scenarios for example are a detailed specification of a flight plan, a series of aircraft maneuvers and pilot tasks. These can be used to train pilots, or to consider the performance requirements of an aircraft. The term scenario is also used to refer to specific incidents or accidents. So for example, the 'Kegworth Scenario' (Cooper 1990) describes a particular accident that happened to an aircraft in the UK. One of the engines on the aircraft became damaged when a turbofan blade fractured. The pilots, in attempting to contain the fault, shut down one of the engines. What they did not realize at the time was that they had shut down the healthy engine by mistake. Later in the flight they carried out maneuvers for their final approach and the increased load on the damaged engine led it to fail entirely. The pilots were unable to restart the healthy engine they had mistakenly shutdown and the aircraft crashed onto a motorway just short of the runway threshold.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Understanding the role of thin films in porous media is vital if wettability is to be elucidated at the pore level. The type and thickness of films coating pore walls determines reservoir wettability and whether or not reservoir rock can be altered from its initial state of wettability. Pore shape, especially pore wall curvature, is an important factor in determining wetting film thickness. Yet, pore shape and the physics of thin wetting films are generally neglected in models of flow in porous rocks. This paper incorporates thin wetting film forces into a collection of capillary tubes model to describe the geological development of so-called mixed-wettability in reservoir rock. Our model emphasizes the remarkable role of thin films.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>New pore-level fluid configurations arise that are quite unexpected. For example, efficient water displacement of oil (i.e., low residual oil saturation) characteristic of mixed-wettability porous media comes about due to interconnected oil lenses or rivulets which bridge the walls adjacent to a pore corner.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Predicted residual oil saturations are found to be approximately 35 percent less in mixed-wet rock when compared to completely water-wet rock. Calculated capillary pressure curves mimic those of mixed-wet porous media in the primary drainage, imbibition, and secondary drainage modes. Amott-Harvey indices range from −0.18 to 0.36 also in good agreement with experimental values1,2.</jats:p>",
