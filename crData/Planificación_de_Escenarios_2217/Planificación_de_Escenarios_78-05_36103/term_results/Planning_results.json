To us it seems obvious that the greater a firm's commitment to long‐range planning, the greater are its chances for survival and success. Most managers and executives “know” that this is so — they do not have to perform lengthy and costly research on planning to support so obvious a truism. Nonetheless, we did a research study of long‐range planning in the motor freight industry to find out whether long‐range planning is a necessity for every company in the industry. It also asks if there is a boundary condition that differentiates between those companies that must plan continually, plan occasionally, or not engage in long‐range planning at all. If there is such a boundary, what variables go into making it up? Are the variables controllable or uncontrollable? Can a model be devised that incorporates these variables? The answers to these questions can point the industry toward more efficient and effective use of its scarce resources.</jats:p>",

In the feudal period, especially in the 14th to 19th centuries, the art of town planning flourished here, where it was promoted more than in any other country of the region. Unfortunately, this rich legacy has not been studied in any detail. Even plans of most Burmese historical cities have not been professionally drawn and published. In this article, some of the finest examples of Burmese feudal cities-Ava, Toungoo, Pegu, Amarapura, and Mandalay-are described and analyzed for the first time. Several conclusions are drawn from this material: that the square form of city plans was developed independently in Burma, that the traditional cities were regularly planned and well coordinated with the local topography, and that the most effective and progressive building technology was used in city construction.</jats:p>",

In the Public Expenditure White Paper, from December 1972 up to February 1976, there was a single table outlining the possible evolution of the economy over the four-year period which the public expenditure forward estimates cover. In the last two public expenditure white papers, even this single table has been dropped. In the latest paper there is the highly tentative suggestion that gross domestic product might rise at 3½ per cent a year up to 1979-80—but nothing is said about the macro-economic assumptions for later years. There is now no table showing the distribution of resources which might accompany this growth-rate—merely a text reference which says that ‘a rise in the proportion of national income devoted to industrial investment is essential…’</jats:p>",

The first is an aggregate model presenting a demometric revision of the traditional economic-base model. The second model, an enlarged version of the first, is characterized by a breakdown of economic activities into nine major sectors. Both models are fitted to data for the rapidly growing metropolitan area of Tucson, Arizona, USA. They are then used to derive tentative impact and dynamic multipliers which substantiate the role of households as consumers and suppliers of labor in the development of the Tucson Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area (SMSA). The major finding is that, for the same level of resources, the second model yields better policy implications than the modified (and therefore also than the traditional) economic-base model. </jats:p>",

This paper describes an instrument (the Psychoeducational Profile) that provides a comprehensive evaluation of developmental functioning and behavior. The importance of integrating information about the child's unique learning characteristics with measured skill levels is emphasized. Factors involved in programming from assessment data are considered, including the understanding of the child's abilities, selection of realistic goals and methods and anticipation of potential management problems. Two case studies are presented to demonstrate the process of developing a teaching program based on information derived from the PEP. It is concluded that viewing the autistic child as developmentally disabled with specifiable handicaps and determining a starting point for educational goals from a comprehensive assessment can reduce initial uncertainty and confusion and provide a framework for ongoing education. </jats:p>",

The general problem of optimal allocation of production factors in time and space is introduced in order to derive the most satisfactory migration strategy. In describing the regional economy by means of a generalized Cobb–Douglas production function, the general problem is decomposed into two levels. At the first level, optimal allocation of factors in time is solved in an explicit form using the generalized Hoelder inequality. At the second level, a spatial strategy is derived and the principle of spatial allocation of production factors is formulated. By use of the optimal strategies, the simple two-sector model (that is, agriculture and the rest of the economy) is investigated, and the labor surpluses in Polish agriculture and in an agricultural region in Poland are calculated. </jats:p>",

For over a decade, Sjaastad's (1962) basic analysis has been unsurpassed. The more recent paper by David (1974), however, attempts to lay a firm microeconomic and risk-analytic foundation for migration models by using concepts arising from job-search theory. His analysis is still quite limited in its perspective on migration, and the present paper attempts to derive a more satisfactory theoretical view of migration. In particular, the various aspects of job-search theory as it has been applied to macroeconomic theory are reviewed and the relevance of these to migration behaviour are assessed. The paper emphasizes (1) differences between search models concerned with wage dispersion and those concerned with job finding, (2) the information possessed by job seekers about different labour markets, (3) alternative search strategies including voluntary job quitting and the migration of unemployed job seekers, and (4) different measures of job-finding probabilities. Although several theoretical models are presented, the main purpose of the paper is to provide a systematic overview of the issues in model design in this important new area of migration research. </jats:p>",

It is not possible to make more than one or, at the most, two steps per day and a standard one day step drawdown test is extended for several days. The extra cost involved in the extended test must be balanced against the extra accuracy derived from such a test. I have no data to make such an assessment but intuitively I believe that the extra accuracy in transmissibility or well-loss determination will be only a few percent and is unlikely to justify the extra cost.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Mr Connorton's second point is really taking the analysis of step drawdown tests into areas where it is not theoretically applicable.

Before teaching each group, teachers had 90 minutes to “think aloud” and plan the lesson. Teachers’ planning and teaching were recorded and coded. Students completed achievement and attitude measures after the lesson. Results indicated that generally, the greatest proportion of planning statements concerned the subject matter, but substantial differences occurred. Planning differences were related to teachers’ cognitive styles and abilities. Relationships between teacher planning, teacher behavior, and student outcomes also appeared. </jats:p>",

In addition to offering a sales forecast, the model is designed to provide diagnostic information about a new product's strengths and weaknesses. By relating advertising expenditures, price, and perceptions of performance/acceptability of the product to sales, the model indicates how an unsuccessful product can be redesigned or the marketing mix changed to make possible a successful introduction. The model also can be used for new product planning. Given a media plan, price, sampling level, couponing, and some estimate of repeat usage, a pre-test market forecast of year-end sales can be made which allows management to evaluate different marketing plans to see which best meets profit or sales goals. </jats:p>",

One area where more data would be very helpful is to learn the needs and requirements from non-Ph.D.-producing colleges and universities.
