      "abstract": "<jats:p> In September 1973, the Cost of Living Council (CLC) introduced price controls with a view of controlling profit margins of corporations. Under Phase IV-B as the rulings were called, Booth Fisheries was required to monitor profit margins within defined product groups. The size and composition of these groups were at the discretion of Booth Fisheries as long as they had some reasonable basis, but the profit margins of each group for each fiscal quarter was fixed, based on the previous year's margin. </jats:p><jats:p> Initially, the relationship between product group structure and the total gross profit was not apparent. The task as perceived by management was one of merely modifying the Sales reporting system to help monitor and control the margins within existing product groups. However, the operations research group realized that total gross profit could in fact be increased by restructuring the groups. </jats:p><jats:p> The operations research group studied the problem, mathematically formulated it, and developed a unique algorithm to obtain optimum product groups. The suggested groupings had a substantial impact on the earnings performance of the company. The benefits were directly measurable and amounted to an increase of 12% in gross profit over the traditional group structure. The groupings also provided Marketing with the desired price flexibiity in certain products. </jats:p><jats:p> Due to the time constraint imposed by CLC requirements, the entire project was completed in three weeks. </jats:p>",

Die Fruchtbarkeitstudie stiitzt sich auf 2176 verheiratete Frauen im Alter von 15 bis 44 Jahren. Das Charakteristische an den Nomaden ist das niedere Heiratsalter. 80% aller Ehen wurden geschlossen, bevor die Ehepartner 20 Jahre alt waren.

The aim of such analysis is to provide tools for the decisionmaking process in long-range forest planning. A mixed integer linear programming model is developed to maximize discounted revenues from the sale of timber net of road construction and maintenance, timber management, and transport costs. The main complexity of this model, which precludes a straightforward formulation, arises from the need to gain access to an area before it can be managed. Artificial variables and relations are introduced to avoid an unmanageably large number of 0-1 integer variables. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Part 1 of this two-part series was concerned with the description and analysis of elements that transcend diverse urban structures of the ‘service’ type. The conclusions were general and abstract. Beyond this unified realm a more detailed description of urban form requires additional assumptions. The nature of such assumptions defines urban form within the confines of positive or normative analysis. Here the additional assumptions define spatial equilibrium within an ‘open’ city. Special cases of such equilibria have been studied extensively. In contrast part 2 develops the general case of a multicentre multiincome city. The properties of spatial-equilibrium bid-rent functions, their synthesis to a composite land-value surface, as well as the properties of this composite, are analyzed in section 1. The next section examines residential land-use patterns generated in a ‘service’ city. Such patterns turn out to be dramatically different from those of other urban types. Section 3 discusses the complex land-value and density surfaces that unfold over the landscape. Finally, section 4 provides what is probably the only analytically solved example of a spatial-equilibrium model related to a hierarchy of centres and to a continuous distribution of incomes over a continuous space. </jats:p>",

Despite a heavy reliance on ever more sophisticated high-speed digital computers, however, computer capacity for handling such systems has not kept pace with the growing demands for more detailed information. Consequently, it is becoming ever more important to identify those aspects of a system which permit one to deal with parts of it independently from the rest or to treat relationships among particular subsystems as though they were independent of the relationships within those subsystems. These questions are, respectively, those of decomposition and aggregation, and their application toward ‘shrinking’ large-scale population projection models is the focus of this paper. </jats:p>",

Problems faced together in the years 1972 to 1975 in health planning, development, review, and public policy are described. The unusual geographic and working relationship of these agencies makes them, together, a useful prototype of the HSA to examine. </jats:p>",
