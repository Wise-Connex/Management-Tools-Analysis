      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with constructing a comprehensive standard for evaluating regional environmental systems. Because such systems are composed of complex natural, economic, and social systems, conventional engineering and economic methods are virtually ineffective for this purpose. Systems-analysis methods appear suited to providing proper evaluation as well as effective control of environmental systems. But, in applying systems analysis to environmental evaluation, we are faced with the problem of measuring numerically the level of satisfaction of the region's residents. Environmental systems are very large in scale, and the components (attributes) which contribute to quality of life are not only many and various but often conflict with each other. In addition they are not commensurable. Therefore new methodologies for evaluating environmental systems must be developed. In such complex large-scale systems analyses, it is necessary, whatever the method used, to structure objectives by means of decomposition and ordering, and the construction of a preference hierarchy is an effective way to perform this structuring. The utility approach to decision analysis is employed to choose the best solutions under this interactive procedure. However, environmental systems also permit, to some extent, the possibility of mathematical formulation in a more rigorous form. Shadow prices (dual optimal variables) are good criteria for evaluating a constrained system's performance. We provide some devices (1) to utilize dual variables obtained in mathematical programming, (2) to nest them into multiattribute utility functions in a hierarchical system, (3) to articulate value trade-offs, and (4) to clarify priorities among objectives. These four procedures constitute the nested Lagrangian-multiplier method. </jats:p>",

In many instances this perspective is not fully appreciated because the term \"capital budgeting\" has become too associated with the mechanics of DCF economics and yearly, short-term budgeting. In fact, however, the bottom line, key decision of any planning process—short term, operational or long term, strategic—is the determination of which \"projects\" will be funded and pursued to meet the corporation's goals. This is a pursued to meet the corporation's goals. This is a capital budgeting decision; it is the basic part of planning. planning. In order to assist management in this high-level decision-making, capital budgeting models have been proposed for use in the evaluation of various proposed for use in the evaluation of various quantitative criteria. Techniques such as present value economics, risk analysis, \"what if\" financial models, and mathematical programming have been around for some time; unfortunately, their use in capital budgeting and planning activities has not been as widespread as some have predicted.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The purpose of this article is to propose that there is, however, a definite growth trend in the use of capital budgeting models as a major tool in the general planning activity; and that elements of an evolutionary process are apparent. Some points are discussed on the historical growth rate of currently used capital budgeting models and on where this trend might be leading.

Primarily these efforts concentrated on which methods and procedures were the most appropriate for calculating procedures were the most appropriate for calculating economic criteria. In fact, the concentration at this time was so heavy toward \"the mechanics of project evaluation\" that it overlooked many aspects of capital budgeting models as the basis of a more broadly defined planning process. However, at least it was a start, and in retrospect, perhaps a very good start.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>DCF Models</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Considerable work has been generated on DCF economic models. Perhaps the earliest \"modern\" treatment of this subject was in 1930 by Irving Fisher, a noted economist of the time. His writings today still are recognized as laying a large part of the foundation for current capital budgeting models. Another of the classic works in this field was in 1951 by Joel Dean, a management consultant working with several oil companies. He elaborated on Fisher's basic approaches and established a still-used modeling framework for capital rationing.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Many other articles and books too numerous to mention have been written on this subject (for an extensive list, see Swalm; another less comprehensive list is presented in Ref. 4). Most authors were concerned with (1) the relative merits of discounted vs nondiscounted evaluations (payback, ROI), (2) which of the discounted methods (present value, rate of return, etc.) were the most accurate, and (3) the mechanics of computing the ECF indicators.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Several industry surveys of capital budgeting practices reveal that the proliferation of writings practices reveal that the proliferation of writings on DCF economic criteria had a slow but definite effect. Notable among those surveys are those of Istvan, Christy, Williams, Klammer, Davey, and Petty, which all showed the percentage of surveyed Petty, which all showed the percentage of surveyed firms using DCF models. Fig. 1 graphically displays the recent growth in the acceptance of these methods. This acceptance also has been supported by the author's own experience within his company and some knowledge of the corporate procedures in similar companies.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The objective to be achieved in this respect is the minimization of the total costs of both the reserve crews and overnight delays. The two costs are inversely related, i.e., as the number of reserve crews is increased, the likely overnight delays and costs are decreased, but the cost of the crews staying idle increases. A good compromise between the two kinds of costs will be that which produces the minimum total costs. The analytical techniques used are those of conditional probabilities. They take into consideration the type of aircraft, union regulations, cabin crew patterns, and the future flying programme. The paper explains the steps of the analysis of the problem, the various reserve policy options and conclusions. </jats:p><jats:p> The recommendations arising from this paper have been accepted and implemented by management in the financial year 1976/77.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops efficient forward algorithms and planning horizon results for several machine replacement models under an improving technological environment over time. The models are that of cost minimization, profit maximization, and cost minimization with probabilistic breakdowns. The conditions of the improving technological environment are stated in terms of operating costs, incremental profits, and expected operating costs, respectively, for these models. The state of technology can be assumed to improve every period or every so many periods. The conditions are fairly general and are likely to be satisfied by most improving technologies. </jats:p><jats:p> What is shown, specifically, is that there exists a forecast horizon T such mat the optimal replacement decision for the first machine (new or existing) based on the forecast of machine technology until period T remains optimal for any longer (than T) horizon, and for that matter, the infinite horizon problem. In particular, it is possible to decide whether it is optimal to replace an existing machine at the beginning of a period or keep it at least one more period with much less information than the entire future forecast of technology. It should be noted that the forecasts become less precise farther into the future and that requiring an infinite horizon forecast for decision-making would be unrealistic. Because the planning horizon results obtained in this paper free the solution from an arbitrary horizon and ascertain the optimality of the first period decision or the first few periods decisions based on the forecast of technology only up to some finite period T, these results represent a major advance in the machine replacement literature. </jats:p><jats:p> These planning horizon results also enable us to develop a computationally highly efficient forward algorithm for the models under consideration. The algorithm is illustrated with a numerical example. Another important corollary of the planning horizon results is that the optimal number of machine replacements cannot decrease as the length of the horizon (planning period) increases. Planning horizon procedures are shown to be easily extendable to the existing machine case as well as the case when machine lives are constrained within a prespecified finite interval. The paper concludes with various suggestions for future research efforts. </jats:p>",

Well known in the literature are the cumulative-attraction and interceptor-retail-location strategies. To analyze these strategies or forces of firm interdependence, one approach taken has been to describe the spatial pattern of the firms by certain probability models and the nearest-neighbor statistics. However, when studying the spatial association between retail firms from two different chains or between two different types of firms, the familiar Clark and Evans nearest-neighbor statistic no longer applies. What is needed is a method that is capable of measuring the spatial association between two distributions of points. More specifically, the method should determine whether the spatial association between two groups of points is one of aggregation, independence, or avoidance, as a result of the location strategy employed. The nearest-neighbor method developed in this paper for such a task is a modification of that of Clark and Evans. The probability distribution, the mean, and the variance of the nearest-neighbor statistic are derived, and several empirical analyses of the retail-location strategies among convenience-food stores are provided. </jats:p>",

Application of the method in the United States shows that there are centres around which growth is polarised. However, this polarisation is not as straightforward as expected and it is shown that the type of polarisation can vary with time and with the size of centres to which growth is diffused. For example, in recent decades small centres were positively polarised around growth centres whereas large centres were negatively polarised. The latter result is an indication that the use of growth centres may not always be a good regional planning tool. By analysis of the polarisation of growth rates in a system of centres, information is also given on the mechanism of growth diffusion. </jats:p>",

It is demonstrated that the residential location of parents affects the chances of their daughter making a ‘good’ marriage, but only to a minimal degree. The bride's social mobility is a far more important influence. The impact of the residential environment appears to be greater in the case of high-status and low-status parents.

The proposed method uses continuous water quality simulation to develop long term information from which water quality frequency curves can be obtained. This frequency information allows the evaluation of the impact of proposed water quality control plans taking into consideration the variable nature of the water resource. Using treatment costs and other economic indicators of water quality, the frequency information can be used to estimate the cost‐effectiveness and economic efficiency of alternative plans. The method is demonstrated in a semi‐hypothetical environment; real hydrologic and climatic characteristics are assigned to a hypothetical watershed configuration. Alternative management plans are simulated and analyzed for both physical and economic impacts. The advantages of continuous simulation and its use in water quality planning are explored.</jats:p>",

Using the findings from task 2 above, a proposed plan for overall Lake Michigan water use through the year 2010 was also developed. The effects of the proposed regional water supply system on future water levels in the deep aquifer were also discussed.</jats:p>",
