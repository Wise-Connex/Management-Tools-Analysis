Reports on a\nsurvey undertaken into approaches to strategic dimensions in marketing\nplanning among a sample of television manufacturing companies. Finds\nthat while a broad customer orientation does indeed prevail among large,\nmedium and small companies, they are only vaguely conscious of their\nmission or business purpose. Claims that despite this fact, management\nphilosophies and corporate image are strongly supportive to the\ndevelopment of marketing strategies. Finds evidence that shows that\nlarge‐sized companies see more prospects in terms of intensive growth\nstrategies through market penetration in the domestic market, with\nfuture prospects being identified in terms of new product development in\nthe domestic market, rather than in exploring new market development\npossibilities in overseas markets. Small/medium‐sized companies are more\nconcerned with market development through identifying new untapped\nsegments in the domestic market. Concludes that the majority of firms\nbeing small in size, strategic marketing planning as it is being\npractised requires much more consistency between company mission,\nobjectives and stated growth strategies despite the dynamism in the mood\nof the industry itself.</jats:p>",

A conceptual framework is then offered for evaluating the impacts of outside aid on long-term hazard reduction efforts (and by implication, sustainable development). The consistent use of such framework would increase the validity of future studies of aid programs and improve the understanding about the adequacy of different institutional arrangements within the international aid delivery system. </jats:p>",

He founded the Center for Urban Economic Development at the university in 1978 to help communities help themselves through technical assistance and research. He served as Chicago's director of development under Mayors Harold Washington and Eugene Sawyer, and was the chief architect of the city's highly regarded 1984 Chicago Works Together development plan, which emphasized jobs, neighborhoods, and the equitable distribution of resources and opportunities to combat racism and poverty. Mier was a nationally recognized expert on urban economic development and equity planning, and served as a consultant for numerous cities, including Oakland and Los Angeles, California, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. He published several books, the most recent of which was Social Justice and Local Development Policy (Sage Publications 1993). In the years preceding his death, his interests turned to regional antipoverty coalitions and global networking of equity planners. </jats:p>",

The state matrix representation of assembly is configured by considering the inter-relationships of parts and objects involved in the initial and the goal structures. Thanks to this new representation, the planning lgorithm is straightforward and can be easily and efficiently implemented with simple matrix manipulation. Unlike other planning methods, the actions involved in the assembly process are not defined in advance but are generated at planning time. The syntax of actions are designed so that while directly reflecting the semantics of actions, they can be easily manipulated by the planner. Two examples of how to plan an assembly based on this representation are given in the paper.</jats:p>",

The main reason for including pre‐economic measures of performance is the possibility to receive and assimilate so‐called weak signals from the market which cannot be received by traditional economic controlling systems. These early warning indicators prevent marketing management from decision making based on past‐oriented data, the use of which would require the structure of the environment to remain unchanged. Based on this expanded knowledge, marketing strategies can be generated in a much more sound way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>To model ecosystem functioning for landscape design, analysts would like detailed data about each parcel of land in the landscape. Usually, only information of low resolution is available for the entire area, supplemented by detailed information for a sample of the parcels. These sample data, usually obtained through two-phase sampling, provide initial values of important design elements for dynamic, often nonlinear, models of ecosystem functioning. However, to represent the contribution of the nonsampled portions of the landscape to ecosystem functioning, it would be convenient to be able to operate as if the detailed design information were available for each and every parcel in the analysis. Inference procedures to complete the design information for the unsampled parcels have usually followed the techniques of stratified or regression sampling. These procedures have been developed with regard to their efficiency for estimating population means and totals rather than for their utility to model ecosystem functioning and response to intervention. Stratified sampling or regression estimates therefore do not retain the complex relationships between multivariate design attributes. We present a new multivariate inference procedure for use in such circumstances. In place of estimating design attributes element-by-element in a traditional sense for each first-phase observation, the procedure simply chooses the most similar parcel from the set of parcels with detailed examinations to act as its stand-in. The stand-in is chosen on the basis of a similarity measure that summarizes the multivariate relationships between the set of low resolution indicator attributes and the set of detailed design attributes derived from the second-phase sample. Canonical correlation analysis is used to derive a similarity function for this procedure, which we call \"Most Similar Neighbor Inference.\" We compared most similar neighbor estimates for a multivariate forest inventory to estimates from regression, stratified sampling, and a Swedish National Forest Survey method. The indicator attributes were recorded from stand records, maps, and aerial photographs, while the design attributes were stand yield characteristics derived from on-the-ground inventories. The most similar neighbor estimates have prediction errors that are comparable in magnitude to the traditional estimates for easy-to-predict design attributes. Thus, most similar neighbor inference should be expected to perform almost as well as regression in sampling contexts requiring estimates of population means or totals. More importantly, the most similar neighbor procedure more closely reproduces the covariance structure of the design attributes. Preserving the relationships among design attributes is a vital feature when the purpose of the modeling is to evaluate management options. Furthermore, because most similar neighbor is an exact interpolator, estimates derived from it are consistent in a finite population sense. For. Sci. 41(2):337-359.</jats:p>",

Such a KBS would have to evaluate the advantages and limitations of each available technique, given the specificity of a problem, and incorporate the fundamental knowledge derived from failure analysis. The KBS should include topics such as materials vs. defect size and type, probability of failure, and basic reliability information. In order to organise knowledge of materials degradation efficiently, the parameters that control various forms of failure first have to be rationalised in a general framework. This framework and their factors would then constitute a quantitative and easily programmable description of the independent variables controlling the intensity of a failure. This paper describes such a framework which could guide the general selection of NDE for materials failure, with a particular emphasis on corrosion related failures. The framework architecture itself was constructed using an object‐oriented methodology for maximum flexibility, since it was anticipated that the materials parameters could easily be described as multidimensional objects.</jats:p>",

This measure is the overall response rate when the key response is binomially distributed, or the residual variance in each treatment group when the key response is continuous and normally distributed. Since the true value of the measure is unknown, it must be guessed or estimated from previous trials. We describe approaches to determining an appropriate value for it, both before the trial begins and after it has begun, for use in calculating the final sample size. These approaches differ from previously described ‘internal pilot’ methods in not requiring unblinding of the treatment assignments in the trial. They preserve the power and do not affect the type I error rate materially. The approaches can be applied to longitudinal studies where the rate of change over time is the response of interest, and to group sequential trials.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the mid-1970s, Vietnam experienced a period of transition to socialism, before bringing in economic reforms which led to the gradual dismantling of the subsidised system of planning and the opening up of the country to the global capitalist economy. Economic reform and renovation has important implications for the urban areas of Vietnam. The emergence of markets and the abandonment of many restrictions on travel resulted in a freeing up of the urbanisation process during the 1980s and early 1990s. These processes are considered, and the implications for Vietnam's largest urban area, Ho Chi Minh City, are examined. The likely impact of Vietnam's long-term socioeconomic strategy on the urban network in the remainder of the decade is considered.</jats:p>",

It is always such a pleasure to meet someone of like mind. (The meeting seemed particularly poignant in light of the fact that at that time, back in Britain, the National Curriculum was rearing its ugly head.) The work of Lous Heshusius (1982, 1989, 1991, 1992) and Richard Iano (1986, 1989, 1990) has also given me much encouragement.

It is demonstrated that choosing actual joint angles as the generalized rigid coordinates is the key to applying the proposed approach. From the observation of the special structure of the input matrix, the concepts of motion‐induced vibration and inverse dynamics under a specified motion history of the joints are formed naturally. Based on the above concepts, trajectory planning in joint space is proposed by using the optimization technique to determine the motion of joints along a specified path in joint space or work space and for general point‐to‐point motion. The motion for each joint is assumed to be in a class consisting of a fifth‐order polynomial and a finite terms of Fourier series. This parameterization of motion allows the optimal trajectory planning to be formulated as a standard nonlinear programming problem, which avoids the necessity of solving a two‐point‐boundary‐value problem and using dynamic programming. Setting the accelerations to zero at the initial and the final times is used to obtain smoother motion to reduce the spillover energy into unmodeled high‐frequency dynamics. A penalty term on vibration energy contained in the performance index is used to minimize the vibration of the system modeled by lower frequency only. The final simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the advantage for proper trajectory planning. © 2995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

It is still normal practice, for example, to estimate a set of parameters in a model and to assume that the relationships represented by these values apply equally to all locations and in all directions. Recently, however, there have been several applications of Casetti's expansion method that have been focused on measuring anisotropic trends around locations. Here this technique is used to examine possible anisotropy in distance-decay relationships around origins. That is, the authors attempt to answer the question: does the rate of distance decay vary with direction? The conclusions reached in previous research on this topic are only partially supported here. Via US migration data, it is suggested that although there is evidence of directional variation in distance decay around some origins, and this evidence leads to some interesting insights into the mental representation of space by US migrants, it is impossible to identify any overall trend across origins in directional variability. </jats:p>",

Perkell etal., 2948–2961 (1993)]. Previous work has verified the capacity of a computational speech production model called DIVA to explain a wide range of experimental data using a constriction planning space. The current work extends the model to allow formant space planning of vowel movements. The model learns target regions for F1 and F2 for each vowel during a babbling cycle. A mapping between desired formant changes and articulator movements that achieve these changes is also learned. After babbling, the model successfully reaches all vowel targets from any initial vocal tract configuration, even in the presence of constraints such as a blocked jaw, and the resulting synthesized vowels are easily recognizable. Although vowel targets specify only formant ranges with no articulatory information, articulator configurations used by the model to produce vowels are similar to human configurations.

The fatigue limit state is of main concern and is governing the structural dimensions and the amount of resources utilized in inspection of several members and joints. There is a considerable uncertainty related to the parameters determining the fatigue life, and probabilistic analyses have therefore been used extensively in fatigue analysis. The models used both on describing the fatigue driving mechanisms and the deterioration mechanism, however, are always compromises between ability to describe nature and computational applicapability. In a state-of-the-art probabilistic fatigue analysis, major assumptions are made when establishing the crack growth model, such as: 1) the relation between membrane and bending stresses is assumed to be constant for all stress ranges, and one common stress component for the total stress is used to calculate fatigue crack growth. 2) The crack growth is assumed to follow a pattern with a constant relation between crack depth and crack length. This paper investigates the foregoing fundamental assumptions for the fatigue driving mechanism and shows the effect on time to the first inspection based on state-of-the-art probabilistic crack growth analysis for the detail of interest, for a simple but realistic jacket structure.</jats:p>",

The method exploits the phase-plane approach. In the phase-plane, in an iterative procedure, subareas of search are built, called neighborings, which surround the current-best trajectory. In each iteration, in order to find the next-best trajectory, the dynamic programming (pruned to the subarea) is used. The method of minimal neighborhood makes the neighborings as small as possible and therefore speeds up computations maximally. The tests carried out on a model of the IRb-6 ASEA robot have shown that the method of minimal neighborhood is much faster than dynamic programming applied to the whole phase-plane, while preserving the quality of the resulting trajectory.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The role of immigration in national development has returned to the forefront of domestic policy debates in many developed countries. Two common aspects of the domestic policy debate are focused on the consequences of the concentration of immigrant groups within a small number of the largest cities within any national system of cities and the movement of immigrants from smaller urban places and nonurban places to the largest cities over time. Two challenges emerge. The first is to identify the impact of postarrival migration. The second is to understand the processes underlying this redistribution, particularly if public interventions are planned which seek to influence these internal distributions. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, the authors briefly review the findings of an earlier study on the patterns of both regional and metropolitan redistribution of immigrant groups in Canada. Against this back-drop, a hierarchical model of migration for immigrant groups for the period 1981–86 is developed and estimated. The internal redistribution of immigrants through postarrival migration has continued to be focused on metropolitan areas in general and on Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal in particular. The distribution of previous immigrants plays a significant role over and above that of economic circumstances both in retaining immigrants in a particular city and in attracting members of immigrant groups from other cities. </jats:p>",

We assessed the time estimation recall of 51 students with and without emotional handicaps, learning disabilities, and attentional disorders and examined the relationship between time estimation and the self-regulatory skills of planning and organization. Group differences in time estimation recall were documented, but these differences were no longer significant after controlling for IQ. In planning and organization, students who scored higher on time estimation were less likely to use notes and lists for organization. Our findings call into question prior research that has not controlled for group differences in IQ and support the need for a curriculum in which time-estimation skills are taught directly and in a functional manner. </jats:p>",

Lithotypes were denned by detailed study of a near-by outcrop, where photo mosaics were mapped to establish lithotype geometry for the reservoir model. Probe permeameter measurements were taken both at outcrop and in the laboratory to supplement existing core plug data. The key to achieving an optimum well trajectory through the reservoir is appropriate definition of the kv/kh ratio. Lithological data were assimilated to derive characteristics for input to flow simulation models. These models were developed at the single-well scale and reservoir characterizations then 'up-scaled' to full-field reservoir flow models. These studies indicated that lenses of mudstone and calcrete conglomerates have a significant effect on reservoir flow characteristics. Thus, to optimize individual well performance, a trajectory at 85 degrees to 87 degrees would be more effective than a horizontal well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, formal strategic planning methods originally developed for private business have been increasingly adopted by health care institutions, including publicly funded hospitals. Yet, as a technocratic management process, formal planning may seem at first sight to run counter to the natural mode of strategy formation in these organizations where negotiation and mutual adjustment between powerful groups of professionals, managers and government agencies traditionally control decision-making. This article describes an exploratory study aimed at understanding how formal strategic planning has become integrated and adapted into the management practices of a group of 23 Canadian hospitals. The context, processes and impact of planning are first examined over the entire sample of hospitals (descriptive analysis), and an attempt is then made to explain different planning outcomes in terms of a variety of contextual and process design characteristics (comparative analysis). The descriptive analysis shows that in practice formal strategic planning is easily absorbed into the political process: political and symbolic motives often drive the initiation of planning, the processes themselves are highly participative and the resulting plans often reflect the difficulties of obtaining consensus on goals in these complex organizations. The comparative analysis suggests that in general, contextual factors (eg, stimuli behind planning) appear to be more significant than process design factors (eg, extent of participation) in determining outcomes. In conclusion, it is noted that the confrontation between technocratic rationality and professional bureaucracy gives rise to a number of paradoxes that make both the use and the subsequent evaluation of formal strategic planning a difficult task in these organizations. </jats:p>",

The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) is a project that brings together the regulatory decision‐makers of Europe, Japan and the United States of America and the experts from the pharmaceutical industry in the three regions to seek ways to eliminate redundant and duplicative technical requirements among the developed countries for registering new medicinal substances and products. The ICH is developing guidelines or position papers to achieve the goal of harmonizing technical standards in three broad areas, namely, drug efficacy, safety and quality. Within the area of drug safety, this paper will discuss three of the safety topics because of their relevant statistical framework, and because these topics have not, to date, received any attention by the statistical community. The three issues under consideration by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH), are.</jats:p><jats:p>1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Declarations of societal shift, economic transition, and the dawning of a new era have now become commonplace in social science, particularly in the analysis of economic forms. In this paper, three influential accounts of economic change are examined and are found to be overwhelmingly concerned with identifying new orders, paradigms, or modes of accumulation. First, regulation theory is described. Although this perspective is valuable in its focus upon institutional ensembles and interrelations, it lapses all too easily into structuralism; that is, these institutional ensembles can be explained by their structural ‘coupling’ to the mode of production and the mode of regulation. Second, flexible specialization is considered. Here again the explanation of new industrial forms is distinguished from their description by the use of ‘ideal types’. These types define the contours of the new era. Last, networks are also identified as the dominant organizational form of the post-Fordist era. The argument proposed here is that networks are not new and are insufficiently distinct from other forms of organization, yet they do help to focus attention on network analysis. Drawing upon the work of actor-network theorists, such as Callon, Latour, and Law, I argue that networks must be analyzed from within; that is, we should seek to follow network builders as they weave together heterogeneous materials. Thus, explanation emerges only once description has been pursued to the ‘bitter end’. It is from within the processes of economic change that our own accounts must be constructed, and this militates against theatrical declarations of new orders, eras, etc. We must explain by using the descriptions of network construction and not by recourse to some underlying historical logic. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Defining urban morphology in terms of the shape and density of urban land use has hitherto depended upon the informed yet subjective recognition of patterns consistent with spatial theory. In this paper we exploit the potential of urban image analysis from remotely sensed data to detect, then measure, various elements of urban form and its land use, thus providing a basis for consistent definition and thence comparison. First, we introduce methods for classifying urban areas and individual land uses from remotely sensed images by using conventional maximum likelihood discriminators which utilize the spectral densities associated with different elements of the image. As a benchmark to our classifications, we use smoothed UK Population Census data. From the analysis we then extract various definitions of the urban area and its distinct land uses which we represent in terms of binary surfaces arrayed on fine grids with resolutions of approximately 20 m and 30 m. These images form surfaces which reveal both the shape of land use and its density in terms of the amount of urban space filled, and these provide the data for subsequent density analysis. This analysis is based upon fractal theory in which densities of occupancy at different distances from fixed points are modeled by means of power functions. We illustrate this for land use in Bristol, England, extracted from Landsat TM-5 and SPOT HRV images and dimensioned from population census data for 1981 and 1991. We provide for the first time, not only fractal measurements of the density of different land uses but measures of the temporal change in these densities. </jats:p>",

There is a move now among international lending institutions and several governments to sanction private ownership and distribution of power. This paper proposes that revised rural energy policies should include official encouragement for isolated village-scale energy schemes. On the basis of relevant experience in Nepal, certain infrastructural supports are recommended to underpin widespread uptake of such schemes. A major constraint currently in many countries is the lack of a methodology for planning and managing schemes at the village level. A methodology is needed for three reasons: to reduce costs, to promote local financial commitment and responsibility, and to provide a common frame of reference linking the local management/planning body to agencies distributing subsidies, to banks providing loans and to national professional advisory bodies. On the basis of experience with pilot projects in Sri Lanka, some proposals are made here as to the content of such a methodology. </jats:p>",
