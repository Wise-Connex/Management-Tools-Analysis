Building on that differentiation, this research found that those individuals who possess a greater external orientation are the most likely to be committed to planning.

A hindcasting scenario exercise conducted with over 60 oil spill experts is described. The exercise identifies the critical success factors that must be achieved and the problems that must be resolved in order to accomplish a successful oil spill response. The experts' ratings of the relative criticality and difficulty in achieving the critical success factors and solving the critical problems are presented and discussed. The use of influence‐diagramming techniques to structure the results of the hindcasting exercise is described. Experts may use this model to assess the response readiness of their area of responsibility, to identify critical problems or to assess the status of an emergency response.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper an argument is developed in support of the relevance of social theory for the region. Characterized by bridging across conceptual and methodological divides, by the increasing prominence of the role of space, context, and human agency, social theory exhibits an affinity with the regional development theory of the Regional Planning Association of America (RPAA) in the 1920s. This paper provides a brief account of the RPAA's approach to regional synthesis. The author aims to build upon insights offered by social theories in dealing with multifaceted regional development phenomena, identifying areas of overlap with the approach of the RPAA. The paper is concluded with a brief discussion of regional policy implications and the practice of social theory. </jats:p>",

The simulation considers two couples, one middle aged, the other elderly. Two 16x16 matrices, one for each couple, are used to record and compare the results of every simulation. That comparative data, in conjunction with the coefficient of variation based efficient frontier, contain usefull information for couples who, consistent with their levels of risk, desire to maximize the net present value of assets pass to their heirs.The efficient frontier is shown to be a function of three fators: assumptions, ages of the estate owners, and the discount rates of the heirs. Because of the instability shown in the eficient frontier, estate planners and estate owners must carefully examine not only the estate plans whichfall on the efficient frontier but also those estate plans which fall just off that frontier.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The method is based on an analytical representation of the boundaries of configuration space obstacles (CSOB), obtained by modeling the contacts between manipulator links and obstacle as higher kinematic pairs. The contact conditions and manipulator kinematics are expressed in terms of homogeneous transformations, providing analytic relations between the joint angles and the contact variables. The set of joint angles associated with permissible contact variables forms the boundary of the CSOB. Using these analytical relations, the free space is efficiently divided into free-cells. Each contiguous set of free-cells is then represented by a connected graph that is of polynomial complexity in the number of geometric features of the obstacles and links. The shortest collision-free path on the graph is found using a best-first search. Examples are presented which demonstrate the method for a two link planar manipulator.</jats:p>",

The focus of this paper is in fixturing of complex parts.

I argue for the centrality of images to the construction of femininity. Through a case study of contemporary representations of the family and traditionalism in advertising, I illustrate how advertisers exploit tensions in femininity, and in turn mediate and negotiate these tensions. Alongside the economic and cultural shifts associated with post-Fordism, a reorganization of gender relations is taking place. A ‘new traditionalism’ in advertising, as one of a number of significant female consumer identities, is an attempt to redefine women's roles in line with a nostalgic discourse of familialism and a return to the private sphere of the home. Space and place are central to the definition of the ‘new traditionalist’ woman. </jats:p>",

By the 1930s the destruction of ‘authenticity’ and the process of transformation were already apparent to some. Tourism expanded and diversified. In the 1970s world travellers, and later ‘surfies’, contributed to the distinctiveness of Kuta, a way station on the Asian overland trail. Kuta grew, drew vibrant commerce, package tours, and a new youth scene, displacing world travellers to the periphery—the ‘interior’ or ‘up country’—in search of elusive authenticity. Tourism became introspective, as the gaze of mass tourists and chic tourists focused on hotels, resorts, and each other; international, as world consumer goods displaced local products; and youthful, with the emergence of specialised package holidays, centred on action and consumption. Resort cycles were grafted onto each other in an unwieldy social and geographical synthesis, as Bali, increasingly diverse yet inconspicuous, became ‘whatever you want it to be’. </jats:p>",

Although a variety of theoretical frameworks acknowledged this development there have been very few empirical studies in which the nature and extent of this collaborative integration and the implications for industries in the 1990s have been examined. In this paper, the Canadian pharmaceutical industry is used as the empirical context for an examination of collaboration. The author focuses on the relationship between small and large firms, biotechnology-based companies, and university research and argues that these collaborative linkages need to be more firmly developed in our theoretical discussions if we are to make sense of the corporate world in the 1990s. </jats:p>",

In this paper, it is suggested that this inadequacy can be traced to the commitment of post-Fordist writers to periodizing capitalist development as a way of defining the philosophy of capitalism. Both these tasks are pursued with, at best, a limited awareness of postmodern critiques of the modernist project. After a critique of post-Fordist methodologies, an alternative for understanding industrial restructuring is outlined by means of a case study. Recently, in Victoria, a southern state of Australia, a bitter industrial dispute has ensued concerning various attempts at restructuring. It is argued that the role of language is crucial in defining communities of interest and in defining social norms. The economic circumstances of this case indicate that they are not an automatic determinant of industrial restructuring. </jats:p>",

Such responsibility has not yet been adequately addressed in academic work, although associated concepts of environmental concern, values, and behaviour have been studied in the last two decades. The author therefore looks at the role of environmental responsibility in public environmentalism and particularly at how this notion is articulated by individuals involved in a range of pro-environmental behaviours. Environmental responsibility is shown to be most significant where an individual believes in the efficacy of their pro-environmental behaviour and where the self is perceived to be a responsible agent compared with other social agents. The translation of this environmental responsibility into consistent behaviour proves to be complex and dependent upon the individual's social context as well as upon organised environmentalism. </jats:p>",

It is an unusual case of strong indigenous growth with limited foreign ownership. The sector produces a quarter of all UK sales of open-market printed circuit boards (PCBs) and employs 1800 people, 50% more than a decade ago. Its growth is explained in terms of four key interrelated factors: the special nature of PCB production, local demand conditions, the sector's organisational structure, and government support. The sector is best conceptualised as part of a wider division of labour within the regional electronics industry rather than as a distinct, closely connected cluster. Contemporary pressures promoting the sector's restructuring are discussed in the conclusion. A more active policy response may be required to secure the sector's future. Closer cooperation between the firms may also be important in overcoming present fragmentation. </jats:p>",

Emphasis was placed upon correlation of multiplane images and the pathoanatomy of the gross specimen. Surgical resections achieving wide margins can be curative. Magnetic resonance imaging of lumbosacral chordomas has revolutionized the preoperative anatomic localization of these tumors. Therefore, it is critical that the operating surgeon scrutinize the three‐dimensional location of the tumor and its spatial relationship to surrounding structures prior to surgical eradication. A systematic approach for the radiographic analysis of tumor extent in lumbosacral chordomas is presented. Four strategic areas of preoperative analysis are identified for sacral chordomas and two for lumbar neoplasms. Functional outcome after resection is predicted by Stener's work. Contamination‐free surgery is facilitated by accurate preoperative radiographic interpretation of the pathoanatomy by the surgeon. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

The approach is designed to improve the effectiveness of the high-level planning processes for information systems (IS). A five-phase framework is proposed. The first phase, the perception phase, aims to provide the managers with an environment that enables them to recognize the strategic value of IS and that activates them to participate in strategy formulation. The second phase, the evaluation phase, involves the evaluation of the organization's systems. The third phase, the selection phase, is focused on analysing the data collected from previous phases in order to select feasible projects. The fourth phase, the construction phase, is responsible for producing a set of preliminary IS plans. The fifth phase, the review phase, aims to ensure that ISP effectiveness is further enhanced by ongoing adjustments to the plans. The paper includes brief comments on the initial application of the framework in the Mingchi Institute of Technology. </jats:p>",

The ‘traditions’ of towns and villages are viewed as recent ‘inventions’ created by corporate planners; they are attempts to validate the establishment of residential communities through ambiguous, yet familiar, historical symbols. Yet the identities constructed for neotraditional towns and urban villages make sense only in relation to the ‘other’. In southern Orange County, corporate planners present their master-planned communities as ‘distant’ from the suburbs and cities located in Los Angeles and in northern Orange County according to a scale of temporal, geographic, and social values. Implicit to neotraditionalism is a geography of otherness. This geography reinforces existing social and spatial divisions, promotes reactionary and exclusionary territorial identities, and legitimizes the status quo. </jats:p>",

In other words, destination marketing creates an image of place to be experienced by specific social subjects in particular ways. This is demonstrated through analysis of a series of advertising texts produced by the Hawaii Visitors Bureau and sponsored by the State of Hawai'i in the period 1972–92. The analysis suggests that the ‘target audience’ has changed during this period along with the projected experience of a Hawaiian vacation, but that the theme of alterity, together with its tropes of paradise, marginality, liminality, femininity, and aloha remain persistent elements of the spatializing discourse. These tropes, and their contradictory components, are analyzed, and it is concluded that, in the advertising discourse, Hawai'i as a place and people is mystified into a signifier of alterity. </jats:p>",

The role of information systems in community development remains relatively less well explored.

The proposal for ‘electronic village halls’—community IT resource centres—in East Manchester is examined for clues on emerging best practice for such community IT initiatives. It is concluded that current policies which concentrate resources into a few centres are antithetical to the spirit of information network formation, and create barriers to future development in information flows. In addition, policies to develop information networks in the community should be grounded in the interest groups in the urban system. This requires closer coordination between grass-root needs and the agencies which initiate development projects. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reliability of measurements made in spiral lower jaw tomograms of patients examined with the Scanora® technique. Six observers measured the distance between the alveolar crest and the mandibular canal in spiral tomographic images taken on 40 consecutive patients before implant surgery. In one randomly chosen image from each patient, the observers marked the measuring points at the two locations. The measurements were repeated 2 months later. Three of the observers, all radiologists. excluded in total 11 sets of images considered to improve if retaken. Analysis of variance showed an average standard deviation between observers of 1.67 mm. This was mainly due to the intraobserver variation, 1.07 mm. The variation between plots was significantly larger at the alveolar crest. Confidence intervals showed that reliability improves with multiple readings, either made independently by one observer or separately by several. The inter‐ and intraobserver variation decreased to 1.42 mm and 0.86 mm, respectively. without the images of inferior quality. Compared with a similar study based on hypocycloidal images, the variability was less due to the intraobserver variation and was affected positively by an optimized image quality.</jats:p>",

The KSA's were then identified as either selection or training criteria (critical for the development of selection tests or training programs). The feasibility of establishing career paths between the secretarial/clerical jobs (source jobs) and the managerial/administrative jobs (target jobs) was evaluated by comparing the selection and training criteria of the source job to the critical (important) knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs) of the target jobs. It was found that when the critical KSAs for the managerial/administrative positions were rated using job analysis techniques, they significantly correlated with the content identified as part of the secretarial/clerical jobs. Sixty-eight percent (68%) of the KSAs identified as important for performance in the managerial/administrative jobs were also identified as important for the performance in the secretarial/clerical jobs. Further, 81% of the target jobs' KSAs not found to be source job selection criteria were found to be source job training criteria. The implications are that job analysis methodology can be used to identify possible career paths, and that career paths can be established between secretarial/clerical jobs and entry level administrative/managerial jobs. </jats:p>",

In general, we appear to be spending more on emergencies, yet have not been able to mitigate them as well as we could a decade ago. Chemical plant emergencies appear to be increasing at least at a high linear rate and, possibly, exponentially. These trends will create major problems for the insurance industry over the next few years. It is also possible to forecast major disasters by such trend analysis. Based on additional research in the growing field of disaster statistics, appropriate levels of funding may need to be established for carrying out successful strategies against emergencies.</jats:p>",

Five alternative criteria (no control, aggregate and uniform standards, low and zero nitrogen-input systems) are specified for examination. These are assessed and compared by using a linear programming model. Conventional environmental standards are seen as more cost-effective than low and zero input systems. It appears that various approaches can be consistent with sustainability objectives and are relevant to environmental management problems.

Planning, especially regional planning, represents an area of traditional policy neglect in Queensland, explained in part by the division of powers such that local authorities, rather than the state, have the major responsibility for land‐use development and physical services. Local government jurisdiction in planning poses a challenge for the state government in how best to strategically manage <jats:italic>regional</jats:italic> growth, while at the same time respecting local authority autonomy in planning decision‐making.</jats:p><jats:p>Over the last three years, the Goss government has undertaken both administrative reforms and a comprehensive and innovative planning exercise to shape urban development in south‐east Queensland, the area of greatest population density and growth. In particular, it has adopted a model of corporate government as a framework for the planning process. The corporate model promotes a “whole of government” approach to strategic planning, emphasising efficient and effective outcomes for clients. The model's client orientation has elevated and formalised the role of community input in decision‐making, and provided a process for negotiation between the players in planning policy development. In an intergovernmental environment, consultation with local authorities is important but the managerialist aspects of corporate government are likely to encourage central control of the planning policy agenda. Both are necessary for improved urban outcomes, yet it remains to be seen how these potentially conflicting processes can be reconciled in practice.</jats:p>",

Resulting extreme levels of social disintegration and community disruption, in turn, have greatly intensified a nexus of interrelated pathological behaviors and conditions leading to more rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), production of multiple-drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis, and rising rates of many other contagious diseases which recent evolutionary theory suggests may become increasingly virulent. The standard model of the geographic spread of disease, when coupled with long-standing observations on the patterns of contact between central cities and their suburbs, suggests that the economically segregated outlying suburban townships, local suburban minority enclaves, and the collapsing inner-city neighborhoods in fact constitute a single, linked, geographically extended disease ecosystem. We find that even at the earliest stages of a contagious epidemic originating from an inner city epicenter, the rate of suburban infection will be directly proportional to the number of those already infected within the city, as modulated by the spatial ‘commuting field’ between city and suburb. Extension of this view to the patchwork system of suburban minority enclaves embedded within more affluent townships suggests that the political abandonment of minority populations in any context will significantly increase rates of serious disease within affluent suburban communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract:</jats:bold> Arthropods, the most diverse component of terrestrial ecosystems, occupy a tremendous variety of functional niches and microhabitats across a wide array of spatial and temporal scales. We propose that conservation biologists should take advantage of terrestrial arthropod diversity as a rich data source for conservation planning and management. For reserve selection and design, documentation of the microgeography of selected arthropod taxa can delineate distinct biogeographic zones, areas of endemism, community types, and centers of evolutionary radiation to improve the spatial resolution of conservation planning. For management of natural areas, monitoring of terrestrial arthropod indicators can provide early warnings of ecological changes, and can be used to assay the effects of further fragmentation on natural areas that no longer support vertebrate indicator species. Many arthropod indicators respond to environmental changes more rapidly than do vertebrate indicators, which may exhibit population responses that do not become evident until too late for proactive management. Not all arthropod taxa are equally effective as indicators for conservation planning, and the qualities of indicators can differ for purposes of inventory versus monitoring. Assemblages of arthropod taxa used as biogeographic probes in inventories should exhibit relatively high species diversity, high endemism, and encompass the geographic range of interest. For monitoring purposes, indicator assemblages should exhibit varying sensitivity to environmental perturbations and a diversity of life‐history and ecological preferences.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the past five years, Britain and France have introduced new policy initiatives with the purpose of tackling the problems of urban regeneration in a comprehensive and strategic fashion. City Challenge and the Contrat de Ville were announced as major policy departures in each country, and the respective governments launched them with the intention of achieving early results. Superficially, there is much in common between the two, and the purpose of this paper is to make a comparison of their stated intentions and of the process by which the two initiatives have been developed. In addition to secondary sources, the text of City Challenge bids for Barnsley and Kirklees and of Contrats de Ville for Dunkerque are drawn upon. It is argued that the two initiatives differ insofar as they are geared to the specific administrative and political circumstances of the two countries. There are, moreover, some distinct differences of scale. That apart, some significant similarities in the approaches emerge. Both, for example, lay emphasis upon partnership to achieve stated objectives. Both give a key role to local authorities. Both involve the integration of existing policies and programmes. Both raise the question of whether they are quite the major departure in policy that the two governments have claimed. </jats:p>",
