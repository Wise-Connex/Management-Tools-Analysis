      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses advance planning and how it facilitates the financing of new construction from current revenues, and results in a material savings in the cost of water service. Advance planning for construction and financing reduces the necessity for bond elections, which may cause consumer agitation. The money necessary to finance the growth of public water supplies must come from water revenue, whether directly or indirectly. Adequate revenue is, therefore, a prerequisite to good water service. In general, city councils, which fix water rates for most U.S. cities, have authorized rates that permitted greater expansion than privately owned utilities can afford, many of which are under unrealistic regulation. Publicly owned utilities have doubled their per capita debt in the last decade, whereas the privately owned utilities have kept their per capita debt almost constant. More than half the cost of plant additions in municipal water plants was funded by debt.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The records that most utilities keep on supply and treatment facilities are, when properly interpreted, usually adequate for planning purposes. In the long‐range planning of supply and treatment facilities, the most useful records are those that show the historical trend in demand. The average annual day, the maximum day, and maximum hour for about 20 years should be known. Records of hourly pumpage and consumption for several maximum days each year should be studied and summarized. Sufficient record data should be studied annually to develop daily‐demand curves for maximum days and maximum weeks. The weekly‐demand curves should sometimes be developed for filtration rates, low‐service pumping, high‐service pumping, and high‐service consumption. In order to anticipate what improvements will be necessary in the supply facilities of any given utility, reliable information must be available on separate plant elements. This includes information on the overall hydraulic limitations of the plant and each of its elements, the safe rated capacity of all basins and filter units, the delivery, under present and future head conditions, of all low‐ and high‐service pumps, operating both individually and in various combinations (including the largest unit out of service), and the capacity of all basin equipment and chemical handling and feeding equipment. In short, sufficient data must be available to insure that the weakest link in the plant chain can be strengthened before any break actually develops.</jats:p>",
