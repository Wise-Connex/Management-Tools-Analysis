Both the sociological and philosophical assumptions of planning warrant thorough examination. This article argues the case for the systematic examination of the philosophy of planning by examining two areas where philosophical analysis might help to elucidate, and critically examine, philosophical assumptions made in planning thought and practice. These are the areas of ethics and epistemology. Prior to this examination, philosophy is itself defined, and the relationship between ethical and epistemological judgments is discussed with respect to the logical distinction that can be made between facts and values. </jats:p>",

The 1980s will serve as a further test of the ability of corporate executives to successfully generate, develop and market new products and services within the context of a changing complex environment.

The model is applied to the specific case of a suburban region of the Tōkyō Metropolitan Region. The results show that the higher-order objective of environmental quality regulates the spatial allocation of disposal-of-residuals activities, and the lower-order objective of economic cost determines the form of intraregional population distribution. </jats:p>",

At the same time, we found that current and potential members of corporate planning staffs needed similar information in order to better guide their careers and activities. The 1979 survey was conducted to meet the needs of both management and staff. This survey up‐dates selected data included in our 1979 report and provides new data about additional aspects of the planning process to help meet a continuing need for current information.</jats:p>",

Strategy is more than products, markets and finance - the crucial role of people is gaining increasing recognition. The key aspects of strategy formulation are discussed: corporate objectives and culture, analysis of internal strengths and weaknesses, opportunities and threats in the environment, identification of potential future strategies and matching these with the company, leading to the choice of a strategy. Manpower planning elements are vital in all these steps: identification of the organization's culture and objectives, preparation of a human capability inventory, and the provision of the human resources needed to implement the strategy chosen, as well as the key areas of organizational design, reward systems, management development and leadership.Die noue onderlinge afhanklikheid tussen ondernemingstrategie en mannekragbeplanning in die formulering en implementering van strategiese planne vir 'n gesonde, lewensvatbare organisasie word bespreek. Strategie is meer as produkte, markte en finansiering - die bepalende rol van mense geniet toenemende erkenning. Die sleutelaspekte van strategieformulering word bespreek: ondernemingsdoelwitte en -kultuur, ontleding van interne sterktes en swakhede, geleenthede en bedreigings in die omgewing, identifisering van potensiele toekomstige strategiee en die verenigbaarheid daarvan met die maatskappy, wat lei tot die keuse van 'n strategie. Elemente van mannekragbeplanning is krities in al hierdie stappe: identifisering van die organisasie se kultuur en doelwitte, voorbereiding van 'n inventaris van menslike bekwaamhede, en die verskaffing van die menslike hulpbronne wat nodig is om die gekose strategie te implementeer, asook die sleutelareas van organisasie-ontwerp, beloningstelsels, bestuursontwikkeling en leierskap.</jats:p>"

Le deuxième, inspiré par les urbanistes Thomas Adams et Horace Seymour, a abouti à l'adoption du premier règlement de zonage urbain au Canada. On a pu reconstituer les étapes de ces plans d'aménagement, grâce aux données recueillies dans les archives des conseils municipaux et des chambres de commerce, ainsi que dans les quotidiens de l'époque. L'auteur s'est intéressé surtout aux façons dont l'urbanisme a été perçu sur le plan local, sur son importance dans la politique municipale, et sur l'interaction entre les urbanistes venus de l'extérieur et la communauté: rôle de personnalités importantes et de la presse dans l'orientation de l'opinion publique, réticence des conseils municipaux à contrarier l'électorat, soupçons constants quant aux motifs des tenants de l'urbanisme. Cette étude individuelle illustre aussi la façon dont les concepts d'aménagement, comme ceux de tous les autres aspects de la réforme urbaine, se sont diffusés des grandes métropoles jusque dans les villes de moindre importance, ainsi que la transition entre des visions idéalistes de \"la belle ville\" et un urbanisme économiquement plus acceptable et politiquement plus réaliste. </jats:p>",

An assessment is made of the effects of aggregation on the results of a planning model for West Africa. The assessment uses a detailed hydroeconomic simulation model to study the solution set of the planning model when it has been applied to several representative subareas. Comparisons are made between the design reliability intended for the supply system and the actual reliabilities of sources as estimated by the detailed simulation model. Comparisons are also made between the system suggested by the planning model and the estimated least cost reliable system. (The least cost reliable system was found using a trial and error search method and the detailed simulation model.) It was found that the aggregation assumptions primarily affect the modeling of sources that depend directly on the highly variable precipitation (e.g., ephemeral aquifers). These sources should, in general, be excluded from the planning model and analyzed separately. Overall, unless a planner is particularly interested in studying the use of such unreliable sources, the spatial and temporal aggregation assumptions of the planning model do not hinder its use as an effective regional planning tool.</jats:p>",

Spatial variations in turnout are explained in terms of an alienation and a duty model, with the former being the more important from a politicogeographical perspective.

The model can be viewed as an integration of substantive (producing–causal) submodels with a structural–formal (distributive) submodel. The integration is based on the dual roles of two endogenous variables both as normalizing factors and as explanatory factors. The last role is justified by the factors' representation of relative (inverse) mean cost of interaction.

This method, combining an ecosystematic approach and a new subunit planning procedure, was applied to the Koprino River watershed on Vancouver Island.Following an analysis, forest ecosystems were classified according to the taxonomy proposed by Krajina and his students. Eighteen associations, divided into 26 types, were recognized in the watershed. These biogeocoenotic taxa were integrated for practical application into fourteen treatment units which were subsequently mapped at the scale of 1:20 000. Each treatment unit was designated by a numerical symbol and a selected color to convey ecosystem productivity and sensitivity. For resource planning a resource management map at the scale 1:20 000 was prepared using the treatment unit map as a base. To guide forest harvesting, the watershed was subdivided into seven resource management areas, each with a specific combination of resource values and management prescriptions. </jats:p>",

Only the rate of population change is found to discriminate strongly between the groups, whereas most of the other variables contribute little to the discriminant function. Overall the groups are found to be not very distinct with strong indications that several areas are not appropriately classified. Doubts are therefore raised about the validity of the classification produced by the government. </jats:p>",

Models are developed to indicate the optimal storage of reservoir water, the transfer of water to the producing regions, and the spillage of water from the reservoir, if needed. A deterministic programming model was first formulated to represent the existing situation. A chance‐constrained model then was constructed to evaluate potential violations of the deterministic model. Both models were quantified for the command area. Data were collected from surveys of the area and from government agencies. Both the deterministic and change‐constrained models suggest a more intensive cropping program in the region. Both emphasize more dependence on rabi and less on kharif crops. The chance‐constrained especially suggests use of more water in the rabi season. Important chances in cropping programs and labor use take place under the chance‐constrained model.</jats:p>",
