      "abstract": "<jats:p>The spacecraft’s lifetime is often limited by reliability and redundancy of its components. Furthermore, serious restrictions on duration of spacecraft operations are posed by finite amount of fuel or cooling agent. It is also clear that once a satellite is launched, it is extremely difficult to replace/modify its hardware on the orbit. Future spacecraft missions, especially huge planetary orbiters, will require servicing support from autonomous unmanned satellites. In this paper we introduce and analyze a new scenario for interception of a free rotating satellite ion a Keplerian orbit. The scenario is divided into several stages to be executed by the servicing satellite: attitude determination of the target object; own motion planning; determination of the optimal target position and orientation before docking; controlled approach, i.e., decreasing of a range between satellites; orbiting of the servicing satellite around the target satellite; docking, i.e., radial degreasing of the intersatellite range till the satellites contact, while keeping constant the relative orienta- tion between them. The control algorithm for the servicing satellite motion during its maneuvers is described. Finally, a few examples of satellite motion simulations according to the proposed scenario are presented.</jats:p>"

Analysis of the current climate simulations in terms of the Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) shows noticeable regional differences in the type of precipitation which are in agreement with known precipitation climatologies. For future climate we observe an overall decrease of mean precipitation in most of the Mediterranean regions. A rise in high monthly precipitation amounts appear for all the regions, except for the Iberian peninsula and the Alps. As our analysis embed both spatial and temporal uncertainties in the modeling, our results provide further evidence of a variety of regional patterns within Europe under an increased greenhouse emissions scenario.</jats:p>",

The influence of both the hydrological models and the meteorological inputs driving these models on climate scenario simulation studies are investigated. A regression‐based statistical tool (SDSM) is used to downscale the daily precipitation and temperature data based on climate predictors derived from the Canadian global climate model (CGCM1), and two types of hydrological model, namely the physically based watershed model WatFlood and the lumped‐conceptual modelling system HBV‐96, are used to simulate the flow regimes in the major rivers of the Saguenay watershed in Quebec. The models are validated with meteorological inputs from both the historical records and the statistically downscaled outputs. Although the two hydrological models demonstrated satisfactory performances in simulating stream flows in most of the rivers when provided with historic precipitation and temperature records, both performed less well and responded differently when provided with downscaled precipitation and temperature data. By demonstrating the problems in accurately simulating river flows based on downscaled data for the current climate, we discuss the difficulties associated with downscaling and hydrological models used in estimating the possible hydrological impact of climate change scenarios.

In this paper, we consider the role that this phenomenon, known as behavioral confirmation, plays in shaping the social perceptions of perceivers, targets, and outside observers. As well, we address the value of laboratory research on behavioral confirmation for understanding the dynamics and outcomes of social interactions in naturally occurring settings. Building on these considerations, we then examine the role of behavioral confirmation phenomena in shaping intergroup relations, with particular reference to delineating conditions in which such phenomena serve to preserve these relations. Based on this analysis, we suggest that dyadic confirmation phenomena are likely to occur in naturally occurring settings and may contribute to the maintenance and perpetuation of social stereotypes and societal structures.</jats:p>",

Questionnaires were distributed to 224 male students, who were asked to imagine that they had committed a “burglary under the influence of alcohol.” They were asked to express their thoughts, feelings, and possible actions, both before and after reading a newspaper article about the offense. A multidimensional scaling procedure identified 4 response themes: guilt, fear, forensic awareness, and pride. Two persuasion variables (inducing guilt and a hidden message) were found to have a multifaceted influence on the 4 themes. Implications for police use of the media as well as limitations of the study are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract </jats:bold> Predator assemblages are complex systems in which asynchrony in the dynamics of resources and consumers, and the idiosyncratic perception of environmental conditions by the predators may obscure the detection of expected patterns. We disentangle the specific effects of these variables on the guild structure of a vertebrate predatory assemblage in a semiarid ecosystem of western South America. Over 16 years, this system faced dramatic fluctuations in prey availability associated with four El Niño events. After controlling for other sources of variation, we tested if increased resource availability is associated with higher niche overlaps, as expected from the lean/fat scenario. We determined the existence of two trophic guilds of predators (specialized mammal‐eaters and omnivorous species with emphasis on arthropods) and found that they responded to increased productivity both at the guild and whole assemblage levels. However, the population response of arthropod prey (almost simultaneous) and of different small mammal prey (delayed by 1 or 2 years) to productivity imposed a degree of asynchrony in prey availability and in the response of predators. This resulted in the between‐guilds exchange of predator species depending on mammal prey scarcity or abundance. As a consequence, the observed pattern was an apparent lack of response at the assemblage level. Despite differences in the perception of prey levels by predators, we conclude that each one of them responded accordingly to theoretical predictions following a simple rule: if prey resources are not limiting, predators behave opportunistically converging over the most abundant resources, thus increasing niche overlap; if prey shortages occur, predators specialize on those prey resources that they gather most efficiently, thus lowering niche overlap; if resources become even scarcer, all predators converge again upon the few prey resources still available, thus increasing overlap – out of necessity.</jats:p>",

Twenty‐eight days cured solid blocks prepared as a premix of 3% by weight of the water extended polyester (WEP) and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) past having 40% by weight water were subjected to static immersion in three type of leachants, namely tap, sea, ground water. Weight changes, compressive strength variations, porosity, water absorption, and some other physical properties of the solid PCC waste forms were evaluated during 260 days of the static immersion. X‐ray diffraction (XRD), infrared analysis (IR), and electron scanning microscope were performed for the waste forms at the end of immersion prolonged period to follow the internal changes in the solid waste forms that may occur due to the corrosion action of the different leachants. The results obtained from the different measurements confirm the performance of the PCC solidified waste form, based on the mentioned formulation, as an acceptable matrix in the various disposal sites and for extended disposal time even at the worst flooding environment. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> No or slow reflow following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), despite the presence of a patent epicardial vessel, is a serious complication resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. In the present study, we have evaluated the combination therapy of adenosine and sodium nitroprusside administered as sequential intracoronary (IC) boluses on no-reflow during PCI. Seventy-five high risk acute coronary syndrome patients who underwent PCI with evidence of initial less than TIMI (thrombolysis in myocardial infarction) III flow or developed deterioration in TIMI flow during the procedure were randomized to prophylactic administration of multiple boluses of IC saline solution, adenosine (12 µg/bolus) or the combination of adenosine (12 µg/bolus) and sodium nitroprusside (50 µg/bolus), sequentially. Assessment of TIMI and the TMP (tissue myocardial perfusion) grade was done and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were assessed at the end of 6 months. Slow or no-reflow was persistent in 70% patients receiving saline solution, 31% patients receiving adenosine, and 4% patient receiving the combination. IC injection with saline solution did not produce improvement in TIMI flow or TMP grade. IC injection with combination resulted in greater improvement of TIMI flow and TMP grade. The crossover of patients with no-reflow in saline solution group or adenosine with combination treatment was associated with reestablishment of TIMI II in 4 and TIMI III in 20 patients. Our data suggest that combination therapy of adenosine and nitroprusside is safe and provides better improvement in coronary flow and MACE as compared with IC adenosine alone in cases of impaired flow during coronary interventions. </jats:p>",
