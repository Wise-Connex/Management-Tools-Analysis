Theoretical approaches in the field of design have, however, remained fragmentary, often concentrating on only one or two aspects of space (such as visual quality or functional requirements) and excluding others (such as social, cultural and political aspects of space). Within the fields of planning theory, geography and urban sociology, on the other hand, there is much more theorizing which, however, often remains too abstract to offer any real guidance to spatial practitioners. This article will work out a new theoretical approach to urban space informed by modal logic. In short, urban space is considered in terms of possibilities, that is, the activities that are opened up for the human agent and the possibilities of change, as well as the elements of trust and fear that will be perceived and conceived. </jats:p>",

By comparing two cases of community planning in Seattle, Washington, and Matsudo, Japan, this article examines the role of informal processes in overcoming institutional and social barriers and negotiating differences of identities, values, and interests. The article argues that, through animated interactions, building of trust, experiential learning, and spontaneity, informal activities and processes can serve as important vehicles for creating meanings, social relationships, and collective actions and enable planners to navigate the cultural and political terrain of community differences.</jats:p>",

Adopting this viewpoint allows for the comparison of what rational planning theory keeps apart: theories about plan-making that focus on the representation of urban development (e.g. Lew Hopkins) and theories that study the intentional features of deliberative planning processes (e.g. Judith Innes). Analysis demonstrates that the seemingly incompatible viewpoints can offer complementary insights about plan-making without diminishing or distorting important differences. There need be no epistemic or theoretical gap separating the representation and intention of plan-making; no big difference between substance and process. The differences are practical. </jats:p>",

To evaluate the nature of teaching on these issues, we conducted a survey of accredited planning degree programs. Results suggest that among accredited planning education degree programs, there is significant room for improvement in quality and quantity of teaching about voluntary land conservation. Recommendations include making some currently elective courses required and introducing more varied and participatory teaching methods in current and new courses that cover these topic areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Rail transit investments have been widely supported by the local planning agencies and government financing resources for their perceived environmental and social benefits, as well as the compact development patterns rail corridors support. Despite the widespread expectations, the sustainability of rail transit projects is often found questionable, as are the actual benefits rail investments can bring about in practice. One of the reasons for rail investments' tendency to perform less well than expected has been identified as a prevailing bias of local officials toward high-capital rail transit investments that are underwritten by the transit financing mechanism (Johnston et al., 1988; Kain, 1990; Pickrell, 1992; Richmond, 1999; Flyvbjerg et al., 2003, 2004, 2005). This article examines the funding mechanism problem underlying the rail transit project selection bias and hypothesizes this problem to be a principal–agent problem. Incentive theory is introduced as an analytical tool to model the problem, to better understand the nature and causes of the problem, and to suggest solutions to it. By applying incentive theory to analyze the project development process of the US New Starts program, it is suggested that the funding mechanism problem associated with the bias toward capital-intensive rail investments can be viewed as a principal–agent problem between the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) (the principal) and local project sponsors (the agent). The incentive approach proposed in this article provides insights for analyzing the relation between central government and local agencies in the planning and decision-making process of rail transit investment, and for addressing political problems, primarily rent-seeking behaviors, associated with central government earmark funding. </jats:p>",

CA analysts believe we settle differences in research findings and interpretations by studying the consequences these differences produce instead of claiming philosophical trump. In the first part of this article, I summarize and critique the argument that CA theory is unrealistic explaining of how CA analysts care more about relevant consequences than causal certainty. In the second part of the article, taking some conceptual advice from social theorist Jurgen Habermas, I show how CA analysis can combine structural and intentional concepts to revise and integrate the apparent antagonism between comprehensiveness and compromise for planning practice. I conclude that a pragmatic CA provides a useful and critical theory for planning practice that remains open to future challenge and debate. </jats:p>",

Results indicate that a substantial proportion of couples disagree about who makes household decisions, but the determinants of women's autonomy are still largely similar according to both spouses' reports. The assessment of the effects of two important sources of autonomy—women's education and employment—differs significantly between spouses, however. When spouses agree that the wife is autonomous, the association between her autonomy and her use of health‐care services is found to be substantially stronger than when spouses disagree about her autonomy. This finding suggests that the association between women's autonomy and health‐care‐service use may be underestimated when only women's reports are considered.</jats:p>",

Mobilizing and decision making were associated with performance in the cases we examined. Our results suggest that participation form as well as community influence are important. The hypothesis that increased participation enhances performance is an oversimplification for condominial sewers. </jats:p>",

Data from a health facilities survey and a health professionals survey from 2002 are analyzed to develop estimates of postabortion hospitalizations and of the abortion rate, abortion ratio, and unwanted pregnancy rate. We estimate that 890,000 induced abortions are performed annually in Pakistan, and estimate an annual abortion rate of 29 per 1,000 women aged 15–49. The abortion rate is found to be higher in provinces where contraceptive use is lower and where unwanted childbearing is higher. The unwanted pregnancy rate is estimated at 77 per 1,000 women, or about 37 percent of all pregnancies. Abortions account for termination of one in seven pregnancies. An estimated 197,000 women are treated annually in public hospitals and private teaching hospitals for induced abortion complications, a number equivalent to an annual rate of 6.4 women hospitalized as a result of unsafe induced abortions per 1,000 women aged 15–49.</jats:p>",

Given the deficient state of health‐information systems in most developing countries, nationally representative surveys are currently the most widely available source of population‐based cesarean birth data. The purpose of this study is to assess the quality and internal consistency of Demographic and Health Survey cesarean birth data across countries and time periods. Although these surveys are highly standardized, the formulation of the question on cesarean birth and the categories of women who are asked the question often differ across surveys. A skip pattern that restricts the cesarean question to women who delivered in a health‐care facility improves the internal consistency of the data, although in some countries cesarean deliveries are still reported at low‐level, presumably nonsurgical facilities. Recommendations are made for improving data analysis and the future collection of population‐based cesarean birth data.</jats:p>",

Of special interest are women who rely on the traditional method of withdrawal and the proportion of withdrawal failures resulting in abortion. Our analysis is based on multiyear calendar data concerning women's contraceptive use and monthly reproductive behaviors collected in the 1999 Romanian Reproductive Health Survey. Weibull regression models are estimated to analyze the determinants of discontinuation and failure for all methods combined and for withdrawal. Overall, 19 and 28 percent of women became pregnant within the first year of using any contraceptive method and of practicing withdrawal, respectively. About 57 and 59 percent of failures from use of all methods and from withdrawal ended in abortion, accounting for 30 percent and 22 percent, respectively, of all abortions reported between 1994 and 1999. These findings suggest that high rates of contraceptive discontinuation and failure contributed significantly to the widespread reliance on induced abortion among Romanian women during this period.</jats:p>",

We first provide an exploratory spatial and statistical analysis of pedestrian collision data in the city of Los Angeles to identify preliminary relationships between the frequency of collisions and socio-demographic and land use characteristics at the census tract level. This aggregate level analysis points to major concentrations of pedestrian collision data which are used at a second stage of the research for more qualitative and detailed analysis of specific case studies of intersections with high frequency of pedestrian collisions. </jats:p>",

At the same time, their geographic unevenness, tendency to target particular ethnic clienteles, and inability to address affordability in an absolute sense place some caveats on the conclusions and suggest the need for more fine-grained research regarding how the unique economic development histories and cultural politics of neighborhoods affect food availability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper suggests a simple framework to estimate the shortage of medical practitioners in rural and urban areas in developing countries. Shortages are defined with respect to four main considerations. The overall numbers and also the different categories of practitioners in the rural and urban areas, the relatively greater difficulties of access in the rural areas (which reduce the number of accessible practitioners) and the greater health hazards in those areas (which lead to greater need for medical treatment).</jats:p><jats:p>The quantitative effect of these factors is examined by undertaking simulation exercises with data for the Ujjain district in Madhya Pradesh state, India and also data for that state. The simulations turned up the following results. The un‐weighted total number of practitioners, per head of population, is relatively <jats:italic>greater</jats:italic> in the rural areas; this is because of the relatively large numbers of the unqualified doctors in those areas. On the other hand, a ‘quality adjusted’ total, with lower weights for the unqualified doctors, found little overall difference between the rural and urban areas. Third, allowance for rural–urban differences in the difficulties of access showed that the number of accessible practitioners is much lower in the rural areas. Fourth, rural–urban differences in the incidence of health hazards and estimates of the need for medical treatment also showed a marked shortage of practitioners in the rural areas.</jats:p><jats:p>The main implication of the results is that developmental efforts in the rural areas, including improvements in transport facilities and reduction of health hazards, would help to greatly reduce the shortage of practitioners in those areas. Training programmes to improve the quality of practitioners in the rural areas are also required. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this study, cross‐sectional behavioral data linked to HIV‐status from 4,138 men and 4,948 women interviewed in rural Zimbabwe are analyzed to investigate the distribution and consequences of early first sex. We find that age at first sex (at a median age of 19 years for males and 18 years for females) has declined among males over the past 30 years but increased recently among females. Those in unskilled employment, those not associated with a church, and women without a primary education begin to have sex earlier than others. Early sexual debut before marriage precedes a lifetime of greater sexual activity but with more consistent condom use. Women who begin to have sex earlier than others of their age are more likely to be infected with HIV. This finding can be explained by their having a greater lifetime number of sexual partners than those whose first sexual experience occurs later.</jats:p>",

Likewise, there is interest from the Mexican government and private enterprise for conducting E&amp;P and LNG activities in Mexican waters near U.S. territorial waters. Because of well known Gulf of Mexico loop current eddies, any significant amount of oil spilled anywhere in the Alaminos or Keathley Canyon areas or even the East Breaks and Garden Banks encounters a real potential for impacting Mexican territorial waters. E&amp;P activities near the international boundary must take into consideration existing international agreements and lessons learned for the preparation of contingency plans.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In 1980, following the June 1979 PEMEX IXTOC I spill, the United States and Mexico signed an agreement of cooperation to draft a joint marine pollution response contingency plan. The agreement delegated to the Mexican Navy and the U.S. Coast Guard the responsibility for developing such a plan. This plan, better known as the MEXUS Plan, was completed and acknowledged by both countries in the year 2000. It addresses bilateral cooperation and procedures in response to pollution incidents that could affect the coastal waters of both countries. Oil companies operating near the international U.S. and Mexican boundaries need to be familiar with the application of the MEXUS Plan.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since the signing of the MEXUS Plan, a series of exercises has been conducted that put to test the practical applicability of the plan. Exercise sponsors have included Unocal Corporation, Shell Exploration &amp; Production Company, the Mexican Navy and most recently PEMEX. The lessons learned from these exercises are paramount ingredients for the development of a spill contingency plan near the international boundary. Information includes: Responsible elements, notification procedures, alternative techniques for spill response, bi-national policies, available resources, joint spill management system, customs and immigration procedures for transboundary crossing of personnel and equipment during a spill response.</jats:p>",

For those that do use design, the majority see design as very important: the benefits of design relate to the brand image of both the organisation and the services provided, closely followed by increased profits. Design has been used in the past to add value and improve quality, while innovation has been and will in the future be the main strategic area to concentrate on. Key strategic activities in the past have been adding new customers, whereas in the future the key strategic activities will be to understand customer needs.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The findings of the paper are important because they shed light on the importance of design and the benefits of design in the service sector, the service design strategies responsible for current performance, how the performance of service sector medium‐sized enterprises is assessed in terms of financial, market and service supply criteria, how service sector medium‐sized enterprises have reached their current status and how they intend to progress in the future, and the organisational, service supply and market factors employed in the past and how these might change in the future.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In spite of an impressive 150-year track record of increasing hydrocarbon production to meet growth in demand, constraints are emerging. There will be a pinch in production rates relative to growing demand, necessitating the development and deployment of alternative energy technologies from more sustainable resources. As of yet there is no consensus on how to transition to alternative fuels despite a great deal of talk about doing so.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Predictions of oil's demise have plagued the petroleum industry since its birth. Repeatedly, doomsayers have suggested that the world had no more than 20 or 30 years of oil left. The repeated failure of these dire predictions have led some to dismiss the finitude of petroleum resources completely—even claim that the world can never run out of oil.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>These optimists are as correct in an absolute sense as they are ridiculously wrong in a practical sense. No matter how high the price of petroleum becomes no technology will ever extract every drop from the proven, producing reserves, let alone find every small reservoir that exists. The decline of petroleum is neither total nor sudden. But in a practical sense, a crisis will come when production can no longer keep pace with demand growth. At that time, we will be producing more oil than ever before! Petroleum production will reach a peak and ultimately decline. That peak will occur when surplus production capacity has diminished to zero and demand continues to grow (unless some alternative source succeeds in carving out a major market share very soon).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In his book The Long Emergency, James Howard Kunstler speaks of \"delusional thinking\" in regard to pinning hopes on emerging alternative energy technologies. But while the issue is muddied by ignorant, alarmist, and simplistic declarations of the end of petroleum, it is just as badly muddied by denial. Julian Simon, in his popular, highly misleading text The Ultimate Resource II, has a chapter titled \"When Will We Run Out Of Oil? Never!\" It is true that petroleum has been increasing in the marketplace. Demand has been growing steadily for more than 130 years, and thus far, the industry has kept pace. However, it is utter, antiscientific fallacy to draw any conclusions about the physical limits of the petroleum resource from economic data. The decline will come.</jats:p>",

It efficiently guides the robot in a dynamic environment. This eliminates some of the traditional problems of planned architectures (model-plan-act scheme) while obtaining many of the qualities of behavior-based architectures. The computational efficiency of the method allows the planner to operate at high-rate sensor frequencies. This avoids the need for using both a collision-avoidance algorithm and a global motion planner for navigation in a cluttered environment. The method combines map-based and sensor-based planning operations to provide a smooth and reliable motion plan. Operating on a simple grid-based world model, the method uses a fast marching technique to determine a motion plan on a Voronoi extended transform extracted from the environment model. In addition to this real-time response ability, the method produces smooth and safe robot trajectories.</jats:p>",

These evaluation elements were successfully tested at two rivers in Freiburg. Deficits and development potentials were identified. These formed the basis for a participatory planning process which was initiated in the framework of the project and which was accompanied by experts. Together with citizens, experts and representatives from public authorities numerous suggestions for the revaluation of the two previously evaluated water bodies in ecological and urban development terms were elaborated.

Very few contra‐indications exist for providing root canal treatment, but the planning must include several aspects. Firstly, is root canal treatment best for the patient to maintain a functional dentition long term? Secondly, who should provide the treatment? Thirdly, what are the restorative options that will ensure the best long‐term prognosis? The sequencing of root canal treatment generally occurs early in a typical treatment plan, and prompt restoration after treatment is crucial to long‐term survival of the tooth.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is based on the premise that mundanity is not so much a quality inherent in an object or event as an appearance or affordance generated at the intersection of object, subject, and location. Assuming that a single object will appear banal in one context and different in another, we focus our attention on cases in which a single object is encountered as both banal and different—visible and invisible at the same time, marked out by its ability to blend in. In this paper we explore the mundane and distinctive by reference to marketing and products of the Japan-based company Muji, and in particular through relating the two contrasting aspects of the Muji image to the different ways in which the objects are located in presentation-marketing contexts and in wear-use contexts. In order to explore the usefulness of this distinction between display space and use space we perform a tactical erasure of the commonsense distinction between the textual and the material, thereby enabling the collapsing together, into the single category of display space, of the textual spaces of Muji catalogues and the material spaces of Muji shop floors. The distinction between the en-masse presentation of new objects in highly controlled display spaces and the mundane wear and use of purchased objects in the various and variously encountered spaces of everyday life is explored through the hybrid display-use space of Muji show homes known as Muji-Infill. We conclude by proposing that this display-use distinction can be used strategically to articulate the way in which skilled consumers are able to encounter objects imaginatively and practically in two different contexts simultaneously. In other words, we speculate that, when skilled consumers encounter a superficially mundane Muji object in the literal and disorganised context of use space, they are able to recognise it as stylish and desirable in part by referring to an acquired understanding of the ways in which that object-in-use evokes a Muji marketing space of massed objects-on-display. </jats:p>",

In dialogue with nonrepresentational theory, as well as its critics, I suggest that any thought or theory of relationality must have as its acknowledged occasion the incessant proximity of the nonrelational. The occasion for this discussion is a consideration of the relationship between suffering, pain, or passion and the thematising actions of representation, communication, narrativisation, and theorisation. Such affections, it is claimed, present social science with a particular problem, a problem which revolves around an irreducible nonthematisability within these dimensions of corporeal existence. Drawing on the writings of Butler, Derrida, and Levinas I offer an account of how this problem or impasse allows for a rethinking of the ethical within social analysis and of the nature of representation, corporeality, and intersubjectivity. </jats:p>",

It can be applied to online collision avoidance with no prior knowledge of the obstacles. Infrared sensors are used to build a description of the robot's surroundings. This approach is based on the configuration space but the construction of the C-obstacle surface is avoided. The point automation is confined on some planes with square grids in the C-space. A path-searching algorithm based on square grids is used to guide the automation maneuvering around the C-obstacles on the selected planes. To avoid the construction of the C-obstacle surface, the robot geometry model is expanded, and the static collision detection method is used. Hence, the computation time is reduced and the algorithm can work in real time. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a series of experiments.</jats:p>",

Using survey data from a sample of 120 business process (BP) redesign and related information technology (IT) development projects in healthcare and telecommunications, our results indicate that upstream (BP) rework and downstream (IT) rework is mediated and mitigated by cooperative planning through upstream/downstream strategy coupling and cross-functional involvement. In addition, uncertainty related to a lack of firm or industry experience with such projects increases the magnitude of upstream rework but not downstream rework or the amount of cooperative planning. After accounting for project scope, implementation horizon and whether delays are anticipated, we find that project delay is primarily influenced by the magnitude of downstream rework and downstream delay: the magnitude of both upstream and downstream rework significantly increases downstream delay, which significantly increases project delay. However, the magnitude of upstream rework does not directly affect project delay. These results suggest that project delay is under managerial control as cooperative planning is a managerial function that reduces downstream rework, while uncertainty from a lack of experience with the design affecting upstream rework is not directly under managerial control.</jats:p>",

Multipliers, taken as elasticities, are estimated by regression analyses of the associations between retail trade earnings by place of work and total income by place of residence (from earnings, property, and transfers) across New England's counties in 2002. The multiplier analyses are conducted in two basic forms, both estimated using a simultaneous autoregressive specification and both incorporating a spatial neighbor income variable. In one, geographical effects are treated as dummy variables alone, so their impact on a particular income multiplier coefficient is read only indirectly. In the other, geographical effects are allowed to interact with property and transfer income so that their multiplier coefficients in the region vary from county to county depending upon particular geographical characteristics. The spatial effect of neighboring county income is consistent across the two forms, and suggests a competitive effect in the region's retail sector. Further results indicate that the region's property income and transfer receipts tend to offset each other in geographical context in their impact on retail-trade income. </jats:p>",

The uncertainty in measurement is highlighted, as are the problems relating to changes in excess commuting over time. The measure of the theoretical maximum commute is proposed and added to the traditional excess-commuting measure so that the use of both the minimum and maximum levels can capture the concept of commuting potential. This measure is what we call the ‘extended excess-commuting measure’. These concepts are tested through the use of a simulation exercise. As well as arguing for the inclusion of socioeconomic variables in analysis, we demonstrate that decentralisation in urban spatial structure can lead to either an increase or a decrease in average commuting distance. Some of the inconsistencies in the use of excess commuting can be reduced through the use of actual commutes together with the commuting range, as these factors in combination lead to a clearer understanding of commuting efficiency. </jats:p>",

The negligible impact of food aid on malnutrition, although most commonly challenged on the quality of needs assessments, is equally attributable to the timing of deliveries, and a dysfunctional distribution system. Comparatively few resources have been allocated to strengthen skills for assessing, analysing and understanding community priorities, local economies, and social safety nets. A more thoughtful allocation of scarce funds could have more impact if a range of alternative responses was considered.

In contrast to the high-profile, waterfront regeneration projects that often draw academic attention, I focus upon one of the more routine docklands that are less regularly analysed—namely ‘Victoria Dock Village’ in Hull. I discuss the ways a maritime-heritage aesthetic was employed by the developers to brand and market this site. Thereafter, I discuss how residents negotiated these aesthetics and a sense of local heritage through two planning debates. To do this I adapt recent reconceptualisations of kitsch in critical and material culture studies. These reconceptualisations take a category that academics have dismissed traditionally as vulgar, banal, ‘low’ culture, and suggest that the repetitive familiarity, reassuring predictability, and nostalgic sentimentality of kitsch prove comforting in an increasingly uncertain, disembedded world. I explore the degree to which residents engage with these kitsch landscapes, and whether they feel more rooted as a consequence. I also suggest that a greater emphasis upon everyday understandings of more ordinary places may contribute to wider analyses of how place identities are constructed and continually remade by the quotidian practices and negotiation of social memory. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the last decade, new governance-style, collaborative approaches to environmental management have increased exponentially. What is not well known is how the structure of these partnerships, particularly the policies that foster their development, may contribute to theʼ ability to achieve either procedural or substantive policy goals. Our study investigated efforts in the States of Washington and Oregon to encourage the development of collaborative watershed management institutions. Thirtyfive watershed partnerships were examined to understand how the planning groups implement policy objectives and how partnerships are creating or modifying institutions for planning and implementation. Our findings suggest that both States face similar challenges in important respects. Challenges include obtaining adequate participation, developing and sustaining organizational capacity, and planning implementation. Together, these findings demonstrate that new governance strategies are not a panacea for water management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to the ongoing debate in the ‘new’ economic geography over the dialectic between the cultural and the economic, and in which the study of the geography of consumption is a prime example. The consumer behavior of culturally distinct immigrants is an intriguing and complex economic and cultural inquiry. In this paper we explore the grocery-shopping behavior of suburban middle-class Chinese immigrants in Toronto, where the group's ethnic economy has become full-fledged. Using a mixed approach combining focus groups and logistic modeling, we examine the preferences of Chinese immigrants between the fast-growing Chinese supermarkets and competing mainstream supermarket chains. Attention is focused upon the interplay of ethnic identity and accessibility in determining store patronage. The findings suggest a stronger effect of ethnic affinity on immigrants' choice of shopping venue than that of economic rationality. Grocery shopping, a most mundane and taken-for-granted activity, is practiced with sociocultural meanings by immigrants, and the social use of ethnic shopping spaces indicates that immigrants are not only consumers in ethnic shopping places but coactors in producing the unique ethnic retail environment. </jats:p>",

Its aim is to identify the implications for the workforce in practice.The analysis found that implementation is often described as partial or slow and characterizes reasons for this at a number of levels, including the slow pace of change in service culture and power relations, immutable funding structures, services’ inflexible infrastructures, high levels of staff turnover and lack of training, inexperience among service management, inadequate staff supervision, and ambiguity among some stakeholders. Little substantial critique exists of the model itself. Analysis of the literature further reveals that the implementation of person-centred planning in practice is assisted by policy encouragement, service development and investment, favourable case reports and personal accounts, practitioner enthusiasm and positive evaluations.This article explores these to consider what facilitates the adoption of new elements of practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A key driver of the recent wave of enterprise resource planning (ERP) implementations was the assumption that the integration of business information would provide firms with a competitive advantage, yet concrete business benefits have been uneven across adopting firms. A possible explanation is that although the resource‐based view holds that competitive advantage is derived from inimitable resources, ERP software has become a commodity. Socio‐technical theory suggests that internal organizational resources based on a foundation of ERP technology may be the true drivers of ERP benefits. A firm's strategic configuration is posited to influence the portfolio of organizational competencies available to leverage the benefits of integrated business information, and a number of hypotheses are developed based on the notion that firms with different strategic objectives will realize different operational benefits from the adoption of ERP systems. Survey data from North American manufacturing firms that have implemented ERP systems demonstrate that ERP adopters seeking operational performance improvements are likely to realize these benefits. On the other hand, those seeking external market and supply chain performance improvements must first establish a foundation of internal operational performance improvements before customer satisfaction and supply chain benefits can be realized. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Regional spatial planning in Northern Ireland is directly linked to the transition from conflict to peace, as identified in the Belfast Agreement of 1998. Political consensus, a rare commodity, was secured in the Northern Ireland Assembly for a regional development strategy (RDS), the first spatial planning document of its kind in the UK. This paper explores the deployment of collaborative planning in creating the RDS. Given Northern Ireland's divided socio-political context, the paper seeks to ascertain the influence on meaningful policy debate and strategy-making arising from the collaborative planning approach. The paper investigates the application of collaborative planning measures in Northern Ireland through an analysis of spatial policy relating to economic development. Evidence presented in this paper suggests that socio-political cohesion was given primacy above potentially contentious physical growth patterns necessary for regional economic development, the result of an inability by institutions to grapple with troublesome issues. </jats:p>",

We interrogate how the role of the Auckland Regional Council (ARC) was zealously contested and hollowed‐out during the 1990s. More recently, the impacts of the neo‐liberal reforms in Auckland have been mediated by a further round of local government reforms inspired by a Third Way ideology and by the imperative to respond to the planning crisis resulting from infrastructure underinvestment. New regionally based governance arrangements and planning processes have been created. We argue that this new commitment to regionalism can realistically expect to be tested by deep‐seated political cleavages within Auckland and by Auckland's relationship with central government.</jats:p>",

A reconstruction of demographic patterns highlights variation in the under-recording of infants across time, space, and rural/urban status. The quality of registration is worse for girls, producing an abnormal sex ratio that also varies across space and time. The analysis of fertility shows that the fertility upsurge of 1974-85 was not spatially uniform. Multi-level regression shows that fertility fluctuations are associated with the distribution of women's time between work and family, women's education, mortality decline, population density, and men's migration. After accounting for these variables and family planning, there remains a north-south gradient which wanes over the period, and a time factor interpretable as the rapidity of change and responsible for a brief fertility increase during the opening phase of the transition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> My purpose in this paper is to provide a fuller account of the origins and nature of city-centre living in Manchester, England, by emphasising its too-often neglected ‘independent’ and ‘countercultural’ underside. Some urban policy researchers have made too much of the ‘entrepreneurial turn’ in Manchester, which is said to have been a key catalyst of its city-centre renaissance and city-centre living. My own empirical work as well as that of some cultural geographers highlights the ‘counter-cultural’ origins of the city-centre renaissance and, later, city-centre living in Manchester. I argue that urban policy research in Britain tends to characterise city-centre dwellers as young, single, professionals as if this was a more-or-less undifferentiated social group. Yet this demonstrates an oversight towards work undertaken by some geographers and urban sociologists who have shown that gentrifiers moving into British and North American city centres and inner-urban areas over the last two decades are a complex and differentiated group of housing consumers. My own empirical work shows that Manchester city-centre dwellers are a similarly complex and differentiated group of housing consumers that occupy a number of distinct positions within the city-centre housing market, and that this can be seen more clearly when the origins and subsequent development of city-centre living in Manchester is more fully understood. Three typologies of Manchester city-centre dwellers are identified; ‘counter-culturalists’ tend to originate from within the ‘new’ middle class; ‘city-centre tourists’ tend to originate from the ‘service class’; and ‘successful agers’ tend to be over the age of fifty. </jats:p>",

Three‐dimensional (3D) computer simulation of craniofacial surgery can be extremely useful to foresee the surgical outcome. Many authors proposed computer systems for craniofacial surgical planning based on computed tomographic (CT) images. A number of methods to achieve the prediction of soft tissue behaviour have been proposed from computer‐aided surgical planning system integrating anatomy‐based 3D finite element tissue model to methods for computation of soft‐tissue deformation in craniofacial surgery directly from CT images without any intermediate geometric model. We present a review of present techniques on the use of imaging in the presurgical planning of facial surgery and reconstruction. The entire workflow of image acquisition, tissue segmentation, tissue classification, surgical planning, soft tissue displacement computer simulation and visualization is outlined and different cases of real maxillofacial surgery are illustrated.</jats:p>",

An essential element of building appropriate levels of capacity, specific planning, and response success is to move beyond use of the “special needs” category, to better identify and address the diverse needs of those included under this label. This article provides disability demographics and describes special needs populations to lay the foundation for this change. It suggests the development of a more accurate and flexible planning and response framework based on essential, sometimes overlapping, functional needs: communication, medical needs, maintaining functional independence, supervision, and transportation (C-MIST). It also proposes new approaches to functional support, leadership, service delivery, and training. </jats:p>",

Clearly, such a policy is expected to have beneficial effects. However, it should be equally clear, from its restrictiveness, that there are costs associated with such a policy. In this contribution the appropriateness of social cost benefit analysis is considered as a tool for the evaluation of spatial policy in the Netherlands. The paper starts with a brief overview of a major characteristic of this analysis and discusses its potential importance for the evaluation of spatial planning in the Netherlands. The discussion continues with the possibility of assessing the cost and benefits associated with non‐market goods, which is perhaps the main controversial aspect of SCBA, by focusing on the relevant example of the value of open space in cities.</jats:p>",

Elastic cities are defined as employing aggressive annexation strategies that result in more effective planning control over the city-region, higher population increases, stronger tax bases, and healthier urban-regional economies than those of nonelastic cities. Principal component analysis was used to analyze and model the elasticity of British Columbia's approximately 100 municipal governments for a thirty-year period, 1971–2001. The findings do not completely support the correlation between a municipality's elastic boundary and growth or development. In fact, the picture is more complex than suggested by Rusk's elastic-cities concept. Annexing municipalities do not exhibit stronger population growth, newer dwellings, or economic development when compared with nonannexing municipalities. Annexation may be contributing to rural-urban sprawl rather than more-compact development patterns. </jats:p>",

The existing literature on nonprofit advocacy adequately explains why so few charities are actively political; however, it fails to illuminate the reasons why some individual charities choose to advocate despite documented constraints. This article offers an alternative to existing explanations for nonprofit advocacy that focuses on the causes for, and the constraints on, this behavior. It suggests that nonprofit organizations are more likely to be politically active when public policies restrict their ability to deliver core services, and when the probability of success is highest because of the presence of political allies. Analyses of advocacy behavior in more than 450 501(c)(3) organizations suggest that these factors persist as motivators of political activity even after controlling for the dominant constraints suggested in the literature. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses interagent interactions, an issue that has received limited attention in travel behavior research. Drawing upon the theory of externalities and the sociological notion of social networks, we develop a discrete choice model that incorporates elements of social influence in addition to more conventional factors such as the attributes of alternatives and the characteristics of decisionmakers. Using simulation, we apply the model to the case of telecommuting—that is, the decision to telecommute or not—over two waves. The experiment suggests that some marginal adopters of telecommuting are influenced heavily in the second wave by the decisions of others in the first wave. Furthermore, the example illustrates the importance of social influence on new adopters of telecommuting in the second wave. </jats:p>",

Conventional 2D methods for robot navigation fail to exploit this unique ability of humanoids and thus design trajectories only by circumventing obstacles. Recently, global algorithms have been presented that take into account this feature of humanoids. However, due to high computational complexity, most of them are very time consuming. In this paper, we present a new approach to footstep planning in obstacle cluttered environments that employs a human-like strategy to terrain traversal. Simulation results of its implementation on a model of the Saika-3 humanoid robot are also presented. The algorithm, being one of reactive nature, refutes previous claims that reactive algorithms fail to find successful paths in complex obstacle cluttered environments. </jats:p>",

In order to avoid its effect, the direct kinematic equations are used for path planning in the paper. Here, the joint position, rate and acceleration are bounded. Firstly, the joint trajectories are parameterized by polynomial or sinusoidal functions. And the two parametric functions are compared in details. It is the first contribution of the paper that polynomial functions can be used when the joint angles are limited(In the similar work of other researchers, only sinusoidla functions could be used). Secondly, the joint functions are normalized and the system of equations about the parameters is established by integrating the differential kinematics equations. Normalization is another contribution of the paper. After normalization, the boundary of the parameters is determined beforehand, and the general criterion to assign the initial guess of the unknown parameters is supplied. The criterion is independent on the planning conditions such as the total time t<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>. Finally, the parametes are solved by the iterative Newtonian method.

It is possible, for example, by using fMRI images, to identify particular regions in the brain which can be considered as “functional organs at risk” (fOARs), i.e., regions which would cause significant patient morbidity if compromised. The aim of this study is to propose and validate a method to exploit functional information for the identification of fOARs in CyberKnife (Accuray, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) radiosurgery treatment planning; in particular, given the high spatial accuracy offered by the CyberKnife system, local nonrigid registration is used to reach accurate image matching. Five patients affected by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and scheduled to undergo radiosurgery were scanned prior to treatment using computed tomography (CT), three‐dimensional (3D) rotational angiography (3DRA), T2 weighted and blood oxygenation level dependent echo planar imaging MRI. Tasks were chosen on the basis of lesion location by considering those areas which could be potentially close to treatment targets. Functional data were superimposed on 3DRA and CT used for treatment planning. The procedure for the localization of fMRI areas was validated by direct cortical stimulation on <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0326-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0326:mp0326-math-0001\" /> and tumor patients undergoing conventional surgery. Treatment plans studied with and without considering fOARs were significantly different, in particular with respect to both maximum dose and dose volume histograms; consideration of the fOARs allowed quality indices of treatment plans to remain almost constant or to improve in four out of five cases compared to plans with no consideration of fOARs. In conclusion, the presented method provides an accurate tool for the integration of functional information into AVM radiosurgery, which might help to minimize undesirable side effects and to make radiosurgery less invasive.</jats:p>",

This gives a total prison population of around 800 000 people. These people are detained in penal facilities built during the Soviet era, the majority of which are in peripheral locations. Because the peripheries have been selected as ‘sites of punishment’, Russia's distinctive ‘geography of penality’ makes the maintenance of social contacts of prisoners difficult and undermines attempts to reduce the rates of recidivism in Russia. Women are drawn into the penal complex by virtue of their relationships with the majority male prisoner population, a process which transforms them into ‘quasi-prisoners’ and reproduces gender stereotypes. </jats:p>",

This article compares and evaluates two such frameworks or plans, Tasmania Together and Growing Victoria Together, in terms of their potential to promote sustainability. It argues that they are very different exercises in new governance, aimed at reconnecting with community priorities and at redirecting macro‐policy setting away from a preoccupation with economic priorities, respectively. Nevertheless, both plans have the capacity to ‘green’ state planning, in Tasmania in terms of more purposeful benchmarks, and in Victoria in terms of enhanced sustainability emphasis in the macro‐policy setting. The article encounters tensions in its review of the plans between deliberation and planning, policy empowerment and policy progress, and policy institutionalisation and politicisation as means of achieving policy change. It finds that whilst Tasmania and Victoria are re‐engaged states that are reinventing state policy, as yet they are failing to meet the governance challenges of sustainability.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Over the past 40 years, a considerable amount of solid radioactive waste has been generated in Egypt from a variety of nuclear technology applications in research, medicine, and industry. The Hot Laboratory and Waste Management Center at Inshas, Cairo, has started to build an integrated waste management system to ensure the safe management of this radioactive waste. During the establishment of this system, a range of technological options have been identified and evaluated in order to select and justify the most appropriate option for each waste type, taking into account the basic waste management principles, regulatory requirements, available resources, and other technical and non‐technical factors. Unfortunately, some of the generated wastes were not under a Quality Assurance Program that provides maintenance of traceability to production or conditioning records. So, these wastes are considered unacceptable to be placed in the disposal facility and need to be characterized and brought to an acceptable condition prior to disposal. This must be done in accordance with comprehensive plans and documented procedures to guarantee the safe handling, storage, and disposal. In this work, the existing Egyptian solid waste management system will be presented with a special reference to a management plan to be applied through this system. This will include a description of the organizational structure, functional responsibilities, organizational interfaces, personnel training, documentation, and corrective action.

Two tools that employ farmers' participation were developed and applied at Gikuuri catchment in Kenya. The first tool involved farmers to map soil erosion using their own indicators and determine the soil erosion status at catchment scale. This formed the basis upon which they undertook to plan for SWC measures at catchment scale. Farmers also predicted crop yield losses based on the soil erosion status. Farmers widely approved the soil erosion status map since their own indicators and perceptions were used. The second tool provided cash flow trends for a variety of SWC activities and farmer situations. Farmers can use land with a high, moderate or low erosion status and often have rather different socio‐economic settings. The net benefits over 5 yr for bench terraces, <jats:bold>fanya juu</jats:bold> terraces and grass strips were illustrated to assist farmers in making informed decisions on SWC adoption. The two tools increased awareness on the need for collective actions among farmers and showed fields that cause run‐on on downslope fields. The improved awareness of erosion problems and the related financial consequences increased farmers' willingness to share the investment costs for cut‐off drains.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper proposes a new methodology to explicitly consider unreliability costs in a multi‐stage transmission expansion planning. Starting from a reference plan, alternative expansion plans are derived based on postponement/anticipation of circuit implementations. These plans are then ranked by using an economic index of merit (EIM) and the associated Pareto‐optimal set is obtained through cost/benefit (trade‐off) analyses. The cost/benefit is related to the variation of investments and operational costs of each alternative transmission plan. Besides the usual operational costs (active power losses, fuels, etc.) the unreliability costs, due to random failures in the system, are also considered as operational costs. Therefore, reliability evaluations are carried out for all transmission expansion plans (TEPs) in order to compute reliability indices, such as the Expect Energy not Supplied and Loss of Load Cost (LOLC). To reduce the computational effort, pruning techniques are used to limit the number of possible TEPs. The proposed approach is applied to a configuration of the Brazilian North‐eastern system, considering a planning horizon of 10 years, to identify TEPs that are more balanced in terms of investment and reliability.

Treatment planning scans were acquired at normal exhale/inhale breathing states for fifteen patients. The internal target volume (ITV) was defined as the union of exhale and inhale gross tumor volumes uniformly expanded by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3427-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3427:mp3427-math-0001\" />. Anterior/posterior opposed beams (AP/PA) and three‐dimensional (3D)‐conformal plans were designed using the unit‐density exhale (“static”) dataset. These plans were further used to calculate (a) density‐corrected (“heterogeneous”) static dose and (b) heterogeneous cumulative dose, including breathing deformations. The DPM Monte Carlo code was used for dose computations. For larger than coin‐sized tumors, relative to unit‐density plans, tumor and lung doses increased in the heterogeneity‐corrected plans. In comparing cumulative and static plans, larger normal tissue complication probability changes were observed for tumors with larger motion amplitudes and uncompensated breathing‐induced hot/cold spots in lung. Accounting for tissue heterogeneity resulted in average increases of 9% and 7% in mean lung dose (MLD) for the <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3427-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3427:mp3427-math-0002\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3427-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3427:mp3427-math-0003\" /> photon beams, respectively.

The magnitude of these effects was not found to correlate with the treatment plan technique, i.e., AP/PA versus 3D‐CRT. Given a properly designed ITV, tissue heterogeneity effects are likely to have a larger clinical significance on tumor and normal lung treatment evaluation metrics than four‐dimensional respiratory‐induced changes.</jats:p>",

Standard operation planning for hepatic resections and preoperative donor and recipient work‐up for LDLT is based on two‐dimensional computed tomography (CT) images and magnetic resonance imaging. However, even modern multidetector CT scanners are not able to perform routinely three‐dimensional (3D) visualization needed for operation planning in liver surgery or LDLT. As a consequence, special‐purpose computer‐based operation planning systems have been developed that leverage the possibilities of modern image processing to improve surgical planning. The advances in technology enable surgeons to analyse and to visualize the anatomy of the human liver including the vascular structures within the human liver and define the exact volumetric data of the liver tissue to be resected or preserved. Furthermore, 3D visualization of the vessel architecture within the human liver allows a reliable estimation of the amount of liver tissue that could be at risk after resection because of inadequate hepatovenous drainage. Because of its clinical usefulness and real‐time visualization capabilities we already use an operation planning system in selected patients prior to liver resection and before donor hepatectomy for LDLT as a standard.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The need for data and information that can be used to enhance community resilience to coastal inundation and erosion has been highlighted by the devastating impacts of recent events such as Hurricane Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The physical systems causing coastal inundation\n and erosion are governed by a complex combination of oceanic, atmospheric, and terrestrial processes interacting across a broad range of temporal and spatial scales. Depending on time and place the expression of these processes may variously take the form of episodic storm-induced surge or\n wave overtopping and undercutting, chronic flooding and erosion associated with long-term relative sea level rise, or catastrophic inundation attributable to tsunami. Differences related to geographic setting, such as sea ice in Alaska or coral reefs in Hawai'i and the Pacific Islands, enhance\n this phenomenological variability. Anticipating the expression of these phenomena is also complicated by observed and projected changes in climate. Combined with these physical systems are social systems made up of diverse cultural, economic, and environmental conditions. Like the physical\n systems, the social systems are changing, largely because of increases in population and infrastructure along coastlines. These diverse conditions and systems reveal wide-ranging needs for the content, format, and timing of data and information to support decision-making. In addition, other\n considerations complicate these requirements for data and information: (1) the decentralized acquisition of information from a variety of platforms (e.g., tide gauges, wave buoys, satellites, radars); (2) data and models of varying complexity and spatial and temporal application; and (3) gaps\n and overlaps in agency, institutional, and organizational activity and authority. This systemic complexity presents a challenge to scientists, planners, managers, and others working to increase community resilience in the face of the risks associated with inundation and erosion. This paper\n describes a conceptual framework for an integrating architecture that would support program planning and product development toward hazard resilient communities. Central to this framework is a comprehensive, horizontally and vertically integrated view of the physical and social systems that\n shape the risks associated with coastal inundation and erosion, and the kinds of information needed to manage those risks. Equally important, the framework addresses the necessary connections among systems and scales. This integrated approach also emphasizes the needs of planners, managers,\n and decision-makers in a changing physical and social environment, as well as the necessity of an iterative, nested, collaborative, and participatory process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper deals with the application of the adjoint transport theory in order to optimize Monte Carlo based radiotherapy treatment planning. The technique is applied to Boron Neutron Capture Therapy where most often mixed beams of neutrons and gammas are involved. In normal forward Monte Carlo simulations the particles start at a source and lose energy as they travel towards the region of interest, i.e., the designated point of detection. Conversely, with adjoint Monte Carlo simulations, the so‐called adjoint particles start at the region of interest and gain energy as they travel towards the source where they are detected. In this respect, the particles travel backwards and the real source and real detector become the adjoint detector and adjoint source, respectively. At the adjoint detector, an adjoint function is obtained with which numerically the same result, e.g., dose or flux in the tumor, can be derived as with forward Monte Carlo. In many cases, the adjoint method is more efficient and by that is much quicker when, for example, the response in the tumor or organ at risk for many locations and orientations of the treatment beam around the patient is required. However, a problem occurs when the treatment beam is mono‐directional as the probability of detecting adjoint Monte Carlo particles traversing the beam exit (detector plane in adjoint mode) in the negative direction of the incident beam is zero. This problem is addressed here and solved first with the use of next event estimators and second with the application of a Legendre expansion technique of the angular adjoint function. In the first approach, adjoint particles are tracked deterministically through a tube to a (adjoint) point detector far away from the geometric model. The adjoint particles will traverse the disk shaped entrance of this tube (the beam exit in the actual geometry) perpendicularly. This method is slow whenever many events are involved that are not contributing to the point detector, e.g., neutrons in a scattering medium. In the second approach, adjoint particles that traverse an adjoint shaped detector plane are used to estimate the Legendre coefficients for expansion of the angular adjoint function. This provides an estimate of the adjoint function for the direction normal to the detector plane. In a realistic head model, as described in this paper, which is surrounded by 1020 mono‐directional neutron/gamma beams and from which the best ones are to be selected, the example calculates the neutron and gamma fluxes in ten tumors and ten organs at risk.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\"> Background: Members of a Lower Mississippi Delta community and university partners used the Comprehensive Participatory Planning and Evaluation (CPPE) model to assess nutrition and health problems and develop a menu of interventions. Objectives: We sought to identify and prioritize nutrition and physical activity problems in the community and to identify interventions to address the problems. Methods: Community members and university partners used the CPPE process to identify and prioritize nutrition and physical activity problems. The participants developed causal models to break down the identified problems to their root causes. They then developed a menu of interventions and criteria to rank the interventions. Results: The identified problems were intake of unhealthy foods, lack of nutrition education, and lack of adequate physical activity. The menu of interventions consisted of seven objectives to address poor nutrition and physical activity as well as a total of 19 interventions to meet these objectives. Conclusion: Directly involving community members in identifying health problems and solutions results in the development of interventions that are likely to have greater acceptability with the community. </jats:p>",
