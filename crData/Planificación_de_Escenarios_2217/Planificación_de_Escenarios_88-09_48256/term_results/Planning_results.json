      "abstract": "<jats:p>Im Hinblick auf die Entfernungsabhängigkeit der Gebühren gibt es erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den verschiedenen Fernmeldediensten. Insbesondere bei denjenigen Diensten, die als Netzinfrastruktur das Fernsprechnetz nutzen, hängt die Gebührenhöhe stark von der Entfernung ab. Aufgrund der technischen Entwicklung entspricht diese Gebührenregelung jedoch nicht mehr den bei der Bereitstellung der Dienste entstehenden Kosten.Von regionalpolitischer Seite wird ein Abbau der Entfernungskomponente bzw. eine entfernungsunabhängige Gebührenregelung vorgeschlagen, die dazu beitragen soll, bestehende Benachteiligungen peripherer Räume zu vermindern. Ordnungspolitiker und kommunikationsintensive Betriebe fordern kostenorientierte Tarife, was z. B. die Gebühren für Ferngespräche erheblich vermindern würde. Vorliegender Beitrag untersucht am Beispiel des Telefons, welche Gebührenstrategie aus raumordnungspolitischer Sicht zu unterstützen ist und kommt zu folgendem Ergebnis:Entfernungsunabhängige Gebühren bedeuten nicht nur eine Verbilligung der Ferngespräche, sondern auch eine erhebliche Verteuerung der Nahgespräche. Letzteres würde insbesondere Haushalte und Betriebe mit überwiegend nahversorgender Funktion benachteiligen. Die Forderung nach einer generellen Kostenorientierung der Fernmeldegebühren läuft auf eine Aufweichung des Prinzips der Tarifeinheit im Raum hinaus, was eindeutig raumordnungspolitischen Interessen entgegensteht. Unterstützenswert erscheint hingegen eine Strategie, die versucht, den Gebührensprung an der Nahbereichsgrenze durch eine Erhöhung der Taktzeiten über mittlere Distanzen abzubauen.</jats:p>"

Während regionale Einkommensdisparitäten in Spanien seit längerem durch die Publikationen der Banco de Bilbao1 statistisch aufbereitet und analysiert werden, sind die entsprechenden Forschungslücken für Portugal besonders deutlich. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist deshalb, regionale Einkommensunterschiede in Portugal zu analysieren. Ausgehend von einer mikroökonomischen Theorie der Einkommenserklärung werden mit Hilfe eines entsprechenden Individualdatensatzes für Portugal und geeigneter Abgrenzungen regionaler Arbeitsmärkte empirische Schätzungen regional getrennter, einfacher Einkommensfunktionen durchgeführt. Forschungsleitend ist dabei die Hypothese, daß der Einkommensbestimmungsprozeß in Portugal – wie auch in vielen anderen europäischen Staaten – regional ungleich verläuft.Im ersten Abschnitt wird die theoretische Fragestellung entwickelt. Der zweite Abschnitt enthält neben einer kurzen Beschreibung der Daten die wesentlichen empirischen Ergebnisse. Die Arbeit schließt mit einer kurzen Zusammenfassung und Bewertung.</jats:p>"

Dabei würde einem Einwohnerzuwachs in den ländlichen Räumen eine beachtenswerte Abnahme in den Verdichtungsgebieten gegenüberstehen. Gleichgerichtete regionale Verschiebungen sind für die zurückliegenden zehn Jahre bei der Entwicklung der Beschäftigtenzahlen festzustellen. Im Ruhrgebiet war der Rückgang der Beschäftigung mit gravierenden strukturellen Veränderungen zugunsten der Investitionsgüter- und Dienstleistungsbereiche verbunden.Nachgegangen wird der schon seit längerem in der landesentwicklungspolitischen Diskussion aufgeworfenen Frage, ob mit einer „Entdichtung“ der mit Umweltproblemen belasteten Ballungsregionen auch Entwicklungschancen verbunden sein können. Zur Beantwortung bedarf es jedoch der zusätzlichen Einbeziehung insbesondere von Daten und Indikatoren aus dem Umweltsektor. Strategien zu einer weiteren „Stabilisierung auf niedrigerem Niveau“ sollte man aber bereits jetzt kritisch gegenüberstehen. Denn beim Unterschreiten bestimmter Mindest- und Dichtewerte von Bevölkerung und Arbeitsplätzen können auch in den großen Verdichtungsräumen die Auslastung der meist kostenaufwendigen Infrastruktureinrichtungen sowie die Trag- und Funktionsfähigkeit der regionalen Arbeitsmärkte gefährdet sein.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship between the transformation of advanced capitalist societies from Fordism to post-Fordism and the simultaneous rise within these societies of postmodern culture is investigated. In art and architecture the exhaustion of high-modernist aesthetic progressivism resulted in a postmodern ‘condition’ of ‘free disposability’ of aesthetic materials which was furthered by societal developments such as the dissolution of the Fordist model of standardized consumption into diversified and aesthetizised consumption, the rise of an experimenting culture industry after the youth revolt of the 1960s, the growth of the service class, and the advent of ‘disposability’ in regard to ways and styles of living. In social philosophy a general delegitimation of the grand narratives of progress and emancipation occurred as ‘high-Fordism’ gave way to stagnating ‘late-Fordism’ and fragmented ‘post-Fordism’. In this process the technocratic–statist narrative of Fordism itself and the labor utopia of the industrial working class lost credibility, without any emergence of convincing utopian or grand reformist alternatives. The spatial (global–local) aspects of these transformations are emphasized and the paper concludes with some left-critical considerations which stress the democratic potential of postmodernism and its openness towards local alliances protective against the powers of global capitals and centralized states. </jats:p>",

Im Blickpunkt standen die regionalen Lebenssituationen von Sozialhilfeempfängern und die Sozialhilfeausgaben der örtlichen Träger in Niedersachsen 1986.Die Ergebnisse verdeutlichen, daß das Fehlen eines bundesstaatlich hinreichend geregelten Familienlastenausgleichs Gebiete mit einem hohen Familienanteil und günstigeren Geburtenraten regionalwirtschaftlich benachteiligt: Im Westen, wo der Bevölkerungsanteil der Kinder und Jugendlichen hoch ist, wo viele Familien leben und eine überdurchschnittliche Geburtenrate zu verzeichnen ist, sind die privaten Hilfe- und Beziehungsnetze so tragfähig, daß nur relativ selten Ältere in Heimen versorgt werden müssen. Allerdings belasten dort die überdurchschnittliche Arbeitslosigkeit und das unterdurchschnittliche Lohnniveau die Lebenslage von Familien tiefgreifend, so daß in überdurchschnittlich vielen Fällen Armut nur durch Hilfe zum Lebensunterhalt abzuwenden ist.Im Südosten Niedersachsens prägen ein hoher Rentneranteil, eine geringe Familiendichte und eine niedrige Geburtenrate das demographische Profil. Die Sozialhilfe ersetzt in diesen Teilen des Landes schwerpunktmäßig die Aufgaben einer Pflegeversicherung. Dort scheinen die privaten Hilfe- und Beziehungsnetze weniger tragfähig zu sein, so daß überdurchschnittlich viele ältere Menschen ihren Lebensabend in Heimen verbringen. Sie müssen Sozialhilfe wegen der hohen Kosten für stationäre Pflege in Anspruch nehmen.Um den Sozialhilfeaufwand längerfristig dämpfen zu können, ist eine räumlich differenzierte Strukturpolitik erforderlich. Sie muß die regionalen Rahmenbedingungen verbessern, die für die aktuellen Sozialhilfeprobleme ausschlaggebend sind. Für dieses strukturpolitische Handeln werden in der Abhandlung mögliche Orientierungslinien in Betracht gezogen.</jats:p>"

Poor indigenous energy resources and the leading role that nuclear power has played in the COMECON's energy-intensive manufacturing sector has made nuclear power into an attractive proposition from the 1960s onwards. Discussion in this paper centres around nuclear-power plant siting and operation, and media coverage of the industry—especially after April 1986; reports include official Czechoslovakian material, and matter published by émigré groups. Official planning policies appear to have changed little since the Ukrainian accident, with increasing reliance being placed on nuclear power for electricity production in Czechoslovakia, up to the end of this century and beyond.</jats:p>",

This paper specifically deals with the issues related to the development and design of an information‐flow‐structure about resource wastes, with the understanding that waste management is a matter of serious concern for policy formulation, subsequent planning and implementation at the national level. This structure should support the national planning system based on an I–O–W (Input—Output—Waste) model which is the logical extension of an I–O model. Identification of informational needs of national planners about wastes would be the starting point towards designing such a structure. Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) is found to be a powerful technique to transform the complex mental models into a visible and well‐defined structural format. This is proposed here to be used for the development of the necessary information‐flow‐structure parallel to the existing productive systems, which should support the informational needs of top‐level planners and decision‐makers.</jats:p>",

Zwar besteht die Gefahr, daß solche Konzepte leicht zu unsinniger Konkurrenz zwischen verschiedenen, ähnlich entwicklungsschwachen Regionen führen. Die Alternative bestünde jedoch im Nichtstun und scheidet somit aus.Die regionale Entwicklungspolitik für Hamburg, wie sie sich in einer Vielzahl von Einzelentscheidungen des Hamburger Senats dokumentiert, entspricht einer Strategie der individuellen Ausschöpfung der Hamburg-spezifischen Entwicklungspotentiale. Grundziel ist, die Position der Hamburger Region gegenüber den im Süden gelegenen Konkurrenzregionen zu verbessern, somit also die regionale Exportfähigkeit über möglichst viele Leistungsbereiche hinweg in Relation zum Süden überproportional zu steigern. In Anbetracht der besonderen Strukturstärken der Hamburger Wirtschaft ergibt sich eine Grundorientierung der Hamburger Stadtentwicklungspolitik auf die Förderung des tertiären Wirtschaftsbereiches. Eine solche Ausrichtung setzt jedoch voraus, daß positive Entwicklungen im Bereich des grundleistungsorientierten tertiären Wirtschaftsbereiches nicht durch Einbrüche in anderen Bereichen der Wirtschaft und des Arbeitsmarktes auf gezehrt werden.</jats:p>"

There follows a discussion of the relative merits of two theories which seek to address what some have called the transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. It is argued that the notion of ‘flexible accumulation’, although superior in principle to that of ‘disorganized capitalism’ as a general orienting device, is too loosely specified at present. In particular, attention is drawn to the growth of social and spatial integration as a key element of interfirm relations in a context of growing flexibility. Empirical evidence is adduced in support of the argument that flexibility involves internal changes in work practices and external changes in relations with competitors which are likely to have far-reaching spatial resonances. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes a planning architecture that supports a form of hierarchical planning well suited to applications involving deadlines, travel time, and resource considerations. The architecture is based upon a temporal database, a heuristic evaluator, and a decision procedure for refining partial plans. A partial plan consists of a set of tasks and constraints on their order, duration, and potential resource requirements. The temporal database records the partial plan that the planner is currently working on and computes certain consequences of that information to be used in proposing methods to further refine the plan. The heuristic evaluator examines the space of linearized extensions of a given partial plan in order to reject plans that fail to satisfy basic requirements (e.g., hard deadlines and resource limitations) and to estimate the utility of plans that meet these requirements. The information provided by the temporal database and the heuristic evaluator is combined using a decision procedure that determines how best to refine the current partial plan. Neither the temporal database nor the heuristic evaluator is complete and, without reasonably accurate information concerning the possible resource requirements of the tasks in a partial plan, there is a significant risk of missing solutions. A specification language that serves to encode expectations concerning the duration and resource requirements of tasks greatly reduces this risk, enabling useful evaluations of partial plans. Details of the specification language and examples illustrating how such expectations are exploited in decision making are provided.</jats:p>",

First the nature of the current crisis of Fordism is considered, with special emphasis on two elements of this crisis. The first has to do with the internationalization of Fordist production techniques without the corresponding elaboration of characteristically Fordist consumption patterns in the countries involved. The second has to do with the forms of competition that have arisen in conjunction with the Fordist regime of accumulation in the core countries. Both of these factors, it is argued, have played a significant role in the current predicament facing many advanced industrial nations. The shift to a regime of flexible accumulation is then considered with particular attention paid to the rise of new technologies and new ways of organizing production. These factors are related to changing competitive strategies and the spatial organization of production on an international scale. </jats:p>",

The sample consisted of 12 41/2-year-olds and 12 3-year-olds. There were six boys and six girls at each age level. The children were videotaped as same-age and same-sex dyads in two 20 minute sessions on consecutive days. The results indicated no age differences in the organisation of play. There were, however, developmental and sex differences in the complexity of play. The 4½-year-olds and girls more than 3-year-olds and boys expressed multiple dimensions of planning and symbolic representation. This finding lends support to the Piagetian notion that play symbols are combined in sequences with increasing age and is discussed in relation to the development of decentration. </jats:p>",

Factors affecting external ownership of single-plant firms and location decisions of multiplant firms are considered in light of theories of industrial organization. Firms of different types are shown to react differently to the incentives of the Israeli spatial economic policy. Thus, whereas residents of the development towns benefit little from these capital incentives, nonlocally owned single-plant firms are most attracted by them. However, externally owned small single-plant firms have been shown to suffer from the greatest instability and to form very few local linkages. Another policy failure was the inability to attract government-owned military industries to the development towns. </jats:p>",

The data are for the modes: car driver, car passenger, train, bicycle, and public transit. These data are compiled from week-long travel diaries collected at six-month intervals from a nationwide panel in the Netherlands. Three types of empirical relationships are present in these panel data: (1) autocorrelative relationships, capturing temporal stability in demand for the same mode at different points in time; (2) contemporaneous relationships, capturing complementarity and competition among different modes at the same point in time; and (3) cross-lagged effects, potentially capturing systematic shifts in demand. Simultaneous equation systems are used to test the temporal stability of demand for each mode and the stationarity of the contemporaneous relationships among the modes. The dynamic structure both of trip rates and of travel times are modeled successfully according to several goodness-of-fit indices. The equation systems capture nonstationarity in the contemporaneous relationships, as well as important cross-lagged effects. These results quantify changes in the structure of demand over time in the Netherlands and are shown to be directly related to the event of a public transit fare increase. </jats:p>",

The DP model includes a linear programming (LP) subroutine for calculating least‐cost feed rations. The planning model is empirically applied using data and assumptions representative offeedlots in the Coastal Plain region of Israel where most feedlot production and marketing decisions are made by ‘rule‐of‐thumb’ using set liveweight gain sequences, market standards and stock replacement decisions. The empirical findings indicate that the profitability of feedlot production and marketing could be increased by an average of 10% over that obtained from ‘rule‐of‐thumb’ decision rules.</jats:p>",

A procedure for disaggregate calibration of the multipliers used in the economic-base component of the model is presented. Also given is an endogenous calibration procedure to include zonal constraints into the spatial interaction part of the unconstrained Lowry—Garin model. This is accomplished through the use of only two simple parameters which have important physical interpretations regarding the sensitivity of transportation improvements. Bifurcation conditions are then specified for the constrained model in both the aggregate and disaggregate cases. Through a case study of a medium-size city, the disaggregate calibration approach was found to produce better replication of the observed development pattern. Also the endogenous way of embedding zonal constraints in the two aforementioned parameters was found to be extremely efficient computationally. Most importantly, the analytical framework offers a transparent way of explaining urban development, including the prediction of precipitous developments, thus relieving much of the burden of traditional simulation approaches which tend to be cumbersome and analytically intractable. </jats:p>",

Some of the fallacies which perpetuate this role, especially the economic rationality of waste imports, are investigated and there is an elaboration of the need for a policy framework to change the existing conditions under which the region participates in the world nuclear economy. Alternative strategies to effect these changes are evaluated, and a regional approach is considered to be the most realistic. </jats:p>",

Major retailers, in their search for growth, have turned to market segmentation, increased design, and better-quality garments rather than to a strategy based on cost. This has benefitted manufacturers because of the need for close contact with British suppliers. Both manufacturers and retailers have introduced new technology to cope with the associated demands for improved flexibility, turnaround times, and design. The high cost of automation, however, lays the foundation for increasing concentration and capital intensity within the clothing industry. Despite the apparent opportunities created for the British clothing industry by these developments, it is debateable whether manufacturers have taken, or will take, full advantage. In several garment areas there is evidence that the benefits have been going to manufacturers in other member countries of the European Economic Community, who are increasingly being considered as domestic suppliers by British retailers. The significance of imports from these high-cost countries and the implications for the British clothing industry are also considered. </jats:p>",

Within socialist economies shortage, or unsatisfied demand, is a driving force which stimulates natural tendencies to management stabilization in which bureaucratic structures control the distribution of goods and services. There are two rival models of regional infrastructure provision: Orientation to places of production, or orientation to places of residence. Within either model a hierarchical structure is necessary. It is becoming necessary in socialist countries to appraise the administrative consequences of social goods provision as well as of productive forces. This creates major challenges to link the productive and residence orientation of administration. This, in turn, suggests a need for a more flexible rather than a uniform approach to settlement planning. </jats:p>",

The focus is on the move from renting to owning a home in the young adult years of life. Data from the national American Housing Survey, for the years 1974–1983, are combined with the techniques of multistate demography to produce housing life summary statistics and rates of movement by age. Parameterized curves are fitted to the empirical age-rate schedules and exogenous variables used to explain variation in the parameters related to young adults. Three simple, projection scenarios are also examined. The results indicate the importance of life-cycle factors and economic conditions in the shift from renting to owning a home. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The industrialized nations of the world have begun to plan for the storage and eventual disposal of their increasing volumes of nuclear wastes. In this paper the authors inventory the progress made by these nations in planning for nuclear waste disposal. A typology based on the adoption of spent-fuel reprocessing programs and of progress toward selection of permanent disposal sites is developed, and the world's nuclear nations are located within this typology. However, those countries which have been active in determining and constructing disposal sites have faced considerable internal and international political conflict. Conflict over nuclear waste disposal site-selection is both a geographical and a political problem. There is a review of various factors which contribute to the articulation and resolution of political conflict, including public participation in siting decisions, veto power of local governments, and prospects for international cooperation in siting decisions. It is concluded that decentralized democratic procedures, which emphasize public participation in siting decisions, have the strongest potential for conflict resolution.</jats:p>",
