      "abstract": "<jats:p> The fashion for Marxist analysis in planning theory has all but passed without a satisfactory answer being given to the question: what does the theory tell planners to do? This question can only be answered by conceiving of planning as a political activity in the broadest sense, and by examining Marxian political theory which deals with its subject through the perspective of class conflict. The Marxian concept of class, however, is problematic. In this paper recent developments in Marxian class theory are traced and a movement is found away from a reductionist structural perspective towards one which accepts the importance of nonclass as well as class structures, the existence of new classes cutting across the economic categories of capital and labour, and the significance of individual interests and subjectivity, in short a movement towards pluralism. A critique of reductionism is offered, focusing initially on the work of Harvey, and concludes with some tentative answers to the question posed above. </jats:p>",

Assessment of the patient for home discharge is initiated by a multidisciplinary team. The nurse, physician, social worker, respiratory therapist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, home health nursing agency, durable medical equipment supplier, and caregivers constitute the team. The crucial links to a successful patient discharge are an involved family and a well-developed plan of care, although patient finances also are important. The nurse develops, coordinates, and implements the teaching plan over a period of 2 or more weeks. The home caregivers provide total care for the patient several days before discharge. The home health agency and the durable medical equipment supplier provide services which ease the transition of care from hospital to home. One alternative to home discharge is placement in an extended care facility</jats:p>",

However, the disaggregated capital model which is used to show that nonlinearity of the frontiers between wage rate and profit rate, thus providing a demonstration of capital reswitching, does not incorporate space in terms of transportation costs within a regional economy or include trade between regions.

To support these applications, SDS allows users to specify the products, supply sources, terminals, markets, transport options, and time periods they want to consider for planning and then generates and solves a linear programming model of the specified supply and distribution system. SDS, which can represent supply, terminal operations, and primary and secondary distribution, is one of the few LP models that integrates functional areas in the oil industry. The system is flexible, accurate, and produces relevant reports. However, it was not adopted for routine planning largely because, due to economic conditions, very limited resources were available for implementation. To ensure that a system is used, developers and users must make substantial investments not only in developing it, but in establishing and maintaining a suitable environment for it. </jats:p>",

The task of the robots is to carry a common rigid object from an initial position to a final position along a given path in three-dimensional workspace in minimum time. The number of robots in the system is arbitrary. In the proposed algorithm, the desired motion of the common object carried by the robots is used as the key to planning of the trajectories of all the non-redundant robots involved. The search method is used in the trajectory planning. The planned robot trajectories satisfy the joint velocity, acceleration and torque constraints as well as the path constraints. The other constraints such as collision-free constraints, can be easily incorporated into the trajectory planning in future research.</jats:p>",

In each case, the rate of profit performs poorly as a determinant of the rate of accumulation in the manufacturing industries. If this result is real, rather than being because of inappropriate data or methods, then alternative determinants of investment behaviour must be sought, the emphasis placed by theorists on an equal rate of profit equilibrium is misplaced, and interpretations of capital flows in terms of relative profitability are misguided. </jats:p>",

A strategic decision must be made periodically (e.g., once a year) whether to maintain a private delivery fleet, to employ outside commercial carrier services, or to use a combination of both options. We seek to develop a methodology to address this long range planning decision. Our model considers a geographic area, with random daily demands, served by a single warehouse. The costs considered include the fixed and variable (per mile) costs of a private vehicle and the outside carriers' delivery charges. A private vehicle is constrained by the length of the work-day, since it returns to the warehouse only after completing all its deliveries. Since actual customer locations change from day to day, for planning purposes we divide the geographic area into sectors and decide how best to serve each sector. The model determines the private fleet size and the specific assignment of each sector to a private vehicle or to an outside carrier. The centerpiece of our solution approach consists of a single-source capacitated facility location formulation, in which each “customer” (sector) is served by a single “facility” (private vehicle or outside carrier). Computational results are reported. </jats:p>",

This article proposes a path‐planning algorithm that selects a reasonable collision‐free path tying start and goal points out of a quadtree representation of the robot workspace. The quadtree is obtained from fast conversion of a real image taken through a camera on the ceiling. It represents obstacles and their allocation in the workspace in good time and hence the algorithm is able to find a collision‐free path while following the change of obstacles and their allocation. The algorithm is designed on the basis of “small‐is‐quick” principle. That is, the smaller a search space of the algorithm is, the faster the algorithm selects the shortest path out of the search space. To put the principle in practice, the algorithm investigates a path graph instead of the quadtree while spreading the path graph on the quadtree as small as possible, and selects fast the shortest collision‐free path out of the path graph as a reasonable collision‐free path. Thus the algorithm fulfils its function fast even in a workspace that has a number of obstacles with complicated shape. In comparison with several conventional path‐planning algorithms presented so far, it is shown from experimental results that the proposed algorithm selects faster a reasonable collision‐free robot path than others.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transportation, as the service of moving commodities between places, plays a unique role in a fully competitive capitalist space-economy. The commodity of transportation is consumed as a part of virtually every economic transaction, linking the production and consumption of a commodity; demand for transportation is derived from spatial configurations rather than being fixed by socially necessary techniques and real wages; and the circulation time taken in transportation is a deduction from capitalists' profits. The impact of circulation time on profits may be calculated precisely. The derived nature of the demand for transportation adds a level of uncertainty to the impact of cost-reducing technical change on profit rates. Given this, cost-reducing and time-reducing technical change in the transportation commodity is one of the few ways of ensuring an increased rate of profit for capitalists, ceteris paribus. The public nature of transportation improvements and the high investments in fixed capital that are required help to explain the central role of the state in capitalism in the improvement of transportation and thus in underwriting capital accumulation. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, Okishio proved that in an economy where wages are constant and realization problems are assumed away, cost-reducing technical changes must raise the rate of profit. Okishio's theorem presents an important challenge to explanations of industrial and regional restructuring that are premised on the theory of the falling rate of profit. In this paper, Okishio's claims are examined under more general conditions, in particular when wages vary to ensure market clearing. The effects of capital-saving and laboursaving technical changes on the rate of profit are examined. It is shown that Okishio's theorem is not as robust as some have claimed. </jats:p>",

The model recreates river flows and materials transported through reservoirs and their tailwaters from 1974 through 1987. Solar radiation, water temperature, phosphorus, nitrogen, suspended solids, and water exchange rates determine primary production. Organic loads from watershed sources, added to primary production, form a trophic base for sportfish forage. Fish production is partitioned into biomass and growth of each age class in sportfish and forage fish groups by differential responses to food type, light, water‐level fluctuation and predation. Fish biomass, with angler population distribution and site condition, contributes to determining angler effort and economic benefits. Model users can vary and analyze water level and quality, stocking, fishing regulations, site access, site facilities, and site entry fees. The model (on floppy disks with a user manual) is available for operation on MS DOS compatible computers with a hard disk. Contact R. M.
