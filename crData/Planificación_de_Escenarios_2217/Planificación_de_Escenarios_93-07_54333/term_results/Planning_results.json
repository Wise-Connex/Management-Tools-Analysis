With the decentralization of health sector management, for example in Kenya, there is a growing need of such assessments at district and sub‐district levels. Can rapid assessments be conducted at affordable cost at these levels? What variables and methods are feasible?</jats:p><jats:p>This paper reports on a rapid health system assessment conducted in rural Kenya during 1991. It required the completion at each health facility of a self‐administered questionnaire which included questions on resources, health care programmes, management, service output, and prominent problems. It also included interviews with officers in charge of each health institution in the sub‐district and an examination of records and reports available at each facility</jats:p><jats:p>The paper presents the range of issues addressed, the indicators used, the methods applied, the problems encountered, the costs of the assessment, and a small selection of the findings. We conclude that the assessment model is manageable at district level with modest planning and analysis support from central level. Field staff need more precise instructions for completion of the questionnaire, and more population‐based estimates need to be calculated. Reassessment taking place every 3–5 years should be adequate for monitoring the process of change in the local health care system.</jats:p>",

During the 1980s, attempts to curb health care expenditure had a limited impact with the liberal and pluralist values of the health system undermining reform strategies. In 1991 the French government introduced a new hospital reform which had four main strands: rationalizing public and private health care provision; introducing a medical logic into the hospital service; increasing hospital autonomy and strengthening participation and involvement in the hospital system. However, these reforms left untouched the financing of the health service. Consequently there remains a need for a more fundamental reform of the management and financing of the French health care system.</jats:p>",

The process is still in the early stages but certain patterns of finance and provision are beginning to emerge in a number of countries. All are implementing payroll‐based social insurance while some are beginning to restrict entitlement to those contributing. There is a danger the process of restructuring will leave many without adequate insurance cover. Market solutions are being introduced in many countries to improve the efficiency of provision. Assuming the administrative cost is not too great, this may improve choice and quality of personal care. It is, however, unclear how far these solutions will tackle the fundamental public health problems endemic in these countries today. Those countries that have been slower to implement reform may benefit from learning from the successes and failures of the pioneers.</jats:p>",

During the period under review, legislation was the predominant planning instrument. Spatial urban planning appears to have been effective during the colonial period largely because of the existence of a clear colonial ideology, a small and economically empowered urban population to plan for, and relatively skilled workers. The urban landscape was thus highly simplified and therefore relatively easy to manage. During the period of political independence, however, urban planning was marked by contradictions within the value system of the elite and, consequently, by severely constrained efforts to enact and implement urban planning legislation, lack of a focused development ideology, a relatively large and mostly impoverished national urban population, and a lack of skilled workers. </jats:p>",

Actual field examples are discussed, comparing past forecasts with observed performances. The apparently weak correlation between advances in technology and forecasting accuracy is assessed. Parallel planning is presented as an approach that can significantly accelerate reservoir forecasts. The recognition of inevitable forecasting uncertainties constitutes the philosophical basis of parallel planning.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>We say that reservoir performance forecasting is not an exact science would be an understatement. Even with all the significant advances occurring across a wide spectrum of related areas, questions still remain regarding the reliability of reservoir predictions. In fact, our efforts today are aimed as much at defining the limits of uncertainty envelopes as at producing forecasts. The discussion here pursues the following questions:What are realistic accuracy expectations in performance forecasts? andAre our conventional thought processes in modeling inherently ill-structured to produce rapid forecasts?</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>By their very nature, EOR processes introduce additional levels of complexity to forecasting. This discussion relates mainly to conventional reservoir systems.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Forecasting Methods and Uncertainty</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Methods and Limits. Current reservoir performance forecasting methods can be classified into two broad categories: empirical and mathematical. This paper focuses on finite-difference methods because they represent the predominant industry-wide vehicle in reservoir evaluations. Empirical methods, such as decline curves, are useful, yet they have a limited application domain.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Continuation of past production practices and mechanisms is a precondition for forecast reliability. Likewise, hybrid methods, while suitable for a wideclass of problems (e.g., miscible, pattern floods) have not yet fully matured to offer a universal forecasting capability.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Lorenz recognized the stochastic nature and hence the inherent limitations of weather forecasting. Lorenz's celebrated \"butterfly effect\" example points to inevitable limits of predictability. The analogies between weather and reservoirs have been noted; specifically, the sensitivity of reservoir performance and hence forecasts to certain geologic parameters (i.e., flow boundary conditions) have been highlighted. This sensitivity suggests that performance forecasts will remain uncertain indefinitely.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Both internal and external reservoir factors contribute to forecast uncertainties (Fig. 1). When model forecasts diverge from actual performance, distinctions among primary causes are sometimes lost. For example, accurate models may produce apparently poor forecasts when presumed field management strategies and facility outlays are not actually implemented as a result of external factors.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>When model forecasts duplicate actual performance, this can also be misinterpreted as model validation. In fact, the duplication could simply reflect compensating errors among the internal and external factors. The point here is that accurate forecasts do not mean accurate models. (The hypothetical corollary also appears noteworthy: poor forecasts do not necessarily equate to poor reservoir models.) The nature of the oil industry limits predictability of external factors, such as exact field operating practices. At best, multiple forecasts need to be developed for a range of external factors. Of the four uncertainty causes in Fig. 1, data quality and mathematical solutions are becoming less pronounced, and reservoir characterization and scale-up present the primary obstacles to improving performance forecasts. The lack of determinism in both external and internal factors suggests only the obvious:all reservoir performance forecasts carry a band of uncertainty. Ballin et al. attempted to quantify this uncertainty for a special class of problems. Haldorsen and Damsleth described a general methodology for producing stochastic forecasts.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Discretization</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Both geostatistical and finite-difference models discretize reservoirs. The two models, however, have dissimilar discretization scales (geostatistical models use inches to several feet; finite-difference models use hundreds of feet). Current and projected hardware and software limitations suggest that the discretization gap between finite-difference and geostatistical models will not disappear for giant fields. Consider the multibillion-barrel ATL/INB field in West Africa. A finite-difference model using 1-ft3 cells will require about 0.5trillion cells. The corresponding figure for the Safaniya field in the MiddleEast is about 7 trillion cells. Cells (1 in.3) will suggest models with roughly800 trillion cells for the ATL/INB field. These numbers imply our indefiniteneed for a scale-up process and hence the resulting uncertainties.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Homogenization</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>An obvious outcome of the scale-up process is homogenization. Porosity/permeability transforms, often used to describe permeability fields, also contribute to homogenized property assignments in simulation models. Fig.2 gives the porosity/permeability core data for the ATL/INB field. This field exhibits a complex lithology of predominantly silica sands intermixed with dolomite. The use of a single-variable transform, represented by the solidline, filters the observed variability in the core data. An alternative approach that would reduce the homogenization effect is the use of \"cloudtransforms\" developed by Kasischke and Williams. Cloud transforms produceproperty representations in models that can mimic distributions observed in real data (e.g., cores or logs). Fig. 3 shows a sample distribution generated by a cloud transform for the Elk Hills 26 R reservoir.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 652^</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

As we have already seen, the performance of the economy in the 1950s seemed to permit analysis from two different perspectives, which yielded two very different sets of conclusions. Comparison with British economic performance in the immediately preceding decades seemed to suggest that the growth rates achieved in the 1950s made that decade one of unparalleled economic success; comparison with the growth rates achieved by competitor countries in the 1950s suggested the period was one of significant, relative economic decline, on a par with what Britain had experienced, especially vis-à-vis Germany, in the years before the First World War. Both lines of analysis were, no doubt, correct as far as they went, but, as the decade progressed, the latter began to impress itself more upon government, as the greater success of other countries became manifest. However, the problem was seen to be not merely that Britain’s rate of economic growth was relatively low, but also that it was uneven.</jats:p>",

My interest comes in part from recognizing the benefits of classroom collaboration, which can give students experience and insight into their own thinking and problem solving. Students also gain emotional support, dialectical opportunities, and mutual commitment (Gebhardt, 1980) as well as preparation for academic and workplace collaboration as they work with the conventions and language of a discourse community and receive feedback (Higgins, 1988). My interest is also understandable given the prevalence of collaborative writing activities in classrooms. For example, nearly half of the respondents (46.5%) in a national survey of university and college business communication teachers indicated that they use collaborative writing in their classes (Bosley, 1989). The use of collaboration is increasingly widespread in many other writing courses as well (see detailed review in DiPardo &amp; Freedman, 1988).</jats:p>",

Sodann wird dargelegt, wie sich im Laufe der letzten Jahrzehnte einerseits die Lage der Eisenbahn in der Substitutionskonkurrenz verschlechtert hat, während andererseits die verkehrlichen Umweltbelastungen zu einem Politikum geworden sind und sich Verkehrsbedarfe wie verkehrliche Produktionsmöglichkeiten gravierend gewandelt haben.Diese Entwicklungen werden im Hinblick auf ihre raumordnungspolitische Bedeutung angesichts einer Eisenbahnpolitik betrachtet, welche vor allem finanzwirtschaftliche Sanierungsziele verfolgt. Nachdem negative raumwirtschaftliche Folgen einer Fortsetzung dieser Politik skizziert sind, werden Elemente einer alternativen Eisenbahnpolitik herausgearbeitet. Diese muß im Interesse der Unterstützung anderer Politikgebiete, so des Umweltschutzes und der Raumordnung, darauf abstellen, die Bahn in großem Maße wettbewerbsfähig zu machen, wenn auf dirigistische Verkehrslenkung verzichtet werden soll. Dafür müßten gleichsam „künstliche“ vermeidbare verkehrs-, unternehmens und gewerkschaftspolitische Ursachen der gegenwärtigen Wettbewerbsuntüchtigkeit der Bahn erfolgreich bekämpft werden.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Daß Stadtentwicklungsplanung immer schon veränderten Rahmenbedingungen und Anforderungen ausgesetzt war, zeigt der Vergleich von in der Vergangenheit zu diesem Thema erstellten Planwerken mit den tatsächlich eingetretenen Realitäten. Durch die Wiedervereinigung hat diese Unsicherheit eine zusätzliche Dimension und durch die aktuell negative Konjunkturentwicklung einen nicht gerade optimistischen Rahmen bekommen.Veränderte Anforderungen werden heute aber auch von Planern selbst an Entwicklungsplanung gestellt. Gerade vor dem Hintergrund der akuten Unübersichtlichkeit muß sie sich auf verschiedene mögliche Entwicklungsalternativen einstellen, kann nicht erst einen langen Planungszyklus abarbeiten und dann die Entwicklung auf sich zukommen lassen. Gerade jetzt sollte ein Plan nicht nur für das Bücherregal bestimmt sein. Stadtentwicklung will die Umsetzung mitdenken und angehen.Dazu wird diese Planung in Flensburg aktuell viel stärker als in der Vergangenheit als ein kommunikativer Prozeß organisiert, der in seinen Ansatz recht früh auch Akteure außerhalb der Verwaltung einzubinden sucht. Das Ziel, zu einer Kooperation zu kommen, soll in der Folge an konkreten Pilotprojekten quasi „erlernbar“ werden. Die vorhandenen Teilkonzepte zur Stadtentwicklung und Flächennutzungsplanung werden dabei selbst als Instrumente eingesetzt, indem bestimmte gewünschte Entwicklungsvorstellungen an private Kooperationspartner herangetragen und als Projekte konsequent angestoßen und angeschoben werden.Auf seiten der Verwaltung verschwimmt damit die klare Aufgaben- und Kompetenzunterscheidung von Stadtplanung und Stadtentwicklung, von Stadtentwicklungs- und Flächennutzungsplanung, von Planung, Moderation und Projektmanagement. Resultat ist ein komplexes Geflecht von Konzepten, Plänen und Projekten. Diese Tendenz wird in der aktuellen Diskussion um Stadtentwicklungsplanung als „Strategische Planung“ thematisiert, ein Ansatz, der sich noch stärker – und das ist nicht nur ein Nebeneffekt – an den vorhandenen Strukturen von Verwaltung reibt als die in der Vergangenheit schon nicht konfliktfreie Forderung nach interdisziplinärer, fach(ämter)übergreifender Planung und Problembearbeitung.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die bislang im Rahmen der Gemeinschaftsaufgabe „Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur“ praktizierte Regionalpolitik kann kurz als Strategie des mittleren Weges bezeichnet werden. Die Strategie des mittleren Weges versucht durch die räumlich und örtlich konzentrierte Förderung von v. a. gewerblich-industriellen Investitionen und von wirtschaftsnaher Infrastruktur, in strukturschwachen und ländlich geprägten bzw. peripheren Gebieten sich selbst tragende Wachstums- und Entwicklungszentren zu schaffen, die gleichermaßen der gesamtwirtschaftlichen Wachstumssteigerung, der strukturellen Stabilisierung und dem großräumigen Ausgleich der Lebensumstände zu dienen imstande sind. Sie folgt damit einem Entwicklungsmuster, das auf der Vorstellung bestimmter Gesetzmäßigkeiten für die regionale Entwicklung, also einer „Normalstrukturhypothese“, beruht.Bei einer Betrachtung ihrer Ergebnisse zeigt sich, daß ihre Annahmen bezüglich der regionalen Entwicklung und damit auch die Ausgestaltung ihrer Instrumente und Maßnahmen der Realität räumlicher Entwicklung nicht gerecht werden. Im Gegenteil, das Festhalten an einem überkommenen regionalpolitischen Denkschema forciert die in den letzten Jahren immer deutlicher werdenden räumlichen Entwicklungstendenzen, die als fortschreitende regionale Differenzierung bezeichnet werden können, in einer für die Problemregionen bedenklichen Weise.Eine konsequente Umgestaltung der Gemeinschaftsaufgabe in eine wirksame entwicklungspotentialorientierte Regionalpolitik setzt eine Betrachtung der einzelnen regionalpolitischen Strategieempfehlungen, die in diesem Zusammenhang aufgeworfen wurden, voraus. Dabei zeigt sich, daß die entwicklungspotentialorientierte Regionalpolitik bestandsorientiert ist, primär zum Einsatz qualitativ wirksamer Maßnahmen rät und die Auswirkungen der funktionalen Zusammenhänge zwischen den Regionen berücksichtigt.Die wichtigsten Ansatzpunkte der entwicklungspotentialorientierten Regionalpolitik im Rahmen einer Gesamtstrategie zur Regionalentwicklung liegen im Bereich der produktionsorientierten Dienstleistungen, in der Aus- und Weiterbildung der Arbeitnehmer, in der Förderung von Innovation und Diffusion und im Auf- und Ausbau der haushaltsnahen sowie der Telekommunikations- und Informationsinfrastruktur. Vor der Implementierung eines neuen Konzeptes der Förderungsgrundsätze der GRW muß das Konzept der Regionalpolitik erweitert werden. Es müssen außerdem spezifische regionale Entwicklungsziele festgelegt werden und es muß eine Konzentration der regionalpolitischen Instrumente und Maßnahmen auf die Verbesserung von regionalwirtschaftlichen Rahmenbedingungen erfolgen.</jats:p>"

Menschen. Die Spielräume für eine rasche Integration dieser starken Zunahme sind in einer Reihe von Agglomerationen begrenzt, da das planerisch abgesicherte, erschlossene und marktverfügbare Baulandangebot nahezu ausgeschöpft ist und kurz- wie mittelfristig große Schwierigkeiten bestehen, neues Bauland im nötigen Umfang bereitzustellen.Diese (neue) Ausgangssituation in den alten Ländern verlangt nach einer konsequenten Dezentralisierungspolitik sowohl auf einer überregionalen Ebene (stadtregionale Außenentwicklung) als auch in den Stadtregionen selbst (stadtregionale Innenentwicklung). Zwangsläufig geraten damit mittelstädtische Regionen und Mittelstädte wieder stärker ins Blickfeld von Raumordnung und Städtebau.Mittelstädte – als „goldene Mitte“ zwischen Stadt und Land – kennzeichnet insbesondere die Kombination „Vorteile der Metropolen ohne ihre Nachteile“ plus „Vorteile des ländlichen Raumes ohne seine Nachteile“. Gelingt es, diese Konzeption zu verwirklichen, können sowohl der von den Metropolen ausgehende weitere flächenhafte Suburbanisierungsprozeß als auch eine weitere disperse Siedlungsentwicklung in verstädterten Räumen vermieden werden.Maßnahmen und Instrumente zur Umsetzung dieser Konzeption verlangen nach einer verstärkten, aktiven Rolle der Bundesraumordnung und Landesplanung und nach einer Bündelung aller Förderinstrumente, die geeignet sind, regionale und örtliche Standortbedingungen im Hinblick auf die räumliche und soziale Integration eines erheblichen künftigen Bevölkerungszuwachses zu verbessern und auszubauen.Die Umsetzung und Verwirklichung von Konzepten der dezentralen Konzentration trägt einer raumordnungs- und städtebaupolitischen Problemanalyse Rechnung, die den künftig zu erwartenden Bevölkerungszuwachs und dessen Integration nicht in erster Linie als Mengen-, sondern als (räumliches) Verteilungsproblem betrachtet.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Human diet planning is generally carried out by selecting the food items or groups of food items to be used in the diet and then calculating the composition. If nutrient quantities do not reach the desired nutritional requirements, foods are exchanged or quantities altered and the composition recalculated. Iterations are repeated until a suitable diet is obtained. This procedure is cumbersome and slow and often leads to compromises in composition of the final diets. A computerized model, planning diets for humans at minimum cost while supplying all nutritional requirements, maintaining nutrient relationships and preserving eating practices is presented. This is based on a mixed-integer linear-programming algorithm. Linear equations were prepared for each nutritional requirement. To produce linear equations for relationships between nutrients, linear transformations were performed. Logical definitions for interactions such as the frequency of use of foods, relationships between exchange groups and the energy content of different meals were defined, and linear equations for these associations were written. Food items generally eaten in whole units were defined as integers. The use of this program is demonstrated for planning diets using a large selection of basic foods and for clinical situations where nutritional intervention is desirable. The system presented begins from a definition of the nutritional requirements and then plans the foods accordingly, and at minimum cost. This provides an accurate, efficient and versatile method of diet formulation.</jats:p>",

New projects benefit from the “experience” as other projects complete and update the knowledge system. All projects benefit from plans that are developed better, faster, and cheaper and the subsequent uniform development environment facilitates staff mobility.</jats:p>",

The influences of context on process, and context and process on outcomes were estimated using regression. The results indicate that a number of contextual variables strongly influence aspects of the project planning and implementation process, and then indirectly influence project outcomes through the planning and implementation process.

IMPICT explicitly considers capacity constraints and total system cost (including tardiness) to determine order sizes, order release/due dates, and operation schedules in a deterministic, multi‐level, finite horizon, dynamic demand environment. Continuous time scheduling variables allow setups to be carried over from one period to the next.</jats:p><jats:p>Three new heuristics built on the IMPICT framework are presented and tested in a simulation‐based, full‐factorial experiment with a wide variety of problem environments. The benchmark for the experiment was materials requirements planning with operations sequencing (MRP/OS) implemented with best‐case, fixed planned lead times. The experiment showed that all three heuristics were statistically better than MRP/OS. The total cost for the order merging (OM) heuristic was 25 percent better than the total cost for MRP/OS. Computational times for OM were substantially larger than for MRP/OS; however, the computational times in the experiment suggest that OM is still computationally viable for large‐scale batch manufacturing environments found in industry.</jats:p><jats:p>IMPICT is superior to standard MRP systems because it explicitly considers capacity constraints and total system costs when it creates a materials plan. IMPICT is superior to linear programming‐based approaches to finite loading and scheduling found in the literature because it allows setups to be carried over from one period to another and because it is computationally viable for realistic‐sized problems.</jats:p>",

Operations personnel have already verified the accuracy of the hydraulic simulator, which enabled them to resolve an operational problem involving a low‐pressure system response. The ISS has been demonstrated for initial system studies, for verification of the transfer mechanism, and for actual storage management studies during unexpected drought strains on the system in the summer of 1992. Emergency training through return of data from the simulator to the SCADA system has been delayed. The training will enable an operator to simulate a main break, for example, and practice alternative responses by manipulating a system of remotely controlled isolation valves. Using the ISS, operators can become familiar with unusual conditions before they occur in the real system, which began operation in January 1992.</jats:p>",

The subpopulation differed with respect not only to life-cycle stages and household economic resources but also to stated housing preferences and future housing plans. For example, previous renters were found to be younger households in the earlier stages of the life cycle who purchased lower priced condominiums with more borrowed funds than previous homeowners. A proportion of previous renters, however, were found to be entering the condominium sector late in life. Previous owners, the majority of whom moved from the freehold ownership market, preferred condominium ownership as means of gaining greater physical security and less direct maintenance responsibilities and, therefore, searched for only condominium housing. On the other hand, tenants sought initially to gain entrance into the freehold ownership market before deciding on the purchase of condominiums. Previous tenants are planning to use the equity of their condominiums to move into single detached houses within a short period of time, whereas for previous owners the condominium sector presents a final stage in housing demand. It is concluded that life-cycle stages and household economic resources continue to dominate a household's tenure transition, but this must also be combined with tenure and housing preferences as well as long-term or future housing plans. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The current restructuring of agriculture has resulted in many farm families adjusting their business activities as part of a survival or accumulation strategy. Considerable attention has been paid to the nonconventional methods farm businesses employ to raise income, being conceptualised variously as ‘farm diversification’, ‘part-time farming’ and ‘pluriactivity’ . These terms incorporate a complex multitude of possible options, the nature of which has led to significant differences in the interpretations of such concepts. In the first part of this paper the conceptual debate which is emerging in the literature is reviewed, with some advantages and disadvantages associated with each term highlighted. It is suggested that an analytical distinction between farm-centred diversification and off-farm employment, within the broader pluriactivity of farm households, can help to provide a focus for empirical work. To provide an illustrative example, some insights from the developing political economy of agriculture are drawn upon to investigate the extent to which farm family businesses with one major form of farm-centred diversification (farm-based accommodation) have further diversified the business. The final stage is to examine whether legal operators also hold any off-farm employment, with a consideration of both the nature of that employment and the relationship with business structure and accommodation type. The limitations of this approach are recognised, particularly the gender-bias implications, but it aids an initial exploration of relations between alternative farm-centred and off-farm activities of pluriactive farm businesses. Findings show that farm-based accommodation does little to prevent operators going off the farm to find employment, with small-sized farm businesses particularly pressurised. Further research into specific options can contribute to an understanding of the dynamics of households engaged in pluriactive strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Russian government has launched a privatization program with the aim of creating a housing market in place of administrative allocation. Very few, including reformers at the top level of government, realize the economic, social, and political value of housing reforms. At this stage, their goals are very narrow: to free the state of its construction and maintenance burden, and to collect revenues from real-estate owners to support the activities of local governments. These reforms yield little, if anything, given cumbersome and contradictory private-ownership laws, power squabbles between interest groups at different levels of the local and federal governments, and resistance at the grass roots. For the above reasons any market-oriented policies although effective in the countries of the ex-socialist block, may be impossible in Russia. Thus, in St Petersburg, the second largest Russian city, a short-lived privatization program collapsed in early 1993. In this urban community, as in a microcosm, the interaction of political, economic, and social factors is reflected, which sheds light upon urban affairs in a broader context of a postsocialist Russia. A number of questions are asked in this paper. What is behind the all-Russian privatization program? What forces are pushing for reforms and who opposes them? Will privatization relieve the housing crisis, and is it a workable alternative to the centrally administered housing-allocation system? </jats:p>",

The problem considers the collision between any link of the robotic manipulator and the time-varying obstacle. The information on the motion and shape change of the obstacle is given prior to robot motion planning. To facilitate the problem, we analyze and formulate it mathematically in a robot joint space. We then introduce the view-time concept and analyze its properties. Using the properties of the <jats:italic>view-time</jats:italic>, a view-time based motion planning method is proposed. The view-time based method plans the robot motion by units of the view-time. In every view-time, it uses a stationary obstacle avoidance scheme. The proposed method is applied to the motion planning of a 2 DOF robotic manipulator in an environment with a polyhedral moving obstacle.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many parts of the developing world investment in water resources takes a large proportion of the available public investment funds. As the conflicts for funds between the water and other sectors become more severe, the traditional ways of analyzing and planning water investments has to move away from project‐by‐project (or even a river basin‐by‐river basin) approaches to include the relationships of water investments to other sectors and to overall national development policies. Current approaches to water resources investments are too narrow. There is a need for ways to expand the strategic thinking of water sector managers. This paper develops a water resources planning methodology with the primary objective of giving insights into the linking of water sector investments and macroeconomic policies. The model optimizes the present value of investments for water resources development, while embedding a macroeconomic model into the framework to allow for an examination of the interactions between water investments, the growth in the agricultural sector, and the performance of the overall economy. A case study of Bangladesh is presented which shows how strategic thinking could lead to widely differing implications for water investments than would conventional water resources systems planning models.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Seismic stratigraphic and seismic fault evidence both show that the Central Chukchi basin is a north-trending, fault-controlled basin, which developed at the beginning of early Mississippian time. About 20 km thickness of sediments have been deposited in the basin. Using a simple flexural model a series of 3-dimensional basement motion patterns with time was produced. From these characteristic patterns two stages of basement evolution can be recognized: the first is basement subsidence controlled by regional extensional fault systems during the period from early Mississippian to later Jurassic: the second stage is basement evolution as two nearly separate blocks from the beginning of Early Cretaceous. The west block development is related to reactivation of the old fault system, while the subsidence of the east block is caused by tectonism and associated sediment loading due to progressive thrusting northward of the Brooks Range. </jats:p><jats:p> Quantitative basin modeling techniques show that many uncertainties occur when applying mathematical and computer models to simulate a sedimentary basin, especially in a frontier area where only limited data are available. In this study, quantitative basin modeling techniques applied to the Chukchi Sea Planning Area, Alaska, demonstrate how uncertainty can be handled. The Chukchi Sea Planning Area encompasses about 127,000 square kilometers of the northwestern Alaska continental shelf and lies offshore of the Natural Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. Only seismic data and a few remote onshore wells are available in the Planning Area. Compared with the North Slope of Alaska, the Planning Area has had a significantly different structural history. In addition, most of the strata in the Area are currently thermally mature to overmature and in the stage of generating dry gas. The prospective areas for oil are the margins of the central Chukchi Basin, such as the Chukchi platform, Herald Arch and northeast part of the basin. </jats:p>",
