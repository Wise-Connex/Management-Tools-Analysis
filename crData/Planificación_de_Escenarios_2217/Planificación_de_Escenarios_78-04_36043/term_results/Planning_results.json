Planning methods need to take these restrictions into explicit consideration if they are to be useful. This paper discusses the first set of restrictions in connection with the analysis of economic planning in France and Sweden. The ‘degree of plannedness' (manner and extent of planning) is related to the extent of governmental control with regard to the plan itself, its construction, and its implementation. The second set of restrictions is either of legal and ‘regulatory’ nature or defined by the economic relationship between the central and the local government. Thus municipal plans in a mixed economy become a flexible guide to municipal policymaking rather than a control instrument over municipal development. </jats:p>",

To ensure flexibility, the problem solver consists of an interpreter driven by a theorem prover which actually manipulates formulas of the language. Many examples of the use of the system six given. including an extended treatment of the world of blocks. Limitations and extensions of the system are discussed at length.

Many generalisations have also been made about the attitudes of local authorities to these large‐scale units, and some leading hypermarket operators have made bitter accusations against local authorities for endlessly protracted planning negotiations which inevitably lead to increased construction costs. But little information has been gathered up to now (so far as we know) on the precise attitudes of planning authorities, and little attempt has been made to define the highly variable range of responses which they have expressed over the years. This study by Jennifer Sumner and Keri Davies of St David's University College sets out to throw light on this murky area. The broad trend is one of increasing acceptance of the superstore, but not of the hypermarket. In general the attitude to large‐scale retailing developments seems vague and non‐committal, with some councils adopting the attitude of “we won't worry about the problem until it arises.” But the authors believe that trends are changing and that, with further co‐operation between developers and planning authorities, an agreeable compromise could be made.</jats:p>",

Data for administrative and financial control are being confused with data needed for policy and planning purposes. Data systems are designed without due regard to practicality cost and need. A dubious passion for all purpose systems obscures the necessary role of special data sampling projects and special analyses in throwing light upon choices for the future. Planners and policy makers continue to act as if projection methods appropriate for the fifties are still sufficient for the future. Procedures for the development of information systems are being left to people who tend to be preoccupied with day-to-day and technical concerns, unrestrained by university and government policy makers who prefer to ignore or refuse to see that the gathering and presenting of statistical information acts directly on the policy and planning process. The demonstrated lack of interest by most senior leaders in government and in the universities in the assumptions, methods and procedures involved in collecting and analyzing information is illustrated by the failure of both universities and governments to develop separate or joint capacities for continuing analysis on a national basis of what is happening and why. Substantial work done at the provincial and regional level is not brought together for examination from a national perspective. If the universities do not themselves take corrective action, this failure will progressively reinforce the \"provincialization\" of universities so much deplored by academic leaders as being antithetical to the basic nature of authentic universities. The data needs associated with control should become the responsibility of provincial jurisdictions while the resources of Statistics Canada and the energy of AUCC should be oriented to policy information relating to global, national and interprovincial questions.</jats:p>"

It is assumed that much foresight about the future of a spatial population system can be gained by studying the dynamic implications of a fixed matrix of empirically estimated demographic rates. </jats:p><jats:p> The analysis reveals that during the period 1966–1971 the Canadian spatial population system had very strong growth potential, over 40% of which was due to foreign net immigration, and that the system's long-run redistributional trend is: (1) a continued dominance by Ontario; (2) a strong westward-shifting potential; (3) a drastic reduction in Quebec's competitiveness; (4) a substantial increase in the mean age of every regional subpopulation, except in the North; and (5) a switch from male to female dominance. It is also shown that the convergence toward the long-run distribution can be divided into two stages: First a quick convergence toward relatively smooth regional age profiles, and then a slow but persistent spatial convergence. </jats:p>",

But telecommunications is a complex and highly interactive process, and if the best use is to be made of the opportunities presented, a framework of definitions is required for the coordinated development of systems. Following extensive studies of the definitions required, the Post Office and its principal suppliers are developing a family of standard switching and associated systems, collectively known as System X. Based upon digital, software and micro-electronic technologies, System X is intended to increase the cost-effectiveness and evolutionary capabilities of the British network, with designs that are fully competitive on world markets. The definitions used for System X cover customer service and network interworking requirements, systems architecture, and a range of design standards and procedures. The arrangements enable vital interactions to take place between production and operational interests, and between the definition and design processes. System X is part of an overall systems strategy that is being progressively created. It links System X with other developments, in terms both of service performance and technical standards. In all its aspects, strategic systems planning is expected to lead to the creation, in cost-effective ways, of basic capabilities providing hitherto unattainable opportunities for extending telecommunications services, increasingly in a global context. The continuing reconciliation of global needs and local aspirations in telecommunications represents perhaps the greatest challenge to strategic systems planners worldwide.</jats:p>",

No company is reported to be using it. This paper hypothesizes that the reason for this failure may be a very simple one: the incremental benefit of aggregate planning (i.e., the coordinated optimization of aggregate work force, production, and inventory) over improved aggregate inventory management alone may be quite small. To demonstrate our hypothesis we reexamine the original paint company cost comparisons presented by HMMS, and show that virtually all of the LDR's reported saving over paint company management could have been obtained with a one time adjustment in management's aggregate buffer inventory level. We conclude that although the LDR might provide significantly larger savings than improved aggregate inventory management alone, published empirical results fail to demonstrate that potential. The implications of our hypothesis and conclusions are discussed. </jats:p>",

This theory indicates that a test of the spatial separability of the utilities may be performed by examining the degree of transitivity in probabilities and gross flows that is predicted by the spatial-interaction models. United States migration data for four periods between 1935 and 1970 were examined for transitivity at three spatial scales of resolution. These flows all exhibited significantly high degrees of transitivity, although for no period or scale of resolution were migration flows completely without some statistically significant intransitivities in either the probabilities or gross flows. The regions involved in intransitivities varied greatly from period to period, and only weak evidence indicated lower degrees of intransitivity for local aggregates of regions. The hypothesis of spatially separable utilities must be rejected for the migration data examined. Theoretical discussion indicates that several causes may lead to intransitivities, which in turn lead to problems in applying spatial-interaction models to migration data. </jats:p>",

They include revenue and facility-size balancing, a differential-equation representation of profit maximisation, and mathematical-programming formulations. The different methods turn out to be closely related but offer different and complementary insights. Some dynamic properties of such equilibrium points are explored, including the identification of circumstances which generate discrete changes for smooth changes in parameters. A number of possible algorithms for calculating the points are described. </jats:p>",
