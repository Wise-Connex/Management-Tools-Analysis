It urges all those interested in the development of planning theory and practice, in whatever sphere, to move right outside the nineteenth century, positivistic research tradition, which has hitherto dominated their intellectual efforts, and draw support for their attempts to advance planning on both the theoretical and practical fronts from an intellectual milieu which is more characteristic of our own times, namely, that of existentialism. </jats:p>",

Many are lacking in the attitudes and skills which will be the foundation for future occupational success.

It is an honour to be invited to give a lecture which commemorates the work of an outstanding educator, Des English. To have the needs of special education brought directly to the attention of the Curriculum Development Centre in this way is timely and may well give a focus and an impetus to our thus far modest efforts in this direction. It is noteworthy that the conference has provided for a number of curriculum workshops in which particular dimensions of needs can be addressed. It is important that in those workshops specific needs are related systematically to overall curriculum design and development questions. There is added reason for this in the criticism within special education of the historic tendency to define and categorise qualities and conditions of need according to narrow or highly particularised criteria instead of setting curriculum tasks within a broad framework of aims and a wide and open definition of learning situations. This is perfectly understandable in view of the history of special education and the fact that we are concerned with a particular dimension and aspects of learning. There are institutional constraints, too, which are acknowledged in the Warnock Committee’s statement:</jats:p>",

Although this individual holds the key to the profitability of a specific product, little has been done to aid the process planner in the performance of his job. With the cost of machinery skyrocketing as the degree of automation is increasing, much emphasis has been placed on process planning or engineering. This paper outlines the responsibilities and functions carried out by the process planner. The paper is primarily concerned with automated manufacturing systems and, in particular, the planning of parts on machining centers. It demonstrates the decisions required of process planner and the lack of quantifiable data available to make logical decisions at the present time. A review of the two approaches to automated process planning, called variant and generative planning, is presented. The paper also describes some of the shortcomings of classification codes that have been used for automated process planning. The framework for a computer generative process planning scheme is demonstrated. The selection of machining parameters (feed, speed and depth of cut) are also discussed.</jats:p>",

To date there has not been a review of the EIS process in terms of airports. This paper evaluates the overall process of review as it has been practical. A series of 100 airport master plans was evaluated in terms of noise impact and control. Further consideration was given to the implementation of these control strategies. Land use control was specifically addressed. Results show that noise does not consistently get evaluated in airport master planning. In those situations where noise is recognized, land-use compatibility is not always recommended. It was further found that the requirements of land-use assurance agreements in the long run do not insure that compatible development will result. Recommendations are made to strengthen this present weakness. [Work in part supported by EPA.]</jats:p>",

Households are classified into five different categories, and each is subject to a transition matrix, the elements of which are functions of the changing availability of housing stock and job supply, and the different preferences for these of the different households categories. </jats:p><jats:p> A three-zone concentric configuration was used, and the model was calibrated for the South-East standard region with the use of data for 1961, 1966, 1971, and 1976. The model was then run until 1991 with alternative combinations of projections of strategic exogenous variables such as transport costs, job supply, and housing stock availability. Although the model appears oversensitive to the changes in the number of households in each zone and arrives at an equilibrium distribution quickly, it suggests a research strategy to determine the nature of the elements of the transition matrices. The model also illustrates that it is possible to use the dynamic accounting framework of kinetic theory to embody any given hypothesis of movement. </jats:p>",

Yet such methods as the repertory grid, although invaluable for investigating individuals, make comparisons across a wider group difficult. The multidimensional scaling program PREFMAP possesses this facility through its assumption of a group cognitive space whose dimensions, while common to all, have different saliences for different individuals. This study tests the feasibility of using PREFMAP to study perceived attributes of shopping centres. A broad, though not exact, commonality of dimensions appears to exist. Values of subjects' saliences on PREFMAP dimensions are further shown to be related to variations in shopping behaviour, but until multidimensional scaling can be related to a theory of cognition it will not realise its potential for behavioural studies. </jats:p>",

By exploiting factor analytic methods to generate a set of qualitative or generalized attribute indices, interest is centred not only upon the significance of these indices, but also upon the components of each index. With data obtained from a San Francisco Bay Area Travel Survey, multinomial logit analysis is employed to estimate the model. Moreover, to identify the differential influence of generalized attributes, the model is separately estimated for suburban and central city subsamples and, in the latter case, a simultaneous destination–mode choice model is developed. The results demonstrate that generalized attributes derived from attitudinal information are significant inputs into an individual's choice of shopping area. In addition, policies which focus upon the time, safety, and parking availability components vis-à-vis comfort aspects of the shopping excursion will be more effective in obtaining desired changes in the existing pattern of travel. </jats:p>",

Special attention is given to the organizational pattern of the agricultural sector and to agricultural policy making and implementation. The main conclusion of the article is that, for harmonious development of production and use of food, there is need for uniform economic policy and integrated economic planning which cover all sectors of the food complex. Such a role cannot be played by agricultural policy alone. The author describes the integrated program of food economy development for the years 1975–1990 in Poland and gives some theoretical bases for policy in the food economy.</jats:p><jats:p>Cet article contient la description du complexe de l'économie agro‐alimentaire en Pologne, de sa structure interne, sa signification et sa place dans l'économie nationale, des effets productifs et des relations avec d'autres branches de l'économie nationale.

Wilson and Batty et al have shown how ad hoc algorithms could be used to modify the usual singly-constrained gravity model, whereas recently Jefferson and Scott have used geometric programming techniques to ensure that the inequality constraints are satisfied. This work develops an approach suggested by Dacey and Norcliffe whereby the inequality constraints are incorporated into the expression for the system entropy. The entropy-maximising method and the more rigorous statistical derivation considered in the paper lead to implicit expressions for the zonal populations which can be evaluated by means of a given algorithm. The asymptotic properties of the model and the inclusion of attractiveness factors are also considered. An interesting feature of this model is that it contains as special cases Wilson's doubly-constrained model and singly-constrained model. </jats:p>",

The primary advantage of this technique is that resource acquisition lead times as well as inventory records are integrated into the process of computing the project schedule. This paper presents a set of formal CPM/MRP algorithms that may be used to compute the early and late start schedules as well as the critical sequence. A number of modifications have been incorporated into the CPM/MRP technique to improve the viability of CPM/MRP as a tool for application to actual project scheduling problems. A simple example project is used to demonstrate the CPM/MRP model.</jats:p><jats:p>The CPM/MRP technique is designed to overcome a basic shortcoming of previously suggested project scheduling methodologies. CPM was initially designed to schedule projects subject to technological constraints only. Later, additional techniques were introduced to consider constraints upon various aspects of resource availability (Davis). None of the suggested techniques attempted to integrate resource acquisition lead time with the generation of requirements for resources. Obviously such a technique would require the integration of inventory records into the scheduling technique.</jats:p><jats:p>The combination of CPM and MRP provides a possible vehicle for overcoming this drawback in CPM. Both CPM and MRP are linear models that generate schedules based upon precedence relationships. An integrated approach is useful since activities could be scheduled subject to information about the inventory position. An activity may be scheduled as soon as all resources are on hand. It is only delayed by those resources which must be acquired and activities which proceed it in the project network.</jats:p><jats:p>CPM/MRP also shows promise as an aid to constrained resource scheduling since computations regarding resource availability are an integrated part of the technique. The effect of resource allocation decisions is immediately evident in the MRP‐type time phased records.</jats:p><jats:p>Results of the tests run on short projects of up to 300 activities and resources have shown that the program does work satisfactorily. Execution time for a 300 item network tested was approximately ten seconds on a CYBER 175.</jats:p>",
