      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines Lacan’s psychoanalytically derived social theory as to its appropriateness for understanding aspects of planning practice. Lacan theorized not only about language and culture, but also about that which resides outside of symbolization and underlies human desire, to provide an understanding of human subjectivity, identity and motivation. We discuss how a Lacanian critical social theoretical approach could be pertinent to analysis of the complex mixture of hybrid processes – technical, collaborative and political – that comprise planning development assessment. We outline key Lacanian concepts including the mirror-stage, jouissance, the Four Discourses and the ‘big Other’ and their applicability to understanding development assessment and regulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this article is to explore the role of politics in planning and the highly political role of planners. The structure planning process for Flanders illustrates that planners are an active force in enabling change and that political decision-making is a process of its own with its own actors. Interviews with key political actors allow unravelling the planning process from the perspective of the political class. The case brings powerful informal arenas to the open and documents power plays involving planners and politicians. The case also illustrates that much of the actual planning discourse is at odds with the rationale of some politicians. </jats:p>",

Most influential in this regard has been Francis Fukuyama’s End of History ideology and its progenies – or mutations – such as the Third Way. A close reading of their proponents (especially Anthony Giddens) and critics (Perry Anderson, Pierre Bourdieu, Alex Callinicos, John Gray and others) with reference to the contrasting political-economic theories of Friedrich von Hayek and Karl Polanyi, however, reveals the fundamental contradictions of neoliberalism – especially between capitalism and democracy – and identifies for progressive planning the role of extending radical democracy to the realms of the state and the economy. </jats:p>",

The article is a case study of Newark, New Jersey's, efforts to construct a resource recovery facility as the cornerstone of their industrial development policy. This innovative approach to economic development was replete with the rhetoric of “closed-loop” systems similar to the current proposals for developing a sustainable employment and economic base for cities. Despite the emphasis on environmentally sound economic development, the resource recovery experiment was both an economic and environmental debacle. Several of the assumptions that guided resource recovery as a mechanism for revitalization continue to inform planning. </jats:p>",

Toward developing such a framework, the authors conceptualize globalization as the removal of political and physical barriers for the free movement of capital, people, information, and culture among nations and propose that the removal of such barriers have consequences on the cities of the third world. These consequences, the authors suggest, are expressed in the configuration of urban space, urban form, and urbanism in the third world. The authors look at those four agencies of globalization (movement of capital, people, information, and culture) and their effects. The goal of the article is to offer a critical framework for reviewing contemporary literature on globalization and third world urban form.</jats:p>",

Less known is the past history of this conception of towns that combines the advantages of the city and the landscape. This article unfolds how firmly this notion was rooted in a tradition of enlightened thinking and planning. It is outlined by some of its most expressive milestones. Nowadays, almost-forgotten projects such as John Sinclair's “ideal village” and John Claudius Loudon's plan for London place the Garden City in a different and more complex light and indicate that Howard could count on an existing understanding of his concerns. </jats:p>",

Environmental planner Elpidio Rocha was hired to design a pedestrian mall that included abstract sculptural forms. In the context of deindustrialization and suburbanization, however, urban renewal did not halt downtown decline and local political interests dismantled the pedestrian mall, setting the stage for a new round of redevelopment. </jats:p>",

It begins with comments on the state of the telecom industry and draws attention to elements of technological and product convergence, highlighting the point that while industry convergence on digital technology is a fact, today’s mobile telephony marketplace is nonetheless characterised by three generations of technology and the latest generation, 3G, embraces three related but competing standards. The paper examines 2G, 2 and a half G and 3G developments around the world and identifies factors relevant to the marketing of 3G, including recognition of geographical and user diversity and the consequent need for marketers to keep these various user perspectives in mind. There is recognition of the financial pressure on telephone operators and of the sometimes emotional and fickle preferences of telephone users. However, customer desire for personalisation, including personalised 3G services, are important features of the marketplace, as will be the availability of simple, secure payment systems.</jats:p>",

Although these approaches have failed to produce evidence of systematic change among clients, this should not lead to the conclusion that research has failed to identify effective methods of intervention. This chapter reviews demonstration research that examines the operation of the child welfare system from an organizational level. The interventions of this research were meant to change the operation of the system altogether in order to meet the needs of clients and to achieve policy goals.</jats:p>",

An important aim of the investigation was to establish whether the presence of certain factors known to affect the extent of competition (and by implication the intensity of CA) in purely commercial markets similarly influenced organisations in the charity sector. Conversely, internal stakeholder resistance to the idea that charities should compete against each other did not appear to modify the sample organisations’ actual CA behaviours in any way.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every year the major German cities are losing inhabitants through the suburbanisation of their urban fringe. The study of seven major cities reveals an annual negative migration balance of about 0.5% of the total population between 1981 and 2000. Thus approximately 10% of the urban population migrated to the surrounding countryside in 20 years. Suburbanisation is an essential reason for the ratio of population-related housing completions, in which the inner city brings considerably fewer dwellings onto the market — with a ratio of 1∶1.7 — in comparison with the urban fringe. The building type of so-called “single-family” and “two-family” houses plays a special role in the process of suburbanisation. The study illustrates the greater attractiveness of the urban fringe and the scarce availability of building sites in the inner cities for the construction of single-family and two-family houses: as a result, the population-related housing completions in urban fringe areas are four to five times higher than in the city centre.</jats:p>"

Several methods used with full text search engines to improve different aspects of information quality, are demonstrated and described based on our constructive work, implementing Business Technology portals. Relevancy of information was improved with several used methods and reliability by structured searches with meta‐information and by reduced information space. Recentness of information was improved with push technology. As conclusion, full‐text search engines increase the information quality by filtering information, however recentness of information and analyzed information are more difficult aspects to improve than relevancy and reliability.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the short-term regional economic effect of universities. The methodology used differs substantially from previous studies as it focuses on the additional resources attracted to the region by the establishment of universities. The effects of the attracted resources are therefore related to the basic financing provided by the federal state (Land). We call these relations the regional rates of return on university financing. We demonstrate the regional rates of return using the experience of the Otto-von-Guericke-University Magdeburg and the college of higher education Magdeburg-Stendal as examples. The results indicate that the financing of universities is an effective means to create both jobs and economic prosperity. In turn, the reduction of public funding for universities causes substantial opportunity costs for the region, even in the short term.</jats:p>"

The study aims to improve understanding in order to inform the revision of regional planning polices and suggest practical guidance for local authorities to implement such policies. Wide technical consultation was carried out with the Environment Agency, local planning authorities and development agencies. Threshold Assessment was investigated as a technique to assess the potential impacts on the environment of various levels of forecast growth within selected parts of the region. Initial results indicate the need for more strategic and better integrated planning which recognises environmental and development boundaries.</jats:p>",

Six factors of the strategic planning process (SPP) were assessed by the questionnaire: participation, organizing mechanisms, inputs and analysis, responsibilities for developing the plan, substantive elements in the resulting plan, and elements in promulgating the plan. The results indicated that although non-profits are engaged in strategic planning, the strategic planning process is not being used to the degree executive directors desire. Directors appeared to perceive the inputs and analyses in the SPP to be particularly deficient. In addition, the degree of perceived participation in the SPP appeared to be less than one might expect in nonprofits. Implications of the findings for research and practice are discussed.</jats:p>",

Beginning with discussions with visually impaired people about their experiences of museum places, I seek to offer a more general understanding of the coconstruction of place and subjectivity through the role of touch. Touch produces a form of confirmation of the subject–world at the interface between the materiality of that world and the hand. Such an encounter is understood not as initially meaningful and representational to a subject who is distinct and distally knowledgable about the world, but as constitutive—through a proximal encounter with the praesentia of a place, which is both present and absent—of the subject itself. As such, I aim to contribute to ongoing debates around the themes of performativity and nonrepresentationalist knowledge within geography. </jats:p>",

Pushing forward the agenda of nonrepresentational theory, this is about attending to differences—those imperceptible, sometimes minor, and yet gathering, differences that script the world in academically less familiar but in no less real ways. I am thinking here about the folded mix of our emotions, desires, and intuitions within the aura of places, the communication of things and spaces, and the spirit of events. Such folds leave traces of presence that map out a world that we come to know without thinking. Throughout, I argue the political importance of our current debates concerning a performative appreciation of society's unfolding. In the first part of the paper I sketch out the academic territory that makes witnessing space potentially unfamiliar by problematizing the representational setup and the interpretation of empiricism that facilities knowledge production. In the second part I present an overview of the operation of Gilles Deleuze's thinking as a possible apprecenticeship in becoming able to perceive, and hence better able to express, the folded mix of the witnessed and witnessing world. In the third part of the paper I investigate the philosophical and ethical mechanics of the act of witnessing itself, translating the arguments found here to question the laws regulating the act of representation. Throughout, as an exemplary witness to that which I am trying to present, the paper is haunted by Olga Tokarczuk's novella The Hotel Capital. </jats:p>",

In a spatial economy formed by two asymmetric regions, an upstream firm supplies an input to two downstream firms. This economy is modelled as a three-stage noncooperative game. In the first stage, the firms choose locations simultaneously. In the second stage, the upstream firm selects a monopoly price for the downstream firms. In the third stage, the final good firms compete in quantities, taking the input price as given. If it is assumed that each firm is active in each market, the agglomeration of all firms in the large region is always a perfect equilibrium, although it need not be unique. If vertical linkages are intermediate and transport costs are high, there is a dispersed equilibrium with the upstream firm in the small region. If vertical linkages are strong and transport costs are low, a cluster can occur in the small region. In this latter case, regional policy can select the small peripheral region as a location for the industrial cluster. </jats:p>",

This is regardless of whether such discourse relates to any of Kachru's categories of Inner, Outer and Expanding Circles. My metaphor for this ubiquitous presence is a <jats:italic>recurring decimal</jats:italic>. The prominence that a language has in language policy may be due to a number of factors such as population, prestige, status, functionality, nationalism, etc. English shares all these factors in different countries, and may, in fact, have more than one of the factors in the same country. The recurrence of English in language policy is often presented as an outcome of deliberate choice. To maintain this position is to fail to “problematize the notion of choice” (Pennycook, 1994), since it is well known that there are historical, economic and bureaucratic constraints to language decisions. The resulting hegemony of English may be seen as beneficial from the perspective of its communicative and instrumental functions, particularly in the contexts of a “shrinking world,” which globalization represents. However, in Outer Circle countries, where English is largely acquired though formal education, its detrimental effects can be seen in social stratification, exclusion, and problems associated with education and literacy, status of languages other than English, and language rights. These problems inevitably invite attention to the broader issues of English in the context of educational failure and overall language policy.</jats:p>",

I critically compare ideas of performativity with those of embodied practice and their combined contributions, oriented to an exploration of spacing, with particular regard to the means to adjust, reconstitute, and reimagine one's life through encounters with space. The argument seeks to bring space into discussions of performativity, through a consideration of empirical narratives and observed encounters with surroundings, from ethnographies of the apparently mundane activities of allotment holding and caravanning. Through this discussion I examine the significance of spacing in performativity. Particular themes, worked in terms of spacing, are the emerging tensions between, for example: being and becoming; routine activities and everyday creativity; the desire to experience change or to ‘go further’ and to ‘hold on’; and, in relation contexts and flows, time and identity processes. Through the discussion the encounters and imagination of the research are reflexively considered in terms of the accessibility of performance to research investigation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine different forms of spiritual practice which seek to (re)enchant the everyday and the ordinary. By considering the duality of sacred and profane as the relational outcome of both embodied action and the action of other objects or things that are nominally valued as profane, an account is sought which acknowledges the corporeal enacting and sensing of the sacred both in and of the everyday. Taking empirical examples from New Age spiritual seekers, I trace the ways in which profane spatialities and temporalities are reconfigured into sacred topologies and how these seekers realise spiritual enlightenment through a reinhabited appropriation or articulation of the world. The source of signification of this spiritual comportment lies in embodied practices of the everyday that are sensed as the spiritually ‘correct’ or ‘true’ way of doing things. New ways of thinking everyday spiritual practice are thus sought and elaborated upon. </jats:p>",

By helping firm founders to make decisions, to balance resource supply and demand, and to turn abstract goals into concrete operational steps, business planning reduces the likelihood of venture disbanding and accelerates product development and venture organizing activity. Empirically, we examine 223 new ventures initiated in the first 9 months of 1998 by a random sample of Swedish firm founders and provide support for our hypotheses.

We rigorously test which quantifiable characteristics of species make them better components of indicator groups of complementarity in area networks. We find that even indicator groups comprised of randomly chosen, taxonomically unrelated species perform better than randomly chosen areas, and we demonstrate the improved efficiency of protected‐area networks possible when using indicator groups chosen on the basis of species' characteristics.</jats:p>",

Within a sociopolitical context that presents opportunities and constraints, my interest is in how a particular set of organisational spaces—those of a voluntary welfare agency—are brought into being within the city and in how we might best apprehend their experiential texture. Drawing on research undertaken in a community drop-in centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, I explore the utility of two bodies of thought which emphasise social practices for this task. The first of these is actor-network theory. This frames organisation as a relational achievement, rooted in the successful translation of various actors, resources, and other material entities into a network through which an agency is constituted over time. Although an actor-network perspective affords insights into organisational formation and subsequent durability, I argue that it functions less well when one is seeking to apprehend the intersubjective spaces of affect that constitute so much of the daily goings-on of organisational life. As a way of approaching these matters, I turn to a second and related body of work that foregrounds notions of embodied practice. This, I suggest, enables us to attend more fully to the sometimes fleeting immaterial and affective dimensions of organisational space. It helps us, as Thrift (1997) has written, to touch the invisible in the visible. </jats:p>",

Adapting elements of a model of capacity‐building for environmental decision‐making, the paper indicates how traditional exclusionary decision networks serve to inhibit decision capacity, whilst more inclusive processes may be more likely to cope with challenges of reconciling multiple values and decision‐making for managing the forests in the interests of society as a whole.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The past decade has seen a remarkable turn towards the cultural in human geography. This shift has been marked by a strange gap between theory and empirical practice. Radical though the turn to the cultural has been in reconstituting the ways that human geography thinks of itself as a discipline, its impact on ways that geographers actually do empirical research has been in certain respects relatively limited. Indeed, while the cultural turn has become strongly associated with a valorisation of qualitative methodologies, the actual range of methods used has been relatively narrow. Drawing on the work of Nigel Thrift and a range of other human geographers who are exploring the metaphor of performance to understand this realm of practical action, I argue that not only can social action be viewed as performance, so too is it productive to reframe the research process itself as a kind of performance. This reframing allows for a more experimental and more flexible attitude towards both the production and interpretation of research evidence. It also makes it easier to think of new ways of engaging with how individuals and groups inhabit their worlds through practical action. Drawing on my own experimentation with written and photographic research diaries, I explore a number of ways through which the performative ethos can inform and invigorate the human geographic imagination. I conclude by arguing that human geography needs to be more imaginative, pluralistic, and pragmatic in its attitude towards both (a) methodology and (b) the kinds of final research accounts it produces.</jats:p>",

This article discusses the history of compensation planning and the factors that have led to the increasing complexity of the process. It then details the business case for automating compensation planning, including ROI considerations, decision support, compliance and data privacy issues and global compensation issues for multinationals. The importance of system flexibility—critical because business needs evolve over time—is also addressed.

The required measurement data include the central axis depth dose curve (PDD), the dose profile at<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp4753-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp4753:mp4753-math-0001\"/>of 60 mm cone at 80 cm source‐to‐surface distance (SSD), and the cone output factors for cones of 5 mm to 60 mm at 80 cm source‐to‐axis distance (SAD). The employed dual source model has the same structure as the one that has been studied in our previous work while most of the parameters of each source are extracted from the measurement data rather than the beam phase space. The energy spectra will be extracted from the central axis PDD, the fluence distributions will be deconvoluted from the dose profile at<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp4753-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp4753:mp4753-math-0002\"/>and the source distributions will be determined from the measured cone output factors. Monte Carlo dose calculations in various water phantoms have been performed to verify the beam commissioning procedure. The agreement between the measurements and the commissioning results was within 2%/1 mm for the central axis PDDs and the dose profiles at various depths when an IC‐3 chamber was used and within 2% for the cone output factors for various collimator sizes of 5 to 60 mm. Largest difference (9.5%) was observed for the 7.5 mm cone when an IC‐10 chamber was used. The large differences can be attributed to the volumetric averaging effect of the IC‐10 chamber, whose dimension is comparable to the field of the small cones. The overall agreement between the measurements and the commissioning results is clinically acceptable, which implies that our commissioning tool is adequate for clinical applications of Monte Carlo dose calculations for the Cyberknife stereotactic radiosurgery system.</jats:p>",

A number of studies have attempted to analyse the multitude of individual changes and their manifestations through analyses based on a variety of institutional, policy and governmental distinctions. This paper attempts to specify the changes with particular reference to planning, and to consider the evolution of the public service ethic in planning towards more openness, scrutiny, transparency and efficiency with particular reference to the changing ethos of the professional employee. We first explore the  main impacts upon local government, the public service ethic and professional planning as a consequence of the Modernization agenda and freedoms and flexibilities initiative. We then look at how such changes have impacted upon the ethos and values in public service and planning. We draw on some evidence of Ombudsman cases to highlight issues of professional values in planning practice over the past decade before finally drawing these strands together in some conclusions. Our principal findings indicate that the much‐trumpeted decline of services and standards may not have been as apparent as is sometimes portrayed and that internal professional attitudes and values towards the external changes may not have significantly altered over the same period.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Faced with anxieties about meeting welfare needs, and worries about the nature and meaning of citizenship, there is evidence of increasing state-initiated moves to develop the role and responsibilities of voluntary associations. Existing research suggests, however, that there are tensions between the spatial distribution of voluntary resources and welfare needs, and that the relationship between voluntary activity and active citizenship is more complex than is often acknowledged. Focusing on the voluntary welfare sector in Glasgow, the authors first examine the uneven distribution of voluntary activity across the city and its relationship to ‘need’. Although in contrast to previous research this reveals strong representation of voluntary organisations in deprived areas of the city (largely as a result of state funding programmes), important tensions and conflicts remain between where organisations are funded to provide services and the needs of vulnerable populations. In the second part of the paper the relationship between voluntarism and citizenship in Glasgow is examined. Highlighting the existence of a distinction between ‘grass-roots’ and ‘corporatist’ voluntary organisations, the authors illustrate the ways in which voluntarism can be associated with both the empowerment and the disempowerment of citizens. In the conclusions it is emphasised that developments in Glasgow resonate with wider concerns about the impact of welfare reform on the voluntary sector. </jats:p>",

In this paper a three step procedure, based on Genetic Algorithm and Decision Theory, is applied to obtain the best generation sizing and siting on a medium voltage distribution network, considering in the objective function and in the constraints the power quality disturbances and taking into account the unavoidable uncertainties that the Embedded Generation production introduces.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present a large-scale, airspace planning and collaborative decision-making model (APCDM) to enhance the management of the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight as prompted by various airspace restriction scenarios imposed by dynamic severe weather systems or space launch special use airspaces (SUA), we develop a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air traffic control workload, and airline equity constraints. The model includes a three-dimensional probabilistic conflict analysis, the derivation of valid inequalities, the development of air traffic control workload metrics, and the consideration of equity among airline carriers in absorbing costs related to rerouting, delays, and possible cancellations. The resulting APCDM model has potential use for both tactical and strategic applications, such as air traffic control in response to severe weather phenomena or spacecraft launches, FAA policy evaluation (separation standards, workload restrictions, sectorization strategies), Homeland Defense contingency planning, and military air campaign planning. The model can also serve a useful role in augmenting the FAA's National Playbook of standardized flight profiles in different disruption-prone regions of the national airspace. The present paper focuses on the theory and model development; Part II of this paper will address model parameter estimations and implementation test results. </jats:p>",

For a good part of the 20th century, state intervention in land‐use planning, resource management, and nature conservation was motivated primarily by national development goals, including a desire to ensure the territorial‐economic integrity of the nation state. Although there is always variation within countries resulting from such factors as the uneven spatial distribution of natural resources, the variety of arrangements for allocating powers and responsibilities among territorial units of government, and different cultural attitudes toward nature, there was nonetheless a discernible trend toward the nationalization (Europe) or federalization (United States) of resource management, land‐use planning, and nature conservation. At the very least, in most countries the state played a strong coordinating, regulatory, and financial role in relation to the management of nature within its territory.</jats:p>",

In many cases, partnership and consultation mechanisms have become integral to attracting inward investment and providing aftercare. Inward investment is thus an important area in which to explore interinstitutional relations between agents operating along diverse spatial boundaries and with different responsibilities. In this paper we analyse the local and regional institutional structures and relations characterising the inward investment process in Britain using new survey data from local authorities, regional bodies, and inward investors. We find that promotional activities have clearly defined structures which are chiefly led by the regional level. Aftercare is characterised by more collaborative arrangements involving both regional bodies and local government. However, many bodies are little used, with competition and tension between partners remaining frequent within English regions, regardless of recent institutional changes designed to reduce such problems. In Scotland and Wales, however, their national institutions are not only widely used, but they create high levels of satisfaction from firms. Hence, England has yet to respond to the effective challenges of Scotland and Wales. The analysis also highlights the limited importance of all national, regional, and local public institutions in attracting inward investors and their subsequent aftercare. The critical inputs to business decisions appear to be driven chiefly by more general supply-side conditions (for example, general skills versus local public packages) and the general attractions of a particular location. </jats:p>",

We evaluated representation in the central coast region of British Columbia, a forested landbase containing a complex mix of management options, administrative and ownership types, and disparate ecological and economic objectives. We found that most ecosystem types were well represented outside areas subject to management activities, but a minority were poorly represented. When we examined areas under consideration for protection or special management, we found that they failed to represent many of the most poorly represented ecosystem types and incorporated limited amounts of the remainder. Because these poorly represented types were relatively limited in area, it should be possible to adjust proposed reserve areas to improve representation of these types with limited impact on other values. Failing to do so will result in increased opportunity costs to improve representation in the future. Despite the limitations of ecological classification systems to represent biodiversity, they are an improvement over strictly ad hoc approaches because they employ a systematic, repeatable approach in selecting reserve areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The capability of a commercial respiratory gating system based on video tracking of reflective markers to reduce motion‐induced CT planning and treatment errors was evaluated. Spherical plastic shells (2.8–82 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>), simulating the gross target volume (GTV), were placed in a water‐filled body phantom that was moved sinusoidally along the longitudinal axis of the CT scanner and the accelerator for ±1 cm at 15–30 cycle/min. During gated CT imaging, the x‐ray exposure was initiated by the gating system shortly before the end of expiration (so that the imaging time would be centered at the end of expiration); it was terminated by the scanner after completion of each slice. In nongated CT images, the target appeared distorted and often broken up. GTVs volume errors ranged 16%–110% in axial scans, and 7%–36% in spiral scans. In gated CT images, the spheres appeared 3 and 5 mm longer than their actual diameters (volume errors 2%–16%), at the respective respiration rates of 15 and 20 cycles/min. At 30 cycles/min the target appeared 1 cm longer, and volume error ranged 25%–53%. During treatment, gating kept the beam on for a duration equal to the CT acquisition time of 1 s/slice. The difference in positional errors between gated CT and portal films was 1 mm, regardless the size of residual motion errors. Because of the potential of suboptimal placement of the gating window between CT imaging and treatment, an extra 1.5–2.5 mm safety margin can be added regardless of the size of residual motion error. For respiratory rates ⩾30 cycles/min, the effectiveness of gating is limited by large residual motion in the 1 s CT acquisition time.</jats:p>",
