It is broadly concerned with efficient use of resources to produce its product. However, there is no well-defined product nor a price that can be attached to its product, and most of its product is not directly sold. Users (students) exert little pressure to increase efficiency, not only because they lack mature judgment and are unaware of input-output relationships (often inputs as well as outputs are ill-defined and uncertain), but also because efficiency gains are not passed to users. Furthermore, factors outside the school system influence output throughout the long production process. Even if the price mechanism does not work, economic principles can still be used in education to improve decision making.</jats:p>",

Today a company is expected to show that its operations whether for new or existing plants - are not causing emissions which harm the environment on either an instantaneous or cumulative basis. A comprehensive mathematical model which defines the ambient concentrations from given emission levels can help provide these necessary impact statements.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Ambient monitoring and mathematical modelling are a tremendous complementary team. Ambient monitoring cannot provide the impact statement of process changes of a new plant except after the fact. On the other hand, mathematical modelling may not have the desired precision unless controlled by matching measured concentration and/or wind velocity data. This may sound contradictory when considering a new plant - but it is not. One of the first requirements for a good environmental impact statement is the definition of background concentration level before the new plant or an operational change is introduced. Through history-matching measured data, a numerical model which includes all important aspects of the problem can accurately predict either the additional impact due to new plants and increased throughput or the reduced impact due to abatement equipment being installed.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:sec>\n                        <jats:title>Problem Areas</jats:title>\n                        <jats:p>Perhaps the mathematical models most widely used in providing impact statements are the Gaussian plume models (1,2,3). Unfortunately, these models have a number of restrictions which limit their use particularly limiting are the assumptions of how terrain can influence the wind and the restriction to steady-state, uniform wind velocity.</jats:p>\n                        <jats:p>The two assumptions most often used with the plume models concerning terrain influence on wind are:the wind streamlines remain horizontal and intersect terrain orthe wind always flows parallel to the ground surface.</jats:p>\n                        <jats:p>An application problem contained in the paper evaluates these assumptions as they compare with the three-dimensional numerical model results.</jats:p>\n                        <jats:p>Several recent presentations have described methods which can include topographic effects(4, 5. 6) or large urban buildings(7,8).</jats:p>\n                     </jats:sec>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The public sector is considered more capable of inducing higher rates of savings and of channeling them into development-promoting outlets than the economy can do by itself. State Economic Enterprises (SEE) financed wholly or in large part through government budgets become the instruments of such policies. In an environment where the private sector invests mainly along traditional lines and is shy of long gestation periods, the absorption of modern technology depends on an ability to amass and channel large amounts of finance capital into productive ventures with relatively little direct short-run profitability. The absence of organized markets for equity capital so prevalent in LDC also points in the direction of the state's active participation in economic activities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The profound changes which have occurred in the Cuban health services since 1958 are described and appraised in this article. The first part treats the main socioeconomic policies, particularly the urban and agrarian reforms, that have had an equalizing effect on the distribution of resources (including health resources) between regions and social classes. These socioeconomic developments have determined changes in mortality and morbidity patterns, particularly in the control of waterborne diseases, in the reduction of the level of malnutrition, and in the increasing prevalence of chronic conditions. The second part describes the main characteristics of the health services development in the last decade: centralization of inpatient facilities; decentralization of ambulatory ones; and the training of large numbers of physicians, paramedical personnel, and, especially, auxiliary personnel. The health services are structured according to a regional model that aims at the integration of preventive with curative services, personal with environmental, and medical with social services. Within this model, great priority is given to primary care, especially in the rural areas, where the greatest benefits of the restructuring of the system have been realized. The education and training of human resources, particularly of physicians, in response to the requirements of the system and the flight of nearly half the medical manpower after the Revolution, are also discussed in this section. The third part of the article describes the process of decision—making and planning in Cuba today, with special emphasis on the health sector. This process is highly centralized in plan preparation but highly decentralized in plan implementation. The medical profession has a definitive and decisive influence in the preparation of the plans, through the very powerful advisory planning task forces. The advantages and disadvantages of this active participation are discussed. Plan implementation is accomplished with massive participation by the population and its organs, the mass organizations, which partly explains the great achievements of the public health programs. The relationship between decision—makers and planners, not always an easy one, is also analyzed. </jats:p>",

The approach is based on the premise that areawide planning, as opposed to substantial reliance upon market mechanisms, is required to allocate health care resources among communities. In this approach it is assumed that all health care service cost functions are long run and that the time period of adjustment is such that fixed capital goods do not restrict adjustments in the service output of hospital facilities.</jats:p>",

The series of the short‐run plans are parametrically solved by linear programming “variable right hand” techniques and are later integrated into a long‐run program using a (computerized) decision tree analysis. The attitude towards risk of the farm operator is expressed in the willingness to maximize the expected value of the income stream over the planning horizon subject to the restriction that alternatives which may lead to lack of liquidity must be eliminated.</jats:p><jats:p>Ce travail présenle une approche tentative ďintégrer, sous conditions incertaines, une planification de ferme à court et long terme.
