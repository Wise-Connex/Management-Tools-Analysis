Until fairly recently, however, the primary emphasis has been unidisciplinary and has centered around research activities. In 1972, implementation of state IPM programs began in an organized manner with the help of federal funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Extension Service. By 1979, USD A Extension provided over $5.4 million to new and expanding IPM programs in all 50 states (4). During this time, no parallel organized research effort was established to support this expanding implementation network. Thus, various Experiment Station and USDA groups began to examine planning and coordination mechanisms to provide for best use of research and extension resources, to seek methods of providing additional funds, and to ensure an interdisciplinary approach to IPM. The purpose of this paper is to record the events leading up to the formation of regional planning groups and describe briefly progress to date.</jats:p>",

As such, the VERT technique is more powerful than techniques such as GERT, which are basically time and cost oriented. VERT has been successfully utilized to assess the risks involved in new ventures and projects, in the estimation of future capital requirements, in control monitoring, and in the overall evaluation of ongoing projects, programs, and systems. It has been helpful to management in cases where there is a requirement to make decisions with incomplete or inadequate information about the alternatives. An example describing the application of VERT to an operational planning problem—the evaluation of electric power generating methods—is illustrated. </jats:p>",

The analysis is applied to the United Kingdom, where in 1981 changes were announced in the method of making public expenditure decisions which had evolved over the previous two decades. The various components of public expenditure in the United Kingdom are described, and the decision-making process which led to the March 1981 Public Expenditure White Paper is outlined. The significance of the different price bases used in public expenditure (cash (at current or at expected prices), volume, cost, and constant) is then explored. The advantages and disadvantages for policy-makers of attempting to reduce the number of price bases used are analysed; it is shown that there is no cost-free route to reducing complexity. The significance of government's decision in 1981 to make greater use of the cash basis in decision-making is assessed. The analysis is applied specifically to the United Kingdom, but the issues raised are of policy relevance to the choice of price bases for public expenditure decision-making in any country in a time of inflation.</jats:p><jats:p>(A second paper in a future issue of the <jats:italic>Journal</jats:italic> will examine the political purposes behind gross or net measurement, the earmaking of receipts, and the more precise relationships between figures used in the planning of public expenditure, in macro-economic analysis and forecasting and in Parliamentary and local control.)</jats:p>",

The objective of the model is to minimize the sum of the capital, operating, and distribution costs incurred in meeting future water, gas, coal and power demands within a region. The nonlinear objective function represents an improvement over existing models, as it permits analysis of nonlinear system response and economies of scale.

Therefore, this shape of market area will always emerge and in the case of free entry will exhaust the region. Of particular merit is the fact that these market areas are closer to reality. Further, weaknesses in the analyses of Mills-Lav and Greenhut-Ohta were exposed and some corrections made. </jats:p>",

Initially, the basic tradeoffs inherent to production planning decisions are represented by means of an aggregate model, which is solved on a rolling horizon basis. Subsequently, the first solution of the aggregate plan is disaggregated, considering additional cost objectives and detailed demand constraints. Several improvements in the methodology related to hierarchical production planning are suggested. Special attention is given to alternative disaggregation procedures, problems of infeasibilities, and the treatment of high setup costs. Computational results, based on real life data, are presented and discussed. </jats:p>",

Ultimate recovery from the deep carbonate reservoir is expected to reach 393 MMbbl, or 54% of the 728 MMbbl oil originally in place (OOIP).</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The Jay/LEC fields, discovered in 1970, produce oil from a carbonate reservoir in the Florida panhandle and south Alabama. The fields were unitized in 1974, and waterflood operations have been underway for 7 years. This sour-oil field has been recognized for some time as an ideal miscible displacement candidate because (1) the crude is miscible with nitrogen, methane, and CO, at reservoir conditions and (2) about 382 MMbbf of oil are expected to remain following waterflood operations. Continuous tertiary recovery studies began in late 1977, and the working interest owners approved the project in June 1980, after 8 man-years of technical evaluation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Reservoir questions receiving special attention included injectivity of water following gas injection in a water-alternating-gas (WAG) operation and remobilization of residual oil trapped in the reservoir following water injection. A field injectivity test showed reduction in water injectivity would occur, and laboratory tests showed essentially all waterflood residual oil in place will be recovered from reservoir rock contacted by miscible gas. Additional study showed that decreased water injectivity following gas injection would be offset by excess injection capacity and some injection string changeouts.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Recovery and performance estimates and WAG ratios were based on results obtained with two- and-three-dimensional reservoir simulation of representative sections of the reservoir. A modified version of Exxon's General Purpose Simulator (GPSIM) was used. Detailed reservoir description gave confidence in simulation studies and was an important factor in the decision to forego a pilot test.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Nitrogen was selected as the principal injection gas rather than methane because of economics and rather than CO2 because of availability and economics. It will be injected alternately with water at rates of 67 MMcf/D until about 20% hydrocarbon pore volumes (HCPV) have been injected. A period of about 15 years of gas and water injection will be followed by injection with water until depletion. Ultimate oil recovery should be increased some 47 MMbbl, or 6.5% of the 728 MMbbl of OOIP. Ultimate recovery now is expected to reach 393 MMbbl of oil.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Nitrogen will be purchased from a supplier with subsequent compression to 7,600 psig and distribution by the unit to existing injection wells. Facilities include injection compression, a field-wide distribution system, and a nitrogen rejection unit. Electric motors will be used as prime movers. Total investment is estimated at about $80 million. Nitrogen injection is targeted to begin in Dec. 1981.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Reservoir and Fluid Properties</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Oil accumulation at Jay/LEC is in the Smackover carbonate and Norphlet sand formations.

The multiactivity dynamic location models that this perspective generates is the subject of future research in the Public Facility Location Task.

After reviewing the concept of hierarchical planning and citing some examples, we describe a method for analytic evaluation of a hierarchical planning system. We show that multilevel decision problems can be nicely modeled as multistage stochastic programs. Then any hierarchical planning system can be measured against the yardstick of optimality in this stochastic program. We demonstrate this approach on a hierarchical system that can be shown to be asymptotically optimal for a job shop design/scheduling problem. </jats:p>",

The number of periodontal services ordered was directly related to the number of restorative units and inversely related to the number of extractions and prosthetic devices.

Installation of devices to reduce water use, engineering plans to prevent malfunctioning of collecting sewers, and engineered process modifications of treatment facilities must be coordinated to achieve full benefits of water conservation.

Choices are based in part on the yield available from water supply reservoirs or, in the case of flow augmentation reservoirs, on the increase in low flows at downstream locations. Detailed estimates of these effects may be too costly for basin planning purposes. Thus this paper presents methods for rapid estimation of those quantities for New Hampshire. For water supply reservoirs, a composite empirical relation between Y95 (the draft available 95 percent of the time) and storage ratio, S*, is developed from previous studies in the region. For flow augmentation reservoirs, empirical relations between S* and degree of regulation, R*, are applied to each upstream regulating reservoir. Values of regulation arc then summed and divided by the mean flow at the downstream reach of interest. This parameter, (ΓR)*, is then related to increase in flow available 95 percent of the time by an empirical relation.</jats:p>",

This makes it possible to draw upon the distinctive features of both models. The technique is demonstrated by a study that analyzes the effect on the Massachusetts economy of the expansion of a container port facility at Boston. The approach presented here has general applicability to policy analysis and planning studies that require both the detailed regional interindustry interactions captured by a disaggregated input-output model and the cost, price, supply, location, and demand interdependencies which are endogenous in the best regional forecasting and policy simulation models. </jats:p>",
