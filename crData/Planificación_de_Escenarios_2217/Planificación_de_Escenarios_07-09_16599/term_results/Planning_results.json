Contributing factors include transition to a market-driven economy, political devolution, demographic changes, globalization, and technological change. These are unravelled with care, with a conclusion that embedded markets are the central contributing factor, with globalization and political institutions as important helpmates. Regarding urbanization outcomes, the evidence reviewed supports the convergence hypothesis in broad terms, but with ample evidence of hybridity, resulting in urbanization with Chinese characteristics. The article concludes with a call for a more balanced approach to urban policy interventions in China, whereby existing spatial planning perspectives are complemented by market-based perspectives. </jats:p>",

The literature shows that religious organizations provide significant social services to communities, but little is known about how they compare to their secular counterparts within the same geographic context. Employing qualitative and quantitative approaches together with GIS applications for spatial analysis to survey data from religious and secular organizations in North Philadelphia, this article measures the influence of the religious sector in local community development. The article concludes that religious institutions, specifically congregations and faith-based organizations, have a significant community presence in their offerings, presence, and location and provide a substantial level of service to individuals in that they operate as “silent partners” within communities, providing important—although often unseen “institutional capital” to local development in urban America. </jats:p>",

Using the framework, a sample of thirty local comprehensive plans was evaluated to determine how well local plan goals and policies promote smart growth principles. The plans were selected from a pool of plans that have been adopted in Wisconsin under its new comprehensive smart growth planning law. Plans are evaluated for attention to six commonly accepted smart growth principles as developed and promoted by a number of national organizations and coalitions. This content analysis reveals that communities are not fully embracing the smart growth agenda. Furthermore, there is a clear distinction between the use of smart growth principles among cities and villages versus town or rural governments. The article concludes with a discussion of the applicability of smart growth to small towns and rural communities. </jats:p>",

Since 1999, NAMRU-2, DEPKES, and the US CDC have maintained a hospital-based influenza surveillance network at sites across the Indonesian archipelago. NAMRU-2 analyzes about 700 influenza samples a month and about 100 samples a month strictly for avian influenza. NAMRU-2 has tested every human AI case in Indonesia since human cases first appeared.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>From January to December 2005, NAMRU-2 has identified 18 cases of H5N1 in Indonesia, all of which were confirmed internationally. A number of family clusters were observed in Indonesia and the possibility of human to human transmission could not be excluded in at least two of these clusters. Small clusters with possible limited human to human transmission is a worrying development, as is the fact that many of the human H5N1 isolates have been obtained from cases without a clear exposure.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Molecular analysis of the H5N1 isolates has shown that human viruses are clustering and most have a distinct genetic difference from the poultry viruses. The number of cases is accelerating with 45 deaths in 2006 as compared to 13 deaths in 2005. The seriousness of the Indonesian situation, and recently publicized failures in national contingency planning for an AI outbreak highlight the need for oil and gas industry to engage in detailed contingency planning arrangements.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper will review the NAMRU-2's sampling and analysis program drawing some broad conclusions from the results as well as highlighting the need for ongoing influenza surveillance in Indonesia and improvements in national crisis management and contingency planning.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Human illness due to highly pathogenic (HPAI) avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was first documented in 1997, following H5N1 poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong where 18 H5N1 cases with 6 deaths were detected.1 Between late 2003 and early 2004, unprecedented outbreaks of HPAI H5N1 virus among poultry re-emerged in Asia.2 From January 2004 through June 29, 2007, 317 human cases and 191 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in twelve countries.3 Most cases are believed to have resulted from sporadic avian-to-human transmission through direct exposure to H5N1-infected poultry.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The occurrence of H5N1 cases among family members was first documented in Hong Kong in 1997 in which two confirmed cases were cousins.4 In early 2003, two H5N1 cases were identified among a Hong Kong family that had recently traveled to southern China.5 Other H5N1 case clusters were observed in 2004–05, but without sufficient information to ascertain if human-to-human transmission had occurred.6 The best evidence to date of probable limited human-to-human transmission of H5N1 virus was from a hospitalized child to her mother and aunt in Thailand in 2004.7 Emergence of an H5N1 virus with greater transmissibility among humans could result from re-assortment of avian with human influenza A viral genes and or the acquisition of mutations in one or more avian influenza genes, including those that confer a change in the receptor binding specificity of the H5 hemagglutinin or enhance transmission among humans. Since an increase in case clustering could signal the beginning of a pandemic, detailed investigation of all H5N1 case clusters is critically important.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Since 2003, poultry outbreaks of H5N1 have been reported throughout Indonesia, especially on the islands of Java, Sumatra, Bali and Sulawesi. Most provinces have been affected by these outbreaks, prompting culling activities.8 During June 28 to July 7, 2005, three of five immediate family members were admitted to hospitals near Jakarta with severe respiratory disease. Within two weeks, all three patients had died and H5N1 virus infection was confirmed in one case. Over the next two years 80 deaths in 101 additional human H5N1 cases and at least 10 family clusters were identified amongst these. In this report, we describe the epidemiology, clinical, and virological findings associated with clusters of H5N1 cases in Indonesia that occurred from June through October 2005 and the large cluster that occurred in May.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Using evidence from rural Malawi, we demonstrate that patron–client ties and a moral obligation to support the needy, which are fundamental to African social life, are central elements of transactional sex. We argue that the exchange of sex for money is better understood as one of the many ties of unequal exchange in which Malawians and other Africans engage, an exchange in which the patrons are as important as the clients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A simple information system for primary care clinics was designed to support the USAID funded health system strengthening project in the Suez Governorate in Egypt. This system (FACT—Feedback and Analytic Comparison Tool) was implemented in December 2003 in 14 primary care clinics. The MS Access‐based system was designed and prototyped in several months, and was easily and cheaply modified several times after implementation. A total of 128 562 persons have been registered in the system (as of June 2005) and 36 083 visits have been documented. A key feature of FACT is the ease with which clinicians can conduct exploratory research about practice patterns, and variations in them across doctors and the other clinics. This analytic feature enables the clinicians to self‐diagnose quality problems and take action accordingly. Several of the clinics have used this feature of FACT to identify important gaps in service use among patients, and have taken steps to remove barriers to promote more appropriate patterns of utilization. The paper reviews the design and implementation issues and early evidence of the system's utility in helping support quality improvement (QI) work in the clinics.

The study shows that program performance varies according to government policy choices and the local market environment. New York and Boston are the only two areas where vouchers clearly do better than LIHTC, a result of LIHTC's targeting of distressed neighborhoods and the dispersion of vouchers. In Atlanta and Miami, LIHTC's emphasis on new construction has brought more assisted families to middle-income suburban neighborhoods. By contrast, the persistent racial segregation in Cleveland and a regionwide housing shortage in San Jose have diminished the economic and educational prospects for both programs. </jats:p>",

Our model includes two often‐neglected proximate determinants of abortion: sexual practices and access to abortion services. We relate three sociodemographic characteristics—women's educational level, their relationship status, and their age—step by step to the stages of the abortion process. We apply our framework using data from the COCON survey, a national survey on reproductive health conducted in France in 2000. Our model shows that sociodemographic variables may have opposite impacts as the abortion process unfolds. For example, women's educational level can be positively linked to the probability of practicing contraception but negatively linked to the propensity to carry the unintended pregnancy to term. This conceptual framework brings together knowledge that is currently dispersed in the literature and helps to identify the source of abortion‐rate differentials.</jats:p>",

Matched longitudinal data for 1,661 mothers and their children are analyzed. The mothers were interviewed in 1994, when their children were aged 9 to 11, about sociodemographic characteristics, their marital relationships, and women's status. Cox proportional hazards models are used to assess unmarried children's age at first sex as reported by the children in 2005 at ages 20 to 22. After multivariate adjustment, the analysis indicates that when parents make household decisions jointly, sons report delaying first sex. In households in which mothers have higher status, daughters report delayed first sex. The results demonstrate that long‐term positive effects on children, particularly delaying first sex, occur in families in which parental decisionmaking is cooperative and in which women have high status.</jats:p>",

This study examines the impact of unintended—mistimed or unwanted—pregnancy on breastfeeding duration. We use data from the 1990 Paraguay and 1994 Bolivia Demographic and Health Surveys and restrict our analysis to last‐born, surviving children younger than 36 months from singleton births. To assess the association, unintended and intended pregnancies are compared by calculating incidence rates and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) using survival analysis. Most children (approximately 95 percent) were breastfed initially, but the median duration of breastfeeding in Bolivia was five months longer than that in Paraguay (19 versus 14 months). A greater proportion of pregnancies were described as intended in Paraguay than in Bolivia (74 percent versus 45 percent). In adjusted analyses, unwanted and mistimed pregnancies were associated with slightly longer duration of breastfeeding (aHR = 0.9) than were intended pregnancies, but the association was not statistically significant. In this study, therefore, pregnancy intention was not an important factor in duration of breastfeeding in Bolivia or Paraguay.</jats:p>",

In this study, we find that fewer than one half of induced abortions performed in the United States in 1997–2001 (47 percent) were reported by women during face‐to‐face interviews in the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). Hispanic and black women and those with low income were among the least likely to report their experience of abortion. Women were also less likely to report abortions that occurred when they were in their 20s. Second‐trimester abortions were more likely to be reported than first‐trimester terminations. The levels of recent spontaneous abortion reported in the 2002 NSFG were consistent with the accumulated body of clinical research, although substantially more lifetime pregnancy losses were reported on self‐administered surveys than in face‐to‐face interviews. Subsequent research should explore strategies to improve information collected on abortion, and, in the interim, research involving pregnancy outcomes should be adjusted for unreported induced abortions.</jats:p>",

Major problems were their insufficient quantity for sustainable treatment and the discrepancy between the needs of the recipients and the donors' supply. Objectives in this study were to discuss these findings and to learn from key informants (KIs) how to improve the DD process. Data were collected through KI interviews in 2001/2002.</jats:p><jats:p>A 30% gap in drug supply has to be bridged by DDs. KIs confirmed the importance of the World Health Organisation and Tanzanian DD guidelines as a tool for good donation practice and emphasized the role of the government in their implementation. They requested that donors meet the recipient country's regulatory requirements. In contrast to QS respondents, KIs did not view DD quality as a minor problem, and proposed that DD quality should be adapted to the national quality assurance procedures. DD processes could be improved through (a) effective implementation of DD guidelines as an aid for decision‐making and for quality assurance, (b) availability of data to improve communication between donors and recipients, (c) transparency between recipients and donors and (d) clearly defined accountability.

This means an increased risk of capacity mismatches and destruction of economic value. At the same time, the changing airport ownership models require maximal value creation while airlines expect airport efficiency. Due to changing air transport and airport market regimes, physical planning of airports must be (more) adaptive. In unpredictable commercial markets, company plans must also be proactive and aimed at value creation. The authors conclude that an integrated approach between physical planning and strategic and business planning is practically non-existent. They illustrate strong interdependencies between separate planning disciplines and propose a more integrated, value-based planning approach, which addresses economic choices embedded in master planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is widely used for defining conditions on the execution paths of dynamic systems.  In the case of dynamic systems that allow for nondeterministic evolutions, one has to specify, along with an LTL formula f, which are the paths that are required to satisfy the formula.  Two extreme cases are the universal interpretation A.f, which requires that the formula be satisfied for all execution paths, and the existential interpretation E.f, which requires that the formula be satisfied for some execution path.\n  \nWhen LTL is applied to the definition of goals in planning problems on nondeterministic domains, these two extreme cases are too restrictive. It is often impossible to develop plans that achieve the goal in all the nondeterministic evolutions of a system, and it is too weak to require that the goal is satisfied by some execution.\n  \nIn this paper we explore alternative interpretations of an LTL formula that are between these extreme cases.  We define a new language that permits an arbitrary combination of the A and E quantifiers, thus allowing, for instance, to require that each finite execution can be extended to an execution satisfying an LTL formula (AE.f), or that there is some finite execution whose extensions all satisfy an LTL formula (EA.f).  We show that only eight of these combinations of path quantifiers are relevant, corresponding to an alternation of the quantifiers of length one (A and E), two (AE and EA), three (AEA and EAE), and infinity ((AE)* and (EA)*).  We also present a planning algorithm for the new language that is based on an automata-theoretic approach, and study its complexity.\n</jats:p>"

These extremely differentiated quantitative analyses are based on data from the municipalities on population development, and more particularly on the nexus of migration viewed in terms of selected structural features. The author explores the extent to which, following the wave of suburbanisation in the 1990s, the landscape of eastern Germany — characterised by demographic shrinkage — is now marked by tendencies of regional polarisation, ranging from signs of reurbanisation to wider-scale deconcentration. In this respect, this paper augments previous analyses conducted at the pan-German level with a perspective which is distinctly on eastern Germany. The paper closes with a discussion of the current debate on visions (or “leitbilder”) for spatial development in Germany based on the results of the analysis, and finally considers some issues related to maintaining parity of living conditions throughout Germany.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the industrial economy, evaluating company performance based on financial results was good enough. However, in the current globalized and highly competitive environment, maintaining long term competitiveness requires companies to engage in overall strategic planning and performance evaluation. The balanced scorecard is a tool or method for balancing an organization's performance and can react to situations where a company's direction becomes disoriented. This approach assists in strategy planning, process management, and performance evaluation from four perspectives, including financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth. Good strategy planning provides companies with a correct management direction, correct process management ensures the efficient execution of plans, and correct performance evaluation illustrates the execution results. This study mainly focuses on how a large rubber company in Taiwan utilizes the balanced scorecard in its organization. As the technical perspective is important in the rubber keypad industry, besides the four above perspectives, this company has added the technical perspective. By introducing this company and its progress in implementing the balanced scorecard, this study hopes to provide other companies, especially rubber companies, with a planning direction and reference for the future implementation of the balanced scorecard.</jats:p>",

We have adopted a new framework broadly based on the 2005 rule and enhanced by the use of scenario planning techniques for our senior capstone planning course. Our methodology is described, along with the positive and negative effects of the new approach we have observed in our 2 years of experiences. Although our key learning outcomes remain unchanged, the new approach has shifted the emphasis toward the recognition of multiple perspectives and divergent social values and uncertainty, at some cost to the rigor of the technical analysis. Examples of student management plans, and a public presentation by the 2007 class, are available on our class website.</jats:p>",

Psychological intervention introduced to elite athletes during their training program reflects the aims of each critical phase of the program, namely the preparation, competition, and transition phases. In addition, while conducting psychological consultations, the sport psychologist should take into consideration the specific objectives of other preparations in the training program, such as the physical, technical, and tactical. The specific psychology intervention in each phase of the basketball training program, the philosophical approach to the intervention process, and the reasoning behind the use of the certain psychological techniques at each specific phase of the program are discussed.</jats:p>",

However, the tendency for planning decisions to become a focus of opposition has also led to planning being represented as ‘a problem’ in meeting renewable energy targets. Using Jessop's dialectical relationship between modes and objects of governance, this paper seeks to understand why certain states are inclined to resolve ‘the planning problem’ for wind through strengthened national control. The case study is the Welsh Assembly Government's 2005 planning guidance on renewable energy, which superimposes centrally‐determined ‘Strategic Search Areas’ for large‐scale, onshore wind farm development onto local decision‐making processes. Motivations for adopting this approach reflect the UK's centralizing planning culture, and beliefs that local planning processes will not yield sufficient sites to meet targets for wind power expansion. Responses to this planning guidance suggest that it may stabilizing the regulatory conditions for large‐scale wind investment in the short term, in some parts of Wales, but faces a number of points of vulnerability in the longer term.

This circumstance is discussed with regard to its consequences for the development of the Munich metropolitan area. Based on qualitative interviews, the current living conditions, future conceptions of life, and visions of aging of this cohort are presented. The conclusion is drawn that these future senior citizens represent increasing demand for inexpensive housing, while having little need for infrastructure designed to suit the special needs of the elderly in the near future. In the case of this cohort, demand for such facilities will set in at a much later point in time. However, whenever the need does arise, a larger group will have to be accommodated.</jats:p>"

As the public sector moves from a “civil service” to a “human resources” paradigm, adapting innovative personnel practices is increasingly becoming critical for good governance. Workforce planning (WFP) is one such innovation that allows a jurisdiction to build its long-term capacity in the face of changing work requirements, work values, technology, demography, and an array of other factors. Although the evidence on the use of WFP at the federal level is encouraging, the same is not the case at the state and local levels. There is little to nothing known about the need or the applicability of WFP in small local governments. Therefore, in the context of small local government, the article assesses the conceptual promises of WFP against the realities and capacities of governments operating at the grassroots level. </jats:p>",

A variety of management disciplines were reviewed to understand the way that project and program rollouts are treated in IT, product development, organizational learning, and manufacturing literature. These reviews enabled the development of a conceptual model to describe how planning and implementing the rollout of a product or service can be more knowledge-focused and an accompanying capability maturity model. Several examples from real life, including one experienced by one of the authors, were used to illustrate and test the conceptual model. The model integrates knowledge management, change control, and planning in a way that can develop organizational learning and the authors assert that this can improve productivity and both tangible and intangible returns to those that follow the model. An accompanying capability maturity model is also presented. The conceptual model, while initially tested against several real-life cases, needs to be tested against a new set of projects as an action learning research project in order to more fully develop knowledge of the dynamics of learning and improvement in rollout projects. The implication is that when project managers undervalue important learning aspects of phased rollouts, they may miss important organizational learning opportunities. </jats:p>",

Yet, in rural Zambia, progress in family planning has lagged far behind the advances made in Zambia's urban areas. The contraceptive prevalence rate in Lusaka and other urban areas outstripped the rate in rural Zambia by nearly 25 percentage points (41.2 percent versus 16.6 percent) in 2001. The total fertility rate varied between urban and rural areas by 2.5 children (4.3 versus 6.9 children). This paper considers the urban-rural differentials in Zambia and assesses family planning outreach as a tool to narrow this divide.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>This study uses the Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data, collected between 2001 and 2002. Logistic regression techniques were employed to examine factors associated with contraceptive use. The first analysis tested modern contraceptive use versus traditional method use and no use. In addition, separate models were run for samples stratified by type of residence (rural or urban) to determine if different factors were associated with use by residence. A simulation determined the effect of all women receiving at least one household visit from a health worker if all other variables were held constant.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Differences in modern contraceptive use between urban and rural areas persist (OR: 1.56, 95 percent CI: 1.24–1.96) even after adjusting for a number of demographic, socioeconomic, cognitive, and attitudinal factors. Household visits by a community health worker significantly increased the likelihood of modern contraceptive use among rural women (OR: 1.83; 95 percent CI: 1.29–2.58). If all rural women received at least one outreach visit per year, the prevalence rate for modern contraceptive methods would be expected to increase for this group by 5.9 percentage points, a marked increase but less than one-quarter of the total urban-rural differential.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Outreach in the form of health worker visits can improve access to family planning services, but it does not eliminate barriers to access or address continued high-fertility desires in Zambia.

Nevertheless, even for fixed-base systems, control of mechanical manipulators is a challenging task. This is due to strong nonlinearities in the equations of motion, and consequently different algorithms have been suggested to control end-effector motion or force, since the early research in robotic systems. In this paper, first a brief review of basic concepts of various algorithms in controlling robotic manipulators is introduced. Then, specific problems related to application of such systems in space and a microgravity environment is highlighted. Basic issues of kinematics and dynamics modeling of such systems, trajectory planning and control strategies, cooperation of multiple arm space free-flying robots, and finally, experimental studies and technological aspects of such systems with their specific limitations are discussed.</jats:p>",

Our subjects tended to classify processes into two groups. In the first group are the processes that are formal, strict, and well-documented. In the second group are the processes that are informal and not well-structured. The classification has similar characteristics to the model proposed by Truex, Baskerville, and Travis [12]. Our first group is similar to their methodical classification, and our second group is similar to their amethodical classification. Interestingly, software engineers using a process in the second group stated that they were not using a process. We believe that software engineers who think that they are not using a process, because they have the prevalent concept of process as something methodical that is strict and structured, actually are using an informal (amethodical) process. We also found that software engineers improvise while using both types of processes in order to overcome shortcomings in the planned path which arose due to unexpected situations. This finding leads us to conclude that amethodical processes are processes too.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>My main contention in this article is that the nation‐state paradigm for policies targeted at effecting development in sub‐Saharan Africa is undermined by arbitrary colonial boundaries and porous borders and the challenges of transnationalism as part of the globalization phenomenon in late modernity. The nation‐state paradigm is also the framework for guaranteed dominance of English and French, the two main excolonial official languages of sub‐Saharan Africa, because the indigenous languages, at least theoretically, operate within ethnic boundaries. I cite evidence of internal migration and displacement across national boundaries to argue that policies which are coterminous with these boundaries motivate people to move. I suggest that the treatment of boundaries as zones of continuity rather than discontinuity will allow for the development of stronger interstate agencies within which framework projects may be better managed. I present evidence of the difficulty in pushing macro—language policy and planning and make a case for micro—language policy and planning not only as a more viable alternative in the region but also one for which success is easier to measure.</jats:p>",

Stochastic loss networks are often used to capture the dynamics and uncertainty of this class of resource allocation problems. A wide variety of examples include applications in telephony and data networks, distributed computing and data centers, inventory control and manufacturing systems, and call and contact centers. Another emerging application area is workforce management where, e.g., an IT services company offers a collection of service products, each requiring a set of resources with certain capabilities. The customer demands for such IT service products are stochastic and the IT services company seeks to determine its per-class resource capacity levels in order to maximize its profits over the long run.</jats:p>",

The simulation results demonstrate that the national dynamics have a unique equilibrium. Comparative statics analysis shows that, if environmental improvement occurs in the technologically advanced (less advanced) region, the national output rises (falls). As a region improves its technology, the other two regions' aggregated output levels fall—not only in relative, but also in absolute, terms. This implies that if any region has a high rate of technological change and the other regions remain technologically stationary, then economic activities will tend to be concentrated in the technologically advancing region. It is also shown that technological differences appear to play only a small role in accounting for spatial wage disparities and endowments. </jats:p>",

In light of the rejection of the Dibden Bay (Southampton) container-port proposal, the authors counterpoint the UK government position with the views and evidence presented by key players in the port and shipping industry. The respective standpoints are shown to be markedly divergent in a number of key respects. The principal conclusion is that market forces are of critical importance in determining the nature and location of port developments. Consequently, unless shippers are provided with sufficiently flexible facilities in the locations they prefer, Britain could, as in the 1980s, find itself in danger of becoming little more than an appendage to the major North European continental ports. The delicate balance between interventionist and market-led port development is an issue that will inevitably be encountered in other geographical contexts. </jats:p>",

It focuses on the enrolling of innovations in communication and information technologies into the markets traditionally dominated by stock exchanges. With the development of capacities to trade on-screen, the power of incumbent market makers has been challenged as a less stable array of competing quasi-public and private marketplaces emerges. Developing a case study of the Toronto Stock Exchange, I argue that narrative emphasis on the performative power of sociotechnical innovations, the deterritorialisation of financial relations, and the erosion of state capacities needs qualification. A case is made for the importance of developing an understanding of: the spaces of encounter between emerging social technologies and property rights, rules of exchange, and structures of governance; and the interplay of orderings of different institutional composition and spatial reach in the reconfiguration of market architectures. Only then can a better grasp be gained of the evolving dynamics between making markets, the regulatory powers of the state, and their delimitations. </jats:p>",

However, funding of schemes is still a critical issue. The focus of this paper is on economic considerations of water reuse planning. A survey of pricing mechanisms for reclaimed water revealed that most schemes are subsidised to a great extent. In order to minimise these state contributions to the implementation and operation of reuse projects, their planning should identify a least cost design option. This also has to take into account the established pricing structure for conventional water resources and the possibility of gaining revenues from reclaimed water pricing. The paper presents a case study which takes into account these aspects. It evaluates different scheme designs with regard to their Net Present Value (NPV). It could be demonstrated that for the same charging level, quite different amounts of reclaimed water can be delivered while still producing an overall positive NPV. Moreover, the economic feasibility and competitiveness of a reuse scheme is highly determined by the cost structure of the conventional water market.</jats:p>",

The present study used data from offenders paroling from prisons in a southwest ( N = 127) and midwest ( N = 75) state to examine the psychometric properties of the IPASS subscales. With regard to construct validity, psychometric properties ranged from good to excellent.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Spatially explicit population models (SEPMs) are often considered the best way to predict and manage species distributions in spatially heterogeneous landscapes. However, they are computationally intensive and require extensive knowledge of species' biology and behavior, limiting their application in many cases. An alternative to SEPMs is graph theory, which has minimal data requirements and efficient algorithms. Although only recently introduced to landscape ecology, graph theory is well suited to ecological applications concerned with connectivity or movement. This paper compares the performance of graph theory to a SEPM in selecting important habitat patches for Wood Thrush (<jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Hylocichla mustelina</jats:named-content>) conservation. We use both models to identify habitat patches that act as population sources and persistent patches and also use graph theory to identify patches that act as stepping stones for dispersal. Correlations of patch rankings were very high between the two models. In addition, graph theory offers the ability to identify patches that are very important to habitat connectivity and thus long‐term population persistence across the landscape. We show that graph theory makes very similar predictions in most cases and in other cases offers insight not available from the SEPM, and we conclude that graph theory is a suitable and possibly preferable alternative to SEPMs for species conservation in heterogeneous landscapes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rainfall data of Bhilwara district in Rajasthan state for a period of45 years were analysed from two approaches viz.; 'Meteorological' approach and 'Onset of monsoon' approach. The results revealed considerable difference in rainfall characteristics with respect to length of growing period, water surplus/ deficit and probability of intervening dry spells due to these approaches. The 'Onset of monsoon' approach is more rational as it precisely describes the actual crop environment and provides information for varying onsets of monsoon as compared to 'Meteorological' approach. The results of water balance study revealed an increase of 142.6% in water deficit due to delay in onset (31 51 SMW) as compared to normal onset of monsoon (27th SMW), whereas an increase of 35.2% and decrease of 33.7% in water surplus was recorded due to late and early onset of monsoon. The correlation studies also reveal that onset of monsoon is inversely correlated (-0.91) with duration of rainy season while positively correlated (0.83) with water deficit. Thus, the 'onset of monsoon' approach should be considered for crop planning under rainfed regions to harness more profit per unit of rainfall.</jats:p>"

The interplay of intrafield faulting and the layered geology provide potential for a high degree of compartmentalization. A significant proportion of the reserves is thought to reside in reservoirs of the Thylacine sandstone member, which contains poor-quality marine sands interbedded with successions of shale and thinly bedded sand/shale. Key to designing wells to achieve satisfactory deliverability was an understanding of the distribution of net reservoir in the background of nonreservoir.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The Thylacine field is 70 km offshore Victoria in Tasmanian waters. The field was discovered and appraised in 2001 with Wells Thylacine-1 and Thylacine-2 (Fig. 1), which penetrated gross hydrocarbon columns of 275 and 240 m, respectively, in the Waarre and Flaxman marine-deltaic sandstone formations. Overlying Belfast shales provide the seal to the accumulation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The discovery and appraisal wells indicated that productivity would be low from the upper reservoir units and that considerable reservoir distribution and connectivity uncertainty exists. These elements present significant challenges to the commercial development of this resource. Any well drilled into sections having lower net-to-gross reservoir-thickness ratio must be placed carefully to enable commercial deliverability. Therefore, a detailed predictive reservoir stratigraphic model integrated with seismic inversion was used. The model increased confidence in the location of the target reservoir.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Development Challenges</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>A combination of complex field structure, reservoir-facies areal distribution, and vertical-stacking patterns presented considerable challenges to developing the Thylacine field. Low-quality potentially compartmentalized reservoir sands in Thylacine hold significant gas reserves. Wells in this environment must be designed to intersect sufficient productive reservoir to maximize productivity and connect potential pressure compartments at commercially viable levels. Uncertainty related to reservoir-facies development and the effect of small-scale faulting on individual-well productivity also meant that final horizontal lengths of wells could not be preset and had to be determined as the reservoir section was drilled. Detailed reservoir modeling across the range of potential subsurface outcomes before drilling, translating net-to-gross reservoir-thickness ratio to a productivity and value measure by use of dynamic simulation, provided a working tool for determining optimum horizontal-well length during drilling.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This is partly due to residential self-selection—that is, a lifestyle preference for transit-oriented living—as well as factors like employer-based policies that reduce free parking and automobile subsidies. Half-mile catchments of station areas appear to be indifference zones in the sense that residents generally ride transit regardless of local urban design attributes. Out-of-neighborhood attributes, like job accessibility and street connectivity at the destination, on the other hand, have a significant bearing on transit usage among station-area residents. The presence of self-selection, shown using nested logit modeling, underscores the importance of removing barriers to residential mobility so that households are able to sort themselves, via the marketplace, to locations well served by transit. Market-responsive zoning, flexible residential parking policies, location efficient mortgages, and adaptive reuse of parking lots are also promising tools for expanding the supply of transit-based housing. </jats:p>",

As a result, staging high‐profile fixtures are increasingly being seen as a prominent method of strengthening a destination's domestic and international image. Despite the plethora of academic interest in special event management, there remains an apparent lack of knowledge surrounding the role played by public sector tourism planners. This paper examines narratives from representatives of New Zealand‐based regional tourism organisations responsible for maximising the local benefits associated with hosting the 2005 British and Irish Lions Tour. While the ‘once in a lifetime’ nature of the six‐week nationwide series was undoubtedly its biggest selling point, it was equally to blame for a multitude of hurdles encountered by regional operators. The findings identify a host of logistical and resource‐based challenges, along with the manner in which such threats were overcome. Several recommendations are introduced, highlighting the need for consistent, yet flexible, approaches to regional sport event planning. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

However, these activity reports are based on human observations and judgment. This fact implies a number of limitations such as the coarse level of detail and subjective coding systems. To overcome these problems, a rule-based system has been applied to analyze real-time surface-sensor data autonomously.

In this way, a standardized and objective categorization of the drilling process can be achieved at a level of accuracy and detail yet to be reached.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Another benefit is the automated reporting feature. Through the recognition of the rigs, current state, the system is able to propose an impartial process description. This leads to a reduction of the time spent on reporting and leaves more time to focus on unexpected events and lessons learned.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Analysis of field data allowed the introduction of new key performance indicators (e.g., wellbore treatment time per depth interval) for benchmarking, which are determined automatically during the evaluation process.

In this way, costly and time-consuming data management effort (e.g., to compare operated and nonoperated wells) is eliminated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The new system was applied to wells drilled in the Vienna basin during the past year. The Vienna basin covers large parts of eastern Austria (lower Austria, Vienna, and Burgenland) and reaches into the territories of the Czech Republic in the north and the Slovak Republic in the east. It is approximately 200 km long and 55 km wide, striking roughly southwest to northeast from Gloggnitz (lower Austria) in the south to southwest to Napajedla (Czech Republic) in the north to northeast.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As a conclusion, it can be stated that the application of this system significantly improves the accuracy and resolution of the drilling-process description, reducing data-management efforts.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to examine current discharge planning practices for young offenders in Youth Training Centres in South Australia with a view to improving offenders' connection with primary health‐care services on discharge. To determine the strengths and weaknesses of current discharge planning practices, this exploratory study involved in‐depth review of literature and a semistructured focus group of stakeholders. Findings were discussed with an expert advisory group before final recommendations were made. This study identified a service model approach to discharge planning that recommended a nurse located within the Divisions of General Practice as the coordinator. The study found that trusted staff in detention centres, with an awareness of services available in the location of release, influence young offenders' decision‐making in relation to health‐care services. Awareness and recognition of young offenders' health beyond periods of juvenile detention and into their adult lives is valuable in that it has the potential to establish lifelong healthy behaviours. Bonding with young offenders and gaining their trust increases their likelihood of attending primary health‐care services.</jats:p>",

The applied method in this research is qualitatively descriptive research. The purpose of this study is to describe 1) the accuracy of the formulation of the problem with the basic competence and indicator, 2) the completeness of the assessment instrument, and 3) the selection of assessment type. The results showed that 90.9% BC or indicator evaluation instrument is made while 9.1% is not made. This causes the teacher unable to know the level of students' understanding of the BC. Ninety percents (90%) of instrument evaluation is less precise; while 10 % of the evaluation instrument is less precise, less appropriate. Forty ( 40 %) of evaluation instruments are complete and 60% are incomplete (no scoring guidelines and answer keys). There are seven development forms of authentic assessment, namely performance appraisal, project appraisal, portfolio assessment, written assessment, attitude assessment, self-assessment, and product assessment. Here is an overview of the authentic assessment form used by teachers. 20% of all indicators are studied, in the form of performance appraisals, the type is the oral practice . Meanwhile, 80% is a written assessment, in the form of multiple choice test and description (short field and essay). This shows that most teachers do not take advantage of other forms of authentic assessment. Keywords: authentic assessment, basic competencies, indicators.</jats:p>"

In this method, motion planning is simplified by introducing a state-space to describe the whole motion series. And each state in the state-space corresponds to a contact state specified during the motion. The continuous motion is represented by a sequence of discrete states. The concept of the transition between two neighboring states, that is the state transition, can be realized by using some traditional path planning methods. Considering the dynamical stability of the robot, a state transition method based on search strategy is proposed. Different sets of trajectories are generated by using a variable 5<jats:sup>th</jats:sup>-order polynomial interpolation method. After quantifying the stabilities of these trajectories, the trajectories with the largest stability margin are selected as the final state transition trajectories. Rising motion process is exemplified to validate the method and the simulation results show the proposed method to be feasible and effective. </jats:p>",

BSP/SA has been described in terms of phases and the specific tasks within them. This work was aimed at presenting a computer-based application automating one of the most important tasks in BSP/SA methodology (process-organisation matrix). This matrix allows storing information about the levels of present responsibilities in positions and processes.

Since the degree to which a project is planned often guarantees its potential success, the evaluation process should make it possible to answer different questions related to stages of project implementation. The goal of this study was to develop a planning tool to help health professionals and community workers judge the potential success of health education interventions based on the extent to which they are planned and to test the tool in real intervention evaluations. Educational interventions examined in this study were targeted primarily at the promotion and adoption of behaviour reducing the risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. The conceptual framework of “intervention mapping” served as the basis for developing the tool. Experts were consulted to identify criteria that would make it possible to evaluate the extent to which different stages of the model were accomplished. The tool was tested for reliability. Data from 123 projects were then collected and analyzed. The process for the development of the tool made it possible to identify 40 planning criteria, broken down into the 19 tasks of intervention mapping model. Reliability test results were highly satisfactory. The overall average score for project planning was 12.7 out of 40. The degree to which different stages were planned varied considerably. For example, only 15% of projects had developed their objective matrices properly, whereas 80% were assured proper support for their implementation. Thirty-nine percent of the projects were satisfactorily available for evaluation. This exercise made it possible to construct an interesting tool for identifying strengths and weaknesses of intervention planning. Various promoters might find this tool useful for increasing the potential success of their initiatives. </jats:p>",

Taken to its extreme, positivism can contribute to the development of unrealistic goals, construing failure as success, ignoring dissenting perspectives, and contaminating evaluations of PCP. Excessive positivism is presented as a misapplication of PCP principles rather than an inherent flaw in the design of the approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Minimum cost has become a critical performance criterion for most engineers in the provision of township infrastructure service schemes. Consultants spend very little time generating alternative project options, often presenting decision-makers with only a few poorly differentiated alternatives borrowed ad hoc from other projects. Infrastructure projects' costs are scrutinised more closely and with greater skill and accuracy as projects have become larger, more complex and more expensive; clients have also become more exacting in their requirements. These and other factors have compelled engineers to design with greater care and in more detail. This paper contributes to the underdeveloped area of cost planning and forecasting on infrastructure projects by maximising the opportunity for improving quality and reducing project costs at each stage in the design process. In times of ever-increasing costs, the majority of clients, globally, are insisting on projects being designed and executed to give maximum value for money. The cost planning model and its outputs represent a disciplined effort to produce fundamental decisions in shaping project costs. This will place a heavy burden on consultants to use clients' money in the most efficient way possible. The cost planning model attempts to relate design to cost so that, while taking full account of quality, utility and appearance, the cost is planned to be within the economic limit of expenditure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We map the distribution of environmental grants provided by selected California foundations in 2000 and the degree of dependency of the grantees on foundation support to test theoretical claims about foundations' role in contemporary environmentalism. Contrary to assertions by critics of elitism, there is no consistent favoritism of the so-called ‘mainstream’, ‘flagship’, national environmental organizations as recipients of foundations' grants. Instead, donors support a variety of causes with varying levels of funding based on recipients' perceived expertise and needs—a finding consistent with pluralist and resource-dependency arguments. On the receiving end, we find that the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that have greater reliance on foundation money are those which are younger, have fewer paying members, and are not involved in local-level or toxics issues. Overall, we find that no single theory can adequately explain the trends in giving and in dependency. Future research building on these findings can proceed along two directions: a theoretical path in search of a more universal theory of foundation giving; or an empirical path focusing on clarifying different types of NGO grantees, the longitudinal patterns of environmental giving, and the impact of foundation funding on NGO grantees. </jats:p>",

In this paper we interpret firms' environmental performance as their ability to reduce polluting wastes while maintaining observed levels of inputs and desirable outputs. Making use of data envelopment analysis techniques, we compute waste-specific environmental efficiency measures for a sample of ceramic-tile producers located in the eastern Spanish region of Valencia. Our results show that there exists substantial room for improving environmental performance, which would have highly beneficial consequences for the local environment. In a second stage of analysis, we find that affiliation to the regional Technological Institute, ITC, which aims to promote technological innovation within the ceramic-tile industry, improves tile firms' environmental efficiency. In addition, firms located in the local industrial district of the Plana Baixa enjoy what we have broadly defined as ‘environmental spillovers’, which enhance their environmental performance. Also, ceramic-tile firms which outsource the management of wastes show better environmental performance. </jats:p>",

We analyze Madrid's electronics district, which has managed to survive and prosper even after the turbulent period of the early 1990s when Spanish telecommunications services and product markets were liberalized. The study of structural changes alone in RPDs as they respond to external shocks may not sufficiently account for other important sources of some districts' resilience. Also playing important roles may be the conscious strategies of districts' leading firms. We study changes occurring after shock with quantitative data coming from surveys performed before and after telecommunications reform was implemented. Most other recent studies of change in RPDs compare instead the current situation with a qualitative description of the previous situation. We also build on previous empirical work, provide recent regional statistics, and compile information from the daily business press published over more than a decade. Anticipating the end of its various monopolies well in advance, the Spanish carrier Telefónica began searching for new growth opportunities as early as the mid-1980s. With Madrid's electronics district having evolved from a state-anchored district to an emerging high-technology district, Telefónica benefited from its production and development linkages there which confered a competitive advantage in winning foreign markets, especially in Latin America. Since the crisis, a process of reagglomeration has occurred in the district. Several large multinational suppliers of telecom equipment have relocated some of their production to Madrid and assigned greater importance to their R&amp;D laboratories there. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper analyzes the effect of railway investment on land prices and land use in a polycentric city under various regulatory regimes of land markets. The introduction of a fast mode of transport (train), accessible in discrete locations, leads to an increase in city size. The stations of the fast mode induce dense residential settlements in their vicinity. As a result, the average residential and commercial land rents increase in both competitive and segmented land-market situations, compared with the unimodal transport case. When rail investments serve only one particular centre, this leads to the growth of the advantaged centre at the expense of the other centre. An investment in the fast mode results in city growth and an increase in rent receipts. However, the effect of the investment for individual centres and their corresponding residential areas depends on the underlying land-market conditions. Restrictions on commercial land use lead to increases in commercial rents, but this is more than offset by the decrease in residential land rents. </jats:p>",

Thus, they present significant logistical challenges. On the basis of a review of the manufacturing and service supply chain literature, the authors identified five supply hain strategies that can potentially increase the speed of response to a bioterrorism attack, reduce inventories, and save money: effective supply chain network design; effective inventory management; postponement of product customization and modularization of component parts; coordination of supply chain stakeholders and appropriate use of incentives; and effective information management. The authors describe how concepts learned from published evaluations of manufacturing and service supply chains, as well as lessons learned from responses to natural disasters, naturally occurring outbreaks, and the 2001 US anthrax attacks, can be applied to design, evaluate, and improve the bioterrorism response supply chain. Such lessons could also be applied to the response supply chains for disease outbreaks and natural and manmade disasters.</jats:p>"

As a tactical response, many pharmaceutical companies outsource the management of clinical trials to clinical research organisations on a fixed‐price contract basis. This paper presents an alternative approach based on the concept of Product‐Based Planning. Key elements of the approach are the creation of a deliverables budget and the establishment of project management‐related deliverables. The conceptual developments described in the paper are supported by a telephone survey of 10 UK practitioners. The survey confirms the prevalence and limitations of fixed‐price contracts while highlighting a willingness to try a deliverable‐based approach – initially through small pilot studies. The key barrier to implementing a new approach is resistance from key stakeholders, such as finance departments, which can be addressed through selling of the business case.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> American mortgage markets, once arenas of discrimination by exclusion, now operate as venues of segmentation and discrimination by inclusion: credit is widely available, but its terms vary enormously. One market segment involves sophisticated predatory practices in which certain groups of borrowers are targeted for high-cost credit that strips out home equity and worsens the risks of delinquency, default, and foreclosure. Unfortunately, it has become more difficult to measure inequalities of predatory lending: race–ethnicity and gender are ‘disappearing’ from the main public data source used to study, organize, and mobilize on issues of lending inequalities. In this paper, we present a mixed-methods case study of statistical representation of homeowners and homebuyers marginalized by race, ethnicity, and gender. A theoretical examination of official data-collection practices is followed by a discussion of alternative meanings of racial–ethnic and gender nondisclosure. Interviews with a sample of homeowners and homebuyers in the Washington, DC, area reveal some respondent ambivalence about the details of data-collection practices, but provide no consistent support for the idea that nonreporting is solely a matter of individual choice. Econometric analyses indicate that nondisclosure is driven primarily by lending-industry practices, with the strongest disparate impacts in African-American suburbs. Predatory lending is producing ambivalent spaces of racial-ethnic and gender invisibility, requiring new strategies in the reinvestment movement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The technology of online mega‐voltage cone‐beam (CB) computed tomography (MV‐CBCT) imaging is currently used in many institutions to generate a 3D anatomical dataset of a patient in treatment position. It utilizes an accelerator therapy beam, delivered with 200° gantry rotation, and captured by an electronic portal imager to account for organ motion and setup variations. Although the patient dose exposure from a single volumetric MV‐CBCT imaging procedure is comparable to that from standard double‐exposure orthogonal portal images, daily image localization procedures can result in a significant dose increase to healthy tissue. A technique to incorporate the daily dose, from a MV‐CBCT imaging procedure, in the IMRT treatment planning optimization process was developed. A composite IMRT plan incorporating the total dose from the CB was optimized with the objective of ensuring uniform target coverage while sparing the surrounding normal tissue. One head and neck cancer patient and four prostate cancer patients were planned and treated using this technique. Dosimetric results from the prostate IMRT plans optimized with or without CB showed similar target coverage and comparable sparing of bladder and rectum volumes. Average mean doses were higher by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0001\" /> for the bladder and comparable for the rectum <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0002\" />. In addition, an average mean dose increase of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0003\" /> in the femoral heads and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0004\" /> in irradiated tissue was observed. However, the <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0005\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0006\" /> values for bladder and rectum were lower by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0007\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp9127-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp9127:mp9127-math-0008\" /> indicating better volume sparing at high doses with the optimized plans incorporating CB. For the head and neck case, identical target coverage was achieved, while a comparable sparing of the brain stem, optic chiasm, and optic nerves was observed. The technique of optimized planning incorporating doses from daily online MV‐CBCT procedures provides an alternative method for imaging IMRT patients. It allows for daily treatment modifications where other volumetric tomographic imaging techniques may not be feasible and/or available and where accurate patient localization with a high degree of precision is required.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study, we present an intensity‐modulated radiotherapy technique based on forward planning dose calculations to provide a concave dose distribution to the prostate and seminal vesicles by means of modified dynamic arc therapy (M‐DAT). Dynamic arcs (350 degrees) conforming to the beam's eye view of the prostate and seminal vesicles while shielding the rectum, combined with two lateral oblique conformal fields (15 degrees with respect to laterals) fitting the prostate only, were applied to deliver doses of 78 Gy and 61.23 Gy in 39 fractions to the prostate and seminal vesicles respectively. Dynamic wedges (45 degrees of thick end, anteriorly oriented) were used with conformal beams to adjust the dose homogeneity to the prostate, although in some cases, hard wedges (30 degrees of thick part, inferiorly oriented) were used with arcs to adjust the dose coverage to the seminal vesicles. The M‐DAT was applied to 10 patients in supine and 10 patients in prone positioning to determine the proper patient positioning for optimum protection of the rectum. The M‐DAT was compared with the simplified intensity‐modulated arc therapy (SIMAT) technique, composed of three phases of bilateral dynamic arcs. The mean rectal dose in M‐DAT for prone patients was <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0001\" /> Gy; in M‐DAT and SIMAT for supine patients, it was <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0002\" /> Gy and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0003\" /> Gy respectively. The doses to 15%, 25%, 35%, and 50% of the rectum volume in M‐DAT for prone patients were <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0004\" /> Gy, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0005\" /> Gy, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0006\" /> Gy, and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0007\" /> Gy respectively. These values were lower than those in M‐DAT and in SIMAT for supine patients by 7.7%, 18.2%, 22.4%, and 28.5% and by 25.0%, 32.1%, 34.9%, and 41.9% of the prescribed dose (78 Gy) respectively. Ion chamber measurements showed good agreement of the calculated and measured isocentric dose (maximum deviation of 3.5%). Accuracy of the dose distribution calculation was evaluated by film dosimetry using a gamma index, allowing 3% dose variation and 4 mm distance to agreement as the individual acceptance criteria in prostate and seminal vesicle levels alike for all supine and prone patients. We found that fewer than 10% of the pixels in the dose distribution of the calculated area of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20114-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:media:acm20114:acm20114-math-0008\" /> failed the acceptance criteria. These pixels were observed mainly in the low‐dose regions, particularly at the level of the seminal vesicles.</jats:p><jats:p>In conclusion, the single‐phase M‐DAT technique with patients in the prone position was found to provide the intended coverage of the prescribed doses to the prostate and seminal vesicles with improved protection for the rectum. Accordingly, M‐DAT has replaced non‐modulated conformal radiotherapy or SIMAT as the standard treatment for prostate cancer in our department.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number: 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",

The importance of these two issues to the effectiveness of treatment programming highlights the need for instruments that can reliably assess offender risk and needs, guide the treatment planning process, and monitor progress over time.

Further, techniques typically used for needs assessment (i.e., prevalence proportions) do not take into account the probability of experiencing a negative consequence as a result of using specific substances. An approximated severity index is proposed that: a) takes into account the probability of experiencing negative consequences as a result of using specific substances; and b) is comparable across substances. Data from the NSDUH and the ADSS are used to demonstrate these techniques. The findings suggest that substances typically considered priorities based on prevalence proportions are not the same substances that have a high probability of causing negative consequences.

We present a modeling framework that integrates stand-level spruce budworm volume impacts used in the Spruce Budworm Decision Support System (SBWDSS) into an industrial-scale timber supply model for the 209 000 ha Black Brook District in northwestern New Brunswick, Canada. This approach uses linear optimization of harvest scheduling, salvage, and insecticide application to minimize volume reduction. One hundred and ninety-five scenarios were simulated, including normal and severe spruce budworm outbreaks, beginning in 2002, with combinations of varying insecticide efficacy, timing, and spatial extent of protection. After simulated severe defoliation from 2007 to 2016, maximum harvest reductions of 35% were predicted for a normal outbreak for the 2012–2016 period, and 46% for a severe outbreak for the 2017–2021 period; these impacts were reduced to 25% and 34% using re-optimized harvest scheduling and salvage. Results suggest that combined optimized salvage and harvest rescheduling could reduce future harvest reductions by up to 12%. Spatial optimization of protected areas gave similar results to those obtained using protection priority assignments based on marginal stand-level volume reduction in the SBWDSS.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the specification of accessibility indicators for modelling the location choices of offices, with particular application to the upcoming implementation of a high-speed railway line in the Netherlands. Potential accessibility indicators are formulated, whereby attention is given to the shape of the impedance function and to the role of competitive transport modes in a transport mode's accessibility effect. These indicators are then tested in a discrete choice model on the location of office employment. Finally the accessibility indicators are used to explore the effects of the upcoming domestic high-speed train services in the Netherlands. The analyses show that a Box–Cox impedance function performs best for this application and significantly better than the exponential and power functions. The derived potential accessibility indicators have much explanatory capability for location attractiveness at a regional level, but at an intraregional level connectivity measures become more influential. Finally, it has been found that the accessibility effect of the future high-speed train connection is larger for business travel than for commuting, the value of time of travellers being a dominant factor. </jats:p>",

Urban and agricultural development affects a significant fraction of the species’ range and predicted climate change is likely to dislocate many current populations. Here, we explore spatial patterns of multivariate genotypes and genetic diversity throughout the range of valley oak to determine whether ongoing and future patterns of habitat loss could threaten the evolutionary potential of the species by eradicating populations of distinctive genetic composition. This manuscript will address three specific questions: (i) What is the spatial genetic structure of the chloroplast and nuclear genetic markers? (ii) What are the geographical trends in the distribution of chloroplast and nuclear genotypes? (iii) Is there any part of the species’ range where allelic diversity in either the chloroplast or nuclear genomes is particularly high? We analysed six chloroplast and seven nuclear microsatellite genetic markers of individuals widespread across the valley oak range. We then used a multivariate approach correlating genetic markers and geographical variables through a canonical trend surface analysis, followed by GIS mapping of the significant axes. We visualized population allelic richness spatially with GIS tools to identify regions of high diversity. Our findings, based on the distribution of multivariate genotypes and allelic richness, identify areas with distinctive histories and genetic composition that should be given priority in reserve network design, especially because these areas also overlap with landscape change and little degree of protection. Thus, without a careful preservation plan, valuable evolutionary information will be lost for valley oak.</jats:p>",

Key recommendations are that the forces causing a high‐cost economy must be kept under control by capping provincial minimum wage rates and by more effectively utilising the aid funds. Immediate action is needed in the areas of Aceh that were little damaged by the tsunami and are therefore receiving little assistance. Appropriate policies affecting the supply of labour for construction, both from inside and outside of the province, are needed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deformable (non‐rigid) registration is an essential tool in both adaptive radiation therapy and image‐guided radiation therapy to account for soft‐tissue changes during the course of treatment. The evaluation method most commonly used to assess the accuracy of deformable image registration is qualitative human evaluation. Here, we propose a method for systematically measuring the accuracy of an algorithm in recovering artificially introduced deformations in cases of rigid geometry, and we use that method to quantify the ability of a modified basis spline (B‐Spline) registration algorithm to recover artificially introduced deformations. The evaluation method is entirely computer‐driven and eliminates biased interpretation associated with human evaluation; it can be applied to any chosen method of image registration.</jats:p><jats:p>Our method involves using planning computed tomography (PCT) images acquired with a conventional CT simulator and cone‐beam computed tomography (CBCT) images acquired daily by a linear accelerator–mounted kilovoltage image system in the treatment delivery room. The deformation that occurs between the PCT and daily CBCT images is obtained using a modified version of the B‐Spline deformable model designed to overcome the low soft‐tissue contrast and the artifacts and distortions observed in CBCT images. Clinical CBCT images and contours of phantom and central nervous system cases were deformed (warped) with known random deformations. In registering the deformed with the non‐deformed image sets, we tracked the algorithm's ability to recover the original, non‐deformed set. Registration error was measured as the mean and maximum difference between the original and the registered surface contours from outlined structures. Using this approach, two sets of tests can be devised. To measure the residual error related to the optimizer's convergence performance, the warped CBCT image is registered to the unwarped version of itself, eliminating unknown factors such as noise and positioning errors. To study additional errors introduced by artifacts and noise in the CBCT image, the warped CBCT image is registered to the original PCT image.</jats:p><jats:p>Using a B‐Spline deformable image registration algorithm, mean residual error introduced by the algorithm's performance on noise‐free images was less than 1 mm, with a maximum of 2 mm. The chosen deformable image registration model was capable of accommodating significant variability in structures over time, because the artificially introduced deformation magnitude did not significantly influence the residual error. On the second type of test, noise and artifacts reduced registration accuracy to a mean of 1.33 mm and a maximum of 4.86 mm.</jats:p><jats:p>The accuracy of deformable image registration can be easily and consistently measured by evaluating the algorithm's ability to recover artificially introduced deformations in rigid cases in which the true solution is known <jats:italic>a priori.</jats:italic> The method is completely automated, applicable to any chosen registration algorithm, and does not require user interaction of any kind.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.57.Gg, 87.57.Ce, 87.62.+n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>To assess the dosimetric effect of using interpolated contours in planning intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for advanced T‐stage nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The present study focused on T3–T4 tumours where the proximity of targets to neurological organs poses a stringent test on the feasibility of such an approach. Contours of targets and organs were delineated on CT images of 2.5‐mm interval and a reference IMRT plan was generated. An investigative (INV) IMRT plan was then generated with the same planning protocol, but based on interpolated contours that replaced deleted contours on alternate slices. The reference and INV plans were compared. Regarding target coverage, all targets in the INV plans met the acceptance criteria except for the PTV in one case. Regarding organs, the mean dose to 1% volume of the brainstem and spinal cord in the INV plans were kept below their dose limits. No significant differences in the mean doses to others organs were found. Satisfactory target coverage and protection of critical organs to a degree similar to full‐scale contouring could be achieved with use of interpolated contours. The saving in manpower time for contouring is expected to significantly improve the throughput of the IMRT planning process.</jats:p>",

The project participants developed a simulation model to evaluate schedule changes and applied it to a proposed shortening of the time between bus arrivals, or “headway”, on TCAT’s Route 81 circulator bus that serves the Cornell campus in Ithaca, NY. The model was developed by adapting a commercial simulation software package called ProModel that is usually used to simulate the layout of manufacturing facilities. Use of the simulation model helped TCAT planners better understand the  implications of the proposed schedule change to segment-by-segment passenger counts at stops and on-board vehicles. Based on our experience, we discuss a number of issues both with the development of simulation models for transit operations and the practice of collaboration between university students and faculty and public transit agencies. </jats:p>"

Prediction of molecular flexibility aids in the comprehension and prediction of protein function and in providing details of functional mechanisms. The ability to predict the locations, directions, and extent of molecular movements can assist in fitting atomic resolution structures to low‐resolution EM density maps and in predicting the complex structures of interacting molecules (docking). There are several types of molecular movements. In this work, we focus on the prediction of hinge movements. Given a single protein structure, the method automatically divides it into the rigid parts and the hinge regions connecting them. The method employs the Elastic Network Model, which is very efficient and was validated against a large data set of proteins. The output can be used in applications such as flexible protein–protein and protein–ligand docking, flexible docking of protein structures into cryo‐EM maps, and refinement of low‐resolution EM structures.
