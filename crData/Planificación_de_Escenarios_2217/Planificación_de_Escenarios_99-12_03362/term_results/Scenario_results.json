      "abstract": "<jats:p>Standards play an increasingly important role in the development of the “global village”, both from the economic and the quality of life perspective. However, development of standards should always be in tune with the needs of a free economy, whose main engine is differentiation. Standardization and differentiation can be complementary, but only to the extent that a correct balance between the two is kept. The balance becomes particularly delicate when standards move from product‐related issues to organization‐related issues, as is the case of quality system standards. Starting from a brief review of ISO 9000 and its role in the past decade, then moving to Vision 2000, the paper expresses reservations about the benefits and opportunity for standards to enter the organizational improvement area. In a situation of continuous change and global competition, differentiation seems to be the name of the game, more than standardization. Instead, a kind of “standards syndrome” seems to take place, where standards are expected to legitimize managers’ choices.</jats:p>",

But as the year 2000\n      approached, along with it came the fear of the millennium bug, generally\n      known as Y2K, and the computers threatened to strike!!!! Y2K, though an\n      abbreviation of year 2000, generally refers to the computer glitches\n      which are associated with the year 2000. Computer companies, in order to\n      save memory and money, adopted a voluntary standard in the beginning of\n      the computer era that all computers automatically convert any year\n      designated by two numbers such as 99 into 1999 by adding the digits 19.\n      This saved enormous amount of memory, and thus money, because large\n      databases containing birth dates or other dates only needed to contain\n      the last two digits such as 65 or 86. But it also created a built in\n      flaw that could make the computers inoperable from January 2000. The\n      problem is that most of these old computers are programmed to convert 00\n      (for the year 2000) into 1900 and not 2000. The trouble could therefore,\n      arise when the systems had to deal with dates outside the 1900s. In\n      2000, for example a programme that calculates the age of a person born\n      in 1965 will subtract 65 from 00 and get -65.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To project mean weekly stream temperature changes in response to global climate warming and for studies of freshwater ecosystems, a four‐parameter nonlinear function of weekly air temperatures was used. One parameter, the upper bound stream temperature, was obtained by extreme value analysis from stream temperature data, and the other three parameters were obtained by least squares regression analysis. The least squares regression function was developed separately for the warming season and the cooling season (hysteresis) to take heat storage due to snowmelt or reservoir operations into account. There were very weak correlations between model parameters and annual or seasonal air temperatures. To project weekly stream temperatures under a 2 × CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> climate scenario, weekly air temperature data from 166 weather stations, incremented by the output of the Canadian Center of Climate Modelling (CCC) general circulation model (GCM), were applied to nonlinear stream temperature models developed for 803 stream gaging stations. An error analysis indicated that only 39 stream gaging stations would not exhibit a significant change under the CCC‐GCM 2 × CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> climate scenario. The projections at the remaining 764 stream gaging stations showed that mean annual stream temperatures in the contiguous United States would increase by 2°–5°C, least near the West Coast and most in the Missouri River and Ohio River basins. On average, there would be a 1°–3°C increase in the maximum and minimum weekly stream temperatures under the 2 × CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> climate scenario, most in the central United States. It was also found that most streams would experience the maximum change in weekly stream temperatures in spring (March–June). The minimum changes in stream temperatures are projected to occur in winter (December and January) and summer (July and August) throughout the United States.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rain water running through soils and wetlands will leach decomposing plant organic matter into streams and lakes in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In streams, lakes and eventually estuaries, DOC can be mineralized to CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, precipitated to sediments or taken up in biological matter, and is thus an important part of many aquatic ecosystems. Using hydrological, climatological and geographical data from 32 sites located in Canada, we developed a neural network model which allowed us to estimate DOC export from the Canadian land mass. We reapplied the model to the 32 sites plus a further 43 basins to estimate area normalized exports for various regions of the country. We estimated that 14.3×10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> t of DOC are currently exported from Canadian terrestrial ecosystems. We then modified climatological inputs to the model to reflect the predicted temperature and precipitation conditions under a doubled atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> regime. Our model suggests that DOC exports will increase by approximately 14% under a doubled CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> atmosphere, mostly owing to increases in runoff. Our analysis also shows that DOC export is greatest in the spring in southern Canada and summer in the north.</jats:p>",
