      "abstract": "<jats:p> The most powerful of the social choice theorems are also highly significant to planning. The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem, for instance, states that every procedure for choosing from among at least three outcomes is either dictatorial or liable to manipulation, which is narrowly conceptualized as a false revelation of preferences. Planning provides opportunities for many other types of manipulation, but there is not much room for public planning in standard social choice theory, where the ideal is that social decisions should be independent of the procedures leading up to them. However, institutionally enriched social choice theory introduces assumptions about agenda formation and other organizational procedures. The effect is that the entire planniong process is seen to have potential impact on the final decision. A planning version of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem can then be formulates, which implies that one should not expect utility maximizing planners to always tell the truth in organizational setting where the agents act strategically in pursuit of their own interest. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews the developments in the new institutionalism in social science and their relation to communicative planning theory, with emphasis on the relevance to the practcal task of responding to demands for a more place-conscious evolution in public policy. I trace the evolution of forms of governance that are more responsive to the multiple claims and social worlds of civil society and include discussion of the social-constructionist conception of institutions, the significance of actors and networks, the interrelation between structure and agency, and the cultural dimesions of social networks. The implications for developing governance capability or instittional capacity are also explored. In reviewing comnmunicative planning theory, I discuss how Habermas's approach to communicative ation may be reworked or positioned in an institutionalist perspective. Finally, I explore how these developments can be used to dvelop understanding and strategies for evoling more inclusionary approaches to intgrated, place-focused public policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1980s planning in Britain was conditioned by Thatcherism. I explore whether the ideological influence continued into the 1990s, after Thatcher's 1990 resignation. The case for a significant change rests upon three dimensions—a greater stress on environmental issues, the resurrection of the development plan and new participatory forms of urban policy. I also explore a case study of London and discuss the implications of the “New Labour” goverment. I conclude that there was a significant weakening of Thatcherism during the 1990s, although the basic approach was retained. Uder Blair, however, a new ideological framwork with an emphasis on consensus signals a fresh approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tPlanification y desarrollo lingüísticos en el Caribe: El Suriname multi-étnico\n\t\tDespués de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Suriname, como muchos otros territorios del Caribe, experimenté un movimiento nacionalista y cultural creciente cuyos partidarios abogaban por un mayor papel para el sranan, la lengua franca criolla surinamense, en la vida nacional. Sin embargo, los prejuicios históricos desfavorables y la estigmatización del sranan dificul-taron los esfuerzos de promover y eleva r el idioma. Al contrario del mayor parte del Caribe, Suriname es una nación étnicamente muy diversa. La asociación del sranan como la propiedad de los criollos, una minoría dentro del país, limitaron los éxitos del nacionalismo cultural en la promoción del idioma. También en contraste con el resto del Caribe, el sranan goza de un reconocimiento bastante difundido como una lengua autonoma del neer-landés, el idioma oficial. Este hecho ha facilitado la planificacion lingüística en favor del sranan. El nacionalismo cultural tuvo cierto éxito en elevar la position social del sranan dentro de la población general, pero fracasó en movilizar suficiente apoyo oficial sostenido por el idioma en la administration nacional y en las escuelas. Una política oficial de monolingüismo neerlandés siguió rumbo ininterrumpida y inalterada, produciendo una generation multi-étnica de jovenes cuya lengua materna es el neerlandés. El debate sobre la planificación lingüistica se enfoca actualmente en la estan-dardización lingüistica y en la adopción del neerlandés-surinamense, la variante neerlandesa local fuertemente influída por el sranan, como el idioma oficial de Suriname.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingvoplanado kaj evoluigo en Karibo: Multietna Surinamo\n\t\tPost la Dua Mondmilito, en Surinamo, same kiel en aliaj teritorioj en la kariba regiono, ekkreskis kulturnaciista movado, kies apogantoj pledis por pli granda rolo por Sranano, la surinama kreola interlingvo, en la nacia vivo. Tamen, la delonge ekzistantaj antaŭjuĝoj kaj anatemigo de Sranano malhel-pas klopodojn antaŭenigi la lingvon kaj plialtigi gian prestigon. Malkiel la plejparto de aliaj karibaj teritorioj, Surinamo rolas kiel hejmo al diversaj etnoj. La identigo de Sranano kiel kultura posedajo de la kreoloj limigis la sukceson de la kreola kultura naciismo en la antaŭenigo de la lingvo. Ankaŭ malkiel la plejparto de la kariba regiono, Sranano estas vaste konata en Surinamo kiel sendependa de la officiala lingvo, la nederlanda. Tiu fakto, tamen, faciligis lingvoplanadon favoran al Sranano. Kultura naciismo ja sukcesis levi la statuson de Sranano antaŭ la generala publiko, sed malsuk-cesis rikolti sufican officialan subtenon al la lingvo fare de la nacia registaro aŭ en la lernejoj. Officiala nur-nederlandlingva politiko daüras senŝanĝe, produktante generacion de denaskaj parolantoj de la nederlanda. La lingvo-plana debato nun centrigas je normigi kaj akcepti la surinam-nederlandan, t.e. la lokan nederlandan lingvovarianton forte influatan de Sranano, kiel la officialan lingvon de Surinamo.</jats:p>",

As contraceptive prevalence increases, aspects of contraceptive‐use dynamics, including reasons for discontinuation and behavior after discontinuation, become important influences on fertility. This report uses calendar data from the 1993–94 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey to examine contraceptive behavior following discontinuation of modern‐method use. The individual‐level characteristics found to influence switching behavior include the method used, method‐related difficulties with previous contraceptive use, and education. A large amount of unexplained variation in switching rates remains, however, largely at the individual level, but also at the community level for certain types of transition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Polyethnic societies present some key implictions for planners. Discrimination against, and harassment of, minorities is worryingly universal, and planning professions in all soceties need to recognize and address these isues. Planning practice needs to reflect an awareness of the implications of difference while incorporating an understanding of prcesses of social change in relation to minority and migrant groups, specifically, changes in household size and/or structure and orienttion toward the housing market. The core empirical data of the paper comes from the 1991 Census of Population and a major study of housing needs in a large district in northern England. Although focused substantively on British debates and data, most of the concerns addressed in this paper have an element of universality. </jats:p>",

Ninety‐eight separate interviews with women and their husbands conducted in rural Chitwan District, Nepal, over a 12‐month period in 1993–94 revealed that people continually and self‐consciously weigh the perceived benefits and risks of practicing family planning relative to their situations. Temporary and, especially, hormonal methods are perceived to carry unacceptable health risks. Contraceptive technologies are evaluated in relation to competing priorities and interests. Household poverty heightened the perceived risk of family planning use; poor people fear they can ill afford negative effects to their health that might result. People assess their health status and physical workload, factors that they believe condition their ability to use family planning methods without experiencing damaging health effects. Strategies employed to lower contraceptive risk include altering the method of choice, manipulating relationships with spouses, timing the adoption of contraceptives, managing the context of service provision, and acting in light of the experiences of others. Qualitative findings from the fieldwork are complemented by analysis of data from a standardized fertility survey.</jats:p>",

I first examine approaches to measuring urban environmental perfomance, drawing on the concepts of carrying capacity, ecological footprint, environmental space, and appropriated ecosystem area. Since cities affect and are affected by ecological systems far beyond their physical boundaries, I propose including interactions at the local, regional, and global scales in the definition of environmental performance. I then systematcally review the current literature on the reltionship between four structural variables typically used to describe urban patternform, density, grain, and connectivity and four dimensions of environmental perfomance sources, sinks, ecological support systems, and human well-being. I conclude that what we measure and the scale of analysis affect the direction of observable urban ipacts. We must consider these factors as we select measures of urban environmental peformance. </jats:p>",

The popularity of female sterilization in rural Andhra Pradesh is shown to be intelligible if the symbolic value of a young mother's reproductive capacity is understood in terms of familial power relations. Through sterilization, young mothers can symbolically push their influential mothers‐in‐law toward old age, thus increasing their own relative prestige, and they can strive to control the ambiguity surrounding their reproductive functions. This study is based on 14 months of participant observation in three rural villages, a survey of 396 households, and unstructured interviews with 42 women and two men. It shows how demography and anthropology can be mutually supportive in their efforts to clarify population phenomena.</jats:p>",

Next, I discuss efforts at policy reform, focusing on the example of the Pacific Nortwest “timber belt.” I then use examples of community development drawn from experences in the “timber belt” to illustrate the emergence of the federal-corporate collabortion.

Analysis was completed of data for 70 women who were asked about their recollection of information and understanding of participation. Most women understood the purpose of the study. Their reasons for agreeing to participate varied by site and included wanting to try a new method, wanting to help others, and wishing to avoid pregnancy. Most women recalled correctly the burden of participation—number and frequency of visits, tests, and examinations. Most understood that they could withdraw from the study without jeopardizing their care. The women were also asked to recall the risks and benefits of the contraceptive they were testing. Only 23 percent recalled the pregnancy risk correctly; 40 percent underestimated and 19 percent overestimated it. Few women interpreted rates of risk correctly; some perceived high rates as low ones and the rates of the spermicide being studied as better than those of other contraceptives. This study confirms that risk is better recalled than understood. The participants surveyed remembered the information they were questioned about better than did participants in some other studies, a finding that supports earlier research results showing that younger, healthier patients (such as contraceptive users) recall better than older, less healthy ones.</jats:p>",

During the last four decades, the economy has moved away from its agricultural base, although it still contributes an important share to the economy. The rapid development and growth of the building industry in Saudi Arabia has resulted in an emerging globalization trend, whereby the settlements witnessed drastic changes in their social and physical structures. This paper focuses on globalization and coflicts surrounding the modernization of tradtional societies and identifies development issues likely to dominate the future of Asir. The globalization process, mainly the result of foreign (mostly Western) influence and the rapid expansion of the Saudi economy, has been detrimental to the preservation of local traditional architecture and to the quality of life in traditional communities, especially the settlements of the Asir region. This work views the effects of this process and proposes some areas, including government policy, climate and terrain, and religion, that may be exploited to help the country maintain a sense of uniqueness in a global world. </jats:p>",

They are part of a panoply of measures some of which are explicitly aimed at strengthening regional government. However, in this paper we argue that the new innovations are being put in place with insufficient attention paid to the need to reform central and local relations, so that the scope for regional autonomy is limited. The consequence is that relations between regional institutions are much weaker than their links to central government. We compare RDAs and regional planning fora in this regard and show that little thought has gone into harmonising their activities at the regional level as the emphasis has been placed on ensuring that central government retains overall control over policy. We conclude that, if regional autonomy is to be seriously introduced, the central state will have to substantially rethink the scope of national policy, especially in the planning arena. </jats:p>",

Data for currently married, fecund women aged 15–49 from demographic surveys conducted in the SNNPR in 1990 and 1997 are used to investigate contraceptive knowledge and communication, and the use and future need for family planning services in this population. This study focuses on how these processes are affected by household organization and women's status, and on their implications for population policies and programs. Considerations of the implications of these results for understanding the fertility transition of a highly diverse African population under severe stress are presented. Although household extension and polygamy characterize one‐third of the women sampled, they do not affect the women's contraceptive behavior. Women's literacy and autonomy are, by far, the most significant forces in the movement toward lower fertility in the region.</jats:p>",

All the deaths of women aged 15–49 in 1994–95 in three provinces of Vietnam were identified and classified by cause. Maternal mortality was the fifth most frequent cause of death. The maternal mortality ratio was 155 deaths per 100,000 live births. This ratio compares with the World Health Organization's estimates of 430 such deaths globally and 390 for Asia. The maternal mortality ratio in the delta regions of these provinces was half that of the mountainous and semimountainous regions. Because a larger proportion of the Vietnamese population live in delta regions than elsewhere, the maternal mortality ratio for Vietnam as a whole may be lower than that of the three provinces studied. Maternal mortality is low in Vietnam primarily because a relatively high proportion of deliveries take place in clinics and hospitals, where few women die in childbirth. Also, few women die of the consequences of induced abortion in Vietnam because the procedure is legal and easily available.</jats:p>",

In particular, it examines the role of management in planning and setting priorities for contingency planning, especially in those organisations that have specified that IT is critical to the business operations. The survey was undertaken because there was a perception that coping with disaster is a much‐neglected aspect of management in Australia, and this analysis examines the underlying attitudes. The findings reveal that most organisations are inadequately prepared and fail to take the issue seriously. Business continuity is not rated as a high priority. Managers in the IT area are also expected to take the responsibility for contingency planning for the whole business.</jats:p>",

Daneben gibt es eine Gruppe von Phraseologismen, welche in besonderem MaBe die Kultur der Sprache und ihrer Sprechergemeinschaft widerspiegeln und ohne das notwendige soziokulturelle Hintergrundwissen nichtverstanden werden können.

The Model for Financial Planning incorporates the time and the expected nature of financial events. The categories of the model include 1) money management issues that the individual faces as short-term expected events, 2) issues of meeting unexpected financial events through an emergency fund and insurance, 3) investing to reach the individual’s intermediate and long-term goals, 4) transference planning and other long-term issues whose time frame is unknown. The model has applications for “do it yourself” investors, financial planners, and students. The framework successfully integrates the broad range of topics typically covered in financial planning and personal finance courses. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

Er analysiert Daten aus dem in Indien gesprochenen Englisch in Bezug auf den Sprecher/Hörer, die Funktion, den Kontext und andere relevante Faktoren, die die Sprache im alltaglichen Leben bestimmen. In der postkolonialen Ära hat der Gebrauch dieses \"Grassroots English\" unter denjenigen, die sich in einer mehrsprachigen städtischen Umgebung spontan grundlegende Bestandteile der Sprache aneignen, in bemerkenswerter Weise zugenommen. Dieser Sprachgebrauch wird im allgemeinen nicht auf forma-lem Wege durch Unterricht erlernt. Diese Situation macht die Anpassungs-prozesse an die kontext- und funktionsspezifische Realität sichtbar. Anstatt über normative Eigenschaften des indischen Englisch auf einer Skala \"einheimischer\" und \"nicht-einheimischer\" englischer Sprachen zu theoreti-sieren, zeigt diese Studie die Komplementaritåt zwischen \"Grassroots English\" und anderen Sprachen Indiens, und die Entstehung dieser Variante als eine der notwendigen Kontaktsprachen im vielsprachigen Indien.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tHumnivela angla en komunika paradigmo\n\t\tLa referajo enfokusigas la komunikan aliron en plurlingvaj medioj kaj analizas donitajojn el la barata angla vidalvide al la parolanto/aüskultanto, la tasko, la kunteksto, kaj aliaj perantaj faktoroj, kiuj estras la paroladon en la ciutaga vivo. En la postkolonia epoko, okazis rimarkinda kresko en la uzo de la humnivela angla lingvo inter la spontanaj akirantoj de iuj elementaj eroj de la lingvo en urba, plurlingva medio.

In this paper, the architecture of a hybrid intelligent inference model for implementing the intelligent CAPP system is developed. The detailed structure for such a model is also constructed.

LR projects have been the most important planning tool in Japan, yet the results of their use to develop over 30 per cent of Japanese urban areas have been little examined. The paper challenges the conventional wisdom that LR projects are an effective means of preventing urban sprawl. Through interviews with local planners and participants in projects, and a detailed GIS mapping of land-use change and infrastructure development in the case-study area, the research presents an in-depth study of the use of LR for suburban land development, and a close look at the patterns of urbanisation on the fringe of Japan's most dynamic metropolitan region. It appears that while LR projects do clearly prevent sprawl within the project areas themselves, they tend to exacerbate problems of sprawl at the scale of the city and region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The justification for advance directives is grounded in the notion that they extend patient autonomy into future states of incompetency through patient participation in decision making about end-of-life care. Four objections challenge the necessity and sufficiency of individual autonomy, perceived to be a defining feature of liberal philosophical theory, as a basis of advance care planning. These objections are that the liberal concept of autonomy (i) implies a misconception of the individual self, (ii) entails the denial of values of social justice, (iii) does not account for justifiable acts of paternalism, and (iv) does not account for the importance of personal relationships in the advance care planning process. The last objection is especially pertinent in light of recent empirical research highlighting the importance of personal relationships in advance care planning. This article examines these four objections to autonomy, and the liberal theoretical framework with which it is associated, in order to re-evaluate the philosophical basis of advance care planning. We argue that liberal autonomy (i) is not a misconceived concept as critics assume, (ii) does not entail the denial of values of social justice, (iii) can account for justifiable acts of paternalism, though it (iv) is not the best account of the value of personal relationships that arise in advance care planning. In conclusion, we suggest that liberalism is a necessary component of a theoretical framework for advance care planning but that it needs to be supplemented with theories that focus explicitly on the significance of personal relationships.</jats:p>",

Nature was construed as a disordered and hostile realm destined to be conquered by man. Farmwork and projects of land reclamation were represented by means of metaphors of violent attack and war; agriculture came to symbolise the Fascist struggle for a radical transformation of Italian society. The city, understood as the epitome for civilisation, constituted an already domesticated and therefore ambiguous realm. As an ideal city, Rome represented the glorious era of the Ancient Roman Empire, which the Fascists wished to resurrect in a futuristic form. Rome of that time was, however, understood as corrupted by centuries of cultural decadence. Extensive modifications of the urban landscape were therefore made so as to represent in city space the Fascist claim to be a continuation of the antique past into a glorious new millenarian era. A comparison between Italian Fascism and German Nazism reveals that these movements had antithetic views on nature and cities. </jats:p>",

Implying a focus on the effects of investments on employment and hence urban growth, this model also takes the propensity of producers to hoard labour into account. Such behaviour, it is argued, generates continued employment expansions over and above that created by the original decision to invest. Furthermore, and unlike earlier work in this tradition, an attempt is made to account for regionally differentiated outcomes within individual economies. To this end, the notion of priority is introduced. The resulting model-delineating archetypal 'landscapes of priority'—not only captures the typical sequence of urbanisation experienced by many, if not most, of the former socialist states of Europe and Asia, but also indicates from where the economies in transition from central planning have to proceed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I seek to examine the relationships between fiction, violence, and the geographical imagination through an analysis of Eoin McNamee's debut novel Resurrection Man. In dealing with a universal theme—the will to kill—but set in 1970s Belfast and narrating the existential journey of a gang of Loyalist killers in their campaign of violence across the city, I suggest that this novel presents the modern city and the characters who inhabit its streets as individuals journeying through familiar and alien territories in search of a stable set of identities. Through an examination of the narrative style employed by McNamee–the structural devices, the metaphorical engagements, the linguistic tropes—I suggest that the novel reads the city beyond the scientific or social-scientific imagination. For geographers interested in the connections between cities, violence, and modernity, the novel invites us to establish a dialogic relationship with the literary text not to advance our own theories but to take seriously those which in structure, form, and content are radically different to our own. </jats:p>",

I highlight some of the benefits, tensions, and ambiguitics of the stakeholding metaphor, before considering whether it offers a blueprint for the construction of more ethically and socially responsible regional and local economies. I argue that the idea's main limitations stem from its basis in a notion of corporate autonomy which detracts from the diversity of ways in which places and regional contexts condition the range of feasible and beneficial company strategies. The debate highlights the need for more research into how corporate governance affects regional economic fortunes. I criticise stakeholding proposals for implying that the benefits of cooperative economic relations are sufficient to ensure the formation of new industries and new technological trajectories. In the final section of the paper I briefly examine the use of stakeholding in public policy debates in Britain, and the likely geographical consequences. I argue that the use of the term reflects an optimistic communitarianism, and that the benefits of emphasising community participation, rights, and responsibilities should not be used to legitimate a policy abandonment of those communities lacking the resources to participate as stakeholders. </jats:p>",

This empirical investigation explores individual accounts of delusional experience and the changed relationships with the body, home, and city. The ‘unboundedness’ of delusional experience is discussed, and the unpredictable therapeutic properties of nonmedical material spaces are addressed. It is argued that academic geography has neglected the voices of people who experience delusion and the many spaces which they inhabit. </jats:p>",

The authors argue that it is possible to understand the myriad ways in which various authorities have sought to govern the city through an interrogation of the series of means through which the city has been ‘diagrammed’ as a space of power, regulation, ethics, and citizenship. These speculations take a historical but not a historically ‘periodised’ form; the authors consider in turn the diagramming of the city in the ancient Greek world, the nineteenth-century liberal diagramming of the city, eugenic models of the city, and latter-day neoliberal modes of visualising, programming, and governing urban spaces. The aim is neither to found yet another theory of spatialisation nor to advance a Foucauldian urban sociology but to gauge the parameters which have bequeathed us the contemporary city as a governed and ethically saturated space. </jats:p>",

Yet very few ranges have comprehensive planning programs in place to proactively address current and future mission needs. As a result the Air Force leadership announced “Environmental, Safety and Occupational Health Initiatives” in 1995 that called for the development of comprehensive airspace and range plans to address both operational and environmental issues in order to maintain access to ranges and sustain readiness. Largely in response to these initiatives, the Air Force Development Test Center (AFDTC) at Eglin Air Force Base established a Range Environmental Planning Office in July 1995. This paper will introduce the range challenge, report on an innovative range planning partnership that has evolved over the last three years at Eglin, and address the importance of range planning to mission sustainability.</jats:p>",

The aim of this article is to introduce a method for creating treatment-relevant typologies that can be continually developed and linked to outcomes within the context of an information system. To increase understanding of interactions between programs and client outcomes, a typology of clients was created based on 14 personality scales, using scores obtained at the point of program admission. This article reports on the methods used to construct the typology, the substance of the classification system, and the steps that are being taken to ensure its continued development. It also emphasizes the advantage to typology development of ongoing access to an information system that includes recidivism and other outcome data. </jats:p>",

To this end, and taking 1994 as a reference, this paper describes the planning process and content of the manufacturing strategies of a representative sample of the largest industrial companies in Spain, analysing, in particular, the high priority manufacturing objectives and policies maintained during the period 1992‐1993 and those foreseen for the period 1995‐1999. The information analysed has been obtained from a mail survey. The comparison of the Spanish companies with American and other European manufacturers attempts to observe how the Spanish experience is similar to that of other countries, in order to obtain interesting conclusions for the managers who may be responsible for managing industrial companies located in Spain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author attempts to provide a synthesis of the long-run evolution of cities by taking an economic perspective. He defends the idea that urban growth for preindustrial cities has been limited by the tyranny of distance. Then he argues that technological progress, by fostering mobility, has reinforced economies of agglomeration and thus allowed for larger cities. This has led to the development of industrial cities and the dominance of the tyranny of distance. Nowadays, however, technological progress in communications and telecommunications seems to be challenging the rationale for agglomeration in cities as more and more economic interactions can be realized at arm's length. Increasing mobility may have turned into a threat for cities, hence the prediction about the demise of cities. Nonetheless, it is argued that the ‘tyranny of proximity’ may provide a strong glue to keep postindustrial cities together. </jats:p>",

Accommodating such variety can make the planning of appropriate training to enhance and develop their IT skills difficult. In order to explore the likely extent of diversity in IT experience and skills in today’s recruits, the project reported here examined the competence, attitudes and previous IT training of two consecutive cohorts of new entrants to a higher diploma programme. The surveys add weight to the view that nurse educators do face a considerable diversity in new students’ competence and experience with IT. Further analysis has also shown that subgroups of the cohorts, characterized by their age, gender, education or previous IT training, differed significantly in a ‘knowledge of computers’ score but not in their attitudes to IT. Arising from the results, the paper argues that, in seeking to develop a consistent level of IT literacy, core IT competence should be identified and all courses should have the clear objective of raising students’ confidence in using computers.</jats:p>",

Subjects in the experimental group were also requested in a second phase of the interviews to specify when and where they intended to perform the activities. The results showed that activities for which time and place had been specified were more likely to be performed. In Study 2 another 75 undergraduates volunteered to participate in an experiment in which they were requested to perform an activity (reporting mood effects of reading a prose excerpt) by themselves on one of three following days. One group of subjects only agreed to perform the activity, another group agreed to perform the activity as well as indicated when and where they would do it, and a third group in addition to this indicated which other activities they would perform on the same day. In support of the hypothesis that planning an activity increases the likelihood that it will be performed, the results showed that subjects who indicated other activities more frequently performed the target activity. More efficient time management resulting from planning may account for the findings, although further research is needed to show this conclusively.</jats:p>",

The author argues that the impact of European Objective One and Two policies for community economic development in the years following 1994 has sensitised local and regional interests in England to the opportunities of more locally owned actions dedicated to achieving social inclusion and that traditional regional policy portfolios will be seen as insufficient. He also explores the rising tide of interest in social economy and third system approaches generally, again with strong European influence, and examines a series of wider policy actions for the RDAs to consider under the banner of competitiveness with social cohesion. </jats:p>",

While tapping non-rational and thematic aspects of culture, research on culture and the self provides only limited insight into its dynamic and heterogeneous nature and into processes of enculturation. In turn, while capturing the fluid and complex nature of cultural systems, sociocultural work neglects its non-rational and thematic aspects. In both traditions, relatively little attention is given to power. The discourse analysis of family interaction undertaken by Pontecorvo and Fasulo (1999) is shown to overcome many of these limitations. Treating culture as an integrated, complex system which is integral to human interaction, their approach captures processes of cultural creation and change as well as power relations. In conclusion, it is argued that there is a need for greater cross-fertilization of ideas across the diverse traditions of research in culture and psychology, while respecting their distinctive insights and agendas. </jats:p>",

In this paper we discuss the social foundations that anchor people to places and present an analysis that demonstrates an interrelationship between community social institutions and nonmigration. Specifically, we show that the proportion of persons remaining between 1985 and 1990 in 3024 US counties varies directly with the number of locally owned small-scale retail establishments, the number of small-scale manufacturing firms and family farms, the number of local civic associations, and the proportion of the local population in civically active religious denominations. </jats:p>",

Yet, the state policies which have precisely these objectives fail. Why? I suggest that an important part of the answer lies in state form. I pursue this theme by looking at the land-reform policy of the Indian state. The land-reform policy happened to be one of the ways in which the postcolonial Indian state tried to create the conditions for capitalist development. But the democratic form of the state and the class alignment in the society set some limit within which the state had to work, and in particular, conditioned the form that the policy took. In short, the policy became bureaucratic as opposed to popular, and also entailed the mediation of market relation. This form of the policy was not what was struggled for by the lower classes. Yet, the state triumphed in imposing this form of the policy. To the extent that the policy failed to benefit the lower classes and to remove the fetters on capitalist development effectively, this was because of the form of the policy. However, the state has not failed equally everywhere. With a different parallelogram of class forces and thus a different context of the state action in particular States than that which generally existed at the national level and in most States, the outcome of the policy was, to some degree, different there. Statistical and qualitative analyses are presented to support this claim. </jats:p>",

The findings suggest that franchising is a viable growth strategy for small firms and that per se it creates few major problems for growth‐oriented small businesses. It is argued that further research is needed, particularly into the experiences of “failed” franchises and into the problems encountered by growing small firms who do not adopt franchising as a growth strategy.</jats:p>",

Within this region there have been important national differences in the experiences of privatisation: in terms of the legacies of the state-socialist period, in the methods of privatisation, and in the outcomes in terms of property rights. We explore three major aspects of privatisation. First, we revisit the path-dependent nature of privatisation, as a process which is influenced above all by national economic and political structures, including relationships in and around the state. Second, we argue that with emphasis on path dependency there is a failure to give sufficient attention to the way in which there was a significant shift in course of transformation in the range of strategics available to the main agents in the privatisation process; in particular, a high degree of control over property rights was achieved in the ‘third wave’ of privatisation by a small number of agents in the context of weak reregulation and corporate governance. Third, we investigate the nature of the third wave of privatisation through the functioning of networks of firms in the Czech and the Slovak Republics.</jats:p>",

This assessment is made within a view of biological integrity and ecosystem health. Within the Map of Italian Nature project, that started as a result of Italian national law n. 394/91, such assessments are currently applied to approximately 1.5 million hectares in order to establish new reserves and protected areas, based on their “natural values” and “fragility” at scales in which humans generally influence the condition of the landscape, to get a more representative network of regional biological diversity. Risk and value assessments, based on distribution of species and habitats most threatened with extinction and reduction, are made in reference to the coordination of information on the environment (CORINE) habitat mosaics. To this purpose, digital thematic maps are generated as geographic information systems (GIS) coverages in polygonal (vector) format from satellite, airborne, and observed distribution data of 1) existing land cover habitat types and biodiversity component distributions, and 2) different kinds of man‐induced disturbance. Habitat fragility is estimated either as “potential,” through a simple conceptual model relating fragility to sensitivity and human disturbance, or as “displayed,” inferred from habitat loss. Habitat sensitivity is used to compare biological health within habitat types. The Map of Italian Nature project aims at identifying gaps in the existing reserve network, and is very akin to the gap analysis approach. Map of Italian Nature intends to protect landscape mosaics at the broader scale, based on gaps in protection and threats while including finer scale data on threatened species to make sure they do not fall through the cracks. Results for a pilot study area are presented and the relevance of the approach to biological health and integrity assessments is discussed.</jats:p>",

Drawing on elements of regulation theory, actor-network approaches, and consumption studies, niche markets for SFPs are conceptualised as the outcomes of the intersecting activities of networks of producers, consumers, and institutions. On the basis of this conceptualisation and preliminary empirical evidence from a European research project, it is suggested that unique configurations of networks at local and regional levels, and their relationships to cxtralocal networks, will contribute to the success or failure of regional SFPs in promoting endogenous development. It is also argued that a focus on particular products, markets, and regions is required to gain a holistic understanding of the complex and contested network relationships through which niche markets for SFPs are constructed. </jats:p>",

Analytical expressions are derived for the change in basic employment and the export-base employment multiplier. These expressions are compared with the conventional hybrid approach where the impact on the recipient sectors is analysed by using a partial-equilibrium method and the effect on other sectors is calculated through some form of demand-driven multiplier. The conventional hybrid procedure fails to capture fully displacement in the regional labour market. If we use the general-equilibrium results as a benchmark, numerical simulation suggests that the hybrid approach substantially overestimates the employment effects of the subsidies. Similar problems are likely to apply to the evaluation of all supply-side policies targeted on the regional export base. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Societies in the Middle Ages underwent a fundamental change in their mode of organisation as they moved from being organised around concepts of kin rule to being ordered around the power exercised by kings over defined territories. Even though this state-making process led to the creation of a landscape that was inherently impersonal in nature, kings strove to legitimise and justify the existence of the new state to their subjects. Their principal method of engendering a sense of loyalty towards their kingdom or early state was through the promotion of certain group ideologies. A variety of these legitimising ideologies were utilised by societal leaders, including foundation legends of kingdoms, origin legends of people, and the promotion of senses of ethnic identity. By drawing on evidence from two Celtic societies in the British Isles, namely Wales and Ireland, it is argued that legitimising ideologies experienced a general increase in their geographical scale throughout the Middle Ages. It is suggested that the main reason for this general trend was the increasing use, and subsequent increasing maturity, of state institutions within medieval society. Such institutions enabled medieval rulers to govern larger territories in a more efficient manner and, as a consequence, legitimising ideologies of an ever-increasing geographical scale were needed in order to justify the rule of those particular political units. It is concluded that these legitimising ideologies were principally political constructs, which were manipulated by medieval rulers in order to justify their rule of an evolving state landscape. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the late 1990s, use of either of the words ‘childhood’ or ‘internet’ is enough to signify at a stroke many of society's contemporary hopes and fears about what it means to be modern. By providing a critical review of the burgeoning (popular, policy, and academic) literature that is emerging as debates about ‘childhood’ and ‘the Internet’ take centre stage in the ongoing struggle to define the future of our ‘virtual geographies’, what we seek to do in this paper is to unpack some of the assumptions that underpin both terms. Specifically, we argue that there is now a dominant story in circulation concerning what has been called the rise of a ‘digital generation’, albeit one, as we show, that can be read in two diametrically opposed ways. In the central part of the paper, by characterising the Internet as the latest in a long line of ‘frontier’ technologies, we identify three senses (in terms of time, in terms of space, and in terms of competence) in which this dominant story acts to construct discursively the cyberspace opened up by computer-mediated communication as distinct from the ‘here and now’ . For all its seductiveness, however, we propose that this discourse is not adequate to describe the complexities of what particular children might actually do with particular Internet-based tools in particular settings. By drawing on a variety of work (from both within and outside of the discipline) which has begun to open up the undifferentiated categories ‘children’ and ‘technology’ on which simplistic notions of a cohort of ‘cyberkids’ are based, we conclude the paper with some preliminary ideas about how we might be able to offer more nuanced accounts of being connected. </jats:p>",

The accountability arrangements for RDAs are ambiguous as to whether the agenda of the new agencies will primarily reflect the views of their boards and executives, regional stakeholders, or government ministers and departments. The authors put the current debate about RDA accountability into historical perspective and review its main features. They argue that the debate risks ignoring some important factors which affect the success of RDAs if it does not also (a) examine the issue of accountability within and between the broader constellation of organisations whose efforts must underpin the realisation of regional economic strategies, and (b) address a broader debate about the role of regional institutions— elected or not—in encouraging regional economic innovation and development. </jats:p>",

We also provide a methodological framework within which the implications of policies related to domestic water demand can be evaluated, before the policies themselves are implemented. We make use of primary data collected in Katarko, a rural village in northeastern Nigeria. Through regression models for the dry and rainy seasons we demonstrate that beyond socio-cultural and demographic factors, economic ones are also significant in determining domestic water demand. These findings underscore not only the importance of demand-side management in water-related projects, but also the need to incorporate economic principles in them. Making use of the identified determinants into water-demand projections further reveals how changes in these variables can affect future demand.</jats:p>",

Twenty-four university musicians listened to expressive performances of short piano excerpts played for them via MIDI on a Yamaha Disklavier acoustic piano. These expressive models contained idiomatic features (musically appropriate) and nonidiomatic features (musically inappropriate). After hearing each model, subjects reported their thoughts regarding dynamic variations they had heard and then attempted to imitate the model in their own performance on the piano. Results indicated that expressive performance of dynamic variations is influenced by the performer's explicit identification of dynamic features and their incorporation into a specific goal performance plan. Analyses of individual dynamic features revealed that subjects who identified features consistently performed the features differently than did the subjects who did not identify them. Subjects who identified features played nonidiomatic features more accurately and played idiomatic features at more pronounced overall levels. </jats:p>",

In this article we describe the development of a contracting philosophy for planning and executing the project through the formation of an alliance comprised of operator, drilling contractor, and integrated services company. We examine the unique environmental and logistical features of this project and describe how the alliance addressed these critical issues by using the strengths of the respective companies to reduce risks and ensure a cost-effective, successful operation. The logistical management of this rank wildcat well, which was situated in a remote location offering no practical means of resupply and no local resources, was further complicated by the technical difficulties associated with the well.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We conclude by discussing the different objectives of each company in conjunction with the overall project objectives and describing how these respective goals were aligned to the mutual needs of the alliance. The lessons learned by the alliance members are noted and recommendations are made for approaching similar operations.</jats:p>",

It is argued that decision‐making processes around land use, especially when they concern conflicts between development and environmental protection, are not easily rendered into the flexible arrangements deemed characteristic of governance. Two case studies in the housing and minerals sectors – presented to illustrate this general argument – show the existence of strong ‘strategic lines’ which tend to subsume local representations and limit the formation of partnerships. In both cases, the strategic line comes dressed in the language of technical (numerical) forecasts and projections which raises problems for any local opposition to the thrust of the strategy. In conclusion it is argued that although some recasting of the planning regime in each sector is underway this has only served to highlight continuing problems in linking strategy and locality, especially in cases of conflict around land use, which regional governance may not easily alleviate.</jats:p><jats:p>Cet article examine le prétendu changement du <jats:italic>gouvernement</jats:italic>à la <jats:italic>gouvernance</jats:italic> dans le contexte de la planification de l’utilisation du sol en Angleterre et montre certains des problèmes liés à la croissance de l’autonomie régionale dans les systèmes gouvernementaux. Les processus de décision concernant l’utilisation du sol, particulièrement quand ils concernent des conflits entre le développement et la protection de l’environnement, ne sont pas aisément résolus par les arrangements flexibles qui sont dits caractéristiques de la gouvernance. Deux cas d’étude dans les secteurs du logement et des mineraux – présentés afin d’illustrer l’argument général – montrent l’existence de fortes ‘<jats:italic>strategic lines</jats:italic>’ qui ont tendance à inclure les représentations locales et qui limitent la formation d’associations. Dans les deux cas, ‘<jats:italic>the strategic line</jats:italic>’ prend la forme des prévisions techniques (quantitative) et des projections, ce qui pose des problèmes pour toute opposition locale à la dynamique de la stratégie. En conclusion, bien que certains remaniements soient en cours dans le régime de planification de chaque secteur, ceci n’a servi qu’à souligner les problèmes continus des liens entre la stratégie et la localité, particulièrement en cas de conflit quant à l’utilisation du sol, que la gouvernance régionale risque de ne pas pouvoir résoudre facilement.</jats:p>",

In this study we examine the two leading border water-management agencies today, the venerable International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) and the new Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC), to understand better the post-NAFTA prospects for policy innovation in this issue area. The two agencies, IBWC and BECC, are analyzed from the perspective of two prominent theoretical explanations for agency behavior, structural choice politics and interorganizational implementation, to identify their political and institutional limitations as binational water-management agencies. We then chart the prospects for further innovation in binational water management along the US—Mexico border. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Theories suggest that administrators may use their discretion to advance their agency’s version of the public interest, court political support, or both. The author hypothesizes that administrators courting political support use their discretion to reward legislators who monitor their programs more closely than do other legislators. The author measures the degree of scrutiny a program receives by quantifying members’participation in oversight hearings. In analyzing the allocation of Urban Development Action Grants (UDAGs), the author finds that administrators in the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Office of Community Planning and Development were guided by both the agency’s perception of the public interest and by political considerations. Members of the House Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs who participated more extensively in hearings overseeing HUD programs received larger UDAG allocations in their home districts, and more oversight led to more grant money. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Person‐centered planning is becoming a popular means of designing supports for people with disabilities. However, very little research evaluating person‐centered planning exists. We evaluated the degree to which items and activities reported to be preferred in person‐centered plans represented accurate preferences based on how individuals responded when presented with the items and activities. Person‐centered planning meetings were conducted with 4 individuals with profound multiple disabilities to develop preference maps and to identify leisure‐related preferences. A sample of the reported preferences in the plans was then systematically assessed by observing each participant's approach and avoidance responses to the items and activities. Of the sampled items and activities reported to be preferred in the plans, 42% represented moderate preferences based on the latter assessment process and 33% represented strong preferences. With 2 participants, several preferences identified in the plans were nonpreferred items and activities based on the preference assessments, and some were frequently avoided. These results suggested that although person‐centered plans may identify some accurate preferences for people with profound multiple disabilities, this approach should be used cautiously. Results also suggested that such plans should be supplemented with systematic preference assessments to ensure the accuracy of identified preferences. Future research areas focus on evaluating other aspects of person‐centered planning.</jats:p>",

Patients who had recently undergone primary unilateral trans‐tibial amputation, living in their own homes before the amputation, were included. Fifty‐two patients with a median age of 78 years (60–92) were assessed with the Katz Index of ADL. Results revealed that of the 10 (20%) patients discharged to their own homes within 1 month, only 2 belonged to grades A‐C, that is, were independent in the majority of functions in personal ADL. Within 6 months 62% were discharged to their own homes. Eighty‐four percent of the patients in grades D‐G, i.e. most dependent on others, were still at the hospital or dead 1 month post‐operatively. All the patients who belonged to grades A‐F survived the first month post‐operatively. The Katz Index of ADL had predictive value regarding early outcome in terms of length of hospital stay, discharge to the patient's own home or death within 1 month, and positive predictive value regarding survival the first month post‐operatively.</jats:p>",

Commercial sponsors have been generous. There is a Management Committee, drawn from the principal funders, a Preservation Administrators Panel to advise on preservation strategy, a Committee on Preservation Surrogates, and a Digital Archiving Working Group. Several research projects are being supported, including work on gaps in preservation training, resolving dampness in buildings, and preservation management of digital materials. This last is now occupying a great deal of attention, and the NPO works closely with other preservation initiatives in the UK and abroad. Much work is also taking place towards a national preservation strategy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> This research examines the sensitivity and vulnerability of community water systems (CWSs) to weather and climate in the Pennsylvania portion of the Susquehanna River Basin. Three key findings emerge from a survey of 506 CWS managers. First, CWSs are sensitive to extreme weather and climate, but that sensitivity is determined more by type of system than system size. CWSs that rely partly or wholly on surface water face more disruptions than do groundwater systems. Larger systems have more problems with flooding, and size is not a significant determinant of outages from storms or disruptions from droughts. Second, CWS managers are unsure about global warming. Few managers dismiss global warming; most think global warming could be a problem but are unwilling to consider it in their planning activities until greater scientific certainty exists. Third, the nature of the CWS, its sensitivity to weather and climate, and projected risks from weather and climate are insignificant determinants of how managers plan. Experienced, full‐time managers are more likely to consider future weather and climate scenarios in their planning, while inexperienced and part‐time managers are less likely to do so. Implications of these findings include support for efforts to move away from surface water, for clear communication of climate change information, and for the hiring and retention of full‐time professional CWS managers.</jats:p>",
