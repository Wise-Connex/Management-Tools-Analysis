In particular, statutory authorities have been slow to acknowledge the mobility and access needs of disabled people, and the legislative base to back up local authority policies remains largely ineffectual and weak. In this paper, the interrelationships between disability and the built environment are considered by focusing on the role of the UK land-use planning system in securing access provision for disabled people. </jats:p>",

In this paper, planning concerns in one such nation, the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), are examined. The study opens with a description of each of the four separate states in the FSM, emphasizing their geographical, historical, and cultural characteristics. Regional aspects of FSM development are then examined by a statistical analysis of the geographical distribution of population in the individual states. Strategies are explored to incorporate rural outer islands found in three states, as outlined in the first two FSM national plans. The study concludes with an assessment of the regional challenge of developing the FSM into an economically and culturally sustainable nation. </jats:p>",

Along with this development, the energy would be an important element to maintain or increase this growth. In Indonesia, for instant, the growth of energy demand is estimated to be 6% during years of 2000 to 2010. For natural gas demand especially, Indonesia will consume about 1.1 Tcf/year. Java Island, in this case, would become the highest increase of energy demand, from 393 MMcf/D in 1989 to 1200 MMcf/D by 2010. By that time, the natural gas production from both non associated gas and associated gas reservoirs in the Northwest Java basin from where the large amount of gas is produced, is predicted to decline.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In order to overcome this problem, another prospective gas resources that could be exploited is coalbed methane. This kind of prospective gas resource has been found in large reserve in the of Northwest Java basin, epecially in Talang Akar formation, some of the coalbed methane layers found in Talang Akar posses overpressure condition. In this formation, it is found that the vitrine reflectance of coal, ranges from 0.5% to 1.9%. The gas resources from coalbed methane reservoir in Indonesia is estimated about 213 Tcf, and of 33.4 Tcf of this volume is found in Northwest Java basin area. Until this time, these coalbed methane deposit have not yet been developed or exploited commercially.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The economics and the technical aspects of the coalbed methane exploitation and its properties in Talang Akar formation are evaluated and discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",

Planners all over the Federal Republic believed they had an obligation to lay the groundwork for cities of the future, not simply to rebuild the cities of the past. Many of the central issues addressed by the planners have already been touched on, including the best location for housing construction, the retention or modification of the historic street pattern, the renewal of slum areas, and the desire to reduce population densities in the inner cities. Earlier chapters considered these issues in the context of the construction of individual buildings or smaller ensembles.

Most senior planners were removed from office or allowed to resign. Sometimes the purge affected lesser officials as well, although this varied widely from place to place. Naturally the central agencies in Berlin that had sponsored urban planning were abolished along with the Reich government. The members of the Arbeitsstab Wiederaufbauplanung, planners in Speer’s ministry and in the German Labor Front, scattered across Germany, seeking refuge in cities where they hoped to be able to work, either as private architect/planners or as employees of new city governments or even as employees of the occupying powers.</jats:p>",

This study describes the historical development of the two communication sectors and documents policy trends affecting each over the last five years. The study then explores Vietnam's shifting political economy during the same period, finding that the country's efforts simultaneously to maintain its Communist political ideology and to develop its economy through free-market mechanisms and foreign invest ment explain the tenuous dualism in communications policy. </jats:p>",

By contrast, in this paper the archaeological project is portrayed as an illuminating failure which holds valuable lessons for geographers. The archaeological period is placed in the context of Foucault's career, and then the Archaeology of Knowledge is situated as the arena for Foucault's most instructive encounters with the problems of necessity, contingency, and human subjectivity. Although Foucault's profound theoretical modesty does not solve the problem of how to theorize specificity, it does suggest that we make significant adjustments in our own attempts to do so. The implications of the argument are given a test drive through a brief reading of recent work by Thrift, after which a recasting of the notion of responsibility is put forward as a means of beginning to deal more bravely with poststrueturalism. </jats:p>",

As a minimalist approach to these questions I imagine human thought-and-action as a double helix, It is assumed firstly, that man is a semiotic animal, a species whose individuals are kept together and apart by their use of signs; secondly, that every sign within itself combines elements of drastically different ontologies. This invisible world is then captured in a three-dimensional coordinate system whose axes are those of identity, difference, and intentionality. While the resulting map is anchored in fix-points of silence, the real world of socialization and understanding is always in flux. The paper closes with a pastiche on Carl von Linné's Flora Suecica; in the current world of thought-and-action, signifier and signified are assigned the same ordering functions as stamina and pistil once were in the world of plants. How do I draw the invisible lines of the taken-for-granted? How do I project a dematerialized point onto a transparent plane? </jats:p>",

But is it really? In this paper it is argued that even the most sophisticated of attempts at ‘theorizing the social’ can claim success only by abandoning reason where reason is needed most: in the abstract formulation of particularity. In the pursuit of this ultimately fatal flaw of any theoretical endeavour, the author ultimately asks what it is about society and space that seems to require a theoretical approach, and what precisely we stand to lose if we opt for a theoretically informed abandonment of theory. With reference to Walter Benjamin, whose work is read as an embodiment of the most crucial conflict between reason and justification, an attempt will be made towards a genuinely material social science that does not rely on external guarantees to achieve a modest goal in the possibility of cognizance. </jats:p>",

The paper opens with a discussion of the meaning of flexibility in a dynamic economy to expose the social division of labour as the foundation of the creation and evolution of production systems. Production systems are established to obtain the scale and scope economies offered by the independent firms of the social division of labour. The necessity to organize production requires the creation of some type of an internal or external governance structure. The Japanese have developed a social technology that resolves the transaction cost trade-offs confronting North American industry between internal and external governance structures.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The nucleus of postmodern philosophy and theory is derived primarily from French neostructuralist writings. The ontological foundation of such literature is the idealist rejection of the possibility of knowing reality and, as a consequence, the enclosure of the subject within the signifying universe, which in turn results in the exaltation of the signifying processes as the only social processes. The same emphasis, but through nonverbal means, is demonstrated by postmodern architectural and urban design. In geography, however, postmodernism is interpreted differently. In two recent books (by Soja and by Harvey) the postmodern era in human geography is related to the heightened importance of space for social reality and theory. But the split of geography itself between Marxist geography on the one hand, and behavioural and humanistic geography on the other, shows the pertinence of the signifying dimension for the field of geography. In this paper, it is argued that the roles of space and meaning are equally important for geography, and it is proposed that an analysis of the signifying aspect of space may be achieved through semiotics, currently the most complete and sophisticated theory of meaning and culture. The main problem for geography, which is addressed in the final section of this paper, is the integration of a renewed version of the semiotics of space with an equally renewed Marxist geography, the most powerful explanatory approach to geography we have at our disposal. </jats:p>",

First, the 1990 elections are analyzed, the first democratic elections in half a century. Strategies of candidates and parties to gain power, and pressures toward privatization and economic development are discussed, drawing on fieldwork by Eastern European teams in the Local Democracy and Innovation Project. To clarify future directions of these new democracies, eight options are discussed—reliance on the traditional Soviet model, unions, clientelism, ethnic or regional identification, the church, the populist leader, voluntary associations, and the new political culture. These eight options constitute distinct rules of eight separate games. Rather than a single game or model predominating, continuity in these eight over time is expected. Still, the first games are likely to be superseded by those further down the list. </jats:p>",

We argue that which components are required and which developmental changes are triggered or revealed depend on the planning task. We present analyses of three tasks typically used to study planning: the Tower of Hanoi; errand scheduling; and story comprehension. We argue that the performance on the Tower of Hanoi task reflects representational and monitoring demands, and that story comprehension depends strongly on social comprehension and monitoring. Because many everyday plans like running errands have prepackaged components and take place in a less controllable environment, affective and attributional components affect most strongly the choice of goals, decision to plan, and strategy choice. We then speculate on the course of development of each processing component and the complex interplay of cognition, beliefs, attitudes, and motivation in assembling and implementing plans to handle different tasks. Finally, we consider changes across the life span in the kinds of plans that are generated. </jats:p>",

A topological map depicts this landscape in terms of the three fields originally defined by Charles Sander Peirce as iconic, indexical, and symbolic. An anthropological map explains how the landscape is being settled by Homo significator, who first lives in Ferdinand Tonnics's realm of Gcmeinschaft and then moves across the river into the realm of Gescllschaft.

The overall objective is to provide potential users, particularly small municipalities, with a basis for selecting the TPS best suited for evaluating traffic management alternatives for work zones. Four TPSs (TRANPLAN, MINUTP, SYSTEM II, and QRS II) were examined and rated with respect to eleven characteristics, SYSTEM II and QRS II, rated first and second, respectively, are used to assign traffic in a selected network. Alternate routes during road work are identified to minimize total delay and noise impact. The performance of the two TPSs is assessed in relation to predictive accuracy, post-processing requirements, and compatibility with other software. It is found that, while concerns about predictive accuracy and training needs can be overcome at a price, some special features are required within the present generation of TPS for them to be truly beneficial in the routine analysis of work-zone traffic plans. The significance of these features is discussed in reference to the assignment case study. Key words: traffic assignment, work zone, traffic management, planning, software, SYSTEM II, QRS II. </jats:p>",

Two major approaches to the subject are identified: the first, most extensively developed in the United States, is focused upon occupational shifts and their impact upon the earnings paid to individuals; and the second, which has emerged in Britain, is focused upon households and all the types of work undertaken within them. These approaches and their differing implications for polarization—the first approach suggesting a ‘disappearing middle’ and the second approach a growing ‘underclass’—are related to differing social and economic circumstances in Britain and the United States. Both approaches are applied to a household survey of the economically active in Southampton. The survey indicates that social polarization is a result both of sectoral shifts in the local economy and of changing household structures. A number of contrasts between labour-market influences upon polarization in the United States and Britain are highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of the historical geography of modernity. It is argued that the exclusive focus on social theory has detrimental effects on the appreciation of normative political concerns and that it ignores the resurgence of normative political theory. Habermas's concept of the public sphere, and its place within his theoretical and empirical studies, is, by contrast, commendably concerned with linking the social and historical work with normative political theorising, and its usefulness for geographical investigation is applauded. However, the criticisms directed from, in particular, communitarian political theorists and contextualist social researchers would seem to make his attempt to bring a ‘strong’ theory of public political life back within the remit of a reconstructed social theory less plausible. One set of responses to this criticism comes in the form of the attempt to build geography into this normative political theory, turning public spheres into public spaces; Arcndt's political theory, in conclusion, is thus held to be a significant contribution to the historical geography of modernity. </jats:p>",

The conventional gravity model is shown to be a particular case of the new gravity—opportunity model. The calibration of the new model is reached by using Furness's matrix calibration procedure together with Hooke and Jeeves's nonlinear optimizing method.

In this study, differential GPS data were collected for an area of rapid rural-to-urban land-use change by using low-cost GPS receivers in static and kinematic modes. These data were then processed for input to a geographic information system and assessed for their positional accuracy. It was found that GPS data collected in static mode and differentially corrected possessed a circular map accuracy standard (CMAS) of 3.62 m. These accuracies meet the requirements of many large-scale and medium-scale mapping programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Freezing the master production schedule (MPS) is one of the commonly used methods to reduce schedule instability or nervousness in material requirements planning (MRP) systems. However, the impact of MPS freezing parameters in multilevel MRP systems has not been fully understood. This paper investigates the impact of MPS freezing parameters on the total cost, schedule instability and service levels in multilevel MRP systems under demand uncertainty conditions. The MPS freezing parameters included in this study are: (1) planning horizons; (2) freezing proportions; (3) freezing methods; and (4) replanning periodicity. The paper also examines the impact of forecasting errors on the selection of MPS freezing parameters and system performance. A model was built to simulate forecasting, master production scheduling and material requirements planning operations in a manufacturing company. The company is assumed to produce two end items with no component commonality. The company operates in a make‐to‐stock environment. No back orders are allowed and thus any shortage will become a loss of sales. Through a comprehensive simulation experiment and statistical analysis, the study arrived at the following findings: (1) Forecasting errors significantly increase total costs and schedule instability, and reduce the service level in multilevel MRP systems. The selection of forecasting models has a significant impact on system performance. In addition, forecasting errors also influence the selection of some MPS freezing parameters. (2) A planning horizon of four natural ordering cycles results in a lower total cost and schedule instability and a higher service level than a planning horizon of eight natural ordering cycles under demand uncertainty condition, but a higher total cost and schedule instability under deterministic demand conditions. Thus the prolongation of the planning horizon can actually worsen MRP performance under demand uncertainty conditions while it improves MRP performance under deterministic demand conditions. (3) A higher freezing proportion results in a lower total cost and schedule instability, and does not influence the service level under deterministic demand conditions. Therefore, freezing the entire planning horizon is the best option in this case. However, a higher freezing proportion often results in a higher cost, and a lower service level, while reducing schedule instability under demand uncertainty conditions. As a result, the choice of freezing proportion should be based on the required trade‐offs among the three performance criteria under demand uncertainty conditions. (4) The order‐based freezing method results in lower total costs than the period‐based method in most cases. In terms of schedule instability, the period‐based method with freezing proportion of 1.0 performs the best. In terms of service level, the period‐based method with freezing proportion of 1.0 performs the worst; the period‐based method with freezing proportion of 0.25 performs the best. The selection of the freezing method should be considered in combination with the freezing proportion to achieve the required trade‐offs among the performance criteria of total costs, schedule instability, and service level. (5) A higher replanning periodicity results in a lower total cost, schedule instability, and a higher service level under both deterministic and stochastic demand conditions. Thus, less frequent replanning improves system performance. These conclusions may help MRP practitioners to select MPS freezing parameters in multilevel MRP systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The dramatic flourishing of small-scale enterprise in recent years has stimulated a great deal of academic interest. Indeed many researchers have given the small firm pride of place in theories designed to explain the growth of a new, more ‘flexible’, economic environment. Recently, however, commentators have questioned whether these analyses are perhaps not overly optimistic in the role they ascribe to small firms. We add to the debate through a study of small Canadian brewers (microbrewers). Whereas Canada's major brewers have been forced to restructure and rationalise their operations in the face of new competitive pressures, including trade liberalisation and changing consumer demand, microbreweries have found themselves catering to a growing niche market and have expanded rapidly in number. Although much of the microbrewery ‘success story’ appears to support theories of small-firm growth, we argue that a cautionary note must be added for the future. Improved efficiency and flexibility is making it easier for large brewers to break into the high-profit-margin niche markets that were once the preserve of their smaller counterparts. As a result, the next decade may not witness the same levels of small-firm growth that characterised this sector in the 1980s. </jats:p>",

However, most management information systems are centered on information obtained in-house. Very little emphasis is placed on external information, except some very general information published by Government bodies. If it is possible to incorporate information from other similar firms into the analysis, a firm will be able to plan and therefore compete more efficiently and improve its overall performance. The application of interfirm comparison studies as an analytical tool to aid management in planning and performance improvement has been well developed and widely accepted in many developed countries.

In this paper, the Scheme is described and both the ‘farm’ and ‘farmer’ characteristics of a sample of ‘adopters’ and ‘nonadopters’ in England and Wales are examined as well as the reasons for adoption and nonadoption. The results indicate that adopters are drawn from larger farms, those with higher incomes and levels of borrowing, the younger, better educated farmers, and from farms where spouses are more actively involved in developing the business. Considerable resistance towards diversification was found among nonadopters, who have still to be convinced of the financial viability of this type of business development; to many, it is just not farming.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two main approaches have dominated economic theories of physician location; the traditional neoclassical view, in which it is assumed that the medical marketplace is truly competitive, and the provider-inducement model, in which it is predicted that more physicians increase rather than decrease the price of their services. In terms of their distributional implications both models suggest that an increased supply of physicians will initiate their diffusion, but at different rates. In this paper, the relevance of both models in terms of understanding the changing distribution of general practitioners in New Zealand between the years 1981 and 1987 is examined. Despite a substantial increase in the supply of physicians and their services, only modest improvements occurred in their regional distribution, and urban—rural differences got worse. Even conditions of near surplus within Auckland, New Zealand's largest metropolitan area, produced only marginal improvements in the availability of care. The results suggest that the traditional reliance of primary health-care policy in New Zealand on market-based solutions to improve geographic accessibility would seem to be misplaced and support current policy moves on the part of the state to regulate the distribution of physicians and their expenditure. </jats:p>",

Adolescents did not make more errors than either group of adults, but retired adults made more errors than working adults regardless of whether plans were analysed as given or following subjects' own plans.

To facilitate this process, the IHS has developed a manpower planning model to provide for the distribution of dental providers based upon the dental needs of the AI/AN population and within the limits of annual appropriations of funds. This paper briefly describes the original IHS Dental Program manpower planning model and the development of modifications over time. The need‐based approach to manpower planning developed by the IHS Dental Program has exhibited utility and flexibility over time. It allows a determination of clinic size (number of operatories) and dental staffing requirements, and may be generalizable to other public health programs if an accurate assessment of utilization rate and treatment need can be made for the defined population. Nonetheless, the availability of resources in public programs is subject to the compromises inherent in the political process; thus, the use of a manpower planning model alone may not be sufficient to ensure the equitable distribution of dental resources and dental providers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past four decades, many national governments, both centralist and federal, have spent considerable resources on planning for improved types of human settlement. Sometimes, grand schemes of regional planning, ‘New Town’ development, vast subdivisional tracting, and, even, industrial policy have been prepared and implemented in the name of urban and metropolitan development. The developmental role of local councils, as governmental authorities, has been either understated or underutilized; often, both. Australian governments should now reflect upon past policies and, most particularly, reconsider the role of a proactive local government sector in future metropolitan and urban development. In general terms, a multigenerational model regarding Australian urban policy design is considered. The first three, and more conventional, generations consist of: (1) the local government ‘fragmentation’ dispute, whereby local authorities are regarded as being too small, parochial, and ineffective as planning institutions; (2) the ‘New Town’ period, involving centralized planning and funding; and (3) a consolidation era where many different types of corporate, multifocal authority agencies have been created. The fourth generation constitutes the governmentally approved multifunction polis (MFP): A unique Japanese–Australian vision of a 21st century technopolis. It is argued that a further, fifth, model needs to be considered in the context of Australia's continuing outer-(sub)urban development. A linear growth-linkage model is presented; one which enhances the role of local government planning and development near the various state-located capital cities. </jats:p>",

The objective of this empirical investigation is to uncover spatial and organizational linkages of producer services that have developed in response to changes in the industrial organization of a modern capitalist production system. The focus is on three types of linkages, namely subcontracting, inputs of producer services, and inputs of goods and final services. The data collected through a survey of producer services in Edmonton reveal that subcontracting rather than internalization is the main mode of production. Therefore the producer service sector can play an important role as a supplier of indigenous higher-order services and innovations, inducing better productivity rates in other industrial sectors including resource-oriented local producers. </jats:p>",

It is the premise in this paper that the transition tests the social policy ‘wisdom’ of the pluralistic, democratic ‘Western’ societies and offers scholars the opportunity for monitoring and learning. The paper is focused on family benefits, a component of social policy, and is concentrated on Hungary, Poland, and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. A contrast is made to European countries of the European Community and the European Free Trade Association. The United States is also covered. The discussion is concentrated on maternity and parental leave, care for infants, toddlers, and preschool children, and family allowances. One important question addressed is whether with current financial constraints the East will be forced to relinquish its family benefit policies as the West expands such policies. Or, to the contrary, will these policies be expanded further in the East, as a substitute for unemployment insurance and to solve other labor-market problems? </jats:p>",
