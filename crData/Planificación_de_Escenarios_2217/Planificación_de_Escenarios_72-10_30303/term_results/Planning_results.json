The economics can be calculated if it prospect. The economics can be calculated if it is assumed the prospect will be productive or if it is dry; but when the possibility exists for either alternative, the answers must be preceded by an \"if\" and tend to lose some of preceded by an \"if\" and tend to lose some of their meaning. This problem is more difficult when multiple prospects within a play are considered and is practically impossible for multiple plays within an exploration program.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The expected value concept has been recognized as a method that can help in providing economics of plays and programs for decision making. Through the use of probability, the \"fractional economics\" of individual prospects can be calculated and summed into expected value economics for a play. Several plays may then be summed to provide the essence of a plan for a program.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To remove the drudgery from making the economic analysis, exploration and development activities have been modeled on the time-share computer. The system accepts input values of costs, timing, production, and other economic factors on average prospects in a play. Probabilities of different events occurring are also Probabilities of different events occurring are also input and used to calculate expected value results on production and investments. This is done for any number of plays. The economics of each individual play are then computed, and the totals summed into economics for the total program. program. Capability is provided for summing any number of programs into an over-all program. Capital budget categories, exploration manpower requirements and expected reserves, as well as cash flow, net income, rate of return and payout-time information are available on request payout-time information are available on request at each stage of the summing process. These can be considered in relation to company objectives and resource availability.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>It should be noted that, by strategic use of probabilities of 0 and 1.0 and by inputting estimates for an actual prospect rather than average prospects, the economics for that actual prospect may be computed. prospect may be computed.

There is no single statistic that can represent the accuracy of the network output, and therefore a recent Canadian planning study decided to consider the information obtained from hydrometric networks under the three headings of mean discharge, flow dependability, and floods. The increase in accuracy from network intensification and the probable future benefits were then estimated separately for each of these three categories. Some of the techniques developed in this pilot study are outlined, and it is noted that, for the projections that were used and the conditions of the study area, increases in the accuracy of flow dependability and flood flow data outranked the mean flow category in regard to potential future benefits.</jats:p>",

There are two main features to the problem: the presence of two conflicting groups or subsystems that disagree on a desirable trend for the ratio over a planning horizon, and a lag factor, which means that if one group is in a relatively unfavorable position in a given period, then an extra weight is given to its demands, with respect to changes in the ratio, in the next period. The lag factor takes the form of constraints in the model. The two conflicting objectives in the system are translated into minimization and maximization of a real-valued function. The solution produces lower and upper bonds for the value of a decision variable; an actual budget allocation has to be within these bounds. An application of the model to the use of student-to-library-seat ratios is presented. </jats:p>",

Before these resources can be developed, potential environmental effects must be weighed against the benefits to be derived from their use. A national concern for environmental quality has been translated into policy by the National Environmental Act of 1969.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Complying with the requirements of the Act for new energy resources development on public lands is a complex undertaking requiring public lands is a complex undertaking requiring (1) clearly defined program objectives, (2) an organization which can integrate public policy with diverse scientific disciplines, and (3) flexibility to adjust planning as various sections of the Act are clarified by Court decisions. This discussion explores the interrelationship between these factors using, as an example, the planning and organization created specifically to develop the Department of the Interior's Proposed Prototype Oil Shale Leasing Program.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In September, 1972, the Department of the Interior filed with the Council on Environmental Quality one of the most complex draft environmental statements ever prepared.

The concept of a Responsibility Center is presented, and cost allocation rules for the operation of the Responsibility Center are developed. The cost allocation scheme influences users of a computer facility to adjust their demands for processing to that level most beneficial to the overall organization in question. Four conditions form the basis for the development of the cost allocation formula: (1) Charges for the use of a joint facility must cover cost; (2) a user's charges are based on the incremental cost caused by the user; (3) the charge is independent of the names assigned to users or ordering of users (if some users cause the same incremental costs, then the user's charges are the same); and (4) if the user changes his requirements and as a result his incremental costs are changed, then the cost allocation is changed appropriately. The costing procedure based on the above four conditions provides a rational way to distribute costs; it allocates greater costs to the user whose alternative costs are greater. A five step planning procedure implements this cost allocation procedure.</jats:p>",

A question of growing importance is what forms of research organization can best meet these needs. At issue are the relation between basic or theoretical and applied or task-oriented research, the links between data collection, analysis and research, the modes of interaction between research and policy-making, the balancing of immediate relevance and the long-term view, and the safeguarding of objectivity and independence in matters of vital importance to the political process.</jats:p>",

The planning model portion of the integrated system is a two‐dimensional dynamic programming resource allocation algorithm which performs project selection, budgeting and scheduling. Behavioral parameters that can be used to simulate certain organizational factors are included in the planning model. The control model portion of the integrated system develops cost‐effectiveness measures of variances between actual and planned performances for ongoing projects over time, which provide early warnings of pending project failures and guide control action. Applications of the system at Monsanto indicate that it significantly aids the development of satisfactory organizational decisions and also provides a laboratory for pretesting decisions.</jats:p>",

Stochastic inflows feeding a water supply reservoir are assumed for a hypothetical community with defined demand functions. Prices are allowed to vary as a function of reservoir level, generally rising as reservoir levels fall. Increasing, decreasing and constant rates are tested. It is concluded that varying the price to reflect the increased value of scarce supplies can greatly reduce the risk of water supply shortages. It is also concluded that varying incremental (conservational) pricing policies not only reduces the risk of shortages, but also lowers the average price to the community while rewarding the low consumption user with lower average rates.</jats:p>",

A framework, utilizing a three dimensional matrix, is developed to analyze levels of public concern, management alternatives and action agencies. Structural and non‐structural alternatives are examined and evaluated on the basis of social and economic criteria, long‐ and short‐term environmental impact and legal‐political feasibility. Data requirements which created the necessity for an interdisciplinary approach involving social, physical, and biological sciences are enumerated. The authors examine the role of universities in assisting communities with resource management planning and detail the attributes of academic institutions which desire to successfully attack resource planning problems.</jats:p>",
