Reservoir management is the keystone of any plan. This paper reviews the geology of the Statfjord Field and paper reviews the geology of the Statfjord Field and describes the latest reservoir simulation techniques being used for the evaluation of producing alternatives.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The Statfjord Field is comprised of two geologically complex reservoirs; the Brent and the Statfjord. The overall development plan calls for pressure maintenance by waterflood in the Brent and pressure maintenance by waterflood in the Brent and a combination gas and waterflood in the Statfjord. The first platform, Statfjord \"A\" is in place in the field and the second, Statfjord \"B\", is under construction. These two platforms will go in the center and southern part of the field, respectively. The development program for the northern part of the field and the optimum utilization of the associated gas have not been resolved.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The simulation approach chosen employs several three-dimensional cross section models to evaluate the impact of reservoir property variations and water and gas coning and cusping. Special performance functions are developed from the three-dimensional modeling for use in a two-dimensional field model. Prior to their use in the field model, the validity Prior to their use in the field model, the validity of the special functions is established by comparison of three-dimensional cross section results with the results from a corresponding two-dimensional model in which the functions have been used. The field model is used to examine field development alternatives.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Statfjord Field is located in the North Sea about 150 km east of the Shetlands Islands and 200 km northwest of the city of Bergen, Norway. Figure 1 shows its location in relation to other North Sea Fields. The largest part of the field lies on the Norwegian side of the United Kingdom - Norway International offshore boundary within License 037. The remainder of the field lies within United Kingdom License P104. Water depth in the field averages a relatively uniform 144 m (470 feet).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The first exploratory well in the Statfjord field, well 211/24-1, was drilled during 1973 on the southwest side of the structure. Water-bearing but good quality Brent and Statfjord formation sands were encountered. It is now known that the well was drilled just 150 meters west of the Brent Formation oil/water contact (Figure 2).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The discovery well, 33/12-1, was drilled on the crest of the structure in March, 1974. The entire Brent reservoir section, 160 meters, was found oil-bearing. The oil from test samples was undersaturated by approximately 1500 Psi at the pressure datum depth of 2469 meters. No gas cap was pressure datum depth of 2469 meters. No gas cap was found and from the well location it was concluded that none existed in the reservoir. This has since been confirmed by other wells. Sands were encountered in the deeper Statfjord Formation but these were in water at this location (Figure 3).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The confirmation well, 33/9-1, encountered the Brent Formation oil column and a well defined oil/water contact at 2584 meters subsea. Sand accumulation was found in the Statfjord Formation but, as in the discovery well, it was water-bearing.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The second major oil reservoir was discovered by the third well, 33/12-2. The well encountered 124 meters of oil accumulation in the Statfjord Formation and an abbreviated but oil-bearing Brent Formation. Lowest oil saturation in the well was 2805 meters subsea at an oil/shale contact. As in the case of the Brent Reservoir no gas cap was observed. Reservoir crude from well tests was undersaturated by over 2700 psi at the depth of 2701 meters, and it was therefore concluded that the reservoir had no gas cap.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Under supervision, graduate Teaching Assistants wrote scripts of fifteen to twenty minutes each, which were taped by native students and accompanied by slides depicting French life. Slides were generally copied from illustrations in books, through a free instructional photographic service. The programs were fully automated and were presented to students in the library and in class. Technical procedures and linguistic problems are discussed, and student reactions analyzed, with recommendations for the benefit of others wishing to engage in similar projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the office layout problem where existing offices vary considerably as to relevant criteria and yet permanent walls make it impractical to remodel existing spaces. The major objective of this study was the equitable reassignment of 144 offices to 289 faculty and staff members in 6 academic departments with the College of Administrative Science at The Ohio State University. Since the building contains 5 floors and a wide diversity of office quality, six conflicting objectives have been recognized. </jats:p><jats:p> In order to adequate address these multiple objectives, a large mixed-integer goal programming model was formulated. A companion interactive computer program was also developed to evaluate the performance of each solution with respect to these objectives. The goal programming model served to evaluate several layout strategies and identify the tradeoffs implicit in the problem. The interactive computer program helped translate these insights into a final compromise solution. </jats:p><jats:p> There are two interesting findings of the study. The first one is desirability of allowing the decision makers to be in command of the solution process. This may be particularly important when several decision makers must compete for the same resources. Another finding is that a linear programming code is sufficient for this particular formulation of a mixed-integer model. Although the model contains over 1,700 integer variables, a very few non-integer values were generated. This avoided the computational burden of a mixed-integer code. </jats:p><jats:p> The model presented here has its generic roots in the so-called “assignment problems,” with the added feature of recognizing multiple objectives. It is felt that with the proper modifications, the ideas presented here may well be extended to location-distribution and other types of assignment problems. </jats:p><jats:p> These models have been applied to the layout of the College, with the final implementation having occurred during the Summer Quarter, 1978. </jats:p>",

Sixteen of these have been in the North Sea. From this work, a simple technique has evolved to post-analyze a well in such a manner that the complex interactions of the key variables are understood. These include: weight-on-bit, rotary speed, penetration rate, hole inclination and direction, geology, bits, and bottom hole assemblies. Post-analysis can be used to assess whether the Post-analysis can be used to assess whether the trajectory changes were man induced or caused by the geology.

The normal drilling data was available from drilling recorder charts, bit and mud records, and tour sheets. However, detailed information on bottom hole assembly (BHA) configurations, dimensions and where the assemblies were run was virtually non-existant or not usable. Detailed data of weight-on-bit and rotary speed was also scarce. Forms specially designed for directional wells were drafted and sent out to the field for completion. Response was good. Within two years, detailed drilling data on more than 50 wells had been accumulated. Data was obtained from the Gulf of Mexico, Wyoming, Texas, Canada, Michigan, the North Sea, Trinidad, Iran and Holland.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>By 1974, the effort to understand the mechanism of directional drilling had not significantly progressed. Between 1972 and 1974 an approach was taken to physically observe the directional drilling operation and physically observe the directional drilling operation and learn by experience, like a directional driller. The outcome was that the observer became an excellent directional driller, but a full understanding of the total mechanism of the variable's interaction was not learned.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>One of the major difficulties in interpreting trajectory behavior was the lack of being able to accurately analyze the bottom hole assembly behavior. To alleviate this deficiency, a computer program was developed that would calculate the three-dimensional displacements and forces for any type of bottom hole assembly. To do this a finite element algorithm was used.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The first round of post-analysis using the new program was very disappointing. Results in most part program was very disappointing. Results in most part did not agree and in some cases were completely out of phase. However, it was this work that led to phase. However, it was this work that led to recognition of the importance of hole curvature on the bottom hole assembly response.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Various research projects in the past have attempted to determine the extent to which individual patterns of consumer spatial behaviour may be considered to be invariant or quasi-invariant. Most notable in this regard have been those studies adopting a format of revealed space preference. However, there are difficulties associated with the use of this approach. The present endeavour offers an alternative set of analytical procedures which, although incapable of ascertaining whether spatial behaviour is invariant or otherwise, afford the researcher the opportunity to assess the degree of statistical similarity existing among observed patterns of interaction displayed by assorted groups of consumers. In this respect the present contribution may be viewed as complementing the technique of revealed space preference. The tools employed were developed by econometricians interested in testing the stability of sets of coefficients generated by different regression equations. Evidence of stability among regression parameters connected with shopping models suggests that many of the intricate problems of spatial consumer behaviour may possibly be simplified to more manageable proportions. An empirical investigation of the utility of these econometric methodologies was made in an examination of the significance of a number of selected factors on the spatial allocation of grocery expenditures by four ethnically diverse groups of consumers in Kingston, Jamaica. The substantive results concerning the determinants of ethnic budget behaviour are discussed, together with the processes involved in reducing the initial complexity of the shopping problem under scrutiny. </jats:p>",

We have applied operations research techniques to segments of the blood service complex. This paper is an overview of the general results of this research. From analysis of the data in each segment, a mathematical response function is developed for such managerial processes as demand forecasting, requirements computation, crossmatch and recycle control at each level of the hierarchy in a regional system. These processes in independent hospital blood banks are contrasted with those in hospital blood banks and transfusion services which are dependent on central blood banks for their supply. An example is presented of a model which is useful in the planning of a regional system. Implementation of these hierarchical models in hospital blood banks can reduce outdating, size of inventories and shortage. In central blood banks, these models can minimize shipment quantities, determine optimal transshipments and the most efficient routing.</jats:p>",

The result is an empirical demonstration that the level of fixed costs in the United States is so low that market areas too large to be approximated by the optimal hexagonal market-area shape are not likely to be associated with competition in free-enterprise countries. It is in fact indicated that competitive firms sell over comparatively small market areas.
