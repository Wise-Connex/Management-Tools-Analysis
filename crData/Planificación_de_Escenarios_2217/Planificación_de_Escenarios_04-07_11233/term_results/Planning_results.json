Drawing on the history of the feminist movement, experiences in the classroom, a scan of recent planning papers and publications, including some on planning curricula and women’s prospects within the profession in Canada and the USA, questions are raised about the reasons for this apparent decline. The authors ask if postmodernism is undermining the feminist and anti-racism movements by combining complex and intersecting identities into an amorphous notion of diversity, rather than explicating the differential relations of power embodied in these differences. </jats:p>",

We address this troubling question by interrogating the concept of civil society, with due respect to the actual role played by civil society in the development of capitalism. Based on close readings of Hegel, Marx and planning theory dealing with it, we also argue that the discourse of civil society now serves neoliberalism quite well, but provides dubious support for ‘radical’ or ‘insurgent’ planning. As an ideal for the latter, we propose instead the radical democratization of both the economy and the state. </jats:p>",

We suggest that a conceptual framework that draws upon the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy can be harnessed to assist the systematic analysis of programmes in a way that links this vertical, disease specific strategy to horizontal health system factors so that comparisons can be made. This multi‐disciplinary, multi‐method approach to the evaluation builds upon the work of others including Pawson and Tilley and their ‘programmes theories’. This work has informed the application of an evaluation toolkit which has been successfully applied in a number of settings and assisted in the sustainable implementation of a DOTS strategy in Russia.

Municipal administrators perceive that there is little they can do as far the quantity and quality of services are concerned. This case study was to analyse the utilization of hospital care within a coalition of two municipalities (Paimio and Sauvo) for one year. By using the Diagnosis Related Groups and Main Diagnostic Categorizations and by comparing the data with the existing physician visits, health care decisions may be made regarding the general morbidity and the use of medical services. While the databases number among the most extensive in the world, the existing information has not been fully utilized for planning, implementation and evaluation of services within the municipalities.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>There is increasing awareness that supply subsidies for health and education services often fail to benefit those that are most vulnerable in a community. This recognition has led to a growing interest in and experimentation with, consumer‐led demand side financing systems (CL‐DSF). These mechanisms place purchasing power in the hands of consumers to spend on specific services at accredited facilities.</jats:p><jats:p>International evidence in education and health sectors suggest a limited success of CL‐DSF in raising the consumption of key services amongst priority groups. There is also some evidence that vouchers can be used to improve targeting of vulnerable groups. There is very little positive evidence on the effect of CL‐DSF on service quality as a consequence of greater competition. Location of services relative to population means that areas with more provider choice, particularly in the private sector, tend to be dominated by higher and middle‐income households.</jats:p><jats:p>Extending CL‐DSF in low‐income countries requires the development of capacity in administering these financing schemes and also accrediting providers. Schemes could focus primarily on fixed packages of key services aimed at easily identifiable groups. Piloting and robust evaluation is required to fill the evidence gap on the impact of these mechanisms. Extending demand financing to less predictable services, such as hospital coverage for the population, is likely to require the development of a voucher scheme to purchase insurance. This suggests an already developed insurance market and is unlikely to be appropriate in most low‐income countries for some time. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

We start by identifying the essential service components needed in order to deliver quality care. Secondly, we identify the main partners in a collaboration or partnership. We describe a generic model linking the partners and the components. This model is then used to describe and analyse successful partnerships currently in existence, identifying those features that produced a successful outcome regarding increased access, coverage and quality for TB control. Finally, we illustrate how the process and generic model has been used to develop a locally appropriate model for partnerships in TB control, taking Bangladesh as our example.

It is suggested that the allowances should be created at the level of the central state and be distributed to the federal states, regions and municipalities. In this way the allowance system can benefit from the advantages of the well-established planning concepts at the regional and municipal level. The allocation effects of the tradable allowance system depend on the type of primary allocation, the economic strength of the trading municipalities, the use of auction proceeds and the development of regionally and functionally separated markets. It is recommended that the tradable allowance system should be integrated into an instrumental mix with an ecologically enhanced financial equalisation mechanism at the municipal level and an ecologically reformed real-estate tax.</jats:p>"

In the transition to a market economy, legislation has been developed to offset the weakening in the central planning mechanism and political control that have historically influenced the behaviour of institutions and individuals in the Ministry of Health. There has been relatively little empirical examination of the implementation and impact of legislation as a tool for influencing health service provision in low‐income countries. The study aimed to contribute towards filling this gap by exploring the factors affecting the implementation and impact of the Maternal and Infant Health Care Law, through a case study of two poor, rural counties in Chongqing municipality, China. The study found that key local actors perceive health legislation to be an important tool for safeguarding access to essential health care. However, the implementation of health legislation is inevitably a political process. The study illustrates the difficulties involved in efforts to influence provider behaviour through a national level legislative framework in a situation of decentralization of control over those providers, due to extreme regional variation in economic situations and limited resource inputs from the centre. Lessons are drawn for Chinese and international policy makers. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Disaster management and planning needs to be placed in a holistic setting, and new initiatives found in order to ensure that a disaster is viewed as a shared responsibility. One area that needs further attention is the concept of community policing and what community policing incorporates. Often, a disaster is on such a scale that local community leaders need to be consulted during the disaster limitation and containment stage. It is essential, therefore, that experts from overseas countries brought into the disaster arena, are able to communicate fully and openly with community leaders in order to gain the support of the community.</jats:p>",

However, if one considers the logic of innovation and consensus, it becomes clear that both do not necessarily harmonise (chapter 3). The presented approaches for the separation as well as for the alignment of innovation and the finding of consensus structure the field of possible solutions in order to resolve the contradictions (chapter 4).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Differing from the requirements implied in the term “autonomous regional development”, regional governance is almost always dependent on public support. This raises the question of the appropriate “state-run guidance” for these regional governance structures. The article outlines the particularly efficient governance mode of “network-based co-operative negotiations in the shadow of hierarchy” as well as some typical forms of action and problems of state and regional planning in the support of regional governance. Taking the concepts for cities and their surrounding areas in Schleswig-Holstein as examples, it is shown that the careful construction of a “shadow of hierarchy” is a central precondition for successful regional co-operation. It is exactly the combination of public policy- and development policy aspects that makes this type of regional governance attractive and qualifies state and regional planning as its mentor.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined the status of planning within the various types of higher education institutions in Portugal. Higher education in Portugal is a binary system with university and non- university sectors. The university sector integrates public and private universities and the Catholic university. The nonuniversity sector integrates public polytechnic institutes and other establishments, the latter being private institutions. A survey methodology was used to measure perceptions from rectors and presidents within the entire system. Results suggest that institutional planning in Portuguese higher education is in its beginning phases, but there is a desire to expand that participation. While public institutions appear to be most active in attempting to establish such a process, many are doing less than strategic planning. The authors report details of the findings and make recommendations for advancing strategic planning within the system of Portuguese higher education.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing level of labor mobility in China challenges the current population-management structure. In particular, recent reforms in urban housing provision seem largely to overlook the needs of the migrant population. In this paper I examine the sources of migrant housing disadvantage in cities. Specifically, I analyze the institutional and socioeconomic factors underlying migrant housing choice and conditions, and how these factors influence migrants differently from the locals. Data are drawn primarily from citywide housing surveys and interviews conducted in Shanghai and Beijing. The findings show that migrants make housing decisions based on whether they intend to settle in the cities, and market-related factors such as income and education have a significant, positive impact on migrant housing conditions. But more importantly, the general disadvantage experienced by migrants has much of its root in the institutional restrictions associated with the hukou system that outweigh the combined effects of socioeconomic factors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By offering a response to recent calls for a ‘geography of gentrification’, the author attempts to move on from the intractable theoretical divisions and overgeneralizations that continue to pervade the gentrification literature. The research described in this paper takes the form of a comparative assessment of the gentrifying neighbourhoods of South Parkdale, Toronto, Canada, and Lower Park Slope, New York City, USA. A central part of this research has been an engagement with two contrasting academic discourses on gentrification, the ‘emancipatory city’ (a Canadian construct) and the ‘revanchist city’ (a US construct), to examine how gentrification may or may not have changed since these discourses were produced and articulated. The author combines narratives from in-depth interviews (with a particular focus on displaced tenants) with supplementary data from secondary sources and demonstrates that gentrification is neither emancipatory nor revanchist in either case. This has important implications for how gentrification is understood and evaluated in Canada and the USA. Although one can see crucial broad similarities both in the causes and in the effects of gentrification in each neighbourhood (which would appear to endorse casual references to ‘North American gentrification’), the process is also differentiated according to contextual factors, and the nuances of the gentrification process are illuminated and clarified by international comparison. In sum, the author points to the need to exercise caution in referring to ‘North American gentrification’, especially as a geography of gentrification is only in its infancy. </jats:p>",

Twenty-one students taking an upper-level undergraduate course in greenhouse management were randomly split into two groups. Each group experienced both methodologies with presentations designed to provide complimentary information about site planning for protected environment structures; however, the order in which the groups received the methods was reversed. After each presentation, the participants were given an identical quiz (Time 1 and Time 2) comprised of questions that assessed knowledge gained, higher-order learning, and their perception of how confident they would be in solving actual site planning scenarios. Though quiz scores were not different between the two groups after Time 1 or 2, overall quiz scores improved after Time 2 for both groups combined (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.03). When questions were categorized as lower-order vs. higher-order learning, a greater increase in scores was observed in higher-order learning (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.12 vs. <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.04, respectively). Although students' perceived confidence was not influenced by which method was received first (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.23), their confidence increased after Time 2 compared to Time 1 (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = 0.07). Rather than one teaching method being superior to the other, this study suggests that it is beneficial to use both. Interestingly, while students overwhelmingly preferred to receive the summary lecture before the web-based method, there was no significant difference in test scores between the two orders, suggesting that neither order offered any advantage.</jats:p>",

Patients 65 years and older who were hospitalized in 1 of 2 intensive care units at 2 midwestern university-affiliated medical centers were recruited for the study. Control patients (n = 53) received usual discharge planning; experimental patients (n = 47) were screened in the intensive care unit by using the Discharge Planning Questionnaire. Both groups were assessed for readiness for discharge when discharged from the hospital and were followed up 2 weeks later with a survey completed at home.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>• Results One hundred patients 65 to 90 years old (mean 73, SD 5.78) completed the study. Sixty-six percent were men. The 2 groups did not differ with regard to age, race, sex, severity of illness, lengths of stay in the intensive care unit or hospital, education level, or income. Patients in the experimental group were more ready than patients in the control group for discharge (P = .06). Patients in the experimental group were also more likely to report they had adequate information, had less concern about managing their care at home, knew their medicines, and knew danger signals indicating potential complications.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>• Conclusion Intensive care unit–based early discharge planning can affect elderly patients’ preparation for discharge.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper looks at the linkages between gentrification and the displacement of small-scale manufacturing and blue-collar work in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. Although the link between global economic change and gentrification has been made for the upper classes who are the consumers of the gentrified landscape, very little work has been done on the blue-collar work and workers that remain in the central city despite the assumption by policymakers that deindustrialization is complete. I argue that manufacturing is still a viable sector of the urban economy that is increasingly at risk of displacement because of the conversion of industrial space to residential use and speculative real-estate pressure. In this way, gentrification is encouraging industrial displacement, which in turn is leading to the degradation of the blue-collar work that remains and to the increasing informalization of work. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies production planning with random yield and demand. It is a departure from previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior can be observed in various industries (e.g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. Production of olive oil is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its olives for olive oil production and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total production of olive oil changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies. </jats:p>",

We show that while comprehensive reserve network design is best when the entire network can be implemented immediately, when conservation investments must be staged over years, such solutions actually may be sub‐optimal in the context of biodiversity loss and uncertainty. Simple decision rules, such as protecting the available site with the highest irreplaceability or with the highest species richness, may be more effective when implementation occurs over many years.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An understanding of metropolitan spatial structure in property-value distribution is essential for international real-estate decisionmaking, yet knowledge accumulated in this area is limited because of data and methodology constraints. The author extends knowledge of the area by examining the spatial distribution pattern of housing prices (instead of the much-studied population and employment distributions) and two Pacific-Asia metropolises (rather than US cities or other cities in developed countries). Data were collected in Beijing, China, and Jakarta, Indonesia, from field reconnaissance surveys and interviews in 2000 and 2001. Digital terrain models were constructed for visualizing the property-value distributions. Profiles of the three-dimensional surfaces were extracted and curve-estimation statistics were used in a series of systematically selected geographical sectors in order to assess the intrametropolitan spatial variations. The findings suggest that neither of the two cities resembles a smooth surface featuring a cone, or the roof of a circus tent. Rather, Beijing's residential property value surface looks like a castellated rooftop, whereas Jakarta's resembles two television towers. The dynamic price terrains in the two cities are shaped by many factors, including their physical settings, history, and institutional frameworks. Intrametropolitan variations in property prices were remarkable in both cities. Properties in each of the systematically defined geographical sectors and in the history-development core show unique profiles and curvefitting statistics different from any other. The findings add to the existing generalizations and modeling exercises in the study of the internal structure of cities. </jats:p>",

Using evidence from field surveys and a mortgage-lending database, they measure the class selectivity of gentrification and its relation to processes of racial and ethnic discrimination. They find a strong resurgence of capital investment in the urban core, along with magnified class segregation. The boom of the 1990s and policies targeted towards ‘new markets' narrowed certain types of racial and ethnic disparities in urban credit markets, but there is evidence of intensified discrimination and exclusion in gentrified neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

The size of the electron boost field was defined by measuring the postoperative cavity. Reproducibility of the sonographic findings was investigated in 25 of the patients who were examined before and after radiotherapy (at a total dose of 46–50.4 Gy). Depth (distance from the skin surface to the posterior aspect of the postoperative cavity) was measured, and sonographic appearance of the postoperative cavity was evaluated. Type of surgical procedure, time elapsed since surgery, use of systemic therapy, menopausal status, breast size, and radiation dose were investigated for their influence on sonographic appearance and visualization of the postoperative cavity.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>The postoperative cavity was well visualized in 78% of patients and visualized with some difficulty in 22%. In all but 5 patients, it was hypoechoic and inhomogeneous. The mean depth of the postoperative cavity after radiotherapy was 27 ± 4 mm. Smaller breast (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) and younger age (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05) were associated with decreased visibility of the postoperative cavity. Sonographic appearance was the same before and after radiotherapy, but the mean difference in postoperative cavity depth between the 2 measurements was 2 mm (range, 0–4 mm).

They focus on a discourse oppositional to gentrification that has effectively mobilized space and historicity to speak its truths. The results reveal that diverse mental spaces were constructed and used in discourse to offer two critical constructions: positive resident identities, and developers as villains. Such spaces, grounding medium in the discourse, framed, organized, and illuminated these constructions. This visual rhetoric, Henri Lefebvre's representation of spaces, was a key ingredient in discourse. With actual and threatened opposition to gentrification, many developers formed a sense of a ‘ready-to-rumble neighborhood’. Fears of virulent street tactics (that is, harassment of gentrifiers) most discouraged developers because they could make development projects risky. </jats:p>",

The often complex anatomy in respect to the teeth themselves as well as their surrounding structures may render those tasks difficult. New tomographic techniques hold promises for improvements in all those areas, in particular techniques that can display the object in all its three dimensions and remove disturbing anatomical structures to make it possible to evaluate each root and its closest surroundings in detail. They also provide images, taken at different points in time, that are similar in geometry and contrast making it possible to evaluate differences occurring in the fourth dimension – time. Image‐processing techniques applied to digital images obtained with conventional periapical radiography can be of some help towards improved diagnosis provided that optimal irradiation geometry has been used during image acquisition. When conventional radiographs are used and conventional means employed for their evaluation, one should take radiographs from more than one direction to ensure that at least some three‐dimensional information will be obtained. When evaluating images over time they must be compared side by side to provide best possibilities of subjectively detecting changes occurring over time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We analyze planning and scheduling of multiproduct batch operations in the food-processing industry. Such operations are encountered in many applications including manufacturing of sorbitol, modified starches, and specialty sugars. Unlike discrete manufacturing, batch sizes in these operations cannot be set arbitrarily, but are often determined by equipment size. Multiple batches of the same product are often run sequentially in “campaigns” to minimize setup and quality costs. </jats:p><jats:p> We consider a multiproduct, single-stage, single-equipment batch-processing scheme and address the problem of determining the timing and duration of product campaigns to minimize average setup, quality, and inventory holding costs over a horizon. We formulate the deterministic, static version of this problem over an infinite horizon. We show that, in general, a feasible, finite, cyclic solution may not exist. We provide sufficient conditions for the existence of a finite cycle, use single-product problems to provide lower bounds on the costs for the multiproduct problem, and use them to test heuristics developed for this problem. Next, we modify this formulation to incorporate fixed cycles that may be necessary due to factors such as product obsolescence, perishability, or contracts with customers. We do this by allowing for disposal of excess stock so that finite cycles are always feasible, though they might not be optimal; we also develop bounds and heuristic solution procedures for this case. These methods are applied to data from a leading food-processing company. Our results suggest that our methods could potentially reduce total annual costs by about 7.7% translating to an annual savings of around $7 million. </jats:p>",

A concerted focus on the future is usually involved in the effort. In North Carolina, all Extension Agriculture and Natural Resource Agents, Specialists, Directors and State Staff recently utilized such a structured process in a 3-day conference entitled “The Summit”. The success of this strategic planning process can be measured by the degree to which the process lead to strategic management within NCCE. The Summit used a framework that fully explored forces affecting or impeding strategic thinking. That framework was a day of laying groundwork and with various keynote speakers helping to set the stage; a day of stakeholder direction and attendee active listening and debate; and a day of group reflection. The results of this conference were chronicled in “White Paper” written by a team representing all major in-house stakeholders. While many of the usual problems affecting Extension were reviewed, stakeholder input to both administration and staff is re-shaping the way NCCE uses resources and directs programs. Ten recommendations came out Action te Such an outcome is strategic management, and the framework of The Summit may allow other similar organizations to also have successful strategic planning meetings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we examine a new form of neighborhood change that appeared towards the end of the 1990s and early 2000s and explore its causes, processes, and effects. We suggest that a neoliberal policy regime focused on revitalizing cities through deconcentrating poverty and increasing low-income and moderate-income home-ownership has created a new funding and decision environment for the redevelopment of select inner-urban neighborhoods. The results have been an emerging process of neighborhood reinvestment marked by land-use and social transformations driven not by rent-seeking private developers but primarily by local political actors and community development organizations struggling in resource-poor environments. This neighborhood change process promotes benefits for those with a vested interest in neighborhood and urban revitalization and for a small group of moderate-income, minority homebuyers. The effect of these revitalization efforts on very-low-income residents who have lived in these neighborhoods through a period of severe disinvestment is uncertain. Despite the rhetoric of neighborhood revitalization, the reality of this reinvestment looks more like a new process of gentrification than a process of community-controlled redevelopment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the past, the dual nature of orthodontics has presented practitioners with unique artistic challenges and scientific opportunities. As a result, orthodontists today are enjoying the ‘Platinum Age of Productivity.’ However, a disturbing trend that promotes neither art nor science has emerged. Health care reform in the United States has transformed health care from a service to a commodity. Some orthodontists and orthodontic practice management companies have capitalized on this change in thinking and are aggressively promoting orthodontic treatment as a product. This paper examines the impact of this paradigm shift on the future of orthodontics. Particular attention is paid to the interaction of three themes: first, orthodontics as a product, secondly, the current misconception that there is a shortage of orthodontic practitioners in the United States, and thirdly, the difficulty in defining ‘excellence’ in specialty training in orthodontics. In the near future, the collision of these three concepts will result in an orthodontic ‘Perfect Storm’. The ability of our specialty to survive and thrive will be proportional to our professional behavior during these difficult times…<jats:italic>caveat emptor</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

By way of an example, the authors take as the basis for their study a status quo analysis of local-authority policy on commercial sites and land-use designation in the Märkischer Kreis. In their findings they are able to identify considerable inefficiencies in both the designation and the utilisation of sites. These findings can be seen as largely representative of other regions exhibiting similar structures. On this argumentational basis, the authors develop an instrument based upon a jointly-managed land pool; here sites are „booked in”, earmarked for planning purposes, and serviced for subsequent development. This pool also includes brown fields. The aim is to minimise the amount of open space being redesignated for commercial use, and to enable access to the most suitable locations at an intermunicipal level, which can then be put to efficient utilisation.</jats:p>"

The statistical results suggest that the problems of rational planning are largely technical (lack of resources and expertise) rather than political. Potential explanations for these results are identified, and the implications for theories of rational planning are considered. </jats:p>",

For others less certain about ontology, networks are vital ingredients in firm-specific competitive strategies and long-term growth prospects. In this paper we approach the issue with reference to firm-specific competitive strategies, reporting the results of a large-scale pan-European survey of small and medium-sized enterprises' (SMEs) network-related responses to changing market conditions. Distinguishing between different types of production network (supply and distribution) operating at various geographical scales (regional, national, EU, and global), it is shown that the scope and scale of firm networks are strategic issues. All things being equal, firms adopt advanced technologies in response to changing market conditions, enabling their networks to change in scope and geographical scale. We also show that the significance of local as opposed to national and EU networks is changing with less ‘localism’ and wider geographical scope becoming increasingly important. Using probit models for different types of networks, we identify and distinguish between predictive variables driving network formation, including the type of SME ownership. Implications are drawn for the theoretical status of networks in industrial organisation and their significance for European economic development. </jats:p>",

It describes how residents and activists utilized the Roxbury Master Plan as a tool to raise challenges to planning ideas perceived as detrimental to the neighborhood. Discussion of this master plan provides a laboratory for examining race and class relationships and tensions generated by proposals for economic development strategies based on benefiting powerful institutional players as a way of helping low-income neighborhoods. Review of the development of this neighborhood master plan between the period 1999 and 2003 shows how residents can use community participation to ensure adoption of broad economic development strategies advocated by proponents of big business that do not spell dislocation and gentrification for poor and working-class neighborhoods. The case study also represents a critique of smart growth and New Urbanism as planning concepts in terms of how issues of race, class, and social inequality are approached or ignored by some planners. The study is based on the author’s involvement in the development of the Roxbury Master Plan, including participation in meetings and interviews with residents, elected officials, and representatives of city government between 1999 when the Roxbury Master Plan was officially launched and its completion in 2003. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Permanency planning is a critical issue facing all children in foster care. Foster children frequently suffer from developmental delays and severe behavior problems, often leading to repeated displacements that in turn increase the risk for attachment disorders. To prevent the emergence of such disturbances, an Attachment Clinic was developed in Montreal to offer consultation to Youth Protection workers. A specific problem has frequently been identified in this Clinic: Should a child who has developed a significant attachment to his or her foster parents return to the biological parents or stay in the foster family? The choice between the two families is even more difficult when the parenting competencies of the biological parents seem to have progressed while the child has developed secure attachments in the foster family. Clinical cases will be presented to illustrate such dilemmas. Concepts rooted in attachment theory have been very useful to understand such problems, and have led us to believe that children's best interests lie in the preservation of their attachment ties and that repeated ruptures of such ties constitute a severe trauma. Resistances of the milieu to our position will be discussed as well as the Court's decisions in light of Canadian jurisprudence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Because current methods of imaging prostate cancer are inadequate, biopsies cannot be effectively guided and treatment cannot be effectively planned and targeted. Therefore, our research is aimed at ultrasonically characterizing cancerous prostate tissue so that we can image it more effectively and thereby provide improved means of detecting, treating and monitoring prostate cancer. We base our characterization methods on spectrum analysis of radiofrequency (rf) echo signals combined with clinical variables such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Tissue typing using these parameters is performed by artificial neural networks. We employed and evaluated different approaches to data partitioning into training, validation, and test sets and different neural network configuration options. In this manner, we sought to determine what neural network configuration is optimal for these data and also to assess possible bias that might exist due to correlations among different data entries among the data for a given patient. The classification efficacy of each neural network configuration and data-partitioning method was measured using relative-operating-characteristic (ROC) methods. Neural network classification based on spectral parameters combined with clinical data generally produced ROC-curve areas of 0.80 compared to curve areas of 0.64 for conventional transrectal ultrasound imaging combined with clinical data. We then used the optimal neural network configuration to generate lookup tables that translate local spectral parameter values and global clinical-variable values into pixel values in tissue-type images (TTIs). TTIs continue to show cancerous regions successfully, and may prove to be particularly useful clinically in combination with other ultrasonic and nonultrasonic methods, e.g., magnetic-resonance spectroscopy. </jats:p>",

Because Hispanics are projected to make up one‐half of the state's adolescents by 2020, it is important to determine how cultural and health policy‐relevant factors are linked to this group's use of family planning services.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>METHODS:</jats:bold> Data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey were used to examine characteristics of Hispanic and white females aged 14–17, including patterns of use of family planning services in the past year. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the association between selected characteristics and use of family planning services.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> Compared with white adolescents, Hispanic adolescents came from poorer families, had a poorer health status, less commonly had a regular source of primary health care and had lower rates of alcohol and drug use, and of sexual experience. Although the proportion of sexually experienced Hispanics who had used family planning services was similar to that of whites (34% and 27%, respectively), the proportion who had ever been pregnant and used such services was significantly larger (42% vs. 9%). In the multivariate analysis, Hispanic adolescents who had ever been pregnant were significantly more likely than whites who had not to have used family planning services in the past year (odds ratio, 11.6).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSIONS:</jats:bold> A need exists for family planning programs to target Hispanic adolescents before they become pregnant, and to send a clear message that contraceptive services are available and should be used before a woman ever has a pregnancy.</jats:p>",

Die Problemstellung ist durch eine divergierende Produktionsstruktur (Mehrstufigkeit), signifikante Rüstzeiten und alternative Maschinenfolgen gekennzeichnet. Gegenstand der Betrachtung sind die beiden letzten Produktionsstufen, d. h. die Montage und die Endmessung. Die Montage ist als Fließfertigung und die Endmessung als Werkstattfertigung organisiert. Besonderheiten der Planung ergeben sich aus festzulegenden Einsatzzeiten der Maschinen und kapazitätsreduzierenden Anlaufzeiten nach einem Maschinenstillstand. Die Problemstellung wird als mehrperiodiges Knapsack-Problem formalisiert. Zur heuristischen Lösung wird ein genetischer Algorithmus vorgeschlagen, der für den praktischen Einsatz in eine menügesteuerte Umgebung eingebunden ist. Durch den Einsatz des in Java implementierten Programms reduziert sich die Planungszeit von mehreren Tagen auf wenige Minuten, wobei die generierten Pläne eine hohe Akzeptanz bei den Planern fanden.\n   </jats:p>",
