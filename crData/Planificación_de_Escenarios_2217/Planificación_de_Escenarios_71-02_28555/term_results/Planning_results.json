Planning is a complex procedure, the problems of which are compounded by a changing environment. All planning decisions should be based on research but again deficiencies are obvious in actual practice. Planning involves four phases: setting objectives, developing plans, integrating these plans into the decision process and adjusting the plans to environmental changes. A fundamental problem in university planning is the selection of the best organizational structure to expedite this activity. Such a model would make provision for a five stage process: localized planning, planning by committee, planning by an outside agency, institutional research and the establishment of a specific planning department.</jats:p>",

A predictive model is developed to evaluate expected market response due to an advertising media schedule considering the anticipated schedules of competitors as well as other major advertising phenomena. Heuristic search routines are used to select and schedule media with the objective of maximizing market response subject to budget limitations. The procedure has been applied on real problems. </jats:p><jats:p> The market response model first divides people into market segments which are characterized by product class sales potential. Ads placed by the competing firms cause people in segments to be exposed to this advertising and thereby create a level of exposure value which decays over time in the absence of new exposures. The individual's response during a time period is a function of his retained exposure value for each competing firm and his market segment. Summing over individuals and over time to obtain total market response is approximated analytically using media coverage and overlap data that is relatively easy to gather and store. </jats:p>",

But a new insistence for increased public participation, particularly at the Federal level, has stimulated re‐examination of objectives and methods for relating water planning to citizen interests and preferences. Involved is partly a recommitment to democratic symbols, partly a recognition that segments of society have been overlooked, and partly a reaction to the pressures of confrontation and demonstration. The rhetoric and polemics of participation have often implied a kind of “town‐meeting” process of decision, difficult at best in a nation of 200 million. In water planning more emphasis has been placed on listening to citizens, which has meant providing opportunities for influentials to express their views and preferences. A more adequate approach would seem to require identification of all who are significantly affected by plans and proposals (even though they may not perceive then‐interest). But gaining greater participation does not make the planning job easier. It may increase tension and conflict; it may require difficult choices; and it can alter existing power relationships and generate changes with considerable consequences for the agency and its programs.</jats:p>",
