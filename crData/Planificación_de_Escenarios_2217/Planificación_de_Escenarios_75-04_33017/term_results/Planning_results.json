On the one hand theory must generalize and capture enough of reality to explain it. It must be simple enough to be useful yet complex enough to be relevant. But a case history deals only with specific facts. It need not reflect practices which are right for any other company. Consequently it invariably questions theory since no formula can capture all the variations of a particular case.</jats:p>",

Just as we can learn from Japanese management, we can also learn from Japanese corporate planning. Our research reveals that formal planning was started in Japan before most American or European managers embraced the concept, that the best Japanese practices represent the forefront of the state of the art, and that the current emphasis in Japanese planning is highly entrepreneurial and strategic. As of the mid‐1970s, corporate planning in Japan is very popular, well integrated into the Japanese managerial system, and highly geared to diversification strategies at home and resource‐ and market‐based strategies internationally (see Appendix A). The so‐called Japanese challenge may have abated in traditional form. A study of current corporate planning practices, however, suggests that Western managers would make a mistake in discounting the challenge altogether.</jats:p>",

But there are hints that the traditional approaches to decision‐making are being modified, and that subliminally generated material is not only helpful, but can be a creative and successful way of approaching the multi‐faceted complexity of contemporary planning. In 1964 and 1966, for example, <jats:italic>Dun's Review</jats:italic> printed articles that dealt sympathetically, even admiringly, with business planners who relied upon intuition or other mysterious forms of foreknowledge to make decisions.

They concluded that “hunches may be almost as important as data. Have subjectivism and the counter‐culture philosophy of anti‐rationalism caught up with American business institutions? Does this presage a revolution in executive decision‐making? Most importantly: are there alternative ways of making decisions utilizing obscure but powerful creative abilities within the unconscious mind?</jats:p>",

This model is then used to characterise the vertices and edges of a network and to analyse real deviations. It is shown that the equilibrium characteristics are independent of the nature of the flow parameters, and are determined solely by the overall structure of the network. Three examples relating to West German railway systems are given as an illustration of the ease with which the networks can be topologically characterised. An extension of the analysis to take account of transport flow beyond boundaries of a region is suggested, which, however, involves appreciable computation work. The model provides a means of carrying out dynamic transport flow analyses relevant to planning, and is an extension of conventional analyses based on Markov chains. </jats:p>",

The Office was responsible for R and D budgets which had tripled to a half billion dollars annually by the time of the creation of the Energy Research and Development Administration (ERDA) in January, 1975. This paper describes that evolution.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Events since the Arab oil embargo have heightened the Nation's awareness of its tenuous control over the security of the energy supplies which are so vital to its economy and way of life. The underlying trends, however, had been developing over a period of years, as a result of administrative, legislative, and regulatory decisions on a variety of matters and of depletion of traditional domestic resources. It is the national recognition of the importance of the factors which has changed.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The post-embargo Project Independence Report, taking into account the new energy economics, still projects massive increases in demand, even with heavy conservation measures and a major shift to electricity. Demands on the liquid and gas sectors in all scenarios, combined with the expected marked decline in production from traditional oil and gas sources, suggest that heavy reliance must be placed on synthetics from coal and shale if dependence on imported hydrocarbons is to be kept at a level which does not imperil our economic security. Preembargo analyses reached similar, though Preembargo analyses reached similar, though perhaps less drastic, conclusions. perhaps less drastic, conclusions. Thus, synthetics from coal and oil shale will be extremely important towards the end of the century. It is clear that technologies not now commercially available must be developed if the Nation is to meet the challenge of providing secure supplies of clean fuels at costs which will not excessively impede economic growth. These fuels must be available in forms required by the consuming sectors, and must be developed and used in a manner consistent with a high quality of life and the environment. Such contributions will not be available without significant research now.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This notion has by now become a national consensus — even the conventional wisdom. It was not always thus. Many pre-embargo analyses, notably that of a cabinet-level task force on oil imports, reached more optimistic appraisals of the Nation's energy future. Absent a consensus, fossil energy research continued at a low level long after conversion technologies had become of more than academic interest.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

TATE is not a residual conceptualisation, being that part of the environment which, through direct instrumental interaction exerts defining power on farm goals and farm roles. That is, the interdependencies existing between TATE and farm operations are asymmemcal. Once TATE is assumed as a meaningful unit of analysis, some major problem‐areas are perceived; viz.:</jats:p><jats:p>‐ a functioning of TATE according to an increasingly deterministic model of action;</jats:p><jats:p>‐ an increasing share of irrationality in the intra‐farm processes and choices, which has collective and external origines;</jats:p><jats:p>‐ a growing rigidity of the complex “internal vs. external interactions” of the farm operation.</jats:p><jats:p>The tentative conclusion seems to be justified that TATE forms a “quasi‐organisation” based on a peculiar allocation of responsibility and costs over the different structural positions.</jats:p><jats:p>In the second part of the article the author wonders how the processes presently going on whitin S while still upholding an atomistic world‐view can compare with the classical feudal model of social organisation. With respect to this model he detects three essential differences in the bondages linking superordinate to subordinate positions. These differences seem to make rather for a form of “shifting feudalism” among institutions with the farm institution in the role of the coolie. The feudal model does, however, not seem to meet the requirements for coping with the problems of turbulent environments.</jats:p><jats:p>The last part of the article touches upon the possibility of democratic planning as a way to both cope with the former requirements and to realize a negotiated solidarity.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Ein landwirtschaftlicher Betrieb und seine Umwelt kann als ein System S. angesehen werden. TATE ist der Teil der Umwelt der durch direkte instrumentale Interaktion bestimmte macht auf Ziele und Rollen im Bauernhof ausübt und ist somit keine residuale Kategorie. Das heißt, die Interdependenzen zwischen TATE und dem Betrieb sind asymmetrisch. Wenn man TATE als eine sinnvolle Analyse‐Einheit annimmt, kann man einige hauptsächliche Problem‐felder unterscheiden:</jats:p><jats:p>‐ TATE funktioniert entsprechend einem zunehmend deterministischen Aktionsmodell;</jats:p><jats:p>‐ ein zunehmender Anteil von Irrationalität bei inner betrieblichen Prozessen und Entscheidungen, aufgrund kollektiver und extetner Ursprünge;</jats:p><jats:p>‐ eine zunehmcnde Starrheit in dem Komplex “interne gegenüber externe Interaktionen” der Hofbewirtschaftung;</jats:p><jats:p>Der vorläufige Schluss scheint gerechtfertigt, dass TATE eine “Quasi‐Organisation” bildet, die auf einer spezifischen Verteilung von Verantwortung und Kosten auf die verschiedenen strukturrllen Positionen basiert.</jats:p><jats:p>Im zweiten Teil des Artikels beschäftigt sich der Autor mit der Frage, wie sich die Prozesse, die gegenwärtig innerhalb von S stattfinden, wobei immer noch ein atomistisches Weltbild aufrechterhalten wird, vergleichen lassen mit dem klassischen feudalen Modell der sozialen Organisation. Im Hinblick auf dieses Modell entdeckt er drei wesentliche Unterschiede in den Bindungen zwischen untergeordneten und übergeordneten Positionen. Diese Untenchiede ergeben eher eine Form des sich verändernden Feudalismus bei Institutionen, wobei die Institution Hof in der Rolle des Kuli zu sehen ist. Das feudale Modell scheint jedoch den Problemen der Turbulenz der Umwelt nicht angernessen zu sein.</jats:p><jats:p>Der letzte Teil des Artikels beschäftigt sich mit der Möglichkeit demokratischer Planung als ein Weg, sowohl mit dem oben genannten Turbulenz fertigzuwerden, als auch die in Verhandlungen erreichte Solidarität zu verwirklichen.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

There are single-region and multiregion versions of those rates. In order to measure multiregional life-table rates, life-table accounts are developed together with an accounts based model that estimates the full accounts matrix from available data. These multiregional rates are then used to construct multiregional life tables akin to those recently proposed by Rogers. It is shown that the calculations involved in measuring the survivorship probabilities of the life table can be succinctly summarized in Stone's fundamental matrix. The detailed connections between life-table accounts and age-group accounts are explored, and the possibility of age-group life tables raised. The conclusion is reached that the age-group accounts are the appropriate ones for generating rates for use in population projection models, and that the life-table accounts are the appropriate ones for generating rates for use in actuarial calculations. </jats:p>",

Earlier planning by the FWPCA and the Delaware River Basin Commission was better; but this planning appears to have been halted and perhaps superseded by the provisions of PL 92–500. The Tocks Island reservoir planned to maintain minimum flows may never be built on account of environmental objections; but the consequences of such a decision are not being faced. Meanwhile recent research indicates that urban runoff will be a major influence possibly adding a load of as much as 500,000 lbs. of BOD in a single storm. Unit costs of treating urban runoff pollution are very high, due to its extreme variability. Artificial aeration or oxygenation may provide a more economical means of improving the dissolved oxygen regimen, as compared to primary treatment of urban runoff, or tertiary treatment of effluents. In any event planning on a regional basis is desirable in the Delaware and elsewhere, and Pl 92–500 may need to be changed to facilitate it.</jats:p>",
