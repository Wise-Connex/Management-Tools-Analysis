Social choice theorists have shown that no attractive social decision procedure satisfies both the Pareto principle and loyalty rights. Observation of individual rights and respect for agreement among parties cannot be guaranteed for all constellations of personal preferences. This theorem is applied here to argue for, and illustrate, the impossibility of Paretian advocacy planning. The Pareto principle can conflict with loyalty claims in other modes of planning too, such as sympathy on ideological grounds for a particular group. Finally, two other paradoxes involving loyalty are presented, and their consequences for advocacy planning are briefly discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Economic reforms in China have significantly changed both the processes of urban development and the practice of urban spatial planning. Changes in these aspects of urbanization, however, have not occurred in concert. The reassertion of planning as a profession has resulted in a reintroduction of a form of master planning, while the state's virtual monopoly over urban investment and decision making has steadily eroded. In Chinese cities, the practice of urban planning may have passed from irrelevance under the command economy of the past to gross ineffectiveness in the socialist market economy of today. In this paper I review major urban trends arising from Chinese economic reforms and discuss the problems and prospects of a planning response to these trends. </jats:p>",

The experimental program, called Community and Environmental Planning (CEP), has recently assessed its progress. This paper describes the program and distills what was learned in the self-assessment. The assessment is strongly affirmative, but also raises a number of concerns. The paper concludes with reflections on three subjects of importance to the field of planning on which the CEP experience sheds light: the challenge of continuing renewal, the scope of planning scholarship, and the place of planning in a democratic society. </jats:p>",

As a complement to existing bibliographies, we provide step-by-step procedures as well as tables of library search terms that will facilitate implementing a similar project at other universities. </jats:p>",

The first theme of the paper is that land use planning is an inefficient instrument for this purpose and may actually increase the use of fuel. The second theme relates to land use planning in Britain, where sustainability has been seized upon as a justification for existing policies of urban containment. I argue that some of these policies, in particular the designation of greenbelts, actually increase car use and the length of journeys. </jats:p>",

The incident amplified perceptions of environmental risk and reinforced perceptions of distributional, procedural, and process inequities. Housing prices within the affected area continue to reflect a risk-induced discount when compared to those in adjacent and similar neighborhoods. The property value diminution in the affected area has occurred despite assurances of governmental agencies that residual contaminants are within safe limits. The article concludes with a number of strategies for planners, which should help strengthen planning processes that involve environmental equity considerations in the central areas of our major cities. </jats:p>",

It describes a proposed Canadian national ports policy, and attempts to explain why it never came to pass. It also looks to the developments of the rest of the North Atlantic in regard to ports policy, and asserts that in general, there has never been a true attempt to instate it. Author Lewis R. Fischer presents both sides of the argument for and against national ports policy, and concludes by suggesting that ports have traditionally been one of the most poorly governed sectors of the maritime economy, but that new ideas and new avenues of governance can significantly alter this.</p>",

Consequently, theorists are compelled not just to specify the activities that comprise practice, but also to write the planner who will carry out these actions. That is, they must address the identity of their planners. This paper explores Leonie Sandercock's postmodernism and John Forester's communicative action in search of how identity is written and integrated into their respective arguments. The search leads to a reconsideration of three dilemmas in planning theory: the tension between redistribution and recognition, the relative importance of consciousness and consequence, and the interaction of interpersonal relations and institutional structures. </jats:p>",

Parallels are drawn with pre-Darwinian ideas about archetypal forms in biology. The archetypal building serves to represent those overall properties of the envelope which are determined by the constraints of lighting and the close-packing of certain generic types of space—'cellular space’, ‘open-plan space’, and ‘halls’. Four worked examples are given showing the transformation of the archetype into real historical buildings. Potential applications are suggested in the classification of building types, in building science, in architectural history, and in design support systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Wayfinding is a basic activity that people do throughout their lives as they navigate from one place to another. Many theories of spatial cognition have been developed to account for this behavior. However, most of the computational models focus on knowledge representation (for example, cognitive maps) and do not consider the process of how people structure wayfinding tasks and space. In this paper we present a computational method to compare the complexity of wayfinding tasks in built environments. As a measure for such complexity, we use a simple wayfinding model that consists of two critical elements: choices and clues. We show that elements of people's perception and cognition can be used to determine the elements of the wayfinding model and, therefore, to compare the complexity of wayfinding tasks in built environments. A case study of wayfinding in airports demonstrates the applicability of the method. The integration of this method into the computational design process of built environments will help to identify architectural problems with regard to wayfinding prior to construction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Under a typical riparian landscape structure where a vegetated buffer is sandwiched between a greenway trail and the river bank or lake shore, a trail user's perceptions about riparian scenic quality are influenced by, among other factors, buffer-induced setback effects. As a trail is set back to leave enough space for the vegetated linear area, both the subject and the composition of a trail user's viewshed can change significantly. This may in turn affect his or her perceptions of the lakescape or riverscape. For greenway trail planners, the buffer-induced setback effects become most relevant when they have the option of allocating trails behind either a legislature-regulated buffer with constant width or a scientifically recommended buffer of variable width. In North Carolina's Piedmont region, the discrepancy in width between constant and variable buffers may range from 10 to 200 m, large enough to cause significant visual variances. In this paper a method to investigate these setback effects is presented. Based on Shafer's landscape-photography approach, a technique called BISEA (buffer-induced setback effect assessment) is designed to inquire and represent two pieces of information about the setback effects. These are: (1) the subject and composition changes in prospective trail users' viewsheds caused by buffer-width variations; and (2) the impacts of these changes on riparian scenic quality as perceived by trail users. Implementation of the method is facilitated by a computer-based support system that comprise tools for landscape photography (a digital camera), survey [a global positioning system (GPS) receiver], image processing (a digital image-processing program), database management and visualization (a GIS), and scenic quality assessment (a spreadsheet program). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes a method for determining one part of an equity analysis of transit service change: who benefits from the change. The method defines census tract accessibility indices that measure how well residents can reach desired destinations by transit. By measuring transit door-to-door travel time before and after a major transit investment or service change, a planner may estimate the change in benefit accruing to each census tract. Changed benefits then may be compared to the income of each tract and the cost incidence borne by each tract. The method is illustrated by applying it to a controversial light rail system introduced in Sacramento, California, and a subsequent bus restructuring that included eliminating many express bus routes that linked distant neighborhoods with the central business district. Conventional equity analyses comparing travel time of suburb-to-CBD riders before and after the change, or comparing the income of rail and bus riders, likely would have concluded that the change made transit riders worse off, or benefitted primarily wealthier riders. This analysis, based on accessibility change experience by all transit riders, came to opposite conclusions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been argued that urban sprawl leads to inefficient land-use patterns with leapfrogging and low-density development in the urban fringe. Communities can implement a number of growth-management programs to encourage more efficient and environmentally sound development patterns. However, a long time period is needed to monitor the progress of growth-management techniques and to determine if they have achieved the intended effects. Unfortunately, urban development is mostly an irreversible process that leaves no room for experiment. As a result, we use GIS to simulate the impact of various growth-management policies on future land-development patterns in Portage County, Ohio. A comprehensive database and population growth forecasts are compiled to support the GIS analyses that generate a set of alternative residential growth scenarios. As a spatial decision support system, the GIS is found to be an efficient tool to simulate the form and process of development for detailed assessment and planning. As an educational tool, development simulation with GIS allows the generation of alternative scenarios to help citizens and local officials make sound planning decisions today, define future policies, and plan for new growth. </jats:p>",

These parameters are unsuitable for comparing the connectivity in networks that have different numbers of locations. The objective of this paper is to extend the existing parameters, so that the degree of connectivity of elements in a variety of networks can be compared. These parameters can be used to test relationships between the connectivity of locations and their function in the region and to compare these relationships across several locations in different regions as well as in one location in time. In simulations, we show that the size of the graph affects the values of the parameters derived. However, in contrast to the existing parameters, the degree of connectivity of elements in differently sized networks can be usefully compared. The parameter based on shortest-weighted paths can also differentiate between differently spaced networks.</jats:p>",

In an experiment, subjects were asked to compare varied pairs of Ming-style chairs. These comparisons were then analyzed by using the methods of multidimensional scaling and multiple regression analysis. The results show that the perception of Ming-style chairs between designer subjects and nondesigner subjects are similar and that the three main dimensions constituting the subjects' perceptual space are ‘elementary feature’, ‘emotional image’, and ‘use feeling’. There exist some common critical elementary features among Ming-style chairs. The degree of style similarity (being perceived as the same style) between a pair of chairs will increase with an increase in the number of critical features shared. The influential powers to this perception of similarity are different among these features. </jats:p>",

The land-use change component consists of a series of nonordinal multinomial logit models of site-specific land-use changes. These models incorporate spatial measures (for example, mix of adjacent land uses, and proximity to similar activities) as well as local policy and accessibility measures. Various model forms are developed and explained, as are multiple approaches to evaluating the equation for goodness-of-fit. </jats:p>",

Market size, growth rates, competitive forces, customer fit and profitability are just a few of the criteria which can be used by businesses assessing the attractiveness of their target markets. Yet despite the wealth of variables available to managers and the development of a range of decision tools to help them, research indicates that many businesses continue to assess target markets on the basis of short‐term profitability measures. This paper examines the wide range of approaches which have been proposed in the literature for identifying market attractiveness and questions how these fit with managerial practice, utilising the findings from cases and two studies of <jats:italic>The Times 1000 </jats:italic>UK companies’ target market approaches. The studies’ findings indicate that the literature’s formal, multi‐criteria tools for assessing market attractiveness are not necessarily reflected in the simplistic view adopted by many marketing professionals and brand managers. The paper concludes by offering a research agenda to help define future work in this area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the well‐documented benefits which segmentation offers, businesses continue to encounter implementation difficulties. This raises concerns about the cause of these problems and how they might be overcome. These concerns are addressed in this paper in the form of three questions: Is segmentation a good idea? If segmentation is such a good idea, why does it sometimes fail? What can be done to reduce the chance of failure? A mix of published evidence and case examples is used to explore these questions. The paper concludes by suggesting that if marketers are to overcome their segmentation implementation difficulties, they need practical guidance at three stages in the segmentation process. Before the project begins they must understand the role of success factors contributing to a successful result. During the segmentation project the qualities of the emerging segments must be clarified. After segmentation is complete the question of segment attractiveness must be considered. There is currently a gulf between the priorities of academics and practitioners carrying out segmentation. If this is to be bridged, further research is needed to provide guidance on segmentation success factors.</jats:p>",

The paper will draw on structured interviews in three local authorities, with voluntary sector participants in contracts for social care, and with participants in joint community care planning groups, as well as on documentary research. It will explore the impact of the evolving roles for those seeking to operate effectively in the pluralist provision of public services. It will analyse experiences within joint community care planning structures, and will analyse experiences of contractual relationships.

Three-dimensional seismic studies revealed a number of significant structures in these licenses, and the decision was made to evaluate the most interesting of these at the earliest opportunity. As a consequence, the well engineering team proceeded to plan the first exploration well, which was to be drilled in 1275 meters of water in the Nyk High area off northern Norway.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The team faced two significant challenges. The rig market for fourth generation semisubmersible drilling units capable of drilling in these water depths was such that there were no Norwegian approved vessels available. Hence, they had to plan for the importation of an appropriate rig and introduce a new drilling contractor to the Norwegian sector. Additionally, the water depth was indicative of a dynamically positioned drilling operation, and the Norwegian authorities needed to be convinced that this unit and the associated drilling program were appropriate for the task at hand.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Consequently, there were a number of key processes that were central to the success of this exercise. These included detailed project planning, wide ranging risk assessments, and accessing the knowledge and skills of groups inside BP Exploration with experience in these operations. Visible compliance with our internal technical and Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) systems and policies was a central feature of this project, along with compliance with the Norwegian requirements. As the first well of this nature in the Norwegian sector, these processes were all key to final approval to proceed with the drilling activity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We describe how these aims were achieved by detailing the well engineering team project management, the risk assessment procedures that were implemented, the approach to regulatory compliance, and the verification processes that were put in place. The detailed engineering studies and the performance of the first well will be reported separately in later papers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The proton beam at the Hahn Meitner Institute (HMI) in Berlin will be used for proton therapy of eye melanoma in the near future. As part of the pre‐therapeutic studies, Monte Carlo calculations have been performed to investigate the primary fluence distribution of the proton beam including the influence of scattering foils, range shifters, modulator wheels, and collimators. Any material in the beam path will modify the therapeutic beam because of energy loss, multiple scattering, range straggling, and nuclear reactions. The primary fluence information is a pre‐requisite for most pencil‐beam treatment planning algorithms. The measured beam penumbra has been used as one of the parameters to characterize a proton beam for further calculations in a treatment planning algorithm. However, this phenomenological quantity represents only indirect information about the properties of the proton beam. In this work, an alternative parameterization of the beam exiting the vacuum window of the accelerator, as well as the beam right in front of the patient collimator, is introduced. A beam is fully characterized if one knows (for instance from Monte Carlo simulations) the particle distribution in energy, position, and angle, i.e., the phase space distribution. Therefore, parameters derived from this distribution can provide an alternative input in treatment planning algorithms. In addition, the method of calculation is introduced as a tool to investigate the influence of modifications in the beam delivery system on the behavior of the therapeutic proton beam.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The materials in trash, or municipal solid waste (MSW), may be recycled, composted, incinerated, or landfilled. Transporting these materials to waste-management facilities consumes part of the operating budget of a municipality. Many factors, the majority uncertain, may influence the planning of waste-flow allocation. MSW managers want to know (1) whether the existing pattern is close to the optimal, and (2) if not, what is the optimal? We used a gray linear-programming (GLP) model to address these questions for the regional municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth, Ontario. This approach can effectively reflect the interactive relationships between uncertain system components. It can also bring uncertain information into the optimization process and resulting solutions, permitting feasible decision alternatives to be generated. The region's waste managers have used the results to verify or adjust the existing waste-flow allocation pattern. They may also be used to formulate related local policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has always been difficult to explore local power structures, and local politics (or local political economies) have often been reinterpreted in ways in which they are simply seen as the working out of wider national or global processes. The recognition that this is not enough has encouraged a growth in more locally focused research, frequently involving extensive interviewing of members of local business and political elites. Two key sets of questions arise from this sort of research. The first concerns the relationships between researcher and researched which are constructed by the research process itself. Is it possible to maintain an attitude of critical engagement? How is the research agenda constructed through negotiation between the participants? Who has power within the research process? The second involves a more serious issue for this form of research: namely, is it really possible to identify and explore power through interviews, however carefully constructed they are? What about the dimensions of power that are inaccessible to interviewers? This question has bedevilled community-power and pluralist research in the USA and the United Kingdom, and has never been adequately resolved. Do we now have the means to resolve it? The author explores both of these sets of questions with the help of evidence from a range of research projects in which he has been actively involved. The conclusion suggests productive approaches to the researching of local elites, identifying opportunities as well as constraints. </jats:p>",

I attempt to question what is meant by the term ‘elite’, how the term may be given a deeper conceptual relevance, and what the consequences of this might be for the study of elites. Through a critical review of conventional elite theory, and a discussion of concepts of society and power, three elements of elite definition are identified, focusing on access to resources, networking, and discursive construction. These are then illustrated with reference to local political elites in Somerset. I discuss the potential for a distinctively geographical contribution to the study of elites, through an exploration of the places and spaces in which elites are formed and interact. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This report presents the planning, projected costs, and manpower requirements for a possible national colorectal cancer screening programme. Screening would be offered to all those aged 50–69, who comprise 20% of the United Kingdom population. The initial screening test would be faecal occult blood testing every two years. A local programme, administered by a screening centre serving a population of one million, would be responsible for inviting 100 000 subjects a year. The response rate in Nottingham, the UK trial centre, was below 60%. Good informed compliance would require the active support of primary care. The invitation and test kit would be sent by post, and completed tests returned to the screening centre, for reading and reporting. Those with a positive initial screen (about 2%) would be recalled for assessment. This would result in 60 000 investigations each year across England and Wales, given a screening uptake rate of 60%. Clearly any deviation from this predicted rate would have a major effect on resources. Assessment and any subsequent treatment would be by a multidisciplinary team working at the cancer unit, as recommended in recent NHS executive guidance. The best method for investigation is colonoscopy. When completed successfully this allows visualisation of the whole bowel. However, performance varies widely across the UK, and there is insufficient skilled manpower to undertake this additional workload. Most significantly the technique has a mortality rate of 0.02%, so the programme might expect 12 deaths a year, which would not be acceptable. Alternatively, assessment of screen positive cases could be by a combination of double contrast barium enema and flexible sigmoidoscopy, with a comparable sensitivity. Both procedures have much lower morbidity and mortality rates. Colonoscopy would then only be required for a smaller number of patients, with cancer or suspicious lesions, or after unsatisfactory investigations. Quality assurance should be an integ- ral part of the programme, as in the other NHS cancer screening programmes, involving all professional groups and coordinated by a regional quality assurance reference centre. Cost estimates are over £40 million a year, together with any allowance for general practitioners, with additional capital and training costs at the start of the programme. Given a 60% overall uptake rate, a test sensitivity of 60%, and a recall rate of 2%, about 35% of the cases of colorectal cancer in the eligible population—that is, about 5400 cases, could be detected each year. As this would also depend on maintaining good compliance, a continuing value of 4000 cases is more realistic. Appreciable savings on costs of treatment are unlikely as aggressive curative treatments would be expensive. </jats:p>",

The model is internally coherent, logical, easily intelligible and was used extensively as a guide to predicting development. For all destinations it postulates a path of steady growth until stagnation is reached. The model's widespread influence has discouraged policy and planning prior to stagnation. This paper illustrates the model's limitations, through a comparative analysis of tourism development in Queensland and Hawaii. Tourism growth in actual destinations does not support the model's predictions, in that some of the most attractive, but undeveloped destinations, have shown limited growth, while there are no indications of decline in established ‘mass’ destinations. Tourism growth in undeveloped areas is not inevitable, nor need developed destinations eventually stagnate. The paper argues that there is no automatic developmental progression. At all levels of development there are crisis points requiring coherent policy implementation if sustainable tourism growth is to be achieved.</jats:p>",

There is little work which explores how the definition of the city, particularly in colonized countries, excludes indigenous peoples and cultures. In this paper, I wish to turn critical attention to the cultural meaning of urbanism by focusing on the complex geographies of identity and resistance which characterize the meaning of the term ‘urban’ in relation to First Nations women in Canada. I begin with a brief overview of the way colonial practices, which defined First Nations peoples and cultures as incompatible with urban life and First Nations people's negotiation of these practices, helped separate First Nations peoples and the city in imagination and in fact. I then describe the way colonial administration and policy established First Nations reserves as masculinized spaces. Last, I describe the alternative geographies of rights and identity imagined by urban First Nations women. </jats:p>",

Methods under research include immuno‐contraceptives for women and men, hormonal methods for men, new approaches to female hormonal contraception and improved barrier methods. Modern contraceptives are effective and safe for most women, and some methods have beneficial health effects other than prevention of pregnancy. However, underlying health conditions may decrease the safety of a given method. The appropriate use of the technology available requires screening for biomedical conditions and counseling that enables the selection of methods according to the life style of women and couples. Contraceptive methods have had a considerable positive impact on maternal and infant health and on population growth, but unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortion still occur in large numbers. This shows the need to improve access to and quality of family planning services including the availability of contraceptives, sensitive providers trained in technical matters and communication skills, and communication between the community, the providers and the managers.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this paper I discuss the role of school fieldwork in the context of wider cultural and educational, as well as geographical, discourses. I begin by exploring the increasing scope and sophistication of outdoor activities in the locality of the school which, contrary to common assumptions, were an integral component of geography lessons from the early 1870s. This leads to closely focused discussion of systematic Local Survey, a practice often taken to characterise interwar school geography. Finally, I consider residential fieldtrips to entirely unfamiliar environments in distant localities which were, I suggest, manifestation of a far broader ‘culture of the field’ that increasingly suffused popular culture in Britain during the period. In sum, I argue that, whether in familiar local surroundings or unknown distant areas, fieldwork was most highly valued for its social, moral, and civic benefits, rather than for its contribution to geographical education, narrowly defined.</jats:p>",

This is a complex problem because the set of parameters is large, especially when targets are geometrically close to a critical structure. For this reason, we present here an optimization algorithm, namely the multiplier penalty method, to mathematically determine those parameters. Two cases are presented in this article: the first one is really planned by a physicist in a clinical treatment, and is redone in our optimization algorithm to show the effectiveness of this method; the second one is theoretical where a critical structure is placed close to the target volume. The results show that this method achieves an excellent conformation to the specified isodose curve with the contour of the target volume, allowing minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissue.</jats:p>",

In this paper the author looks at the production and reproduction of financial space in the United Kingdom through an examination of the development of the domestic banking system. Over the past 250 years progressive changes in the banking system, from the formation of joint-stock blanks to the implementation of credit-scoring techniques, have stretched and reshaped the space across which banks have operated. This ‘financial distanciation’, it is argued, is set to accelerate in the 1990s and increase the ‘spatial reflexivity’ between the international, national, and regional financial systems. It is suggested that in the context of heightened domestic and international financial competition the increasing centralisation of lending control in the UK banking system risks marginalising some sections of society and placing local economic communities at an international disadvantage. </jats:p>",

I suggest that the Thatcher government's attempts to reimagine a neglected and remote colony in the South Atlantic as British sovereign territory was significant in mobilising media and public support for the recovery campaign. The role of rural imagery is considered to be one element in that reimaginative process. The actual experiences of the task force and journalists sent to report on the war campaign often clashed with the published reports of the mainstream media. Although government-imposed censorship played a part in ensuring the positive reporting predominated, negative impressions of the campaign and the islands themselves were significant in terms of forcing some to reconsider the strategic and symbolic value of the Falklands. In the final section of the paper I consider not only how the war dead were commemorated but also the decision by the then government to allow fallen soldiers to be buried in the United Kingdom rather than in the Falklands. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The US Acid Rain Program (ARP) has since 1990 allowed 1000 major electric utilities all over the USA to trade SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emission permits. Historical emission rights have heen grandfathered and the target level is a 50% reduction in SO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. Market performance has been successful, with much trade activity and unexpectedly low permit prices. Property rights to permits have been well defined, strictly enforced, and sources have been allowed to trade freely without the need for administrative approval for each transaction. Ignoring source location in this way has kept transaction costs at a minimum. In conclusion, the policy design of the ARP is recommendable for future environmental regulation where source location may be ignored, for example, for creating CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> markets in the USA and the European Union. </jats:p>",

Developments to the model are described including: tenure disaggregation, calibration and testing with the aid of micro and other datasets; application down to small-area (postcode-sector) level; updating and projection from census to recent and future dates; and predicting benefit take-up.

However, despite this ideological objective, several large utility companies were privatised as regulated monopolies. Against this background, in a notable reorientation of privatisation policy, the Major administration attempted to secure a genuine movement towards market liberalisation when it divested British Rail (BR). An elaborate methodology was used to break BR's monopoly and establish a competitive market for the provision of passenger rail services. The authors argue that, notwithstanding the complexity of the rail sell-off, competition has not materialised and BR's monopoly has to ail intents and purposes been reconstituted in the private sector. </jats:p>",

An overview is provided of the main regional and subregional patterns of ‘raw’ earnings differentials and of the underlying ‘deep wage structure’—once variations in workforce composition have been controlled for. A distinctive regional pattern with the highest wages in London and the South East is evident, although there are also some significant variations in wage levels between neighbouring local areas within regions. As the demand for spatially disaggregated data on earnings and incomes remains unsatisfied despite recent increases in data supply, important concerns about the quality of the information remain. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I present findings from research on ‘out-of-town’ leisure destinations and activities by young people from different ethnic backgrounds living in a medium-sized town located in the Home Counties of the South East of England. The predominant way in which the spatialisation of ‘race’ is discussed in Britain is via the discourse of the ‘inner city’. In contrast, the Home Counties' area of the South East has received little recognition of the presence of minority ethnic groups. Instead, it is frequently characterised as being a ‘white place’, or alternatively by some geographers as constituting a ‘nonplace space’ of social and spatial anonymity. However, relatively little research has been carried out on how young people themselves use and perceive different places in the region. I aim to explore issues of race, place, and identity with reference to data from interviews with a multiethnic group of seventy Asian, black, and white young people. I consider the significance of the out-of-town visits for debates over localism, postmodernism, and identity in relation to youth. It is argued that the supposedly anonymous space of the South East is far from being placeless, and instead the out-of-town visits by the young people have identifiable ethnic or racialised meanings. In conclusion, I suggest what implications the findings have for our understanding of the spatialisation of race in this underresearched area of the country. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The last few years have seen a major debate on the scale, extent, and causes of social polarisation in global cities and in Western societies in general. But the debate has often been characterised more by theoretical assertion than by empirical analysis. In particular, the concept of social polarisation has often been confused with inequality. The authors use General Household Survey data and New Earnings Survey data from 1979 to 1995 to examine the existence and extent of polarisation in London. It is argued that the evidence for polarisation is relatively weak, and that to the extent that polarisation exists it is asymmetric, with much greater growth in the size of groups at the top of the earnings distribution than at the bottom. But it is also argued that both London and Great Britain as a whole have seen a marked increase in earnings inequality over the last twenty-five years. Although most groups have improved earnings in real terms, the increase has been much greater at the top end of the earnings scale. As a result, the interquartile and interdecile earnings ratios have risen sharply. It is concluded that London has seen an increase in earnings inequality rather than growth of social polarisation. </jats:p>",

Planning, implementation and evaluation processes are influenced by the potentially conflicting goals of senior management and brand/product managers, a failure to integrate media plans and trade plans, and the prevalence of subjective and ad hoc decision making. All these factors are observed among large fast‐moving goods companies in New Zealand. Demonstrates that the promotional planning process is an important driver of how much use is made of sales promotions. A promotional planning matrix is offered as an analytical tool to allow managers to understand the impact of budget allocations and to help overcome planning problems that were identified in the study.</jats:p>",

These questions are particularly important in light of challenges which claim that, in fact, we have reached the ‘end of history’. Baudrillard, for example, believes that we have entered a ‘hyperreal’ era which suppresses further experimentation with social organization. Instead, collisions of excessively proliferated representations of relationships between rurality, history, and social interaction suggest that the very possibility of social organization in an ahistorical hyperreal era increasingly relies for its expression on the carrying out of deliberately (and often violent) antisocial action.</jats:p>",

Increasingly, new economies and trade in mutable resources such as information, global finance, and genetic material are controlled not by conventional corporate elites but rather by constellations of disparate but highly influential actors linked together across an equally mutable regulatory landscape. With the aid of my recent research into the elite which controls global trade in genetic material as a case study, I begin to deconstruct conventional notions of what constitutes a corporate elite, positing in its place an alternative construction in which they are understood not as formally constituted, institutionally based entities, but rather as increasingly informal, hybridised, and invisible ‘elite networks’. I then consider some of the methodological issues which confront researchers investigating the constitution and behaviour of these elite networks. In so doing I reflect upon the role which processes such as luck, chance, and intuition play in determining the direction and outcome of research projects. I conclude with a discussion of some of the ethical tensions which surround issues of disclosure, textual representation, and attribution of sources. </jats:p>",

Using four experimental data sets they demonstrate that locational cueing introduces random error into the analysis and that spatial cueing increases the relative and absolute accuracy of spatial products (external representations of spatial knowledge). These effects are consistent regardless of whether individual or place cognition is assessed. As such, location and spatial cueing compromise both construct and convergent validity, and the integrity of the conclusions from previous studies on cognitive mapping are brought into question. It is suggested that a multidata collection, multidata analysis approach should be adopted to highlight and compensate for these methodological weaknesses. </jats:p>",

The authors argue that, although much progress has been made with the estimation of household income, such research has concentrated on wage and benefit income. A dynamic microsimulation model called CORSIM is used to estimate new indicators of wealth. These include household income derived from stocks and shares, retirement accounts, and financial gains made from house sales and inheritances. New indicators of debts include all household debts, especially mortgage debts. Although these indicators have been calculated at national levels in the past, it is argued that considerable benefits will accrue to our understanding of social problems and changing consumer lifestyles if these indicators can be estimated at regional and subregional levels of resolution. </jats:p>",

A test for sample-selection bias due to location effects in the labour-market model is formulated and applied to the retrospective work-history data from the Social Class and Economic Life Initiative (SCELI). The test suggests that location and labour-market behaviour are interdependent outcomes. As the SCELI has sampled data from a very restricted subset of all possible locations in Britain the model loses external validity, that is, the results cannot be generalised to individuals who live outside the selected areas at the sample date. The model also loses internal validity, because selection on location will have induced a correlation between the random components and many of the covariates in the model, implying that the estimated parameters are misleading indicators of the true covariate effects. These conclusions must therefore raise questions about the validity of any substantive research related to labour-market outcomes which uses the SCELI data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Amidst a multitude of mutually compounding economic, political, and social crises, amidst the repeated shattering of everyday taken-for-granteds, amidst the repeated invalidation of meaning-memories, identity crises have come to abound in Sweden. For many Swedes perhaps nothing has become more disruptive of taken-for-granted meanings and identity than either the large-scale presence of non-Europeans and Muslims, or the assortment of racisms that have risen to the surface among extremist Others and—less consciously—themselves. The widespread occurrence of cultural racism runs counter to central images of self and nation held by most Swedes. That variety of racism and its attendant identity destabilization is generally denied and culturally reworked in two principal ways. (1) Through people comforting themselves with the belief that the country's racists are somebody else; through convincing themselves that only the physical violence and fascist symbolics of certain others have racist consequences; through blinding themselves to the fact that those same certain others cannot—by the wildest stretch of the imagination—be linked to the employment discrimination, housing segregation and social apartheid that currently pervades the country. (2) Through projecting upon other locations as well as other groups, through adhering to a certain popular geographical imagination, through regarding racism as typical of a limited number of places associated with hideous events, through—in essence—collectively remembering the recently occurred so as to deny or forget the here and now. In order to demonstrate the internal contradictions and collective self-deceptions of this cultural reworking of racism and identity, in order to reveal how the popular geographical imagination in question resonates with the multiple crises confronting Sweden, in order to capture its complexities and show what it silences and turns invisible, I provide a detailed account and critique of one of its central elements. </jats:p>",

Those who continued to use Norplant were reinterviewed at 2 years or at removal. RESULTS: In a multivariate analysis, only 1 of the 4 potential barriers--cost--significantly impeded Norplant discontinuation.

The investment by the Korean company LG, at Newport, South Wales, has prompted a degree of strategic collaboration between some of the institutions and organisations of local governance in South Wales. However, the LG case reveals some important limits to such strategic collaboration. The extreme flexibility required of the planning system by major inward investors promotes a rather impoverished form of strategic collaboration which is hierarchical in nature and select in its coverage both of the relevant institutions and organisations of governance and of the planning issues involved. In conclusion we identify some of the implications of the rather limited way in which the planning system currently impinges on inward investors through local systems of governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally, agrarian beliefs have been assigned an important place in studies of the formative processes of agricultural policymaking. However, such work has tended to privilege these beliefs with a passive, conditioning, or reactive role in decisionmaking and decision taking. In this paper, we show that these deeply engrained notions also provide the basis for articulating more complex proactive strategies, aimed at advancing agricultural interests. We demonstrate how widely held agrarian beliefs in British society, relating to ‘trusteeship’ by farming of the natural environment, have been deployed by policy élites in the British Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) as a means of legitimising a suite of agri-environment policies to sectoral constituencies and the general public which are strongly supportive of both bureaucratic and producer group ambitions. We examine the impact of these beliefs on the formation by MAFF of the British negotiating position towards the European Union's ‘agri-environment’ regulation, EU 2078/92. </jats:p>",
