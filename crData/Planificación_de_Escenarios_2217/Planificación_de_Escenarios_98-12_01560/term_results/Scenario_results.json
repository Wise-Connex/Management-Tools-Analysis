The prominent characteristics of major earthquake operations as well as the damages caused to environmental regime and human population are enumerated. The problems of earthquake prediction and control are also discussed.&#x0D;\nPrediction of hazardous earthquake activity can be made on the different criteria such as: seismicity pattern preceding large earthquake, recurrence intervals of earthquake events, dilatancy phenomena of high strain zone, changes in groundwater levels and composition and anomalous animal behaviour. However, precise technique for short term prediction is still to be evolved.&#x0D;\nEarthquake disasters can be reduced to some extent by adopting adequate remedial measures before, during and after the activity. It is opined that the environmental awareness should be exercised to educate people regarding the defensive operations to protect themselves from adverse effects of earthquakes. The appropriate steps such as schemes of landuse planning, regulation of structural design, and provisions of earthquake insurance programmes may be considered for implementation on priority.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A method for controlling nonlinear dynamics based on avoiding homoclinic intersection is systematically implemented to perform a numerical analysis of the control induced modifications of the steady attractors and bifurcation scenario of a two-well impact system. The work is divided into two parts. This paper (Part I) deals with the analysis of the harmonic (reference) and global optimal excitations, which are both symmetric. The bifurcation diagrams obtained for increasing values of the excitation amplitude show there exist a \"basic\" attractor and other \"complementary\" solutions. The range of stability of the principal complementary attractors is numerically established, and the mechanisms leading to their disapperance are identified. The role of classical and nonclassical local bifurcations in determining the system response is emphasized. Chaotic attractors are seen to appear and disappear both by classical period doubling route to chaos and by sudden changes. Subductions, boundary and interior crises are repeatedly observed. By comparison of the system response under different excitations we obtain information on the performances of global control, which furnishes relatively low gain in terms of regularization but succeeds in controlling the whole phase space. </jats:p>",

Here we investigate the experimental consequences associated with this resonant pair scattering in the normal state. The essential feature of these pair resonances is that they are dynamic pairing fluctuations. Of particular interest in distinguishing different scenarios for the cuprate pseudogap are probes which predominantly couple to the static and dynamic pair fluctuations, respectively. We therefore contrast the behavior of the diamagnetic susceptibility with the pair tunneling spectra of Superconductor-Pseudogapped cuprate junctions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To exploit all potentialities of the optimal control procedure, the analysis initiated in Part I focuses on the system response under one-side control, an excitation which furnishes high gain though, roughly, controlling only one part of the phase space. Many bifurcational and control items related to the unsymmetric and pulsed nature of the excitation are deeply investigated. A nonclassical kind of homoclinic bifurcation is identified and it is discussed how it may lead to major regularity. The system response is very rich, and the main local and global phenomena of the dynamics are analyzed in detail through combined use of bifurcation diagrams and attractor-basin phase portraits. Both the confinement of steady dynamics in the controlled potential well and their successive transition from confined to scattered are studied, and it is discussed how they are obtained through comparison with the case of harmonic excitation. It is shown that the two investigated optimal excitations permit to increase the amplitude level for confined to scattered dynamics and to regularize the steady dynamics, although in a different manner. The analysis shows the effectiveness — in \"average\" sense — of the proposed method for controlling nonlinear dynamics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVE: To evaluate two different techniques for assessing dermal exposure to 4,4'-methylene dianiline (MDA) in a field study. The results were used to test the applicability of a recently proposed quantitative dermal occupational exposure limit (DOEL) for MDA in a workplace scenario. METHODS: For two consecutive weeks six workers were monitored for exposure to MDA in a factory that made glass fibre reinforced resin pipes. Dermal exposure of the hands and forearms was assessed during week 1 by a surrogate skin technique (cotton monitoring gloves) and during week 2 by a removal technique (hand wash). As well as the dermal exposure sampling, biological monitoring, measurement of MDA excretion in urine over 24 hours, occurred during week 2. Surface contamination of the workplace and equipment was monitored qualitatively by colorimetric wipe samples. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Geometric means of daily exposure ranged from 81-1762 micrograms MDA for glove monitoring and from 84-1783 micrograms MDA for hand washes. No significant differences, except for one worker, were found between exposure of the hands in weeks 1 and 2. Significant differences between the mean daily exposure of the hands (for both weeks and sampling methods) were found for all workers. The results of the colorimetric wipe samples indicated a general contamination of the workplace and equipment. Excretion of MDA in 24 hour urine samples ranged from 8 to 249 micrograms MDA, whereas cumulative MDA excretion over a week ranged from 82 to 717 micrograms MDA. Cumulative hand wash and MDA excretion results over a week showed a high correlation (R2 = 0.94). The highest actual daily dermal exposure found seemed to be about 4 mg (hand wash worker A on day 4), about 25% of the external DOEL. Testing of compliance by means of a biological limit value (BLV) led to similar results for the same worker. It is concluded that both dermal exposure monitoring methods were applicable and showed a compatible performance in the present exposure scenario, where the exposure relevant to dermal absorption is considered mainly restricted to hands. The concept for a DOEL seemed to be relevant and applicable for compliance testing and health surveillance in the situation under investigation.</jats:p>",
