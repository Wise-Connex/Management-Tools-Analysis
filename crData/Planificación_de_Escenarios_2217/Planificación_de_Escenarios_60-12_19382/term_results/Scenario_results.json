He makes some rather startling statements about a good number of other things as well, but his remarks about the dramatic form in general and <jats:italic>Macbeth</jats:italic> in particular ask, I think, for some kind of comment. Mr. Winters is a good critic; the issues he raises here are important issues, issues that should be considered by anyone seriously interested in the dramatic form. And though I think he is wrong, he is wrong in an important way.</jats:p>",
