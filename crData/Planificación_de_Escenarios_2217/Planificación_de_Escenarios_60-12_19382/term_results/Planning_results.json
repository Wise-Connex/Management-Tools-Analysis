An objective of the Institute is this body of knowledge. The establishment of various TIMS colleges is a strategy for obtaining this objective. A tactic of the Planning College is the establishment of study teams to review common beliefs of assigned aspects of the subject matter of planning and report the results of these studies to the College. A goal of the present study team is to initiate a fruitful discussion of two specific elements of the planning process so a common and communicable understanding and formal documentation of them will result. </jats:p><jats:p> Management Technology, ISSN 0542-4917, was published as a separate journal from 1960 to 1964.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the importance of the new dynamic programming methods has remained unnoticed because of the apparent complexity of the underlying mathematics. This is indeed unfortunate because the essence of the programming methods for certain classes of problems is not new to practicing economists. Dynamic programming methods can provide an efficient computational algorithm for problem types frequently encountered in consumer demand and production theory. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper the following approach will be utilized. First, an illustration concerned with the allocation of an advertising budget among competing media will be presented that will enable the reader to study the relationship between dynamic programming and simple combinatorial analysis. Second, an attempt will be made to show the relationship between demand and production theory on the one hand and programming on the other. Third, an advertising budget allocation problem much like the simpler one discussed in the first section will be cast in terms of the dynamic programming computational procedure and solved. Finally, a very brief mathematical solution will be preferred. </jats:p><jats:p> Management Technology, ISSN 0542-4917, was published as a separate journal from 1960 to 1964.

Such treatments fall into three categories:acid injection into the pores of the matrix;acid injection into natural formation fractures at less than parting pressure; andcombination acidizing-fracturing treatments in which acid solutions (without propping agents) are injected at treating pressures sufficient to open and extend fractures through which the acid flows.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Because the spending time of acid during a specific well treatment does not change appreciably, maximum penetration is attained when the first increment of injected acid is completely spent. Additional acid injection cannot be expected to further extend the benefits of the treatment. Depth of penetration will depend upon the reaction rate of the acid under treatment conditions, the injection rate of the acid into the matrix or fractures and the area-volume relationship existing in the flow channels.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Based on Darcy's flow formula, extremely low injection rates must be used in order to keep bottom-hole injection pressures below formation fracturing pressure. As a result, only limited penetration of unspent acid will occur. Treatment records indicate that, in most acidizing treatments, formation parting pressures are exceeded, greatly extending acid penetration.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Under these conditions, stimulation benefits are limited to the fracture area produced during the spending time of the first increment of acid injected into the formation. This area may be calculated from laboratory and well data to estimate depth of penetration. This, in turn, may be correlated with productivity data to assist in the selection of optimum treating techniques and materials.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
