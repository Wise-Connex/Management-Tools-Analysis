      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A financial model is described that has been designed to predict short-term and intermediate-term probable cash flow of a company, to predict the influence of possible variations of non-controllable economic environmental variables, and to permit evaluation of the influence of variations of some controllable financial factors. The output of the model for any one set of predicted conditions, including predicted future balance sheets and profit or loss statements for almost any type of company organization and any mixture of business ventures, is to be compared with the results of several other runs under altered conditions in order to determine the influence of these variations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The post-war years have been a time of increasing technology in the petroleum industry as well as in all other fields. Much of this new technology has been concerned with the extension of computational powers through the use of digital computers, and since these machines and their systems are still undergoing rapid development, there is no suggestion of any immediate levelling-off of this trend. Each new extension in computing capabilities has produced, and will no doubt continue to produce, corresponding extensions in the nature or range of the problems that can be solved practically and economically.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During these years the petroleum industry has developed and improved upon many types of mathematical models in order to simulate on a computer the behavior of some particular segment of the industry. A list of some of these models would include:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Models m predict future performance of gas or petroleum reservoirs; Models to predict performance of gasoline plants, refineries and other processing plants; Network models to predict performance of pipeline systems for gathering, distributing or transporting gas, petroleum or products; Market analysis models that project future demand for various products. Some companies have been developing models that are, or will be, capable of simulating the economic behavior of a company or some particular segment thereof. Since there are many different companies with individual variations, combinations, aspirations, needs and desires, there are without question many approaches to the development of such a model. One such approach is presented here.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCEPT OF A FINANCIAL MODEL</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the conceptual stage of almost any sizable project it is normally desirable to formulate objectives at an early point, and such is the case with a financial model. The model to be discussed in this paper was conceived to achieve three principal objectives:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>to predict short-term and intermediate-term probable cash flow performance of a total company or a major portion of a company; to permit evaluation of the influence of possible variations of non-controllable variables such as, but not limited to, market demand factors, some product prices, availability of and terms for financing, tax rates, and the timing of any such variations; and to permit evaluation of the influence of controllable variables such as amount to invest, when to invest, where to invest, use of financing, dividend payments, new capitalization and how much to spread risks of various types.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>If a model of this type is to fulfill these objectives, it must be used generously. Definition of many case-runs would be required to investigate the effect that various combinations of possible future situations might have on the economics of a company, had it been following any particular plan. Many interesting aspects of a company's position, risk and opportunities could be analyzed with a model with these capabilities without any attempt to formulate probabilities until a later stage of analysis is reached.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In operating, the model must be able to provide as a minimum, the basic financial statements of any proof-making organization, the balance sheet, and the profit or loss statement for each future accounting period for which income and expense data are provided. It must readily allow the user, the management or manager of a company or some important part of a company, to introduce new values of some financial variables and changes in financing or capitalization at any time point.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>P. 71^</jats:p>",

These problems are discussed with the idea of presenting solutions that are economically advantageous to the contractor, and that, in turn, would result in savings to the operator. These ideas largely concern operating procedures in which the contractor's ideas may procedures in which the contractor's ideas may vary somewhat from those of the operator. After there are several ways of doing a certain task, several of which could be equally correct. We believe that closer communication and understanding between contractor and operator could influence ways of accomplishing some operations more economically, the theory being that if an operator can do things to save the contractor money, it will, in the long run, save the operator money.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Some phases in drilling a well that bear some review as to equipment requirements and operating procedure are blowout preventor and manifold requirements, deviation limits, and mud programs. Some other problems in which the operator should be sympathetic to the contractor include diminishing labor source, value of lost in-hole equipment while on day work, bid lists and procedures, and reduced volume of drilling.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The main reason for the present plight of the West Texas contractor is an over-supply of rigs, along with a continual decrease in drilling. During the period of the Snyder and Spraberry booms, many people were able to go into the drilling business because of the opposite situation—an under-supply of rigs. The contractor has been paying for the prosperous years since 1957. supply and demand are prosperous years since 1957. supply and demand are approaching a leveling-off point where prudent contractors can make a legitimate profit. Operators now are needed to help establish a sound drilling industry that can worry less about just simple survival and can spend some time, effort, and money in improving drilling techniques.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>BLOWOUT PREVENTOR REQUIREMENTS</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Vitally needed is for contractors and operators to get together on standardization of blowout preventor manifolds. Coral Drilling, Inc. has utilized approximately 20 different company \"hook-ups\". Fortunately, they never have lost control of a well kick. This would indicate that the majority, if not all, of their manifolds were suitable. Nevertheless, almost every time there is a change of operators, the manifold must be revamped. The cost of these changes varies, but in the long run it must be recovered from the operators.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The author agrees that family planning programs should initially emphasize information, facts, and logistics, and that the subsequent campaign should aim at the best prospects, emphasize self-interest, belay the audience's distrust of the communicator, make post-delivery visits to the mother, work with impersonal messages, and legitimate the behavior that it wants to stimulate. But he suggests that private, personal communication has not been shown to be most efficient; that amounts of information should be large, not small; and that messages should be distributed as widely as possible and be as various as possible.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the end, an appropriate message-accounting system and an explicit consideration of the dollarvalue of each “customer,” when imposed upon these principles of hard-nosed advertising experience, will be invaluable to the growth and success of the family planning campaign.</jats:p>",

But growth targets also\n      imply something about the availability of capital goods. The business of\n      economic planning, as Winston points out [1], is to ensure compatibility\n      between the Harrod-Domar and the Mahalanobis constraints. If domestic\n      savings exceed the availability of domestic plus foreign capital goods,\n      two \"despised alternatives\" confront the economy: inventory accumulation\n      or slower growth. To avoid this unhappy predicament, Winston outlines\n      three remedial policies. Our purpose is to suggest that the Harrod-Domar\n      and Mahalanobis constraints may not be independent. Remedial policies\n      aimed at that larger capital goods supply may affect the private and\n      public savings rates and the growth of income. These suggestions are\n      hardly novel [2]. They turn on re¬placing the proportional savings\n      function with a classical savings function (i.e., one which specifies\n      private savings rates by economic sector), on distinguishing tax rates\n      by type of domestic production and imports, and on stipulating a\n      connection between consumer-goods production and import of raw materials\n      for the consumer industries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of the present paper is to discuss the problem of\n      dependence on foreign capital for economic growth of Pakistan, a\n      typically under¬developed country which is relying rather heavily on\n      foreign assistance without a sufficiently spelled-out analysis of the\n      economic and political consequences of such a policy for the country's\n      future. The discussion starts with an analysis of the implications of\n      Pakistan's current Perspective Plan (1965-85) for plan-terminal external\n      indebtedness of the country (Section II). Need for careful\n      rationalization of a terminal bequest of liability of this magnitude to\n      future society is stressed. This is followed by a discussion (Section\n      III) of the alternatives the country would have to service the external\n      indebtedness with which it would be saddled at termination of its\n      Perspective Plan. It is pointed out that the alternatives have political\n      implications for the country's future, and one may question the ethics\n      of thus restricting choice of policies for future\n      generations.</jats:p>"

Se demuestra que el programa de planificación familiar por sí, solo resultaría responsable de un descenso de 24.5 porciento en la fecundidad de la población.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Se discute la relación existente entre la magnitud del cambio obsevatudo y el bajo porcentaje de mujeres de 15 a 44 años de edad que han sido protegidas. Se concluye al respecto que el cambio fué posible porque se usaron anticonceptivos de alta eficacia y se protegieron las mujeres de mas alta fecundidad dentro de la población.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Se discute brevemente la validez de los datos obtenidos mediante el método de la Historia de ebarazoe en el estudio de cambios en fecundidad. Se analiza la magnitud de la disminución observada en la fecundidad de la población en 1964, antes de que comenzara el Programa de Planificación Familiar. Se discute la participación de las pacientes, OPW y NPW en este cambio.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Se analiza la fecundidad que habría tenido la población si en ausencia del programa, las pacientes hubieran disminuido su fecundidad en la misma proporción en que la disminuyen anualmente las Otras Mujeres Protegidas (en lugar de mantener la fecundidad que tenían en los años anteriores al programa). Se concluye que en tal caso el programa sería aún responsoble de un descenso de 19.9 porciento en la fecundidad de la poblacion.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Se señala la necesidad de continuar la investigación para determinar si los efectos observados se mantendrán en el tiempo y cual será la magnitud de los efectos del segundo y tercer año de acción del programa.</jats:p>",
