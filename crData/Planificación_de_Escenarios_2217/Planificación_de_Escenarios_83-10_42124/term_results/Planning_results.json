The model can be implemented on a small (64 Kb) mini-computer. The equations for the model are presented, along with the plots generated. Available plots include vertical and horizontal sections of the wellbore, traveling cylinder plots for anti-collision analysis, and plots that compare the planned wellbore trajectory with the actual surveyed trajectory. In addition, a new directional drilling simulator is described that allows the simulated drilling of a directional well. The simulator is currently in use as a training aid. However, it can also be used for engineering applications. The simulator is interactive and some sample results from the simulator are presented.</jats:p>",

The growth of policy planning systems can be analysed from a number of perspectives: (1) procedural planning theory; (2) interorganisational theory and (3) the theory of fiscal crisis. The paper discusses five major factors which shape the implementation process in relation to policy planning systems: (1) the policy message; (2) the multiplicity of agents; (3) perspectives and ideologies; (4) resources; (5) the politics of planning.</jats:p>",

We do, however, continue to assume the abolition of the national insurance surcharge in two equal stages during the 1984‐5 fiscal year, as well as the usual indexation of tax allowances and bands and revalorisation of indirect taxes. This change in assumptions about policy reflects our guess that the new Chancellor, Nigel Lawson, will attempt to hit his monetary targets by a combination of tighter fiscal policy and lower interest rates than we had previously assumed. In this forecast interest rates are on average about 2 points lower than in July.</jats:p>",

Specific attention is given to the use of network modeling techniques to determine probable durations and risk levels for complex marine projects such as the installation of the first guyed tower production platform, and offshore mating of HIDECK, a barge-mounted integrated oil production facility with a preinstalled platform. Monte Carlo simulation techniques are used to select random variables. The environmental data derived from a spectral ocean wave model are used, while full account is taken of hydrodynamic response of the offshore systems in order to establish the limiting sea states for performing specific construction operations. Environmental data sources for such simulations are reviewed. Various methods used to determine limiting sea states are compared. The results of statistical analysis of offshore construction operations, such as module lifting, pipelaying, and saturation diving, are presented to give insight into the limitations on vessel motions during offshore construction. In summary, this paper provides a review of methodologies and data used in performing operability analyses, in order to assist engineers in assessing duration and risk for offshore construction projects.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author proposes a simple theoretical model of the accelerator type which helps to explain some observed characteristics of the pronounced office-development cycle in Britain. The British economy is currently experiencing its third major postwar cycle, the previous peaks of development activity having occurred in the early 1960s and early 1970s, the latter during the famous ‘property boom’. The author begins with a summary guide to the literature on building cycles, examining the various exogenous factors which have been proposed to explain these cycles and identifying a crucial endogenous causal factor, which is the long production period between new building orders and completions. This delay is incorporated into an accelerator model of the development process, yielding a second-order difference equation which generates cyclical fluctuations around an equilibrium growth path. The behaviour of the model is then tested using typical values of the main parameters, and compared with the results of previous empirical research on the office-development cycle which has focused on the interaction of the user demand, investment demand, and development supply of new building. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we develop an equilibrium model of office location, which explicitly considers the source of agglomeration economies and which sees firm location and contact patterns as jointly and endogenously determined. We solve the model explicitly for contact-benefit, facility-cost, and transport-cost functions representative of medium-sized US cities. The resulting rent functions are concave rather than convex as they are in most models of industrial and residential location. The source of the concavity is that firms make contacts throughout the central business district (CBD). To determine the role of agglomeration economies associated with interfirm contacts, we alter the contact-benefit function, the transport-cost function and the size of the CBD. We find that agglomeration economies have a strong effect on location and, indeed, are often sufficiently strong to produce counterintuitive results. For example, an increase in transport costs causes a decrease rather than an increase in transport expenses, because in the city, which is now smaller, a firm decreases the number of contacts. Further, the increase in transport costs does not increase the relative attractiveness of the center. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within the context of recent attempts by Toronto to restrict office development in its downtown, the author examines, from several perspectives, the apparent locational conservatism of office activities in the existing core. He begins by arguing that in terms of overall systems efficiency the rationale for the decentralization strategy for Toronto was incomplete and that existing data on the frequencies of face-to-face contact indicated that a substantial increase in the difference between core and suburban rents was necessary to induce a significant removal of office activities from the central area. The subsequent increase in this difference beyond the theoretical level where out-migration should occur suggests the importance of other variables besides those traditionally measured by information linkage studies. Neglected among these factors is the quality of information, reflecting the ability to ‘shop’ among alternative information sources, which in a fundamental sense depends on accessibility. It is suggested that Toronto should not be surprised at increasing resistance to outward movement among the remaining office functions and the consequent higher differences between core and suburban rents, which are necessary to induce decentralization. Finally, through an examination of the origins of demand for suburban office-space in Metropolitan Toronto, the increasing level of resistance to removal by the office functions which remain in the core is shown to be consistent with recent migration trends. </jats:p>",

Particular attention is given to the investigation of the macroeconomic constraints on the process of new-business formation, which influence the decision of individuals to establish businesses themselves. Data on company registrations in Northern Ireland over the period 1951–1980 give some support to the proposition that new-business formation is a response to two sets of factors, ‘push’ factors and ‘pull’ factors. Push factors encourage an individual to leave paid employment (or more rarely unemployment) to establish his own business, and it is argued that the threat of unemployment is a significant factor in this decision. Pull factors operate in the opposite manner, making more attractive the opportunities and benefits of self-employment. Of particular interest in this respect is the apparent importance of upturns, or perceived upturns, in economic activity. On the basis of these findings, a number of suggestions for further more detailed research are made. </jats:p>",

Yet there remains much to be understood about the distinctive contribution of office activities to urban form, development, and structure or to problems of structural change at the regional scale. The scope for further work is demonstrated through a comparison of some recent research in Britain and North America. There are some clear differences in emphasis, approach, and methodology between the two ‘schools’ and there is scope for more comparative work and greater international collaboration in research activity. Office studies in Britain have been dominated by empirical concerns, but some research on behavioural aspects of office location decisionmaking and a model of the office development cycle suggest that things are changing. Nevertheless, applied research continues to be important as illustrated by a sector-specific study of the location and behaviour of business services in some large British cities. The development of theoretical models is a notable feature of recent work by some American economists and two examples are included. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT</jats:bold> As urban expansion outstrips water supplies, the usual solution is to build pipelines to bring in water from sources farther afield. Such water supplies may act as either a leader of urban development or as a follower. In either case, this engineering approach to the provision of water has fostered less than optimal utilization of regional water and land resources for urban growth. More efficient utilization of these resources is achieved when water supply development and urban growth planning are conjoint activities. Water supply planners and land use planners, working together, are able to generate and evaluate the full range of urban development options, including water demand management through conservation. Preferred regional growth plans are achieved using the best mix of water supply and urban growth. The result is a reduced rate of water supply development and a reduction of urban expansion on prime lands. This partnership approach is demonstrated for the Calgary Region under two levels of water conservation.</jats:p>",
