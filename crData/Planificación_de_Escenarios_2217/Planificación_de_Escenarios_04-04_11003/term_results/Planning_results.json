      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates how demographic (socioeconomic) and land-use (physical and environmental) data can be integrated within a decision support framework to formulate and evaluate land-use planning scenarios. A case-study approach is undertaken with land-use planning scenarios for a rapidly growing coastal area in Australia, the Shire of Hervey Bay. The town and surrounding area require careful planning of the future urban growth between competing land uses. Three potential urban growth scenarios are put forth to address this issue. Scenario A (‘continued growth’) is based on existing socioeconomic trends. Scenario B (‘maximising rates base’) is derived using optimisation modelling of land-valuation data. Scenario C (‘sustainable development’) is derived using a number of social, economic, and environmental factors and assigning weightings of importance to each factor using a multiple criteria analysis approach. The land-use planning scenarios are presented through the use of maps and tables within a geographical information system, which delineate future possible land-use allocations up until 2021. The planning scenarios are evaluated by using a goal-achievement matrix approach. The matrix is constructed with a number of criteria derived from key policy objectives outlined in the regional growth management framework and town planning schemes. The authors of this paper examine the final efficiency scores calculated for each of the three planning scenarios and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the three land-use modelling approaches used to formulate the final scenarios. </jats:p>",

The policy has social objectives (that is, to create ‘mixed’ communities and reduce the potential for the ‘ghettoisation’ of affordable housing) and financial objectives (that is, to shift the cost of providing social housing to the private sector). Although aspects of the policy have been the subject of research the design issues have yet to be fully investigated. Viewed from a development process perspective, the key design question is how layout and design decisions are affected by the developer's perception (or market experience) that the inclusion of affordable units has a detrimental effect on the market-rate housing. To aid further research, the author develops a classification of design strategies and outcomes necessitated by the inclusion of an element of affordable housing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An understanding of the dynamic process of urban growth is a prerequisite to the prediction of land-cover change and the support of urban development planning and sustainable growth management. The spatial and temporal complexity inherent in urban growth requires the development of a new simulation approach, which should be process-oriented and have a strong interpretive element. In this paper the authors present an innovative methodology for understanding spatial processes and their temporal dynamics on two interrelated scales—the municipality and project scale—by means of a multistage framework and a dynamic weighting concept. The multistage framework is aimed at modelling local spatial processes and global temporal dynamics by the incorporation of explicit decisionmaking processes. It is divided into four stages: project planning, site selection, local growth, and temporal control. These four stages represent the interactions between top-down and bottom-up decisionmaking involved in land development in large-scale projects. Project-based cellular automata modelling is developed for interpreting the spatial and temporal logic between various projects that form the whole of urban growth. Use of dynamic weighting is an attempt to model local temporal dynamics at the project level as an extension of the local growth stage. As nonlinear function of temporal land development, dynamic weighting can link spatial processes and temporal patterns. The methodology is tested with reference to the urban growth of a fast growing city—Wuhan, in the People's Republic of China—from 1993 to 2000. The findings from this research suggest that this methodology can be used to interpret and visualise the dynamic process of urban growth temporally and transparently, globally and locally. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sustainability may be viewed as a principled form of conduct. Among its effects is a growing emphasis on civil society and local governance through which the members of communities are encouraged to rethink democratic ideas and practices, and reconfigure how to live. Although normative, sustainability cannot properly be conceived as prescriptive; such a characteristic would undermine central elements of it, such as participation and equity. In this sense, requiring both mechanisms for community participation in decisionmaking and planning, and an ethic of engagement based on trust, reciprocity, and an acceptance of the rights of noncitizens and nonhuman nature, sustainability might also be construed as a deliberative form of democratic governance. Perhaps problematically, in the last decade this governmental aspect of sustainability has come to be associated with the procedures of communicative rationality. Supported by research conducted over three years in a local government in Tasmania, Australia, we argue that a deliberative and democratic praxis of sustainability may be effective only if and when underpinned by substantive changes to the exercise of power and leadership, and to the ways in which deliberative decisionmaking and planning are pursued. Communicative rationality alone is unlikely to achieve these ends. </jats:p>",

To deal with increasing workloads and their effects, many solutions have been developed, including the concept of team or group work. This paper will address the possibilities, conditions and effects involved in the implementation of group work in home care as a means of improving the quality of working life (QWL) in this sector. To this end I have studied QWL in three jobs in two organizations for home care, one of which implemented group work. This comparison concludes that jobs in the team‐based organization are more complete and challenging, bringing more job decision latitude, but also higher work pressure.

The results presented in the paper show that the average number of outpatient visits per doctor per day and the average number of inpatient days per doctor per day declined significantly over the period from 1986 to 1997. The main factors resulting in the reduction of productivity are associated with the increase of inappropriate staff recruitment in these health facilities, the significant decline of rural population covered by health insurance, particularly rural cooperative medical schemes (CMS), and the rapid rise of health care costs. The latter two factors also have brought about a reduction in the use of these health facilities by the rural population. The paper suggests that the government should tighten up the entrance of health and non‐health staff into the rural health sector and develop effective measures aimed to avoid providing pervasive financial incentives to the over‐provision of services and over‐use of drugs. In addition, other measures that help to increase the demand for health services, such as the establishment of rural health insurance, should be considered seriously.

More precisely, it identifies and examines the programmatic and non‐programmatic factors that influence prenatal care utilization, thus determining the areas that require further attention from the programe. Logistic regression results show that the adequacy of prenatal care use was significantly associated with the implementation of the National Health Insurance (NHI). A higher likelihood of adequate care utilization was found among women who were married or employed, had a higher level of education, had more experience with regard to pregnancy and were at higher risk in terms of obstetrics. The effect of facility choice showed variations after the implementation of the NHI programme. Prior to NHI, no differences were noted between the use of clinics and hospitals. After the implementation of NHI, on the other hand, women who received most of their care from clinics had a higher likelihood of receiving more adequate prenatal care than those who received care from hospitals. Regional differences in seeking adequate prenatal care were also evident. Mothers who were living in southern areas were less likely to receive adequate prenatal care despite the implementation of NHI. The Bureau of NHI, therefore, still needs to work on mechanisms to ensure that more attention is given to the distribution of its medical resources and that additional health care accessibility is provided to pregnant women in these areas.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Out-of-home activities are engaged within time – space prisms, but the prisms themselves are unobservable. In this paper, stochastic frontier models with observed departure and arrival times as dependent variables are formulated to locate time – space prism vertices. Two possible distributions often used in frontier models for one-sided disturbance terms, the half-normal distribution and exponential distribution, are examined better to represent observed behavior. The locations of morning prism origin vertices and evening prism terminal vertices on working days and nonworking days are estimated with an empirical dataset obtained in southeast Florida. The results suggest that the exponential distribution has a better goodness of fit, but the coefficient estimates of explanatory variables are similar between models with the two distributions, suggesting that the model parameter estimates are robust regardless of the assumptions regarding the distribution of the one-sided random disturbance. It is found that the average heights of the morning prism before work and the evening prism after work on working days are estimated at about 2.5 hours and about 3 hours, respectively. It is also found that part-time workers have prism heights that are on average larger by half an hour than those of full-time workers on working days, and smaller by 1.5 hours on nonworking days. </jats:p>",

A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> area centered on the Washington-Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application. </jats:p>",

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems offer distinct advantages in this new business environment as they lower operating costs, reduce cycle times and (arguably) increase customer satisfaction. This study examines, via an exploratory survey of 26 companies, the underlying reasons why companies choose to convert from conventional information systems (IS) to ERP systems and the changes brought in, particularly in the accounting process. The aim is not only to understand the changes and the benefits involved in adopting ERP systems compared with conventional IS, but also to establish the best way forward in future ERP applications. The empirical evidence confirms a number of changes in the accounting process introduced with the adoption of ERP systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The city of Venice, from at least the 16th century, has been popularly portrayed as a ‘fantasmatic’ scene of desire by a Western geographical imagination. I argue that these representational strategies closely parallel the homology and practice of Orientalism, most notably documented by Edward Said. Said's argument, however, pays precious little attention to the ‘connective imperative’ at work between colonial powers, a gendered erotics of knowledge, and heteronormative practices. Focusing on Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice and Ian McEwan's more recent book The Comfort of Strangers, I argue that both authors continue an ‘erotics of composition’—the historical practice of framing, ordering, and composing Venice in gendered, heterosexist terms—which bolsters a series of stereotypes about the licentious behavior of ‘Orientals’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For Monte Carlo treatment planning it is essential to model efficiently patient dependent beam modifying devices, e.g., Multi‐Leaf Collimators (MLC). Therefore a Monte Carlo geometry tracking procedure is presented allowing the simulation of photon and electron transport through these devices within short calculation time. The tracking procedure is based on elemental regions, on surfaces (mainly planes) to separate the regions as well as on bit patterns and bit masks to identify the regions. Photon cross sections for photoelectric absorption, Compton scattering and pair production as well as electron stopping powers and ranges are provided by the Physical Reference Data of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The tracking procedure is implemented in <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0734-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0734:mp0734-math-0001\" /> with object‐oriented design based on <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0734-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0734:mp0734-math-0002\" /> class hierarchies and inheritance. Using the geometry technique, several MLC models are constructed. Some of them take into account tongue‐and‐groove effects as well as curved leaf ends. The models are integrated into the Monte Carlo dose calculation engine XVMC for treatment planning. The system is tested by comparing different MLC implementations and by verification with measurement.</jats:p>",

To conduct this investigation, we use engagement partners' assessments of their existing clients made during the participating public accounting firm's client continuance risk assessment process. We find that auditors plan increased effort and billing rates for clients with earnings manipulation risk, and that the positive relationships between earnings manipulation risk and both effort and billing rates are greater for clients that also have heightened corporate governance risk. These findings provide evidence that auditors assess situations involving both an aggressive management and inadequate corporate governance, and that there is a relationship between those assessments and auditors' planning and pricing decisions.</jats:p>",

The main challenge in dealing with operator allocation is the fact that operators tend to be more qualitative than quantitative, which renders traditional mathematical techniques inadequate. The scheduling model presented in this article takes into consideration the competency of selected and allocated operators. Also presented in this article is a new planning model to determine optimal scheduling time horizons on normal and penalized (holiday or weekend) days, concomitant with the corresponding shift patterns. The difference in basic and overtime payment is taken into account to determine the length of working time of each operator on a given day. Associated with the length of working time is the appropriate shift pattern, given that very long hours may justify more than one shift. The resultant integrated planning and scheduling model is decomposed by exploiting its block angular structure. © 2004 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 50: 999–1016, 2004</jats:p>",

In particular, the author scrutinises whether or not prefirm activities are spatially confined, and which mechanisms are involved in such firm-formation processes. Resting the analysis on the empirical example of firms located in Sweden, Ohio, and Massachusetts, the findings indicate that, even though international components are important, the process of firm formation is indeed a geographically delimited activity. In this, experimentation is essential, the direction and volume of the science base may have large impacts, and structural characteristics in the geographical setting are important. The discussion centres on how to spur clustering of firm formation as opposed to mere colocation of new units, where mechanisms include organisational concentration, application interrelatedness, and a spatially confined search process. The firms in the three regions differ: between the firms in Sweden and Massachusetts there are synergies due to geographical proximity and interdependence, knowledge spillovers, and encouragement of innovation within the group of firms, whereas this is not the case in Ohio. Indeed, in Ohio, the mechanisms which are important in creating an innovative cluster do not seem to be as effective. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the application of pixel‐based intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using the step‐and‐shoot delivery method, one major difficulty is the prolonged delivery time. In this study, we present an integrated IMRT planning system that involves a simple smoothing method to reduce the complexity of the beam profiles. The system consists of three main steps: (a) an inverse planning process based on a least‐square dose‐based cost function; (b) smoothing of the intensity maps; (c) reoptimization of the segment weights. Step (a) obtains the best plan with the lowest cost value using a simulated annealing optimization algorithm with discrete intensity levels. Step (b) takes the intensity maps obtained from (a) and reduces the complexity of the maps by smoothing the adjacent beamlet intensities. During this process each beamlet is assigned a structure index based on anatomical information. A smoothing update is applied to average adjacent beamlets with the same index. To control the quality of the plan, a predefined clinical protocol is used as an acceptance criterion. The smoothing updates that violate the criterion are rejected. After the smoothing process, the segment weights are reoptimized in step (c) to further improve the plan quality. Three clinical cases were studied using this system: a medulloblastoma, a prostate cancer, and an oropharyngeal carcinoma. While the final plans demonstrate a degradation of the original plan quality, they still meet the plan acceptance criterion. On the other hand, the segment numbers or delivery times are reduced by 40%, 20%, and 20% for the three cases, respectively.</jats:p>",

An evaluation of this assignment is presented, based on the findings of a survey instrument distributed to the students at the end of the module. Data were collected on students’ domain knowledge and transferable skills acquired as a result of undertaking the task. Analysis of the data suggests that the task was an effective learning tool for the students in acquiring domain knowledge and transferable skills appropriate to learning about, and for the practice of, e-business and e-commerce.

Fifty patients suspected to harbour intracranial aneurysms underwent computed tomographic angiography and surgery. Computed tomographic angiography and surgery findings were compared in terms of presence of and surgically important features required in preoperative planning. The sensitivity of computed tomographic angiography in the detection of aneurysms when compared with surgery was 96%. Out of the 50 aneurysms identified by computed tomographic angiography, computed tomographic angiography findings and surgical observations were in full agreement regarding the location and shape of the aneurysms (kappa = 1.0). The agreement was slightly less in depicting the size of the neck (kappa = 0.967), size of the aneurysm and orientation of the dome (kappa = 0.95). Although digital subtracted angiography is the standard method in the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms, computed tomographic angiography has proved to be of great value in the management of presumed aneurysm patients.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Simulated annealing (SA) is a multivariate combinatorial optimization process that searches the configuration space of possible solutions by a random walk, guided only by the goal of minimization of the objective function. The decision‐making capabilities of a fuzzy inference system are applied to guide the SA search, to look for solutions which, in addition to optimizing a plan in dosimetric terms, also present some clinically desirable spatial features. No <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> constraints are placed on the number or position of needles or on the seed loading sequence of individual needles. These additional degrees of freedom are balanced by giving preference to consider plans with seed distributions that are balanced in the right/left and anterior/posterior halves in each axial slice, and with local seed density that is about uniform. Piecewise linear membership functions are constructed to represent these requirements. Before a step in the random search is subject to the SA test, the expert functions representing the spatial seed‐distribution requirements are evaluated. Thus, the expert planner's knowledge enters into the decision as to the “goodness” of a seed configuration regarding the spatial seed‐distribution goals. When a step in the random walk yields a seed configuration that is found wanting, a specific number of additional steps in the local neighborhood is attempted until either improvement in the spatial requirements is achieved, or the allowed number of attempts is exhausted. In the latter case, the expert system desists and the unfavorable step is taken, moving on to the simulated annealing test. The number of attempts is determined by the fuzzy logic inference engine and depends on just how badly the expert requirement is not met. The program is interfaced with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) to import optimized seed plans for isodose display and analysis. Execution in a 1.5 GHz computer is less than a minute, adequate for real‐time planning. Results for phantom and real patients are dosimetrically comparable to generic methods such as modified peripheral loading, but in some cases, fewer needles and less radioactivity are required. Sensitivity to simulated random seed placement error is similar to manual plans.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we describe an example of an IOS developed as part of a strong inter‐firm relationship. In 1999, Vodafone of the UK embarked on a transformation to globalize its relationship with Ericsson of Sweden, moving from a set of in‐country relationships to a global relationship mediated through an IOS. As of 2002, the IOS is heavily used, and continues to evolve as part of the overall relationship. Vodafone and Ericsson pursued a journey‐oriented approach to globalization and development, freed from any formal project plan, and identified asymmetric benefits. Using a model previously developed by Gallivan &amp; Depledge (2003), we explore the roles and dynamics of trust, planning and benefits. We posit that a journey or improvisational approach to IOS development works where a relationship is strong and levels of inter‐firm trust are high. We suggest that the nature of the inter‐firm relationship is more important than the approach to IOS development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>A quantitative evaluation method for the CIE color‐planning activity within the product design cycle is proposed in this article. The questionnaire‐based process that is traditionally employed to obtain objective color psychology tends to be time‐consuming. Accordingly, this study proposes the use of gray system theory to overcome this problem. In the CIE color system, colors are defined by three primary colors, R (red), G (green), and B (blue). Using these three principal hues with fixed equigap sequences to simulate specific basic color samples is an efficient means of investigating unicolor images on a personal computer. However, a gray relational generating operation can be used to simulate colors beyond these basic samples and to predict the corresponding membership values for semantic words. In addition, the gray clustering operation is introduced to predict the overall color image evaluation of multicolored products. The predicted evaluation results of the gray system theory and a back‐propagation neural network are both compared with experimentally verified results. The results indicate that the gray forecasting model is the more effective means of predicting the image evaluation, and therefore, the method is adopted within the color‐planning activity. Although this study takes the example of the Internet‐aided color planning of a baby walker as a case study, the proposed method can also be used on other products. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forests are complex systems with forest ecosystem, resource, stakeholder and policy subsystems. Knowledge about forest systems is always incomplete, and uncertainty pervades decision-making. Forest planning should account for complexity and address uncertainty, using feedback on past outcomes to inform future planning. Complexity in the forest system and uncertainty in planning have a spatial dimension, which can be represented and analyzed using geographic information systems (GIS). These principles apply to both strategic and operational planning. In this paper we present a GIS-based method for spatially analyzing forest planning outcomes and uncertainty (SAFEPLAN). Results obtained for a southeastern BC case study show how this method can be used to identify specific sources of uncertainty and remedies for improving the effectiveness of operational forest planning. Anticipating the effects of recurring events on plan outcomes will increase effectiveness of operational planning and will improve the ability of forest managers to achieve the desired results. Key words: uncertainty, risk, forest planning, geographic information system, natural disturbance </jats:p>",

They are also investment vehicles which can be used to secure financial gains as economies expand. Housing markets embrace both these features, and are popular in Britain as a way of maximising residential choice at the same time as protecting and enhancing personal wealth. All markets create winners and losers, but no systematic social differences in either risks or gains are expected. However, this paper shows that, as home ownership has become the British housing norm, people experiencing ill-health are one social group who can struggle to reap its benefits, either as a consumption good or as a financial asset. The way housing markets (currently) work may therefore tend to reinforce the health divide, though this is neither a necessary nor inevitable state of affairs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are many ways in which humans articulate themselves through their ‘spatiality’. One neglected aspect of a historical anthropology of spatial relations and modes of existence concerns the role of the human and social sciences. Drawing on Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's multifaceted distinction between ‘smooth’ space and ‘striated’ space, we propose some ways to analyse the logics of spatialisation at work in the social sciences. We take as case studies the writings of two ‘technicians of space’, Charles Booth and Patrick Geddes, together with some of their contemporaries. The paper is intended as a contribution not to the ‘history of ideas' but to contemporary debates about human spatiality. Whilst some postmodern ‘affirmations' of space counterpose abstract disciplinary ‘striated’ technologies of spatial regulation to nonabstractionist ‘smooth’ modes of spatiality, we take a different perspective. In doing so, we suggest some non-‘historical’ uses to which we might put the history of the social sciences today. We also try to demonstrate some of the merits of an empiricist approach rather than a postmodernist approach to questions of spatiality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the postwar period the modern family home assumed a special place in the Australian imaginary. Women achieved a greater public presence in this context, reflected in calls to Australian housewives to think about how their ideal home would look. The ‘new look’ required of the national home was addressed to its occupants, the Australian family, and was articulated through both government policy discourses and the popular media. Planning for and dreaming about modernity became key activities of homemaking. The requirements of women, in particular, to dream and plan for the future family produced the housewife as a modern figure responsible for the planning of a successful future for her family. The modern challenge to make home anew spoke to women's authority on day-to-day living, moving the efficient arrangement of the home and its public exposure firmly into their domain. However, this new, mass-mediated way of looking at domesticity created a contradiction in female domestic subjectivity. On the one hand, both state and market discourses suggested that women could sweep away the elements of traditional, particularly prewar, home designs that bound them to the home. On the other, popular magazines also placed a great deal of emphasis on the look of things and on looking itself, further inscribing women's identity within domestic space. We argue through a case study of the figure of the housewife in Australian home magazines that as a result of this contradiction during this period the identity of ‘housewife’ came to offer a new, reflexive relationship between female selfhood and home. Via the domestication of modernity in terms of gender, previous divisions between the public and private were destabilised. We suggest that the housewife's gaze both towards the home and towards her ‘domestic self’ intensified the problematic of feminity, putting it on the threshold of public and private space, offering a critical, enabling position for an ensuing feminist analysis. </jats:p>",

In this paper we argue that this tells only part of the story, as where there is speed there is also slowness. The mid-20th-century redevelopment of Coventry in the United Kingdom serves to illustrate this: the technocentric conceptions of timespace that became dominant in this period bequeathed a city that sped up for some, but slowed down for others. These differential mobilities indicate the speed politics underpinning the redevelopment of Coventry in the postwar era, with the city centre increasingly moving to the rhythms imposed by a bureaucratic elite. Noting these rhythms were nonetheless subject to interruptions that undermined this spatial and temporal order, we conclude that geographers must be attentive to the uneven production of both space and time to grasp fully the ambivalence of modernity. </jats:p>",

Even if the federal government was the original policymaker, several provinces added their own incentives in order to nurture a local industry. Although policies have been changing in scope and goals, the results have been positive and the country has acquired a certain leadership in several biotechnologies.

Theories from evolutionary economics and innovation studies are used to address questions related to the local–national–international dimensions of innovations. The concept of ‘environmental selection pressures’ is proposed, as one way to make sense of the differing patterns of firm formation, technological specialisation, and innovation. Preliminary evidence about developments in biotechnology-pharmaceuticals in Sweden and Australia is presented, to exemplify the conceptualisation and develop appreciative theorising. The paper concludes with implications for government policy as well as areas for future research. </jats:p>",

Foreign spillovers will be mainly from trade with other regions or countries.

A repair index was presented to consider reliability updating after repair. The reliability updating after inspection and repair was performed by using the Bayesian updating method. A decision tree was established for selecting the optimal inspection and repair strategy for ship structures. By comparing the expected costs associated with different inspection and repair strategies, the smallest expected cost associated with the inspection and repair strategy can be identified as the optimal one. Based on this, a method was proposed to determine the sensitivities of both optimal inspection and repair strategy. Furthermore, some formulae were derived to analyze the sensitivities. A numerical example was investigated to illustrate the process of selecting the optimal inspection and repair strategy. The results show that the decision tree method is very effective. Furthermore, different values of various costs have significant effects on the reliability and stability of decision results.</jats:p>",

Basically, it deals with two questions: the detector size effect and the heterogeneity dose calculation. The author analyzes both the metrological and computational effects and its clinical implications by simulation of the radiotherapy treatments in a treatment planning system. The detector size effect leads up to smoothing of the radiation profile increasing the penumbra (20%–80%) and beam fringe (50%–90%) values with the consequent clinical effect of over‐irradiation of the organs at risk close to the planning target volume (PTV). In this thesis this problem is analyzed finding mathematical solutions based on profile deconvolution or the use of radiation detectors of adequate size. On the other side, the author analyzes the dose computation on heterogeneous media by the superposition algorithms versus classical algorithms. The derived conclusion from this thesis is that in locations like lung and breast, the classical algorithms lead to a significant underdosage of the PTV with an important decrease of tumor control probability (TCP). On this basis, the author does not recommend the clinical use of these algorithms in the mentioned tumor locations.</jats:p>",

For example, 60% of all new homes in England are now expected to be constructed on previously developed land or provided through the conversion of existing buildings. As speculative housebuilders are responsible for about 80% of all new dwellings built in the United Kingdom, the achievement of this important government target is critically dependent on the ability and willingness of the private sector to respond to public policy. By exploring the main components of the residential development process, the author investigates how far speculative housebuilding will need to change to ensure the successful implementation of the government's brownfield housing target. He suggests that those speculative housebuilders that are enthusiastically building up core competencies in brownfield housing are likely to emerge as the market leaders of the future whereas those companies that continue to rely on past practices and technologies will face an uncertain future as greenfield development opportunities begin to reduce. </jats:p>",

Reliability centered maintenance with statistical methods may allow the time between costly scheduled overhauls to be increased.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the failure‐time relationship of the ALCO 251 marine diesel propulsion engine operated on <jats:italic>Reliance</jats:italic> class cutters. This analysis used exponential, Weibull, and three‐part composite Weibull failure density functions to model engine casualty data dating back to 1978. The data does not indicate the source of the engine failure, but every failure had a significant operational impact. Results indicate an increasing failure rate as the engine ages to the 24,000 hour overhaul time. The evidence indicates a constant failure useful life region, but the increasing failure rate from the Weibull models suggests that the periodic over‐hauls do not prevent wearout failures. As a result, the Coast Guard should consider refining diesel engine overhaul policy in order to prevent increasing age‐related failures.</jats:p>",

The model represents construction sites as partially known and partially unknown. Considering technological reality, spatial location accuracy constraints, and economical efficiency, only the essential boundary information is included in the known environment and modeled as a cell system and network. The cell system is a geometric object and provides the domain for path planning. The network is a topological object for computing the shortest path. Global and local planners are required for path planning to get the full benefits of the spatial model. The global planner computes the shortest path and provides it to the local planner as a sequence of vertices (subgoals). While following the subgoals, the local planner modifies the shortest path to avoid unknown obstacles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim in this paper is to consider several interweaving narratives on Kensal House, which was the first housing estate inspired by Modern architecture to be built in Britain, opening in 1936. The analysis focuses on the ways in which architectural theory and everyday life collided at Kensal House—which is situated in Ladbroke Grove, North Kensington, London—through a reading of the theories, ideas, and ideals of the designers of the spaces combined with the often neglected narrative of the intended users of these domestic environments, the first inhabitants of the block. The paper offers an analysis of Modern architecture from two contrasting yet often complementary standpoints, considering Kensal House both as an ‘urban village’, as the architects called it, and as the ‘white house’, as it became known by residents of North Kensington. Particular focus will be made on the ways in which people responded to the striking domestic modernities of these blocks. Whereas some conventional narratives seem to argue that the architects had an isolated set of views which were simplistically imposed on their consumers, the argument here is that the relationship was rather more blurred and messy, with a constant dialogue among the interested parties. The debates concerning these spaces are polyvocal, including many, often marginalised, voices in the historical narrative of Modern architecture. Consequently, what is produced here is a complex, and often contradictory, tale—a thick description of home. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the late 1970s retail parks have developed in the United Kingdom to become a substantial element of the process of retail decentralisation. From an early focus on ‘bulky-goods' retailing, they have grown and evolved into a variety of unplanned and planned forms, the largest of which can be characterised as ‘hybrid regional centres’. The more recent addition of typical ‘high-street’ retailers to their functions has earned the epithet ‘fashion parks’. Intermittent concern has been expressed at the likely negative effects that these phenomena are having on the traditional system of city, town, and district shopping centres in British cities. In these circumstances it is surprising that little of the recent retail impact research has focused on the larger retail parks. Partially to redress this deficiency, the authors investigate the impact of a large unplanned retail park on the retail system of the Greater Swansea area. The evidence suggests that the greatest impact continues to be focused on the middle-order district and local town centres. The relationship is now ‘strongly competitive’ rather than ‘benignly complementary’. At the same time, the growth in scale and functional diversity of the retail park suggests a strong ‘competitive erosion’ of the status of the city centre. Thus, local authorities concerned for the future of their city, town, and district shopping centres should view processes operating within the shopping centre development industry in association with the location and marketing strategies of the principal ‘high-street’ multiple retailers with considerable caution.</jats:p>",

In this language, transitions between states of knowledge can be described, rather than transitions between completely described states of the world, which makes the language well suited for planning under incomplete knowledge. Furthermore, our formalism enables the use of default principles in the planning process by supporting negation as failure. Nonetheless, K also supports the representation of transitions between states of the world (i.e., states of complete knowledge) as a special case, which shows that the language is very flexible. As we demonstrate on particular examples, the use of knowledge states may allow for a natural and compact problem representation. We then provide a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of K, and consider different planning problems, including standard planning and secure planning (also known as\n            <jats:italic>conformant planning</jats:italic>\n            ) problems. We show that these problems have different complexities under various restrictions, ranging from NP to NEXPTIME in the propositional case.

The paper examines the institutional response to the crisis and the subsequent inquiries. Drawing on the ‘garbage-can model’ of organisational choice and ideas of ‘policy framing’, it argues that the institutional response to FMD was tightly focused on agricultural interests. Subsequently, a compartmentalised approach to lesson learning has been partial in its coverage. The result is that important lessons, of a more holistic and integrated nature, have been overlooked despite the replacement of the Ministry of Agriculture with a new Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Innovation—the social process of developing, adapting, and adopting new technologies and products into the economy and society—is being driven by increasingly intensive use of knowledge. Although knowledge is often considered inherently nonrival and nonexcludable, increasing complexity has combined with new private property rights mechanisms to erect barriers to use. One approach to overcoming the challenge of accessing and using knowledge has been for firms and other actors to cluster geographically in a few locations around the world, in order to capture scale and scope economies. This paper offers a theoretical explanation for this agglomeration, examines the extent of clustering in the agricultural biotechnology industry, and investigates one specific cluster—in Saskatoon, Canada—that has sustained success in generating successive innovation. Preliminary results indicate that clusters appear to be prevalent in areas where knowledge is diffuse, complicated, and actively protected. Finally, our results also suggest that regional knowledge management is enhanced through an optimal number of actors operating within the parameters of seven defined cluster-based functions: three primary (science, technology and collective) and four mixed or hybrid activities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the ways that traditional definitions of masculinity are challenged within the domestic space of the volunteer firehouse. Our aim is to blur the dichotomies of public–private, masculine–feminine, heroic–weak, and moral–immoral. By examining practices associated with being a volunteer firefighter we present deeper and expanded notions of what it means to be a man in this context. Volunteer firefighters create a private space within the firehouse that offers escape from the public demands of masculinity. It is within this space that they can receive and give comfort and experience bonding, friendship, and a deep sense of belonging by embracing emotions normally off limits to men, including self-disclosure, familiarity, and affection. Although acknowledging the masculine hegemony that constructs men's involvement in firefighting and the firehouse, we also highlight the emotional work done by men as they engage in their public and private firefighting roles. </jats:p>",

All vehicles, friendly and adversarial, are assumed to be aircraft. Unlike the typical target tracking problem that uses the linear state and nonlinear output dynamics, a set of aircraft nonlinear dynamics is used in this work. Target state information is estimated in order to integrate into a path planning framework. The objective is to fly from a start point to a goal in a highly dynamic, uncertain environment with multiple friendly and adversarial vehicles, without collision. The estimation architecture proposed is consistent with most path planning methods. Here, the path planning approach is based on evolutionary computation technique which is then combined with a nonlinear extended set membership filter in order to demonstrate a unified approach. A cooperative estimation approach among friendly vehicles is shown to improve speed and routing of the path. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

We argue that the relationship between knowledge and trust helps to explain the evolution of financial services and the production over time of distinctive ecologies of financial service production and use. We discuss the changing scales of financial knowledge and trust in relation to the evolution of the UK financial services industry. We identify two idealised ecologies and networks of retail financial services. The middle-class suburb represents an ecology and network of privilege within the contemporary retail financial services market. It displays relatively high levels of aggregate knowledge about the financial system and constitutes an important part of the retail financial services network, with strong and frequent connections to the financial services industry as a whole. Poor inner-city areas and peripheral local authority housing estates, meanwhile, have very different financial ecologies. Areas of relative deprivation and poverty, they constitute ‘relic’ financial ecologies that have been bypassed and mostly ignored by the mainstream financial services industry. They are colonised by a distinctive set of financial institutions that include firms that operate door-to-door. We look at the formation and evolution of these ecologies over time and discuss the potential of enriching the ecology of the poor inner-city and peripheral local authority housing estate through public policy. </jats:p>",

In particular, we address the registration between preoperative imaging and the intraoperative patient model, as well as between the patient and the robot. Two different registration methods are used and their accuracies compared.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Tudor Hart's 1971 study, based in Wales, was the first to hypothesise the existence of an inverse relationship which often prevails between those communities with the most pressing health needs and the lack or poor quality of health services provided locally. Over the last thirty years there have been many demonstrations of the validity of Hart's ‘inverse care law’ in relation to the provision of, and access to, particular services in the primary and secondary health care sectors. In this paper we provide a direct test of the relationship between an aggregate measure of quality of general practitioner (GP) services and a measure of health need of local populations. We examine the variation in quality of GP services, derived from eligibility for sustained quality payments, over the 131 practices of the former Bro Taf Health Authority in South Wales. Using logit regression analysis we have explored the extent to which the local deprivation of practice populations and the size of practice account for the variation in the quality of provision within the authority. The analysis supports the conclusion that the ‘inverse care law’ is a strong feature of provision. Both the eligibility of GP practices for quality payments and the availability of training practices are significantly higher in the least deprived wards than those in the most deprived ones. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Environmental surrogates (land classes) for the distribution of biodiversity are increasingly being used for conservation planning. However, data that demonstrate coincident patterns in land classes and biodiversity are limited. We ask the overall question, “Are land systems effective surrogates for the spatial configuration of biodiversity for conservation planning?” and we address three specific questions: (1) Do different land systems represent different biological assemblages? (2) Do biological assemblages on the same land system remain similar with increasing geographic separation? and (3) Do biological assemblages on the same land system remain similar with increasing land system isolation? Vascular plants, invertebrates, and microbiota were surveyed from 24 sites in four land systems in arid northwest New South Wales, Australia. Within each land system, sites were located to give a hierarchy of inter‐site distances, and land systems were classified as either “low isolation” (large and continuous) or “high isolation” (small patches interspersed among other land systems).</jats:p><jats:p>Each type of land system supported components of biodiversity either not found, or found infrequently, on other land systems, suggesting that land systems function as surrogates for biodiversity, and that conservation‐area networks representing land‐system diversity will also represent biological diversity. However, the majority of taxa were found on more than one land‐system type, suggesting that a large proportion of the plant, arthropod, and microbial biodiversity may be characterized by widespread species with low fidelity to particular land systems. Significant relationships between geographic distance among sites and differences among assemblages were revealed for all taxa except the microbiota. Therefore, as sites on the same land system were located farther apart, the assemblages at those sites became more different. This finding strongly suggests that conservation planning based on land‐system diversity should also sample the geographic range occupied by each land system. Land‐system isolation was not revealed to be a significant source of variation in assemblage composition. Our research finds support for environmental surrogates for biodiversity in conservation planning, specifically the use of land systems and similarly derived land classifications. However, the need for explicit modeling of geographic distance in conservation planning is clearly indicated.</jats:p>",
