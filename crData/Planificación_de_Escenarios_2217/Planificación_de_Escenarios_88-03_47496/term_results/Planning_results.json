Many of us had just read Walter Kiechel's <jats:italic>Fortune</jats:italic> article about “Smart Corporate Strategy for the 1990s” (February 29, 1988), which presents a remarkable reversal of the publication's skeptical attitude toward strategic management thinking. As a result, I felt the conference theme, selected by its organizer, Walter Schaffir, was made to order for our turbulent times. If my colleagues and I are to keep our jobs in the next decade, we really need to learn all we can about “Getting Value from Strategic Planning!”</jats:p>",

Over the last two decades, forest planning research has emphasized modeling and computational issues of linear programming, rather than it uses for valuation and economic analysis. This paper shows that postoptimal activity analysis provides an effective tool for economic valuation of multiple-resource outputs and production factors. Marginal value curves are easily derived for both market and nonmarket outputs, and for production factors. This and other information are useful in comparing production alternatives and provide a basis for the economic rationale currently sought in multiple-use planning. Also, an efficient joint cost allocation scheme is proposed for use as an accounting system to track efficiency of production for market goods and to audit for rational evaluation of nonmarket goods.

Management is inevitably concerned with the factors causing deviations between the static budget and the actual results. A thorough understanding of these deviations is vital if the budgeting process is to provide the expected benefits in the areas of planning and control. The problem is that superficial analysis often leads to specious explanations, or worse, that management never fully comprehends what caused the gap. We propose using a variance analysis framework to explain these deviations and to improve managerial control and effective decision making.</jats:p>",

The basic structure has not changed and the nature of the relationships between the capitalist mode of production (as the main component of the core) and the village-based mode of production (as a typical mode of the periphery) are supporting the already polarized economic pattern. The current major mechanisms which operate to maintain the basic structure are the pattern of capital allocation, internal migration, the preservation of the village mode of production, and the monopolistic position of the core. These major mechanisms do not differ significantly from past mechanisms although the specific details may vary somewhat. Changes within the structure may occur through a transformation process, in which some basic modification in the production relations and the production forces of the village mode of production may occur. This is regarded as progress and may improve the position of the periphery in relation to the core but does not cause any change of the basic structure. </jats:p>",

In this paper an extension of the spatial price equilibrium model is presented, in which attempts are made to overcome the poor predictive capabilities of this model by imbedding it within a gravity model representation of interregional flows. After the conceptual framework of this model is stated, a variational inequality formulation is presented and this formulation is then used to derive a convex mathematical programming statement of this model. Solution algorithms and sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium solution are discussed, and in the conclusion to the paper a discussion of the extensions of this model are presented which incorporate multiple commodities and imperfect competition in the regional commodity markets. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this essay we examine the connection between a crisis in the American political economy and the recurrence of industrial crisis which imperil the health, safety and welfare of Americans and others affected by U.S.-based in dustrial operations. The crisis of the political economy (manifested by uneven growth rates, polarization, voter cynicism and other indicators) arises from the need for increased coordination and planning of economic and industrial ac tivity. This planning threatens elite control and undermines the ideology of laissez faire economics which legitimates the prevailing order. Weak planning and an unstable political consensus are natural results of this contradiction. A system which we call metaplanning (planning without planning) has evolved in response to this impasse. The early sections of the paper deal with the imple mentation of new industrial policies which are the core of metaplanning, dem onstrating how these policies simultaneously enhance systemic capacities for coordination while reassuring the public that the traditional American aver sion to strong government is being upheld. The implication of metaplanning for industrial crises are examined in a final section. We argue that metaplan ning facilitates private investment in profit rather than safety, early commer cialization of new technologies which shifts risks onto the public, and distorts democratic processes and goals in the public management of industrial hazards. </jats:p>",

Nancy Melin Nelson has defined two types of CD‐ROM products for the library market. The first is designed as a support tool for automation activities, such as cataloging and public access systems. The Library Corporation's BiblioFile and Intelligent Catalog products are examples. The other type, and the one on which this article will focus, provides unlimited access to databases previously produced in an online and/or paper format (i.e., reference databases). Librarians have been relatively quick to accept CD‐ROM as a viable alternative or companion to their online databases. CD‐ROM technology has even afforded some libraries their first encounter with automated reference databases. Experience has taught us, however, that incorporating CD‐ROM reference systems is not as simple as many vendors would have librarians believe. Planning for the new technology is vital. This article will examine four areas of planning that should be addressed before a well‐informed decision to purchase can be made: hardware, database(s), search and retrieval software, and user education.</jats:p>",

It is argued that the growth in female labor-force participation, the fact of occupational sex segregation, and other recent demographic trends have important implications for the social geography of the North American city. With 1980 Census data from the Worcester, MA Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area, the impact of the gender division of labor on urban social space is described; in particular it is shown that occupational segregation is an important source of intraneighborhood class heterogeneity. The final section of the paper is an exploration of the implications of the findings for theories of social reproduction and for class-based urban politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> ‘The NHS needs the ability to move much more quickly’ (The Griffiths Report, 1983, p13) </jats:p><jats:p> This paper grew out of preliminary research undertaken for the research project on which we both work, entitled the Management of Change in the NHS. The project is based in the Centre for Corporate Strategy and Change at the University of Warwick, and is directed by Professor Andrew Pettigrew, who has previously undertaken a longitudinal study of strategic change in ICI (Pettigrew, 1985), and also a pilot study within the NHS which identified the implementation of strategic intent as the jugular problem confronting NHS managers. But a central research problem is why it is that some Health Districts manage to achieve a faster rate of change than others. Hence there was a need to trace the evolution of local systems through time, with the result that the historical analysis of changing is a key aspect of this research. The project is financed jointly by the NHSTA and a consortium of eight of the English Regions and ten case study districts are included. </jats:p><jats:p> The research design focusses on strategic service changes in both the acute and priority group sectors and incorporates developments and contractions. The choice of strategic changes was informed by a detailed review of the most recent regional strategic plans and the review itself prompted this paper. It led us to a number of observations about the content of the change agenda. </jats:p><jats:p> First, there is a high rate of change projected in the current strategic round and earlier studies of incrementalist approaches to change may have to be revised (Hunter, 1980; Ham, 1981). Secondly, these regional change agendas to a great extent reflect national/central policy and the pattern is one of uniformity. These standard agendas include RAWP; the construction of a DGH network; the run-down of long-stay mental illness/handicap hospitals; cost improvements and an increase in health promotion activity. Thirdly, alongside the top-down mechanisms to secure implementation of national objectives, another mode of planning emerges which more closely approaches the concept of ‘local learning’ (Glennester et al, 1983) where organisations seek to explore possible forces for change and how they might respond. Planning here is seen as a means of ‘problem-sensing’ and awareness building (Quinn, 1980) and getting new issues onto the agenda (Pettigrew, 1985). </jats:p><jats:p> The paper will explore the content of the change agenda in detail and the nature of the planning process. It will discuss an alternative methodology, scenario-building and sketches some themes which could form the basis of future health care scenarios. It argues that the standard national agenda is reaching exhaustion and that there is inadequate succession planning for ‘sunrise issues’. </jats:p>",

The assumptions, the implications, and the interrelationships of equity, efficiency, simplicity, and effectiveness are considered, and the question is asked as to whether these criteria together constitute a theory of tax reform. Distinguishing between tax design, which largely abstracts from the practical considerations of political decisionmaking and public acceptance, and tax reform, which confronts these realities, it is concluded that economic criteria by themselves do not constitute a theory of tax reform. Tax reform, it is argued, is essentially concerned with structural changes in a tax system that are achievable in a given set of circumstances. Of necessity, economic criteria often have to be balanced against political judgments about the public acceptability of proposals. Of equal importance, it is shown that second-best choices are inevitable, even in the context of pure tax-design, simply because of the conflicts between the various criteria and the impossibility of meeting the informational requirements of optimal choices. It is also noted that, in the absence of a common denominator, trade-offs between different criteria remain essentially arbitrary. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The public choice approach to tax reform involves a number of distinguishable strands. In the first place, there is a strand in which there is posited a view that taxes emerge, like all other public decisions, from political processes and, therefore, are to be explained in terms of the characteristics of political institutions. In the second place, there is a strand in which it is conceived that taxes are part of the institutional structure, in some way logically prior to other policy choices. One element in this strand is the ‘cost-share’ perspective, in which taxes are seen as analogous to the prices that voters pay for public services. On this view, changes in tax arrangements by altering those prices can be expected to alter public expenditure levels. An alternative element is the ‘Leviathan’ perspective, in which taxes represent the fiscal powers of the state, and in which changes in tax arrangements will alter the extent of these powers and thereby the extent of state expenditure activities. In both these latter perspectives, taxes are to be treated quasi-constitutionally: The institutional arrangements under which tax reforms are decided become an important object of attention. Furthermore, the feedback effects of tax changes on expenditure levels become an explicit part of any proper analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> These various strands are discussed in this paper, and the question is posed as to whether the public choice approach, in whatever variant, can be satisfactorily and coherently ‘tacked on’ to a more orthodox tax-reform line. </jats:p>",

It is shown that the structure of the taxation systems in these countries, in particular the dominating influence of a highly progressive personal income tax, has played a major part in inducing widespread tax avoidance and evasion, and thereby in corrupting and discrediting the tax systems of the countries in question; so that they operate perversely with respect to equity, to efficiency, and to the other objectives of taxation policy. In the paper the author argues that tax effectiveness needs to be elevated to a position of overriding importance in the design of taxation policies; outlines the kinds of reforms which are necessary in order to give effect to generally accepted economic criteria; and discusses the importance of political and other constraints on tax reform. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During 1985, the Labour governments in both Australia and New Zealand proposed a tax mix switch policy in which a broad-based tax on consumption expenditure (at the retail level in Australia, of the value-added type in New Zealand), at a uniform rate, was to provide scope for substantial reduction, by the means of rate reduction, in personal income tax. This major tax reform was to be accompanied, in both countries, by an abandonment of the classical system of company taxation and its replacement by a system of full imputation and the taxation of employee fringe-benefits in the hands of the employer. The tax mix switch part of the proposed tax reforms only went ahead in New Zealand, and in this paper the author investigates the reasons for this phenomenon as an exercise in the political economy of tax reform. Apart from enabling some testing of Prest's hypothesis, that there are advantages for tax reform in a country not having a federal or a written constitution, the required background to this examination is presented, by means of an outline of the fundamentals of the Australian and New Zealand tax systems, and of the proposals put forward for eventual implementation. Likewise the processes by which tax reform was achieved in the two countries are examined, and it is argued that differences in political institutional settings explain the different outcomes. The author also comments on the alternative tax reform strategies which are implicit in the proposals currently being implemented in Australia and New Zealand. </jats:p>",

In both, the party stage has been crucial and policymaking in government has been bedevilled by rash commitments in opposition. In both countries, tax policy has tended to become more open, with the United Kingdom offering rather more scope for Parliamentary input to the policymaking process. In both, pressure groups have exercised a significant influence on the outcome of tax proposals. </jats:p><jats:p> Whilst both countries have had special ad hoc committees on taxation, their influence on policy has been much less than the quality of their reports deserved. </jats:p><jats:p> The new taxes have, themselves, been subject to frequent change and, in some cases, to abolition; the fruits of two decades of feverish activity in tax policymaking are pitifully small. </jats:p>",

The role of income is disaggregated from that of gas usage, dwelling type, dwelling size, and family structure, and found to be less important than some studies would suggest.

Simulation experiments conducted to determine the impact of these decision variables, as well as other important product demand and cost characteristics, on MPS stability are reported.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A general equilibrium, linear programming land-use model formulated in the heritage of Edwin Mills is extended to include a profit-maximizing objective function. This analog of the existing, cost-minimizing formulations in the literature is driven by exogenous export prices rather than by minimum-export requirements. It is demonstrated that the absence of minimum-export constraints results in an optimum corresponding to the exclusive export of the most profitable good. In addition, the outputs of the model are shown to be arbitrarily dependent on assumptions about zone geometry if export prices are high. </jats:p><jats:p> A static, spatially disaggregate version of the model is specified by means of hexagonal land-use zones. Perfect market conditions are assumed and spatial markets identified. Production technologies are of the fixed-coefficient type with constant returns to scale. Import flows are treated explicitly for the first time in a model of this class, and their inclusion is shown to have a significant impact on optimal land-use configurations. </jats:p>",

It is argued that these processes are increasing in importance as a result of deindustrialisation, demographic trends, the activities of the state, and changes in ideology; these forces then being reflected in the operation of the housing market. Marginalised groups in urban society can be categorised through their relationships to three elements of capitalist-patriarchal control, namely economic standards, social norms, and legal codes. Constraints on the residential location and activity spaces of marginal groups are examined by means of case studies of the impoverished elderly, the lesbian community, and down-and-out groups in Paris in the 1980s. </jats:p>",

Explicit methods have the advantage of being able to fully exploit the power of existing mathematical programming algorithms. A disadvantage is the high information burden they place on the decision maker. Implicit (i.e., interactive) methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses: they require less extensive information but do not lend themselves as easily to use with optimizing algorithms. We develop a hybrid implicit/explicit approach that attempts to combine the advantages of both by embedding within the implicit method a procedure that periodically formulates an approximate explicit representation of the multiobjective problem and then solves it optimally without user interaction. Operationally, this requires the frequent solution of two nonlinear programs.</jats:p><jats:p>We also report on the implementation of this method in a forest management decision support system. This is a completely microcomputer‐based implementation currently undergoing field testing for use in planning the timing and intensity of timber harvests on non‐industrial forests in the southeastern United States. The system has been selected as a replacement for an earlier multiobjective program (Harrison and Rosenthal [28]) used by over 1,800 landowners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a prospective study we attempted to define the role of lumbar discography in the investigation of patients with low back pain with or without non-dermatomal pain in the lower limb. The records of 195 patients were studied at least two years after a technically successful operation. Of 137 patients in whom discography had revealed disc disease and provoked symptoms, 89% derived significant and sustained clinical benefit from operation. Of 25 patients whose discs showed morphological abnormality but had no provocation of symptoms on discography only 52% had clinical success. These findings support the continued use of lumbar discography for the investigation of this particular group of patients. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A qualitative social geographical study of a community group's interpretation of rapid urban growth in a free-standing service-class town, Chapel Hill, NC, is reported. The town has a reputation for being a beautiful and comfortable place. This is reflected in its metaphorical description as the ‘Southern Part of Heaven’. Members of the Chapel Hill Alliance of Neighborhoods had developed a strong sense of place in the town. Rapid growth threatened adverse change to elements of that sense of place. These included Chapel Hill's landscape and the life-style available to its residents. The symbolic and structural elements of Alliance members' interpretations of these changes are discussed. </jats:p>",
