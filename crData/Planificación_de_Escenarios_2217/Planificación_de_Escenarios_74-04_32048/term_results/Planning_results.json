Since the model is based on the diffusion model, it can take into account diffusion effects of stack height and spatial distribution of sources. The model, however, does not require so much input data and complex computations as does a diffusion model. In addition to the good features of a proportional model, namely, minimum input requirement and ease of handling, the model explicitly interrelates percentages and amounts of emission reduction with the resulting improvement in air quality. It is applicable for multicategory emission-source situations (for example industrial-residential emission sources) as well as for single-category emission situations (for example automotive emission sources). In the process of model formulation a number of new parameters such as growth factors and relative transfer coefficients are introduced and values of some of these parameters are determined. Several numerical examples are given to illustrate computational procedures and indicate uses of the model in air pollution abatement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a planning model designed to be used by managers of family-planning systems to improve understanding, forecasting, and planning. The macro-flow model describes the patient movement through post-partum and nonpost-partum programs. The flows model the phenomena of: outreach recruitment, continuance, post-partum checkups, switching methods, referral, migration, contraceptive-use experience, private protection, method effectiveness, advertising response, follow up, abortion, and medical services. Strategic variables can be linked to the flow parameters to produce capacity requirements and budgetary implications. The model output includes benefit measures of total active patients, couple years of protection, “births protected,” and unwanted births prevented. The fertility aspects of births prevented are modeled through a nonstationary Markov process submodel that considers demographic phenomena without burdening the basic flow structure. The input procedures used to process patient-visit, outreach, clinic-survey, and experimental data are discussed and some empirical results are reported. The combination of data-based estimates and subjective judgment is done by “fitting” the model to past observed data. Testing and control are done by “tracking” model performance through conditional prediction, diagnosis, and updating. The model is implemented in an on-line, conversational program that facilitates evolutionary model building by allowing the user to specify his model options. The application and testing of the model in the Atlanta Area Family Planning System are discussed and the experiences of managers in using the model to gain new insights, forecasts, budgets, and plans are reported. </jats:p>",

Using input-output relations for production of commodities and labor, and a specific geometry for the transportation network, the model determines an ‘efficient’ land-use pattern and transportation system by solving a linear programming problem. The model incorporates the ‘sunk’ nature of urban capital and shows how this affects the pattern of development in a growing city. From the viewpoint of data requirements and computational complexity it appears that this approach is worth pursuing in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the efforts devoted to Lowry-type simulation models of land use. </jats:p>",

The Törnqvist algorithm for locating multiple facilities was applied to Southwest Argyll, first in standard form. A modified version of the program was then devised with a new searching procedure and a subroutine to accept a complete distance matrix. Comparison of the two procedures showed that the latter gave a more realistic delineation of hinterlands. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A comprehensive community alcoholism program can become viable regardless of the manner in which it is formed, the agencies that may be involved and the number of different sub-systems of service that need to be developed only if there is an effective cohesion of these elements. In this paper, the third in a series on alcoholism planning (1, 2), the advantages and disadvantages of four different approaches to the organization of “comprehensive” (all necessary services) community-based alcoholism services are presented. The selection of a specific concept of organization will depend upon the kinds of agencies involved, the existing services and their relationships and the particular individuals involved in the planning process. These approaches are as follows 1) the “governmental approach”; 2) the “single community agency approach”; 3) the “consortium model approach”; and 4) the “for profit approach”. </jats:p><jats:p> Regardless of which approach is chosen, there are certain substantive issues that transcend any and all of these organizational approaches. Without paying attention to them, those involved in planning will undermine their own ability to successfully implement the chosen organizational approach. Substantive underlying issues discussed include community boards, traditional versus non-traditional approaches to the delivery of alcoholism services, pre-program planning, continuity of care and funding. A “comprehensive” community alcoholism program which includes all services necessary for the information of a total treatment system, must become viable regardless of how it is formed or the number of agencies involved. Unless these multiple elements are integrated, service delivery will be inadequate. Consequently, the development of an administrative structure requires clearly defined lines of communication and responsibility between care-giving agencies, institutions and the community. Effective service delivery and continuity of care are directly related to the administrative structure. </jats:p><jats:p> The specific concept of administrative organization selected will depend upon the kinds of agencies involved, existing services and their relationships and those individuals involved in the planning process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The price of a good prevailing at some local market point may or may not be identical to the price of that same good at another market point. Price differentials over regions depend in part upon the number and locations of firms which sell to these regions, and on the demand curves of buyers. The present paper evaluates the price policy of a firm selling over a set of linearly extended buying points. It derives the optimal spatial prices under alternative assumptions of consumer behavior and demand. It demonstrates mathematically as well as graphically that a spatial monopolist maximizes profits by subdividing his market into economic submarkets, utilizing fob mill prices for some submarkets, and optimal discriminatory prices for the remaining ones. Thus it explains the use of fob pricing over selected distances in a firm's market area notwithstanding the apparently greater profitability of a discriminatory price policy throughout a firm's market space. </jats:p>",

This paper explores the growth of regional health planning in the United States and highlights its important problem areas. The literature of operations-research applications to health planning is reviewed critically with respect to the feasibility of models and the appropriateness of assumptions. Specific problems with the types of studies currently in the literature are identified and recommendations are made for improved coordination between operations-research workers and health planners. </jats:p>",

Increasing demands on our finite water resources make it more vital that programs get off the shelf and are acted upon. There is a gap between our intentions for and OUI results from the planning process. We should examine our failures, identify causes, and learn from them. One of the primary causes is failure to identify the potentials of the implementing agencies early in the planning process. These agencies constitute a hierarchy of governmental units at national, state, regional and local levels. Each of these levels has its own interests, point of view, capabilities and constraints. A plan which is technically and functionally sound can fail as a program if these conflicting interests are not accounted for. The implementation mechanisms must be identified as an initial phase of the planning process. All levels of the governmental hierarchy must be involved throughout the planning process. The successful plan must also provide for suitable assignment of responsibilities which are accepted by the executing agency and monitored for satisfactory fulfillment. Consistency and continuity of the advocate agency are further essential elements to the success of the plan. Experience in water resource management planning has shown that these strategies will produce programs which are accepted, implemented and accomplish the goals and objectives of the planning process.</jats:p>",
