Eleven simulators developed from a synthesis of published literature for seven major timber types serve to demonstrate program capability. Input data include initial stand conditions, prospective harvest schedules, and simple financial factors. Output consists of brief reports summarizing forecasted volume yield and simulated cash flows occurring over a planning horizon. Sensitivity analysis is possible for several decision criteria, including present net worth and internal rate of return.</jats:p>",

This article highlights the findings of the author's study of regional planning for CT Scanner diffusion, and draws the implication that the existing system of planning and certificate-of-need regulation has been only marginally successful because of the absence of a proper incentive system. Under the reform proposal, an annual dollar limit would be placed on the capital expenditures that could be approved for future Medicare-Medicaid reimbursement. This limitation would create a set of incentives leading to close community scrutiny of capital expenditures, and would allow changes in the institutional structure of regional planning to create greater public accountability.</jats:p>",

By maintaining a sharp distinction between the behavioural and statistical aspects of entropy, various submodels may be formulated to generate the most probable pattern of individual choice behaviour. It may nevertheless be possible to regard each submodel of activity as an essential component of some larger, more complex macromodel of the entire economy. Various forms of (simultaneous or sequential) macromodels could then be investigated by examining alternative linkage arrangements between the behavioural submodels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A procedure is discussed for comparing two rectangular n × m data matrices. The two matrices would typically represent data on the same n objects (for example, cities or subjects) and the same m attributes (for example, crime rates or attitudinal variables). An index that measures the degree to which both matrices are similar is presented along with a significance testing strategy that takes into account the possible dependency among the m attributes. To illustrate the strategy, a numerical example is given that compares the seven index crime rates for a set of twenty standard metropolitan statistical areas for the years 1976 and 1977. In addition to giving several possible generalizations of the basic comparison method, including a natural procedure for comparing three or more data matrices, we show in some detail how the matrix comparison strategy encompasses and extends the work of Tjøtheim on measuring association for spatially related variables. </jats:p>",

Learning energy is defined to be a major behavioural force and a statistical model is proposed for its distribution over an assembly of decisionmakers. An attitude system is derived for a social network where the decisionmaker can be in a unitary state of utility or disutility. The resulting partition function shows that the learning energy of the assembly is derived from nearest-neighbour interactions and the operation of an external place utility preference field. A positive linear relationship is proposed between learning energy and environmental stress. The critical stress in social interaction is determined and a variety of behaviours in urban sociology are predicted. The model is then applied to a Markov learning system and the results discussed. </jats:p>",

But the steady state condition he uses to solve his model was shown by Okabe to be mathematically inconsistent with the basic postulates of the model. Okabe is correct as long as the difference between individual city size and total population is small. But when t (total number of population units) is only moderately larger than i (individual city size), as it always would be in actual applications of this model, Simon's steady state assumption is found to be very reasonable. Thus, users of the Simon model need not concern themselves with the fine points and complexities of Okabe's exposition since Simon's steady state assumption holds for any value of t that might be empirically observed. </jats:p>",
