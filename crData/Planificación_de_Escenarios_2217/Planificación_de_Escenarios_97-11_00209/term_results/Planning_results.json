      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning in rural resource-dependent regions increasingly involvesfinding the appropriate balance between market and nonmarket land uses. In the case offorest-dependent regions, the controversyfocuses on the use of private and publicforest lands for a combination of extractive and tourism-related activities. Timber management and harvesting constitute the extractive dimension, whereas the alternative dimension includes such activities as huntingfishing, camping, and simple aesthetic enjoyment. The intrinsic difficulty associated with this searchfor balance can be traced to the measurement criteria for costs and benefits, which easily accommodate market uses, but not nonmarket uses such as tourism-related activities. Thus, a principal planning challenge is to incorporate into the analysis a more comprehensive accounting of costs and benefits so that the social welfare impacts of a particular rural development strategy can be more completely understood. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Citizens and local officials have become increasingly inclined to acceptfiscal arguments as the basisfor land use decisions, and planners have increasingly usedfiscal impact studies as an argument for growth management. However, as an increasing number of studies have found that most forms of development arefiscally unbeneficial, it is no longer clear that the answers fiscal studies are producing are leading to constructive conclusions. Planners, environmentalists, and proponents of the \"taxpayers revolt\" have concluded from recent fiscal impact studies that growth is undesirable. This probably says more about the \"taxpayers' revolt,\" the changing structure of publicfinance, and changing attitudes toward development and the environment than it does about the desirability or undesirability of development. Fiscal impact research can and should be more informative and should increase public understanding of the consequences of alternative land use policies and fiscal approaches to paying for infrastructure and facilities related to new development. Toward that end, this article proposes a number of specific ways to makefiscal impact research educationally useful and informative. </jats:p>",

Monocentric urban density analysis is usefulfor understanding present population distributions and service needs. Public transportation and other services centered on the central business district are particularly well suited to this type of analysis. Planners can test various scenarios as they strive to control and design the future density structure of cities. </jats:p>",

Production scheduling in a remanufacturing shop poses a special challenge as the scope of work involved is not known with great certainty. This uncertainty translates into wide variability in lead times and production inefficiencies. Traditional methods of production planning, more suitable for new manufacture, either fail to give suitable results or are cumbersome to use in the highly dynamic environment. Hence, a novel approach is suggested which gives accurate projections and at the same time is robust enough to cater to the changing ground situation.</jats:p>",

This is of interest for developing decision support systems within the context of planning for recyclability. The proposed modelling methodology could allow the identification and assessment of cost-effective characteristics of disassembly. The proposed approach for the evaluation and the optimisation of the disassembly process for components, part and subassemblies recovery could be used for optimal disassembly sequence generation by considering the precedence constraints between assembly components. The proposed approach is based upon the Petri Net modelling technology already developed at the CAD/CAM laboratory (LICP) at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In this work a generic dynamic model was developed based on Petri Net technology. The Petri Net model (i) represented manufacturing knowledge of the type of precedence constraints (ii) represented dynamically the process planning procedure itself and (iii) encapsulated all possible process planning solutions (process plans). Furthermore, process planning simulation was performed directly on the Petri Net and reachability analysis of the model gave the complete set of solutions (process plans).</jats:p>",

The purpose is to study whether, and to what degree, relationship marketing is the right framework in this regard for today’s retailing in Finland, and how this “new paradigm” can be applied in future to improve the effectiveness of the regular customer cards. Regular customer cards are found to correspond to relationship marketing mainly on its lowest level, and thus at a level where the benefits of relationship marketing are lowest as well. Alternatively, the regular customer systems and programmes are not yet developed enough to take advantage fully of the possibilities of relationship marketing. There is a lot of potential to improve regular customer systems and cards towards more relationship‐based marketing in the daily product sector in retailing by customization, augmentation, and internal marketing.</jats:p>",

Findings support the importance of content, clinical context, and experience whenever reasoning to plan care. Findings did not support problem-solving models of thinking such as the nursing process.

It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly.  This paper    proposes a new approximation scheme.  The basic idea is to transform a    POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an    oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state    of the world is in a certain region.  The transformed POMDP is    consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than    the original POMDP.  We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use    its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original    POMDP.  By controlling the amount of additional information that the    oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between    computational time and approximation quality.  In terms of algorithmic    contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability    in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also    propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs.  The algorithm is    conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all    previous exact algorithms.</jats:p>"

The resulting Dynamically Penalized Likelihood (DPL) algorithm achieves a dose distribution of excellent uniformity in a tumor volume and a much lower dose in regions containing sensitive volumes. A simple model of a patient and of energy deposition has been used for the initial results presented: a two‐dimensional computer generated phantom and monochromatic x rays, without scattering. Three two‐dimensional problems are solved with the DPL algorithm, corresponding to different size and spatial relationships between the tumor and sensitive tissue volumes. The results show that the DPL algorithm is robust and flexible; it only requires moderate computation times and leads to promising solutions, even in rather difficult problems. The results encourage the extension of the present work to more realistic therapy situations.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews the basic components, performance and health effects, and post-processing options for nonwater-miscible and water-mixed cutting fluids currently practiced. The basic components of non-water-miscible and water-mixed fluids are introduced. Time-based degradation mechanisms for cutting fluid performance including liquid contamination, solid contamination, acidity/alkalinity, corrosion resistance, emulsion stability and bacteriological effects are examined. These degradation mechanisms are related to possible human health effects. Recycling effectiveness for different techniques such as sedimentation, magnetic separation, skimming, barrier filtration and centrifugation are also examined. Disposal pre-treatment options for cutting fluids are discussed. Finally, three case examples of cutting fluid management at a research facility, automotive supplier and grinding shop are presented.</jats:p>",

Refurbishment of blades is accomplished by applying a weld bead to the tip, followed by removal of excess material. This paper describes an overview of an integrated system for accomplishing the material removal step. The separate tasks of digitizing the blade to obtain original shape information, automatically calculating the tool paths, and machining the blades, are combined into a turnkey system implemented using a five-axis machine tool and attached personal computer. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of the system for sample blade shapes.</jats:p>",

A shortcoming of this performance measure is that it doesn’t allow comparison of QC strategies that define analytical runs differently. Accommodating different analytical run definitions is straightforward if QC performance is measured in terms of the average number of patient samples to error detection, or the average number of patient samples containing an analytical error that exceeds total allowable error. By using these performance measures to investigate the impact of different analytical run definitions on QC performance demonstrates that during routine QC monitoring, the length of the interval between QC tests can have a major influence on the expected number of unacceptable results produced during the existence of an out-of-control error condition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We consider recent developments in the cultural industries in Turkey, with particular reference to television broadcasting. We seek to show how recent transformations in the industry have been associated with significant developments in Turkish cultural identity. Historically, broadcasting has existed under the monopoly of the state-run Turkish Radio and Television Authority (TRT), and functioned very much as a voice of the Kemalist ideology of the Republic. From 1990, however, there was a rapid proliferation of illegal, commercial television channels, broadcasting signals from outside the country. This led to a new vitality in Turkish television culture, as the new commercial interests sought to develop programming that would appeal to audiences tired of the ‘official’ fare of TRT. Television began to reflect the popular culture of Turkey in ways that were quite creative. Since 1994, and the passing of new broadcasting legislation, the turbulence of commercialisation has quietened. There has been a degree of concentration in the industry, and commercial programming has become less innovative. The momentum of change has slowed, though it has by no means been halted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper it is argued that the music business should be regarded as an activity trading in information. The paper begins with a review of key themes in the conceptualisation of the music industry within the cultural economies tradition. These are the tensions between creativity and commerce and between global and local processes, and the characterisation of the industry in the terms of the flexible specialisation and reflexive accumulation theses. It is then suggested that these debates have downplayed a key characteristic of the contemporary music industry, its involvement with the creation, production, and distribution of information. The emergence of a global music business over the past decade is documented and analysed by means of this framework. Subsequently, two aspects of the integration processes taking place in the music industry are considered in terms of their relationship to the information economy: copyright protection and branding, and competition between producers of information storage and retrieval devices. The paper concludes that interpreting music as an information industry sheds new light on the music business, and points to important questions for further research within the information economy literature. </jats:p>",

In the Tower of London test, a puzzle in which beads sliding on pegs must be moved to match a designated goal configuration, patients with lesioned prefrontal cortex show deficits in planning a goal-directed sequence of moves. We propose a neuronal network model of sequence planning that passes this test and, when lesioned, fails in a way that mimics prefrontal patients’ behavior. Our model comprises a descending planning system with hierarchically organized plan, operation, and gesture levels, and an ascending evaluative system that analyzes the problem and computes internal reward signals that index the correct/erroneous status of the plan. Multiple parallel pathways connecting the evaluative and planning systems amend the plan and adapt it to the current problem. The model illustrates how specialized hierarchically organized neuronal assemblies may collectively emulate central executive or supervisory functions of the human brain.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery and fractionated radiotherapy is currently a labor intensive, operator‐dependent process. Many degrees of freedom exist to make rigorous optimization intractable except by computationally intelligent techniques. The quality of a given plan is determined by an aggregate of clinical objectives, most of which are subject to competing tradeoffs. In this work, we present an autonomous scheme that couples decision theoretic guidance with a genetic algorithm for optimization. Ordinal ranking among a population of viable treatment plans is based on a generalized distance metric, which promotes a decreasing hyperfrontier of the efficient solution set. The solution set is driven toward efficiency by the genetic algorithm, which uses the tournament selection mechanism based on the ordinal ranking. Goals and satisficing conditions can be defined to signal the ultimate and the minimum achievement levels in a given objective. A conventionally challenging case in radiosurgery was used to demonstrate the practical utility and the problem‐solving power of the decision theoretic genetic algorithm. Treatment plans with one isocenter and four isocenters were derived under the autonomous scheme and compared to the actual treatment plan manually optimized by the expert planner. Quality assessment based on dose–volume histograms and normal tissue complication probabilities suggested that computational optimization could be driven to offer varying degrees of dosimetric improvement over a human‐guided optimization effort. Furthermore, it was possible to achieve a high degree of isodose conformity to the target volume in computational optimization by increasing the degree of freedom in the treatment parameters. The time taken to derive an efficient planning solution was comparable and usually shorter than in the manual planning process, and can be scaled down almost linearly with the number of processors. Overall, the autonomous genetic algorithm scheme was found to be powerful and versatile as a computationally intelligent counterpart to human‐guided strategies in treatment optimization for stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy.</jats:p>",

This analysis illuminates the research question of whether urban development beyond a greenbelt could be efficient in an economic sense. The Herbert-Stevens model of spatial efficiency is used to see what economic-efficiency conditions might justify the leapfrogging of urban development over the greenbelt. Some interesting results are produced. When a greenbelt generates a distance-independent level of service, the efficient location of the greenbelt should be outside the urban fringe, and there is no discontinuity between the land rents of the urbanized area and the greenbelt area along the inner boundary of a greenbelt. Conversely, when a greenbelt generates a distance-decaying level of services, (1) a central park type of greenbelt is not an optimal location of the greenbelt in our model setting; (2) there is discontinuity in land rent at the inner boundary of the greenbelt so that outside the urban fringe is an efficient location for the greenbelt, and (3) development jumping over the greenbelt, or a greenbelt inside the urbanized area, could be efficient as citizen's real income, required utility level, desire for greenbelt amenities, and total population increase, and the greenbelt provides amenities with a strong distance-decaying nature. </jats:p>",

A number of commentators have suggested that women in professional occupations are key players in inner-area gentrification, although the evidence here is limited.

The fundamental idea within the distributed utility concept is that particular local load increases can be satisfied at least cost by avoiding or delaying the more traditional investments in central generation capacity, bulk transmission expansion, and local transmission and distribution upgrades. Instead of these investments, the distributed utility concept suggests that investments in local generation, local storage, and local demand-side management technologies can be designed to satisfy increasing local demand at lower total cost. Critical to installation of distributed assets is knowledge of a utility system's area- and time-specific costs. This review introduces the distributed utility concept, describes an application of ATS costs to investment planning, discusses the various motivations for further study of the concept, and reviews relevant literature. Future research directions are discussed. </jats:p>",

We empirically examine the validity of deductively derived patterns about these types of decisions. More importantly, we look for normative insights by exploring how production planning and inventory control decisions affect operations performance. Our findings show that production line and continuous flow plants use more of a level production strategy, and carry less raw material and work‐in‐process inventory. The performance drivers for these plants, through which the operations function excels, are effective utilization of equipment, reduced finished goods inventory, and reduced setup down time. To gain forward demand visibility and batching economies, job and batch shops rely much more on backlogs in their planning process. These plants use more of a production chase strategy and position inventory lower in the bills of materials. Four performance drivers for top‐performing job and batch shops are to find ways that better anticipate customers' orders, have a more responsive chase strategy, carry less raw material or purchased inventory, and shorten production planning horizon, partly through less reliance on backlogs. It is intriguing that top‐performing plants not only do the expected things, given their choice of process, but also excel in selected dimensions—some of which fit the profile normally associated with a different process choice. To monitor and continuously improve operations, evaluation ‘scorecards’ should pay particular attention to performance drivers, which change depending on the plant's process choice.</jats:p>",

However, this sector has remained relatively underanalysed both in the geographical and in the planning literature. The author begins by defining the cultural industries production system (CIPS). In the second part he operationalises this definition with respect to secondary sources on employment in the CIPS in Britain. In the third part he considers the change in the employment structure of the CIPS between 1984 and 1991, and goes on to address the regional patterns of employment in the CIPS with particular emphasis upon London and the South East. </jats:p>",

We frame this paper within a conceptualization of postproductivism and pose the question to what extent, and under what conditions, are new local stakeholders, new local agencies, and new local processes effective in allocating land uses which reflect TRA values? Three new land-use proposals which incorporate TRA values are examined to determine where key catalysts for implementation lie. We found that, unlike other research in rural areas of Britain, institutions in British Columbia that have conventionally regulated land use continue to exercise their considerable regulatory and discretionary powers. Though new stakeholders, agencies and processes at the local level have had an impact on planning, they have not been effective in reconfiguring the power structures for actual implementation of land reallocation. This lack of efficacy is attributed in part to the common property character of lands that support TRA values, the associated complexity of property rights regimes, and the large number of stakeholders involved. Furthermore, there is a lack of understanding by regulatory agencies of land resources as community resources, and these agencies continue to grant higher priority to the strategic considerations of higher levels of government rather than to local concerns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author sets out to interrogate the manner in which cultural festivals have been theorised in the context of accounts of the role of civic boosterism—or what he terms ‘Urban Propaganda Projects' (UPPs)—in the politics of local economic development. Attention is focused primarily upon how authors account for the way in which ‘locals' respond to boosterism. Based upon the thesis advanced by the Ohio School, and a review of later work, the central argument pursued is that work to date has operated with remarkably impoverished conceptions of the antecedent material and cultural contexts within which hallmark events are being organised. In regard to their conception of the ‘audience’ for UPPs, authors have worked with the unacknowledged assumption that locals consume and relate to events largely in terms of the extent to which they buy into, resist (culturally or economically), or become disoriented, by the versions of local identity which are being promoted. Even when critical or Marxist in nature, this form of analysis limits enquiry to the terms of reference of the boosterist agenda itself. The author argues that more imaginative conceptual frameworks might orient analysts to look for other modes of consumption—modes which indeed might refuse to recognise the language of boosterism (for good or bad) and which might require a different entry point to analysis. Using a case study of Glasgow's role as European City of Culture 1990, the author develops the contours of one such framework, with the aid of key concepts of institutional positions and strategic orientations. Although amenable to appropriation within existing critical or Marxist accounts, these concepts are not the products of that framework and thus generate, at the very least, a problematic relationship with it. It is concluded that accounts of local reactions to cultural festivals in particular, and to civic boosterism in general, must escape the epistemological straightjacket that the Marxist/boosterist agenda presents. </jats:p>",

As this production environment becomes increasingly dominant in many countries with small markets like Australia and New Zealand, there is a growing urgency for an OR analysis of its complex planning and scheduling problems, This paper presents a planning procedure for balancing workload variations and WIP inventories for an existing multi‐stage processing facility in a post‐mass production environment with discrete planning periods. The methodology is based on a multi‐criteria production planning model which allows the facility to move towards JIT‐processing at each processing stage without a full JIT commitment for the facility.</jats:p>",

The need to screen for infection depends upon the importance of the disease detected to the individual and the community, the prevalence of the disease, and the reliability and cost of the methods available for detection. In this study the prevalence of chlamydial infection in asymptomatic antenatal patients was 2% and was not related to socioeconomic class as defined: in women attending a family planning clinic the rate was 6 times greater as 12% tested positive. In a recent study of 478 unselected patients undergoing pelvic examinations as pan of routine care in Alabama, USA, during a prenatal visit, the prevalence of genitourinary Chlamydia trachomatis infection was 6.1% by cervical culture, 18.2% by ligase chain reaction of cervical swabs and 16.9% by ligase chain reaction of urine (A). This paper compared the sensitivity and specificity of a ligase chain reaction assay of cervical swabs and voided urine with those of cervical swab culture for the detection of genitourinary tract infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in pregnant women. We contacted the directors of 3 large infertility clinics associated with University Hospitals in Melbourne and were informed that in none of them was it routine practice to screen new patients for evidence of genital or urinary tract infections with Chlamydia trachomatis. Moreover women were not tested for this infection before embarking upon GIFT or in vitro fertilization: embryo transfer treatment regimens in any of these centres although this was planned when better technology for testing became available. At the Mercy Hospital for Women routine testing for Chlamydia trachomatis was formerly performed at the colposcopy clinic but was discontinued because so few women tested positive.</jats:p><jats:p>\n<jats:list list-type=\"explicit-label\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Andrews WW.

Group 2 comprised women attending the antenatal clinics of Lady Dufferin Hospital which provides free obstetric care to women belonging to the lower socioeconomic groups of Karachi (n=100).

These patients were retested after antibiotic therapy to assess the efficacy of the therapy. In groups 1 and 2, 2% and in Group 3, 12% of the females tested positive. Selective screening of sexually active women for chlamydial infection is advocated as a cost‐effective public health measure.</jats:p>",
