      "abstract": "<jats:p>A method is presented for quick calculation of the frequency of cross-wind components which limit the landing of aircraft on runway layouts at aerodromes ánd for deriving the best runway layouts for a site with a known or deducible wind distribution. The method depends on some initial study of the relevant wind rose but an exact solution is obtained by the application of the empirically derived formula <jats:italic>n<jats:sub><jats:italic>v</jats:italic></jats:sub></jats:italic> = <jats:italic>Ce</jats:italic>–<jats:sup><jats:italic>bv</jats:italic>2</jats:sup> where <jats:italic>n<jats:sub><jats:italic>v</jats:italic></jats:sub></jats:italic> denotes the percentage of time that a wind exceeds a velocity <jats:italic>v</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>C</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>b</jats:italic> are constants for a given site. This formula was originally verified only for the British Isles but later it has been found to be valid elsewhere where there is a wide range of wind speeds. Allowance can be made in the calculations for bad weather, e.g. dense smoke or low cloud approaching the aerodrome from certain directions, for use of one end only of a runway and for a permissible tail wind component.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper was originally issued in 1944. The method described has not been changed and the description is only slightly modified. The chief changes are the substitution of numerical integration using <jats:italic>Meteor</jats:italic> computer instead of the original planimeter measurement of curves and the introduction of the ‘bisector’ correction. Certain details of the calculation notably four-figure tables of <jats:italic>L(i)</jats:italic> (eqn (5)) and of the bisector correction, a complete example of the method, the way to remove ‘bias’ in wind summaries and the derivation of the bisector correction are given in a duplicated Addendum to this paper which is available on request from the Institute.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In comparing long- and short-term commitments to fulfill demand for some kind of capacity, a linear formulation of the problem may prove useful. The general capacity-planning problem treated here is that in which the demand for capacity may be met by ownership, leases of various terms, or spot contracts. Certain kinds of machine capacity, tankers, or trucks might be examples. Variations in demand and prices for the various alternatives give rise to a computational problem of considerable proportions and in addition one must account for the firm's time preference for money. A linear model is presented to aid in developing answers to such questions as the following: (1) What effect will any given demand forecast have on capacity plans, (2) what will be the effect of an expected change in ownership costs, (3) if prices for leased capacity increase by some given amount, how will plans and costs be affected, (4) what is the sensitivity of decisions and costs to forecast error? Computation of an optimal plan under various assumed conditions should provide (1) the best policy for the expected future and (2) those changes in policy which ought to follow from changed conditions. </jats:p>",
