A general belief exists that persons with mental retardation have little ability to contribute significantly to the design process, primarily because of their cognitive and communication deficits. As mental retardation services have slowly shiftedfrom a medically oriented model to a normalization-based one, the focus has switchedfrom product-oriented to process-oriented goals. This poses significant difficultiesfor consumers and the professionals who work with them. However, it seems possible that, given the visually oriented nature of the design professions combined with current teaching technologies that can rapidly facilitate the acquisition of self-advocacy skills, persons with mental retardation may be able to learn to express their preferences about their residential environments and experience greater control over their lives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this article is to describe the potential implications of the \"new sciences\" such as chaos theory, self-organization theory, and complexity science to reconcile various different schools of philosophical thought in the environment development debate. Design, through the means of transdisciplinary analysis, here is conceived as a creative process that aids in the emergence of appropriate metaphors and models for the development of sophisticated environmental planning and policies. The epistemological and philosophical foundations of two broad paradigms of thought, the material and ecological paradigms, are examined to develop a more comprehensive approach to sustainable development. Surprisingly, this takes us into the terrain of Newtonian mechanics and principles of thermodynamics. The article then presents an alternative view of sustainability based on the emerging new science paradigm. Finally, the article examines some possible implicationsfor integrated environmental design and planning. </jats:p>",

Each piece is initially considered to be rough and needs to be appropriately “shaped,” or smoothed, to meet mobile robot nonholonomic kinematic constraints. Experiments on a simulated vehicle with ultrasonic sensors are briefly discussed.</jats:p>",

One can identify two distinct approaches to tackle the disassembly problem, viz., design for disassembly (DFD) and planning for disassembly (PFD). This paper focuses on the PFD approach. The evolution of a disassembly plan may require some heuristics and domain specific knowledge. In addition, disassembly planners may have a particular style to solve disassembly problems. Due to these facts and the nature of the PFD itself (open ended and iterative), the paper proposes the use of Analogical Problem Solving (APS) as an approach to assist planners to solve PFD problems. APS is based on the sensible notion that problem solving can be assisted by the reuse of solutions to similar problems encountered in the past. The framework of applying APS to PFD, the merits of this approach, and the issues relating to its use for PFD are discussed.</jats:p>",

Nominal grouping is a highly structured technique designed to keep personal interaction at a minimum level during the process of new idea generation, while maximizing the individual contribution of each respondent. Describes a comparative experiment in which both focus groups and nominal groups of various sizes (five, seven and ten respondents) were used for the purpose of gathering customer perceived service quality improvements. The results reveal that nominal group members produced a significantly larger amount of service enhancements than respondents in focus groups. Concludes that, as far as the quality of ideas is concerned, there is a significant difference between nominal groups and focus groups with respect to the quality of ideas produced by the groups of seven respondents. Moreover, significantly greater levels of group member satisfaction with respect to the participation in the data collection process were found for the groups of seven and ten respondents, with the former receiving the highest score.</jats:p>",

Hierdie nuwe dorpe is beïnvloed deur die internasionale nuwedorp-beweging. Hierdie referaat poog om die invloede te analiseer en om die verskille tussen fisiese uitleg en ideologiese werklikhede uit te wys. 'n Groot gedeelte van Suid-Afrika se geskiedenis is beïnvloed deur die ontdekking van minerale, wat grotendeels verantwoordelik was vir die ontwikkeling van nedersettings. Die ontdekking van diamante in Kimberley in 1869 het bv. 'n massiewe instroming van mense tot gevolg gehad na die voorheen onontwikkelde binneland. Vroeë ontdekkings van die mineraalrykdom van Suid-Afrika het ook voorgekom in Pelgrimsrus, Barberton en Johannesburg, wat almal tot permanente nedersettings gelei het. Vandag, as gevolg van die tipe mineraalafsettings, is individuele prospekteurs skaars. Suid-Afrikaanse minerale word deur net 'n paar mynbedrywe, wat die benodigde finansies en tegnologie besit, ontgin. Die opening van 'n nuwe myn benodig 'n groot aantal werkers, wat die voorsiening van behuising noodsaaklik maak, dikwels in verafgeleë areas. Die konstruksie van myndorpe en die ontwikkeling van groot semi-staat ondernemings beteken dat die meeste nuwe dorpe in Suid-Afrika terselfdertyd ondernemingsdorpe is en hul plasing tot 'n groot mate voorgeskryf is deur die voorkoms van minerale of grondstowwe. Selfs dorpe soos Sasolburg en Vanderbijlpark is ondernemingsdorpe wat naby groot kole-afsettings geplaas is. Die nuwedorpbeweging in Brittanje en sy voorlopers - byvoorbeeld die dorpe gestig deur die \"Enlightened Industrialists\", die tuinstede, en die Amerikaanse groengordelstede - het almal sterk sosiale beginsels onderliggend. In hierdie referaat word beweer dat in Suid-Afrika - ten spyte van die feit dat die fisiese vorm van nuwe stede ‘n groot invloed op Suid-Afrikaanse dorpsuitlegte gehad het - baie min van die sosiale beginsels toegepas is. Die referaat bevraagteken die geldigheid van die vervreemding van die fisiese uitleg van die sosiale beginsels wat dit onderlê. Hierdie referaat bevraagteken ook die doeltreffendheid om buitelandse uitlegte na te boots by die uitlê van dorpe.</jats:p>"

While rule-based approaches are generally fast and are more appropriate for simple scenarios, simulation methods and dynamic models, indigenous to the simulation literature, are necessary to plan within environments involving large-scale uncertainty, multiple interacting elements and complex dynamics. Planning techniques must inter-operate to yield the best decisions, and we have found that simulation-based planning serves as an architecture for detailed model levels for both real-time and off-line decision making. We introduce simulation-based planning as a methodology for addressingthe complexity involved in Air Force missions while employing an example of air interdiction. </jats:p>",

This paper first briefly reviews the background of this dynamic multi-objective decision problem. Then a prototype is proposed with a heuristic integrative algorithm — machine selection using a dynamic decision table which is maintained by dynamic loading feedback method.

A central knowledge base is proposed that links the sub-systems and permits open, networked communication throughout the design to manufacture process. There are three essential steps for this to attain reality. First, we are developing a variety of solid object “features” that the designer can use to create components. Second, we are developing a process planning interface that initially advises the designer on the correctness of the design and then creates the necessary process plan. Third, we are developing the machining routines on an open-architecture machine tool that allow automatic component generation over the Internet. Videomanufacturing demonstrations have been carried out between the designer and the remote machines.</jats:p>",

Such systems lack the predictive capabilities that could conceivably be offered by pre-operative planners enhanced with biomechanical evaluation modules. For the augmented pre-operative planners to be of clinical use, the underlying analysis tools need be reliable, fast and accurate. However, most analysis tools are designed and tested outside the context of a pre-operative planner and in an ad-hoc way that is difficult to automate, if one were to meet the severe demands of a patient-specific pre-operative planning environment. Furthermore, the typical modeling pipeline that is the backbone of the analysis part of a biomechanical evaluation module, is burdened by the introduction of approximation errors. We report here on a novel approach that greatly simplifies the typical modeling pipeline.</jats:p>",

This enables the government to implement the intent of the lawmakers in administering that law. However, interpreting these vague and ambiguous laws requires tax professionals to face planning situations that are complex and uncertain. Due to an increase in civil litigation, the importance of tax professionals making defensible decisions has been magnified in recent years. Carnes, et al. (1994) report that tax partners with Big‐Six accounting firms spend about 30 to 45 percent of their time resolving ambiguous tax questions. Therefore, tax professionals could benefit from models or systems (i.e., decision support systems, expert systems, artificial intelligence) that provide decision direction when facing ambiguous tax situations. One such area in which tax professionals must assist their clients is the determination of what levels of compensation are reasonable for owner‐employees of closely‐held corporations (Hagan, et al. 1995).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The number of private households in Canada surged in the 1970s; at the same time, rental housing was becoming more affordable. Then, in the first half of the 1980s, affordability declined and household formation slowed. Were these changes in household formation attributable to changing affordability? In this paper, a model is estimated by means of logistic regression, in which the living arrangement of a family (or a nonfamily adult) is a choice made on the basis of the income and other characteristics of the family (or adult), and the price of maintaining one's own dwelling. In the model current income is partitioned into expected and transitory components, indicators of income expectations are included, and the endogeneity of living arrangement and income is considered. Income variables are measured in terms of the units of standard rental housing that the family or individual can purchase. The model is estimated empirically by using pooled data drawn from the 1981 Census and 1986 Census public-use samples. The estimation is comprehensive in coverage; separate model estimates are presented for up to 44 distinct pools of consumers defined by age, sex, family status, and income. Estimates derived from the model show that affordability had an effect on living arrangement that, although often statistically significant, was numerically small and that declining affordability does not predict well changes in living arrangement in metropolitan Canada for 1981 and 1986. </jats:p>",

The interaction between the manufacturing plants and warehouses and issues related to distribution of multiple commodities to customers from warehouses represents a crucial step toward an integrated and systematic facilities' design. In this paper we develop a mixed integer programming model for the plant and warehouse location problem where the objective is to minimize the total transportation and distribution costs and the fixed costs for opening and operating plants and warehouses. We employ Lagrangian relaxation to the model, and also present a heuristic to produce an effective feasible solution for the problem. This problem has resulted from a study conducted by the authors for a large company manufacturing health-care products.

One benefit is reduction in operation and maintenance expenses, because less pumping energy and fewer chemicals are used in the acquisition, treatment, and disposal of water. Another benefit is the deferral or downsizing of capital facilities. Comparing current supply with projected demand aids in the identification of future needs for demand management or increased supply. In addition to cost factors, nonmonetary factors, including environmental effects, should be considered.

In previous research I examined the general and analytical conditions defining both the existence and stability of an equilibrium in hierarchically organized spatial markets dominated by oligopolistic corporations that distribute a commodity directly to consumers through their retail franchises. Here I examine the disequilibrium dynamics resulting from this model. A bilevel decisionmaking process is hypothesized in which corporations vary their delivered prices in response to changes in urban market demand and in which franchises vary their retail prices in response both to changes in the cost of the commodity from their parent corporation and to the pricing strategies pursued by their competitors. The complexity of interactions operating between the two levels of the model and the presence of asymmetrical demand conditions facing duopolistic corporations suggests that it is unlikely that an overall spatial price equilibrium can actually be reached by such disequilibrium price-adjustment strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this and a subsequent paper, work by geographers that is based on the idea that we are in a period of transition to an epoch of flexible accumulation, or post-Fordism, is examined. It is argued that this thesis relies on abstracting the technical and organisational aspects of current restructuring from its value relations. An account which includes value relations shows that the phenomena said to characterise flexible accumulation are more contradictory and unstable, more varied, and more open to struggle than is supposed in work in which a new epoch is assumed. An approach based on value relations can give a richer account of current spatial-economic change. In this first paper, capital—labour relations within production, and the relations between firms are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper presents an approach for the case adaptation, especially case repairing, in a case-based process planning system: PROCASE, for machining of rotational parts. In PROCASE, a new process plan is generated by adapting an existing similar process plan from its case library. Case adaptation is a crucial issue in achieving an automated case-based process planning system. This is because, usually, an existing process plan cannot necessarily produce an exact identical part as of the desired part. Adaptation is essential to tailor this existing plan to generate a new process plan for the new part. The case adaptation in this paper comprises case modification, case simulation, and case repairing. The modifier uses the knowledge extracted from case library to edit the retrieved similar plan. The simulator plays an important role in verifying the adapted plan as well as in directing the plan repairing. The repairing rules are indexed by the error messages obtained from the simulation. With the proposed case adaptation, the system will have the capability to repair the erroneous plans to achieve an automated and intelligent process planning system. This paper will first briefly introduce the case representation and case retrieval in PROCASE. Then the rest of the paper is dedicated to the case adaptation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Questions as to how social regulation serves renewed accumulation may be answered by mesoscale studies of the ways states make sites and localities available to new forms of production. In this study I examine the important social-regulatory role of the Japanese state in the rapid creation of new factory sites for flexible producers after 1970, particularly through negotiation with rural constituencies. Firms in leading sectors of Japanese industry have spun-off thousands of new production units over the past twenty years, not only as a result of growth but as a continuous strategy to achieve that growth. One way new factories obtained land and labor was through Japan's 1971 Law to Promote the Introduction of Industry into Agricultural Village Areas, Nōson Chiiki Kōgyō Dōnyū Sokushin Hō. This policy coaxed farmtown governments to carve new industrial parks out of farmland and to sell improved factory sites to manufacturing firms. By subscribing hundreds of farmtowns into this national program annually in the 1970s, the policy helped to structure the external conditions of industrial firms' flexibility, granting full rein to the internal logics allowing their greater spatial reach. By early 1992, over 6800 factories had acquired rural sites under this program and 444000 workers had been hired, many from farm households. The state has by no means abandoned interventionism in this growth period, but has actively reregulated the countryside away from its former engagements in agriculture and into the service of flexible industrial production. </jats:p>",
