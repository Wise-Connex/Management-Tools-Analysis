The problems of advance planning for cleanup of oil spills have been recognized for many years but received little active interest before the Torrey Canyon disaster in 1967. Following that incident the United States began developing national and regional oil spill contingency plans, and the first national plan was published in late 1968. The Water Quality Improvement Act of 1970 spurred additional efforts, resulting in publication of a more comprehensive national plan and completion of detailed regional plans. These plans created national and regional response teams and established responsibilities and procedures for responding to spills of oil and hazardous materials in U.S. waters with appropriate cleanup and control measures. The need for international contingency planning has been recognized during the past year, and some work has begun in this area.</jats:p>",

Since this effort is being undertaken in the service of the public, it is important to assess the social costs and benefits. </jats:p><jats:p> The research focus of the work on which this paper is based is on information systems as entities in themselves and as components of a larger systems design. After analyzing the three discretely defined but operationally joined concepts, information, system, and the information system, we examine the four assumptions underlying the general acceptance of the information system as a management tool: (1) that more information leads to better plans or decisions; (2) that more and faster-moving information necessarily enhances “efficiency” of operation; (3) that greater “efficiency” is identical with better public service; and (4) that information systems are best conceived, designed, and controlled by “information experts,” whose talents are movable and ubiquitous. </jats:p><jats:p> Information systems in public welfare, criminal justice, and land use are reviewed as cases in point, and the conclusion drawn that while there is no gainsaying the fact that in each area a body of organized information is essential to systematic analysis and planning, there exists considerable confusion between quantity and quality, between the necessary and the busy. So far, there is a lack of clarification not only as to the proper constitution of the information system but also about the qualifications of the “experts” designing them. </jats:p><jats:p> Unfortunate as these matters are in raising the costs and lowering the benefits (economic and social, as well), they have ominous implications when viewed in the light of the many-fronted encroachments by computerized information systems on individuals' right to privacy. The data bank and the dossier may be rationalized as means to efficiency, but they cannot be reconciled with democratic process and freedom from cradle-to-grave surveillance. </jats:p>",

The trend away from controls in the Soviet Union is briefly treated. The French planning machinery and the factors determining the initial success of the French method of planning by inducement, its subsequent decline, and its anticipated recovery are outlined. Greater attention is paid to the more democratic British experiment in planning by consensus, with particular emphasis on the structure and evolution of the planning institutions and their strengths and weaknesses. Reasons for the British attempt at national economic planning and for its failure are also indicated while the aborted move towards greater intervention in the private sector is analysed in depth. The author concludes that the new emphasison planning the public sector, using both central policy reviews and annual five‐year expenditure projections linked with economic assessments, is likely to prove more effective than earlier methods and that the deliberate retreat from planning the entire economy will prove a sound basis for a subsequent advance.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire. </jats:bold> L'auteur distingue deux sortes de planifications de l'économie nationale‐ la planification imposée (planification avec contrôles) et la planification suggérée (par persuasion). Puis il traite rapidement de la tendance en Union Soviétique d'abandonner les contrôles. L'auteur explique ensuite le mëcanisme français de planification, les facteurs qui ont déterminé le succès initial de la méthode française de planification par encouragement, son déclin subséquent et l'anticipation de son renouveau. Il examine ensuite plus en détail l'expérience britannique, d'un caractère plus démocratique, qui consiste à planifier par accordg général en insistant particulièrement sur la structure et l'évolution des institutions de planification, sur leurs points forts et sur leurs points faibles. Il expose les raisons des efforts britanniques de planification de l'économie nationale et pourquoi ils ont échoé et analyse en profondeur la tentative avortée d'une plus grande intervention dans le secteur privé. L'auteur conclut que la nouvelle importance accordée à la planification du secteur public en se servant à la fois de révisions des politiques‐clés et d'estimations annuelles des dépenses quinquennales par rapport aux évaluations économiques, risque de se montrer plus efficace, comme méthode, que les précédentes et que l'abstention délibéreé d'une planification totale de l'économie permettra de faire un pas en avant.</jats:p>",

With greater availability of data and projection models, optimization of plans is now much nearer to accomplishment. In contrast to these favorable aspects of planning, increased complexity of plans and large number of alternatives serving differing sets of goals have extended the time horizons from initial plan formulation to eventual implementation. In this paper a man‐machine strategy is proposed to reduce the time required for decision making and conflict resolution. A panel of representatives of the decision makers, influentials and publics involved are selected and brought through a series of dynamic planning steps that simulate real time decision making. Computer interaction graphics is used to visualize the decision making process and to illustrate where and why conflict arises. A mechanism for resolution of conflict and retention of consistency in policy formulation using a cognograph is described.</jats:p>",

With capitalists saving all their incomes for future profits, workers get all there is to get.

Because planning takes place in a dynamic and uncertain environment in which postulated conditions are known to change, it is imperative that the planner be apprised in the planning phase of the effect of changes which can occur. Using “this information, a planner can temper his judgment with a knowledge of the effect of the uncertainty resulting from changes in the system state variables. This paper presents results of the use of a computer simulation and optimization model to quantify possible variations in system response which could occur as a result of uncertainty in the postulated physical and economic conditions under which the proposed water development system was to perform. The possible effects of these variable responses on planning decision‐making is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT</jats:bold> Prior studies of water resource systems have considered risk from the point of view that only the system planners could react to the effects of the risk elements. However, users of water from a system also react to risk. When the quantity of water that a system can supply is subject to considerable variation, the reactions of the users of the water will often effect the benefits generated by the system and thus its optimal design characteristics. A simulation model of a reservoir‐irrigation system is developed which incorporates the water users' reactions to risk in such a manner as to reflect their influence on the optimal design characteristics. A risk (convex) programming algorithm is incorporated into the model to reflect the water users' reactions to various levels of aversion to risk and degree of uncertainty in water deliveries. Response surfaces are generated as a result of performing the simulation at different levels of the design variables. An examination of these surfaces reveals the importance of including water users' reactions to risk in water resource system planning. The effects of different levels of risk aversion on the irrigation farmers' choice of crop enterprises are also examined.</jats:p>",
