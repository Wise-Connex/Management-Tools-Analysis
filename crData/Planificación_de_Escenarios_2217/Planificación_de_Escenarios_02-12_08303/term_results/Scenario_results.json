      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is devoted to a consideration of the present‐day situation faced by the digital economy. The appearance of this phenomenon as one of the basic pillars of modern economies has provoked increasing interest in academic circles which, for the moment, is not fully reflected in the economic literature. Against this background, the central aim of this study is to synthesise the current state of the question, accepting the limitations imposed on such an exercise that is supposed by the scarcity of sources alluded to earlier. Qualitative research in this area has concentrated on the strategies that generate competitive advantages in a digital economy scenario. We follow this line by focusing on this question, trying to determine whether these studies converge in terms of proposals that can be used as a reference point for firms operating in virtual markets. Establishing the foundations of this new scenario is essential in order to consolidate the digital economy as an independent discipline.</jats:p>",
