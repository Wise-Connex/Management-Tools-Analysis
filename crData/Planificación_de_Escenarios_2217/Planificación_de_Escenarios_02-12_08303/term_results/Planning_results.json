      "abstract": "<jats:p> The responsibility for developing transportation programs for welfare participants spans multiple public agencies. Consequently, federal funding programs require that agencies work together to develop a coordinated response to address the transportation needs of welfare participants. Based on a survey of transportation, welfare, and employment agencies in nineteen California counties, this study examines the potential institutional obstacles to successful local collaboration and coordination among public agencies. The research shows that new sources of federal funds have encouraged interagency efforts to address the transportation needs of welfare participants. However, the divergent organizational goals, methods, and approaches of the participating agencies heavily influence these collaborative efforts. As a consequence, stakeholders may have difficulty moving beyond the narrow interests of their individual institutions to identify and plan for the transportation needs of welfare participants. </jats:p>",

The term refers to the great diversity of recent writings that focus on the activity of planning and the practices of planners. It is assumed that empirical accounts of planning practice can help to build a more useful and pragmatic kind of planning theory than can the generalized procedural or normative models that previously constituted planning theory and that they have a pedagogical role to play in relation to practicing planners and planners in training. This article asks questions about how we learn from practice, how we learn from other people writing about practice, and therefore what kind of writing about practice will be most conducive to a learning experience. </jats:p>",

Our example is a multisectoral process initiated to address use and development conflicts in the international tourism destination of Banff National Park, Canada. We show how philosophical presuppositions (essentialism and metaphysical realism) can impede collaboration and exacerbate problems when categories like environmentalist and terms like ecological integrity are used. Rather than fixing categories and terms up front, a more fluid planning approach is advocated; terms are flexible and meanings emerge through dialogue. Shared descriptions replace contentious categories and terms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study examined the influence of a national planning mandate to redress human rights violations of the indigenous people of New Zealand. The mandate requires local governments to prepare environmental plans, achieve national goals, and support participation of indigenous people. A sample of thirty-four local governments was evaluated to determine how well local plans support indigenous rights and to examine the influence of factors that influence local plan support. Findings indicate that plans scored moderate to low in support of indigenous rights. In addition, indicators of citizen participation, quality of regional plans, and local organizational capability to plan had a positive influence on local plan support for indigenous rights. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The study of the unprecedented revival of Hebrew in (pre-Israel) Palestine (approx. 1890–1914) has focused on the status of the language, because the revival has been rightly viewed as resulting from status planning. However, corpus planning, or codification, also served as a critical component of the Revival. Though Hebrew had been used for almost two millennia in written form, mainly as a language of religion, codification was needed in several areas — selection and harmonization of pronunciation, unification of spelling, etc. Still, the greatest task was adapting the language lexically to the modern world. Codification went on in Hebrew, in fact, for over a millennium by generations of writers and translators of various types of texts, culminating in the formation of a modern literature, probably the most instrumental factor enabling the Revival. Lexicalization in the Revival itself was partly done by the Hebrew Language Committee, but mostly by individuals. Ben-Yehuda drew words from old texts and created his own as a scholarly activity and to meet his lexical needs as a newspaper publisher and the first Hebrew dictionary compiler. Others included the writer and journalist Ben-Avi and the national poet Bialik, who drew words from earlier texts or created their own only when they needed them. Other individuals coined countless words to meet their communication needs — writers, journalists, educators, translators, publishers, editors, and language-conscious political leaders. Apart from drawing words from old texts with their original or new meanings, methods included: coining new words from old roots; using old, dormant words as different parts of speech; reducing expressions into single words; borrowing; loan translation; popular etymology; adding prefixes, suffixes or infixes to existing words; and merging pairs of words into single ones.</jats:p>",

Every sovereign nation wishes to preserve its national tongue and maintain its status as a preferred medium of communication. However, the phenomenon of globalization, coupled with the increasing hegemony of English, has motivated many nations to revisit their language planning policies with a view to ensuring and strengthening the pre-eminence of their own languages, not only within their national borders, but within their geographical and commercial reach as well. The Arabic-speaking countries, while recalling with pride their historical dominance in the medieval scientific arena, are now struggling to prevent the language from an inundation of modern foreign terminology. The Arabic language-planning agencies, whose efforts to date, despite their excellent intentions, have not exhibited stellar success, must closely examine the work of other planning organizations which have succeeded in achieving many of their goals. Efforts by linguistically and ethnically diverse Scandinavian countries to promote unified technical and scientific terminology deserve close examination by the Arab nations, along with adaptation of their flourishing endeavors to the problems that beset Arabic language planning.</jats:p>",

The first sub-section offers a case-study of the economy, traffic, and infrastructure of the Port of Genoa between 1861 and 1970 through analysis of traffic, cargo, and production statistics. It determines that the mixture of solid infrastructure and thriving maritime culture brought economic success to Genoa. The second sub-section compares and contrasts port planning and centralisation activities of Britain and New Zealand, particularly through the actions of the National Ports Council and the New Zealand Ports Authority. It demonstrates that centralised port planning was a failure in both Britain and New Zealand, but that this was due to a complex range of factors and not sufficient enough evidence alone to conclude that ports do not require some level of centralised guidance.</p>",

This study investigates abortion dynamics among male and female Zulu adolescents in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. It explores the role of abortion in young people's sexual and reproductive experience, its acceptability, the reasons and likelihood of young people's choosing abortion, and the commonly used methods of pregnancy termination. The study, a rural‐urban comparison using focus‐group discussions, narrative workshops, and role playing, involved surveys and in‐depth interviews. Factors contributing to the commonplace nature of backstreet procedures among adolescents include: social stigma, inadequate knowledge of the legal status of abortion, and a complex group decisionmaking process. Young people invoke “relative moralities” concerning adolescent abortion, recognizing and condoning it on a context‐specific basis. Age, gender, and geographic differences are examined. The methodological triangulation used offers the opportunity for alternative theoretical and methodological approaches to research on abortion‐related issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban growth dynamics attracts the efforts of scientists from many different disciplines with objectives ranging from theoretical understanding to the development of carefully tuned realistic models that can serve as planning and policy tools. Theoretical models are often abstract and of limited applied value while most applied models yield little theoretical understanding. Here we present a mathematically well-defined model based on a modified Markov random field with lattice-wide interactions that produces realistic growth patterns as well as behavior observed in a range of other models based on diffusion-limited aggregation, cellular automata, and similar models. We investigate the framework's ability to generate plausible patterns using minimal assumptions about the interaction parameters since the tuning and specific definition of these are outside of the scope of this paper. Typical universality classes of the simulated dynamics and the phase transitions between them are discussed in the context of real urban dynamics. Using suitability data derived from topography, we produce configurations quantitatively similar to real cities. Also, an intuitive class of interaction rules is found to produce fractal configurations, not unlike vascular systems, that resemble urban sprawl. The dynamics are driven by interactions, depicting human decisions, between all lattice points. This is realized in a computationally efficient way using a mean-field renormalization (area average) approach. The model provides a mathematically transparent framework to which any level of detail necessary for actual urban planning application can be added. </jats:p>",

Although the total fertility rate for Vietnam declined from 6.0 children per woman of reproductive age in 1979 to 2.2 children in 1998, demographic evidence shows that son preference remains strong and influences contraceptive and fertility behavior. This study examines the underlying factors for son preference in a rural village in North Vietnam. The methodology includes focus‐group discussions, an in‐depth study of 25 families, and ethnographic observation. Results indicate that sons are highly desired for their social, symbolic, and economic value. In spite of four decades of socialist policies aimed at reducing gender‐based inequalities and at weakening the patriarchal kinship system, the desire for sons continues to drive the family‐building process. The article also indicates a gap between discourse and social practice with respect to roles assigned to children on the basis of their sex.</jats:p>",

A default hierarchy based on geometric relations often found in engineering and architectural designs is presented as an efficient example of one appropriate hierarchy. The interpreter's shape recognition and generation abilities are demonstrated with two examples: a new engineering shape grammar for the design of vehicle inner panels and a modified version of the classical ice-ray shape grammar. </jats:p>",

The paper commences with information on outputs from the industry, namely current and future production levels, and atmospheric emissions, followed by data on fuel and capacity inputs. Information is then presented to show that the meeting of future output targets may run counter to objectives for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, in view of the slow replacement of ageing plant and the plans to switch fuel from natural gas back to coal. The paper then discusses the economic and commercial factors influencing the strategic choices available to the Russian power-generation industry and the barriers to the implementation of these alternatives. The conclusion is reached that substantial investment is required in Russian power stations, which may require significant increases in electricity prices with associated economic and social problems for industrial and domestic consumers. The pricing system could also be used to reduce demand to match the capacities of available equipment, but that decision may also give rise to associated economic and social problems. </jats:p>",

To facilitate the design of effective programs to increase condom use, this study examines survey data on the determinants of having ever used condoms and on current condom use with regular and casual partners among unmarried young people in urban Cameroon. While most adolescents have tried condoms at least once, use remains inconsistent. Parental support, personal risk perception, and self‐efficacy are found to be associated with higher levels of condom use, Youth‐oriented programs seeking to increase the number of new condom users among the young should promote parental support for condom use and enhance young people's perceptions of personal risk. Programs that work to convince the young that their sexual history can put them at risk of HIV infection and that dispel the myth that HIV risk with regular partners is low may serve to increase personal risk perception. Finally, communications programs should aim to increase adolescents' self‐efficacy, particularly in terms of their perceived ability to convince partners to use condoms and to use them correctly.</jats:p>",

Data are drawn from a 1993–94 community‐based study of women's autonomy in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, states that are, respectively, more and less patriarchal. Matched data were obtained from 1,660 women and their husbands. Results indicate no more than a loose agreement between women and their husbands concerning the dimensions of women's autonomy within the home. Where disagreement is expressed, husbands are more likely to project a comparatively liberal picture of their wives' autonomy than do their wives, and the inference can be made that in surveys men tended to provide more “acceptable” responses than when they were questioned in greater depth. Findings also suggest that cultural context affects the influences that wives' and their husbands' perceptions of women's autonomy have on reproductive outcomes. A clear regional divide is seen, net of individual and household characteristics, in the influence of almost every aspect of women's autonomy.</jats:p>",

Studies increasingly find that this connection is weakening and thus attempts to address urban transport problems with land-use policies are ineffective. The author introduces proximate commuting, a novel employer-based program that decreases urban commuting by providing marginal accessibility improvements to its participants. With the aid of a case study involving a commercial bank in the Western Detroit Metropolitan Area, the author examines individuals' motivations for participating in a proximate-commuting program. Results show that 25% of bank tellers surveyed state that they are willing to take advantage of this accessibility-improvement program. Estimation of a discrete-choice model reveals that gender; expected improvements in accessibility; and better job prospects are three key factors explaining individuals' stated willingness to proximate commute. To the extent that these results hold more generally, they underscore the usefulness of interventions that rely on marginal improvements of home-to-work accessibility. Furthermore, the case illustrates an innovative approach for addressing transport challenges that is both politically palatable and enhances individual choices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examines the determinants of the use of four types of reproductive health‐care services in Uttar Pradesh, India: contraceptive services, antenatal care, delivery in a medical institution, and services dealing with reproductive tract and sexually transmitted infections. The analysis uses a multilevel modeling strategy to assess the presence of household‐ and community‐level variation in service use. The influence of community‐level characteristics and reproductive health‐care service attributes on service use is examined. The results highlight strong community‐level influences on service use, although the type of community effect varies by service type. The role of some individual and household factors in determining a person's use of services is mediated by the characteristics of the community in which the individual lives. The results demonstrate the need to look beyond individual factors when examining health‐care‐seeking behavior, and illustrate that there is no singular “community” effect on service use.</jats:p>",

The multilevel network consists of: the logistical network, the informational network, and the financial network. We describe the behavior of the network decisionmakers, which are spatially separated and which consist of the manufacturers and producing firms, the retailers, and the consumers located at the demand markets. We propose a projected dynamical system, along with stability analysis results, that captures the adjustments of the commodity shipments and the prices over space and time. A discrete-time adjustment process is described and implemented in order to illustrate in several numerical examples the evolution of the commodity shipments and prices to the equilibrium solution. </jats:p>",

It shows how the construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods and is associated with an increase in neighborhood racial change. Finally, the article shows how the citys black community moved from a position of quietly protesting the interstate highway system to one in which a black neighborhood forced government to alter plans that would have destroyed a section of a predominantly black public housing project. In so doing, the article shows how black neighborhoods, over time, moved from a position of adapting to the racial aspects of various planning tools to one in which they sought to modify these tools so that they would benefit, or at least not harm, the black community. </jats:p>",

The first method allows us to determine quantitative parameters of rolling stock (i.e. kilometers logged, efficiency, turnover, etc.). The second is based on specially developed mathematical models relying on qualitative characteristics such as relative expenses, efficiency of the particular train, relative expenditure of resources, cost of the trains, etc.\n\n\nPlanning the volume of the rolling stock the determination of optimal service life of the trains plays an important role.

Supply chain planning processes are identified and analysed using a supply chain management focus. The paper also gives a brief introduction to a framework for supply chain management and to the typical structure of electronic marketplaces. Furthermore, three collaborative supply chain planning scenarios are defined, and it is shown how collaborative supply chain planning typically could be implemented on an electronic marketplace by the means of a Web‐based demonstration. As such, the paper shows how electronic marketplaces can be used to enable supply chain integration.</jats:p>",

The development was led by the private sector but government played an important role. This paper traces how the federal government shaped the Irvine development through a range of policies and programmes from defence to habitat protection. In turn, the developers of Irvine were cast in a role of co-ordinating parts of government. This analysis highlights some of the problems likely to be faced as governments promote similarly phased, co-ordinated and mixed-use proposals under the rubric of smart growth or sustainable development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The overall planning performance of the fisheries sector in Bangladesh over the past three decades was evaluated. Performance has been unsatisfactory largely due to contiguous overestimation of the planning targets and the existence of serious financial, technological, institutional and social constraints. Despite the remarkable growth in export earnings and a stable GDP contribution of 3.2–5.6%, budget allocations remained extremely low (0.7–1.4% of total outlay) in subsequent plan periods. Production from marine fisheries performed satisfactorily with slow growth in recent years, while inland fisheries with initial poor performance showed improvements from the mid-1980s owing to increased productivity in culture fisheries, particularly in pond aquaculture. Targets should be determined with the aid of a thorough review of past performances and there is an urgent need to streamline the implementation capability. Also, a shift from production-oriented planning and seeking technical solutions only to addressing broader institutional and social issues affecting the fisheries sector is essential. Government should emphasize the development of small-scale fisheries, strengthen extension–research linkage, improve infrastructure, build partnerships between relevant agencies and shift its top-down approach to planning towards a participatory bottom-up approach so as to release existing bottlenecks. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The human brain has a remarkable ability to generate plans for sequences of actions that allow human agents to co-operate with and to manipulate the behaviour of others. It is widely claimed that the operations underlying plan developments, behaviour sequencing and inhibition of inappropriate responses to the environment are carried out in the prefrontal cortex. This implies that the prefrontal cortex is a natural system with the capacity to utilise cognitive technology. The present paper argues that social competence is a manifestation of action planning in which other agents feature as plan elements. Accordingly, plans that involve other agents are expected to be more complex than plans which do not. In the light of evidence that negative information makes particularly heavy processing demands, social judgements involving prohibition or unacceptability are expected to create most difficulty for the human action planning system. These assumptions were tested by measuring the ability of patients with prefrontal injuries to detect anomalous action sequences, using a specially constructed <jats:italic>Action Acceptability Test.</jats:italic> It was hypothesised that if the frontal lobes play a major role in action planning, patients with frontal lobe injuries should show impaired ability to detect faulty action plans, particularly when such plans relate to complex social action sequences, and action sequences involving unacceptable behaviours.\n</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>                 The hypotheses were generally supported as frontal-injury patients proved to be worse at detecting both complex social sequences and deviant action sequences than participants with non-frontal injuries and normal control participants. The results of the study are consistent with the view that human social competence results from the cognitive processes associated with action planning and the data also supports the claim that action planning processes are specifically disrupted by damage to the prefrontal cortex.\n</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>                 The findings provide some confirmation for the Cognitive Technology perspective, in that action planning does seem to be physically associated with a specific brain area, and including social agents and deviations from acceptability in action plans do seem to be manipulations that operate to make action plans more difficult to process, hence causing more errors in individuals with damage to the prefrontal cortex. The results also provide some encouragement for the belief that new cognitive tools can be constructed that link brain processes to other levels of description, such as social behaviour. The <jats:italic>Action Acceptability Test,</jats:italic> a prognostic tool developed to predict the social competence of frontal-injury patients, is offered as one such example.</jats:p>",

RG-DEVS, an extension of classic DEVS, expands the classes of system models that can be represented in DEVS. The goal regression method of the artificial intelligence (AI) production system is exploited for the dynamic generation of the model’s sequential states and selection of state transition rules during model execution. Thus, generated states and rules form subgoals and an action plan, respectively. The mechanism for detecting missed execution of the plan and building an amended or new plan for performing corrective actions is also provided. An example application to a transportation vehicle is given to show how RG-DEVS can be applied. </jats:p>",

In addition, it is evident that strategic planning firms achieve better performance than other firms. However, strategic planning often fails due to problems or barriers encountered at the implementation stage. It is unclear from the limited research carried out to date what actions, if any, firms can take to minimise or eliminate these barriers. This paper examines the concept of strategic planning and identifies the barriers to its implementation. It considers the suitability of formal strategic planning as the key to eliminating or reducing implementation barriers by comparing the extent to which the barriers are experienced in formal and non‐formal planning firms. The paper also examines the extent to which the barriers are experienced by high and low performing firms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Current public education, overwhelmed by piece‐meal reform efforts, is in need of <jats:italic>systemic</jats:italic> renewal. An investigation of key literature – systems methods, instructional design, and group process models – yields the conditions necessary for <jats:italic>systemic change</jats:italic> and a suitable base model. Namely, a successful systemic educational change effort is <jats:italic>ideal‐based, holistic, continuing, participatory, user‐friendly, easy to adjust/improve</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>emancipatory</jats:italic>. A suitable base model is discovered in the learning systems of Alcoholics Anonymous and then built on for a new model: the Roundtable (RT) for secular learning. Briefly, the RT session is designed so that leadership and learning opportunities are distributed among all participants, who have equal time to present their ideas. Pilot studies in professional scientific organizations allowed refinement of the model. This study investigated sought the seven conditions in four RT applications in 4th‐grade classrooms in California. Participants at each site were the teacher and their 30±1 students. Each teacher held ten RT sessions, with students leading two to three of the last four sessions. Evidence was sought in the RT texts, session recordings, and users’ views. The criteria were met in the following ways. The RT applications were: <jats:italic>ideal‐based</jats:italic> in the RT texts; <jats:italic>user‐friendly</jats:italic> as they were user‐ready and engaging; <jats:italic>easy to adjust/improve</jats:italic> in the simple revision session tasks, and <jats:italic>emancipatory</jats:italic> as users learned in important, positive and unanticipated ways. The RT applications were <jats:italic>holistic</jats:italic>: found suitable for all classroom levels at both schools, and for all school groups at one school. They were <jats:italic>continuing</jats:italic> after the study in 2 or 3 of the four classrooms. They were very <jats:italic>participatory</jats:italic> in the roles of listener, reader, and speaker; somewhat participatory in the leader and co‐planner roles. Contributions to organizational /educational change theory and future projects are promising.</jats:p>",

The context of this thesis is a verification program of a treatment planning system. It is shown that an appropriately designed “combinatorial verification” makes such a program feasible. Results of this thesis apply to megavoltage photon beams in homogeneous and heterogeneous geometries, to proton beams, and to dose–volume representations. A “field accuracy” concept is shown to facilitate simultaneous checks of dose and distance criteria. This concept is applied to pencil beam calculations in partially blocked photon beams. In a lung tumor phantom large dose discrepancies were found between photon pencil beam calculations and film measurements. This is due to improper scatter handling, as is shown by comparison to results of a point spread kernel algorithm. Methods have been developed for high‐resolution measurements of photon beam edges with ionization chambers, thus in particular suited for a program of routine verification measurements. Improvements in accuracy of up to 2 mm in the penumbra have been achieved. Dose distributions and penumbras in small proton beams have been investigated with Monte Carlo calculations and a 2D scintillating screen detector. Accuracy of grid‐based volume sampling has been studied, yielding the required grid sizes for specific uncertainties in the volume representation of dose–volume histograms. Finally, bringing the concepts of combinatorial verification and field accuracy together, the feasibility of a comprehensive presentation of calculation accuracy in a conformal prostate treatment plan has been demonstrated.</jats:p>",

An earlier critical theory provides a framework for exploring the themes of communication, rationality and domination. Technology, process and organization are forms of domination that may appear in the context of ERP adoption. The literature on the formal and informal (qualitative) justification of information technology investment is reviewed and assessed. The significance of ERP systems is examined and also motives for their adoption. The data used for the study are electronically mediated justifications of ERP adoption that were presented by universities. A content analysis is applied to these data. The paper concludes that, despite reservations about the sensitivity of domination and emancipation to identification and measurement, there is some evidence to suggest people are considered to occupy a subservient role to technology, process and organization. </jats:p>",

The powerful sensation of barely controlled chaos that pervades the atmosphere of urbanity in the South has proven globally inspirational and challenges Western world’s model of urbanization and modernization. This paper draws upon the particular case of Vietnam. It is premised upon the belief that there exists the possibility to embrace informal and/or illegal settlements and activities into a Vietnamese urbanity for the 21st century. Vietnam has the opportunity to develop an ambivalent urbanity – one where ‘place culture’ meets globalization. A balance can be struck between the forces of stability and the forces of mobility in the country’s hybrid urban landscapes. Two very different but complementary elements of landscapes need to continue to develop in parallel – one established, maintained and governed by law and political institutions, dedicated to permanence and planned evolution; the other, the vernacular landscape, identified with local custom, pragmatic adaptation to circumstances, and unpredictable mobility/change. The informal and/or illegal elements within Vietnamese urbanity can become the strategic points to create such a balance. Examples in three secondary cities (Vinh, Hue and Can Tho) of Vietnam are explored for their respective qualities which undeniably tie the informal urbanity to ‘genus loci’ and suggest manners in which these hybrid landscapes can become a formal and legitimate part of future urban development.</jats:p>",

While these icons generally provide a sense of place to the community helping it to identify with the built environment, certain additions to the skyline may be unpopular and may take away from this sense of place and belonging. Most Sydneysiders believed that the ‘Toaster’ would visually “intrude” into the city’s skyline, partially block out public access to some cherished views and interfere with the visual space of the familiar icons that form the city’s skyscape. Having followed proper and appropriate development approval process, however, the developer could successfully withstand a lengthy community protest and negative media campaign aimed at blocking the development. However, the community opinion created its own pressures in the shape of options and imperatives for the various actors involved in the planning and development control process and brought to light various shortcomings of the planning system that allowed an unpopular development to proceed. The following paper touches upon some of the major issues related to this saga and presents facts in a case study fashion. It is hoped the case-study will shed light on the nature of the community’s response that is generated against negatively perceived development and the potential impact of community sentiment on the planning process. It is also hoped to learn some useful lessons from the Sydney experience so that we may better utilize the community sentiment as a resource in shaping our cities for the better.</jats:p>",

Therefore, the development of new process chains requires a critical review, or even a redesign of suitable manufacturing equipment. The application of simulation tools and “virtual prototyping” can support this process as the technology's impact on the machine design can be evaluated without the need for building costly prototypes.

In this paper I challenge this assumption by charting the changing characterization of India, from being virtually synonymous with Asia for centuries to being virtually excluded from the reigning conceptions of Asia. I provide a thumbnail sketch of the spatial imaginaries of some of the peoples inhabiting the cartographic quadrant labeled ‘Asia‘. Against this background, I examine how these imaginaries were subverted by the incorporation of Asia within the capitalist world system. I then chart the impact of modernization theories on the newly independent states of the region. I argue that as several major centers of capital accumulation emerged in Asia, and capitalism ceased to be a Euro-American narrative, a new conception of Asia emerged in the 1980s. If India's lack of industrial development marginalized it from these imaginaries, it is suggested that the meltdown of the Asian ‘miracles' has once again destabilized hitherto-dominant conceptions of Asia. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes an optimal trajectory planning of walking locomotion for a planar biped walking mechanism which has thighs, shanks and small feet. The biped mechanism was modeled to be a 3-degree-of-freedom (dof) link system composed of a stance leg and a 2-dof swing leg. The one step walking locomotion is divided into two phases, i.e., the swing motion of 2-dof swing until knee collision and the swing motion of the straight leg until toe collision. It is assumed that the knee collision of the swing leg and the toe collision at the foot exchange are plastic and occur instantly. The motion of the swing and stance legs in the first phase is solved by the optimal trajectory planning based on the function approximation method. Under the full-actuated condition at the hip, knee and ankle joints, we obtained the optimal trajectory solution with a minimum square integral of input torque. We also obtained a sub-optimal walking locomotion for an under-actuated system whose ankle is a passive joint. The validity of the optimal trajectory solution is confirmed by a forward dynamic simulation. The optimal trajectory solution for the human body parameter values exhibits a natural and stable walking locomotion with the step length of 0.33 m and a step period of 0.62 s.</jats:p>",

The action modules are assembled into an action plan with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A successful plan allows the robot to complete the task without violating any physical constraints. Plans are developed that explicitly consider constraints such as power, actuator saturation, wheel slip, and vehicle stability. These are verified using analytical models of the robot and environment. The methodology is described in the context of planetary exploration similar to the NASA Mars Pathfinder mission. More aggressive missions are planned where rovers will explore scientifically important areas that are difficult to reach (e.g., ravines, craters, dry riverbeds, and steep cliffs). The proposed approach is designed for such areas.</jats:p>",

This process is complicated by the lexicographer’s own attitude towards the language and the public’s sensitivity on language matters. The recent publication of the two most authoritative dictionaries of Modern Greek and their respective lexical coverage reveals the continuing survival of the underlying ideologies of the two sponsoring institutions concerning the history of the Greek language, as well as their opposing standpoints on the language question over the past decades, some 25 years after the constitutional resolution of the Greek diglossia, affecting the way they describe the synchronic state of language. The two dictionaries proceed from opposing starting points in attempting to influence and set a pace for the standardisation of Modern Greek by presenting two different aspects of the synchronic state of Greek, one of which focuses on the long history of the language and thus takes the present state to be only a link in an uninterrupted chain dating from antiquity, and the other of which focuses on the present state of Greek and thus takes this fully developed autonomous code to be the outcome of past linguistic processes and socio-cultural changes in response to the linguistic community’s present needs. The absence of a sufficiently representative corpus has restrained the descriptive capacity of the two dictionaries and has given space for ideology to come into play, despite the fact that both dictionaries have made concessions in order to account for the present-day Greek language.</jats:p>",

This paper describes the development of a new automated approach for use by the planners to generate earthworks activities that overcomes such limitations. As well as creating activity sets in a much shorter time, the ability to compare various sets allows the planner more scope when planning earthworks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I deal with a recent effort, conducted jointly by corporate and voluntary bodies, to create a themed cultural environment in Chennai (formerly Madras), the capital city of the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. This project, not yet completed, fuses craft center with architectural reconstruction, and is the work of upper-caste, globally connected elites. The site, Dakshina Chitra, envisions southern Indian culture and history in ways that are tied to consumerism and to elite perceptions of regional and national heritage. This effort departs from and poses a critique of the versions of culture, history, and identity that have been inscribed by the state in urban public space during the second half of the 20th century—the statues, monuments, and memorials that celebrate Tamil ethnicity as promulgated in the Dravidianist sociopolitical movement. This movement, which originated in the late 19th century, provided a platform for anticolonial and subaltern social movements. It continues in the hands of the political parties who have controlled, at different times, the government of Tamil Nadu since 1967. The competing discourses on heritage posed by these different projects are indicative of political, economic, and cultural transformations associated with liberalization that are now reconfiguring the relations between state and society in southern India. The constructions of locality and history that became visible during the anticolonial struggle of the first half of the 20th century are being challenged by alternative formulations as heritage becomes a marketable good and consumption becomes a vehicle of political participation. With this case I consider the ways that themed urban environments serve not only as indices of the changing political economy, but also as markers of changes in the cultural mediation of political subjectivity. </jats:p>",

While Rossi’s study has clearly withstood the test of time, since it still has much to teach us about the history of an idea — what Urquhart would call “pure eloquence” — his study has less utility in clarifying the status of that idea in history. Understanding Urquhart’s <jats:italic>Jewel</jats:italic> requires, I argue, two different forms of history whose interplay is always complicated: the history of ideas and the history of those politically charged engagements with ideas by authors whose situation at a specific time and a specific place brings meanings to their work that transcend epistemological concerns alone.</jats:p>",

However, real‐world decision‐making processes always have several social concerns and thus multiple objectives need to be achieved simultaneously. In most cases, these objective functions conflict with each other and are also not simple enough to be combined into a single one. Therefore it is necessary to apply multiobjective optimization to generate non‐dominated or Pareto optimal alternatives. It can be foreseen that the multiobjective bilevel modeling approach can become a powerful, and possibly interactive, decision tool, allowing the decision‐makers to learn more about the problem before committing to a final decision. Such multiobjective bilevel models are difficult to solve due to their intrinsic nonconvexity and multiple objectives. This paper consequently proposes a solution algorithm for the multiobjective bilevel models using genetic algorithms. The proposed algorithm is illustrated, using the numerical example taken from the previous study. It is found that the proposed algorithm is efficient to search simultaneously the Pareto optimal solutions.</jats:p>",

It explores especially the relationship between size of municipality and turnout in local elections. The author seeks to explore this issue in the light of Dahl and Tufte's 1973 classic study Size and Democracy (Stanford University Press) which claimed that citizens' motivation to participate is greater in small governmental units than in large ones. This study confirms the Dahl and Tufte hypothesis, in that turnout is consistently higher over time in small municipalities in all the countries reviewed, although the strength of the relationship varies between the different countries. The paper also shows that other factors, such as the type of electoral system used or whether voting is compulsory or not, also have an effect on turnout. </jats:p>",

This article discusses New Zealand’s four structures with an emphasis on relocating the critical functions of health care planning and purchasing, and on the development of the present district health board system. The four structures include: an area health board system (1989‐1991) with planning and purchasing located at “home” in local areas and closely aligned with service provision; a competitive internal market system (1993‐1996) which separated planning and purchasing from service provision; a centralised system with a “headquarters” controlling planning and purchasing (1997‐1999) while maintaining the distance from provision; and the district health board system currently under development (1999‐) which sees purchasing and planning sent home again to regions and linked closely with service provision. The present system entails the devolution of considerable responsibility to the local level, within a framework of strong central government control. Based on New Zealand’s experience, the article notes that all but the market structure appear to have provided an adequate environment for effective health care planning and purchasing.</jats:p>",

The MRC's 2001 Work Programme represents a shift in Mekong basin planning from the era of the Mekong Committee. This shift is largely embodied by a change from a project–oriented focus to an emphasis on better management and preservation of existing resources. The MRC is in a position to help address the related issues of population growth, environmental preservation and regional security. In doing so, the MRC will benefit from the programmes and international collaboration established by its predecessors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore the key elements of the mode of regulation operating at the urban scale in Toronto's postwar period to learn what it was that inspired an entire generation of scholars to call Toronto the ‘city that works' in this period. Despite the significant amount of literature discussing the general character of regulation operating at the city-region scale in the Fordist or managerial period of urban development, it is argued that surprisingly little empirical research has actually documented what allegedly made these Fordist metropolitan regions ‘work‘. Drawing on archival research in addition to insights from Canadian applied regulation theory and from an analysis of Canada's changing fiscal federalism, I argue that, although Toronto did develop within the context of a Fordist regime of accumulation, the particular elements of the mode of regulation it developed at the urban scale were distinctive and important in providing the conditions underlying the economic success of the region. Toronto may have benefited disproportionately from national regulatory policies. However, its economic dynamism also constituted one of the cornerstones of the nation's economic and social viability. Further, its more localized regulatory structures and social context had a specific institutional and cultural richness, which, in concert with its highly developed economic structure, served to stave off many of the crisis tendencies being felt by other industrial regions in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the principal and unique institutional innovations was the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (’Metro'), which can be regarded as a key (although hitherto underemphasized) component of the Canadian Fordist regime of accumulation. More than just a conduit through which nationally driven Keynesian welfare programs were delivered, Metro was also an innovator of unique urban-based postwar development policies. I conclude by demonstrating what this story of postwar Toronto can tell us more generally about urban government and governance under Fordism, and about the managerial paradigm and the regulation approach. </jats:p>",

The necessary steps for LM fabrication of heterogeneous objects include representation and process planning of material information inside an object. This paper introduces a new processing planning method that takes into account the processing of material information. The detailed tasks are pre-processing (discretization), orientation (build direction selection), and adaptive slicing of heterogeneous objects. In particular, this paper focuses on the discretization process that converts all of the material information inside a heterogeneous object into material features like geometric features. It is thus possible to choose an optimal build direction among various preselected ones by approximately estimating build time. This is because total build time depends on the complexity of features. This discretization process also allows adaptive slicing of heterogeneous objects to minimize surface finish and material composition error. In addition, tool path planning can be simplified into fill pattern generation. Examples are shown to illustrate the overall procedure.</jats:p>",

The authors attempt to help scholars from other countries understand the development of economic geography in China by showing how such development has been affected by the country's institutional and economic conditions. They first introduce the context in which economic geography has developed in China and discuss changes in the definition of economic geography in the country. They then examine post-1949 development of economic geography in China in terms of research orientations or tasks, funding, and organization. The authors argue that the development of economic geography is embedded in a broad socioeconomic and institutional context and that this context is key to understanding the development of economic geography in different countries. </jats:p>",

They produce specific geographies of knowing but also create geographies of ignorance. Taking Southeast Asia as an example, in this paper I explore how areas are imagined and how area knowledge is structured to construct area ‘heartlands' as well as area ‘borderlands‘. This is illustrated by considering a large region of Asia (here named Zomia) that did not make it as a world area in the area dispensation after World War 2 because it lacked strong centres of state formation, was politically ambiguous, and did not command sufficient scholarly clout. As Zomia was quartered and rendered peripheral by the emergence of strong communities of area specialists of East, Southeast, South, and Central Asia, the production of knowledge about it slowed down. I suggest that we need to examine more closely the academic politics of scale that create and sustain area studies, at a time when the spatialisation of social theory enters a new, uncharted terrain. The heuristic impulse behind imagining areas, and the high-quality, contextualised knowledge that area studies produce, may be harnessed to imagine other spatial configurations, such as ‘crosscutting’ areas, the worldwide honeycomb of borderlands, or the process geographies of transnational flows. Scholars of all conventional areas can be involved in this project to ‘jump scale’ and to develop new concepts of regional space. </jats:p>",

Over centuries, its port’s trading and defence potential has attracted merchants, colonials, feudal lords, intellectuals and political and economic migrants. These migrant groups in turn, have contributed towards the development and degradation of the city and its centre, ‘Saddar Bazaar’. In the past 50 years, due to an immense increase in the size of the population of Karachi and the expansion of its geographical boundaries, several centres have developed, serving their locale. However, the importance of ‘Saddar’ as a cultural and economic centre still remains, as none of the other have been able to develop the required commerce or culture related facilities which could serve the whole city. Saddar lies in the economic hub of the city and serves thousands of vehicles and transit commuters who pass through it. This has lead to the degradation of its facilities and fast disappearance of its cultural spaces. The absence of these in turn, is resulting in alienation amongst communities, ghettoisation of rich and poor areas and a cultural division of the city. This paper attempts to analyse the process of Saddar’s transformation, identifying the inherent processes and agents of change, and gives some suggestions for its future rehabilitation.</jats:p>",

Neal’s Theory can be applied to preparation for disasters that could confront home health nurses, providing the framework for planning, training, and oversight that the home health agency can use to ensure that the home health nurse is prepared.

The process leading to the realization of some of these targets is useful for conditioning the capacity for increasing the economy of the community. One of the characteristics of society that has gone hand in hand with economic development is marked by the widespread use of technology and changes in a more positive direction from the mindset of the people to institutional institutions. The research method used as an analytical tool in this study is a descriptive type with the aim of obtaining a projected representation of a participation and procedural regulatory mechanism in the community during the process of preparing the RPJMD in Medan City from 2010 to 2025. The analytical steps used are secondary data or data. supporting information in the form of a collection of information regarding the results of interviews with respondents as well as providing an appropriate presentation with an explanation of the matrix accompanied by the presentation that has been displayed by the researcher. The variety of informants or respondents used as a collection of information in this study involved various elements such as social organizations, elements from the Medan city government to academics under the auspices of universities to the mass media and the main element is the Medan City DPRD. The process of compiling the results of this research is oriented towards a question and answer process or interviews by applying qualitative analysis steps with the aim of criticizing various phenomena in the process of preparing reports and investigating phenomena regarding the research topic. The continuation of the process is a data analysis technique using logical interpretation supported by previously collected data. The results of this study are that in development planning, Medan City has a challenge by having to handle an area of 265.10 km2, with an estimated population density of 9,836.56 people/km2 in 2025. This population increase can be an obstacle in handling development planning., however This is also an opportunity if the government can take advantage of this population increase. For population growth itself in 2025 there will be a decline, which in 2020 is expected to grow by 1.03 to 0.94% in 2025.</jats:p>"

With the development of a number of degree and postgraduate courses, such as International Disaster Engineering and Management at Coventry University, a significant change in the emergency planning profession has occurred. Add to this recent incidents such as the severe flooding in the UK and central Europe, the foot-and-mouth crisis, the Yarls Wood Immigration Centre fire, the fuel crisis and the terrorist attacks on the United States and the picture of the dynamic and ever-changing environment in which emergency planning officers now work becomes clear. Emergency planning has developed into a diverse,modern profession that in light of these incidents has become the responsibility of us all. This short paper looks at and explains the legislation that relates to emergency plan-ning, the role of emergency planning departments in local government, the emergency planning process and what the role of local government should be in response to an incident. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present a new method for generating collision-free paths for robots operating in changing environments. Our approach is closely related to recent probabilistic roadmap approaches. These planners use preprocessing and query stages, and are aimed at planning many times in the same environment. In contrast, our preprocessing stage creates a representation of the configuration space that can be easily modified in real time to account for changes in the environment, thus facilitating real-time planning. As with previous approaches, we begin by constructing a graph that represents a roadmap in the configuration space, but we do not construct this graph for a specific workspace. Instead, we construct the graph for an obstacle-free workspace, and encode the mapping from workspace cells to nodes and arcs in the graph. When the environment changes, this mapping is used to make the appropriate modifications to the graph, and plans can be generated by searching the modified graph. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, we first discuss the construction of the roadmap, including how random samples of the configuration space are generated using an importance sampling approach and how these samples are connected to form the roadmap. We then discuss the mapping from the workspace to the configuration space roadmap, explaining how the mapping is generated and how it can be encoded efficiently using compression schemes that exploit redundancy in the mapping. We then introduce quantitative robustness measures and show how these can be used to enhance the robustness of the roadmap to changes in the environment. Finally, we evaluate an implementation of our approach for serial-link manipulators with up to 20 joints. </jats:p>",

It changed the health care system and its financing (by introducing a Bismarckian style of social insurance). It then redistributed power from the Ministry of Health to several stakeholders. A major change occurred in the labor market in health care when the flow of health professionals from the newly independent countries greatly decreased. The decrease was partly due to the consequences of the war in the Balkans and partly due to independent labor legislation in Slovenia.

Inspite of these advantages, spherical designs have failed to gain popularity due to complexity of their motion planning and control problems. In this paper, we address the motion planning problem for the rolling sphere, often referred in the literature as the “ball-plate problem,” and propose two different algorithms for reconfiguration. The first algorithm, based on simple geometry, uses a standard kinematic model and invokes alternating inputs to obtain a solution comprised of circular arcs and straight line segments. The second algorithm is based on the Gauss-Bonet theorem of parallel transport and achieves reconfiguration through spherical triangle maneuvers. While the second algorithm is inherently simple and provides a solution comprised of straight line segments only, the first algorithm provides the basis for development of a stabilizing controller. Our stabilizing controller, which will be presented in our next paper, will be the first solution to a problem that has eluded many researchers since the kinematic model of the sphere cannot be converted to chained form. Both our algorithms require numerical computation of a small number of parameters and provide the scope for easy implementation.</jats:p>",

Whether legislative decisions are taken in a direct democratic assembly or in a representative parliament largely depends on the size of a municipality: smaller municipalities have an assembly, larger ones a parliament. By contrast, direct democratic instruments such as initiatives and referendums are not necessarily more widespread in larger municipalities. The use of initiatives and referendums is higher in larger municipalities, but assembly attendance and election turnout clearly decreases with increasing municipal size. The strength of the size effect varies considerably depending on the different variables of direct democracy under scrutiny. </jats:p>",

We identify the particular significance of calculative practices such as benchmarking and allied techniques in constituting global imaginaries in the New Zealand context. We then demonstrate how our method might inform a case study of the globalising retail-banking sector by revealing multiple spaces and subjects. In analysing the emergence of new economic spaces and subjectivities in this way, our aim is to give situated content to the concept of global imaginaries and to make visible the constitutive power of governing practices. </jats:p>",

Second, what is the relationship between citizens' trust in elected local government officials and the size of local government units? These questions were answered on the basis of survey data from Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway and the United Kingdom. We found that trust in local officeholders is typically and often considerably higher than trust in national politicians. Moreover, the evidence from these four countries suggests that size of municipality has a modest negative effect on political trust. Further evidence suggests that this negative effect is the result of a tendency of citizens in small municipalities to be more satisfied with their local government than residents in large units. This further evidence also shows that whatever its origins (intensive personal relations or a dense network of civil organisations) social trust is not vital for an adequate understanding of political trust. </jats:p>",

The primary question of interest is whether or not there is any systematic relationship between these forms of nonelectoral participation and the size of local political – administrative units. It is argued that, to the extent it is reasonable to expect size to be relevant, the nature of the relationships is likely to vary from one form of participation to another. Analyses are based on survey data collected during the 1990s in each country by means of logistic regression with a common set of variables. Although the findings vary somewhat from one country to another, and are not always in keeping with theoretical expectations, they nonetheless indicate that size does indeed appear to make some difference, even after controlling for the effects of individual characteristics. The effect of size, in other words, is not merely a byproduct of the compositional characteristics of the individuals living in different sized municipalities, as is sometimes suggested. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I draw upon a realist conceptualization of power to inform the analysis of ethnographic data on access to irrigation water and vulnerability to flood hazard in Pakistan. I undertake an integrated analysis of the role of different types of power in influencing differential vulnerability to flood hazard and access to irrigation water in four local-level villages in central Pakistan. Three modes of power are identified: the feudal mode, the bourgeoisie mode, and the communal mode. Each of the modes relies on force, socialization, and control over resources, respectively, to ensure compliance. The villages which are dominated by large landowners tend to have the feudal mode of power as the predominant power structure, whereas the villages with relatively equal property ownership tend to have the communal mode as the dominant power structure. The analyses of power suggest that the participatory reforms in the water sector of Pakistan proposed by the World Bank are unlikely to lead to gains in either equity or efficiency as long as issues of differential power remain unaddressed. </jats:p>",

The risk increase is assumed to be the result of interference between transport flows. No systematic research has been performed so far to test this hypothesis. This paper therefore presents the results of an empirical study on this subject based on accident data from the Netherlands. It is concluded that clustering of infrastructures has not caused a higher probability of accidents in the past. However, impacts of accidents in terms of the number of casualties are significantly more severe. This generates new discussions on the spatial planning of infrastructures on the one hand and the organisation of emergency response capabilities on the other. </jats:p>",

This paper describes forces and mechanisms which, under favourable conditions, promote dissemination of know-how through the dynamics of regional cycles of learning. Enriching earlier insights into the local embedding of subsidiaries and processes of cumulative causation, it emphasises why and how agglom-erating branches of globally operating technology companies engage in upgrading their less developed locality: effects are triggered by a combination of increasing regional labour-cost pressure and corresponding reactions of firms which relate to their branch activities and affect the institutional framework. Two models of regional cycles of learning are introduced which depict crucial distinctions between spatial clusters of technology firms with and without foreign affiliates. Empirical evidence is provided by comparing two technology regions in developing Asia: Bangalore, India, and Bandung, Indonesia. Both are well endowed with universities, research institutions, and firms in technology sectors, but differ with regard to the presence of foreign firms, and accordingly, display divergent qualitative developments. </jats:p>",

The paper has two points of entry to the commodity chain; first, a productionist perspective aimed at revealing how the material commodity is constituted, and, second, a consumptionist viewpoint, intended to show the construction of symbolic elements of the commodity. The value of the breakfast cereal commodity includes both its utility (food) value, and the semiotic and moral narratives associated with it—its symbolic value. To maintain these value dimensions the breakfast cereal companies have fashioned relationships with other organisations to legitimise prod-ucts in the eyes of the consumers. Both governmental and nongovernmental organisations are drawn into the commodity chain, and along with consumers, they actively participate in the recreation and redescription of the commodity's value. Through adhering to the analytical strategy of delineating both production and consumption dimensions the case study was able to establish the multiple layering of meanings that are associated with breakfast cereals—meanings that continue to be aligned with the industry's founding principles. </jats:p>",

We consider how far each of these ‘vocabularies' can be interpreted as a mode of blaming, and draw conclusions linking our analysis to wider relational and moral tensions. Our analysis suggests that blame, although conceptually powerful, falters under empirical scrutiny. On this basis we argue for a more sensitive reading of responsibility discourses in academic debate and enquiry.

In this paper, I examine the interplay between local autonomy and central control in one post-Soviet central government—Ukraine—by examining the case of small-enterprise privatization. Shortly after Ukraine's independence, the central government transferred ownership of state-run small enterprises to local governments, but required that local governments meet annual privatization targets set by a central agency. Some local governments have met the annual targets, while others have lagged behind. The results of an empirical analysis of local privatization levels indicate that central control mechanisms currently have limited influence over local decisionmaking. The results demonstrate that, instead, local elections have increased the influence of local groups whose interests do not always coincide with those of the central government. In response, the central government has instituted several changes to the intergovernmental finance system that are likely to increase central government authority and continue to move Ukraine towards a system in which local governments carry a heavy service-delivery load with limited autonomy. </jats:p>",

The paper takes a contingency approach to explore the factors that impact production planning and control for closed‐loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery. A series of three cases are presented, and a framework developed that shows the common activities required for all remanufacturing operations. To build on the similarities and illustrate and integrate the differences in closed‐loop supply chains, Hayes and Wheelwright’s product–process matrix is used as a foundation to examine the three cases representing Remanufacture‐to‐Stock (RMTS), Reassemble‐to‐Order (RATO), and Remanufacture‐to‐Order (RMTO). These three cases offer end‐points and an intermediate point for closed‐loop supply operations. Since they represent different positions on the matrix, characteristics such as returns volume, timing, quality, product complexity, test and evaluation complexity, and remanufacturing complexity are explored. With a contingency theory for closed‐loop supply chains that incorporate product recovery in place, past cases can now be reexamined and the potential for generalizability of the approach to similar types of other problems and applications can be assessed and determined.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The move towards workfare and active labour-market policies is often alleged to be closely associated with the decentralisation and localisation of welfare delivery and agencies. In the United Kingdom, the New Deal for the young unemployed was designed to introduce local flexibility and discretion in delivery to mainstream labour-market policy. We use case studies of five local areas to examine the extent to which the programme has actually been decentralised and benefited from ‘local flexibility’. We categorise the arguments for policy decentralisation under four main rationales—improved policy learning and adaptation, stronger partnership building, more innovation, and greater resource targeting—and examine the achievements and limitations of the programme under each. We argue that, although the contractualism of the New Deal has allowed a certain degree of local discretion and cooperation in delivery, there have been strong standardised bureaucratic and financial constraints on the real extent of territorial flexibility. Although the limited decentralisation achieved has yielded some of the predicted benefits, the centralised nature of labour-market policy in the United Kingdom is proving resistant to change and, paradoxically, the programme is producing uneven results across the country. To conclude, we consider whether more local flexibility would be sufficient to improve the performance of the programme. </jats:p>",

In the case of fast neutron therapy, TPSs are mostly not of general purpose but are dedicated to one facility.

Efforts have been undertaken to develop a new TPS that could be applied to all the existing fast neutron facilities. The University Hospital of Essen operates a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7040-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7040:mp7040-math-0001\" /> fast neutron beam and the TPS used is based on an empirical model. In a previous study, the empirical model has been evolved to a pencil beam model of 35 monoenergetic neutron beams. Monte Carlo techniques have been utilized to compute distributions of the energy deposition due to primary and scattered neutrons in a simple geometry water phantom. The experimental validation of the method is now presented. Depth dose curves in water of monoenergetic neutrons have been derived from the distributions of energy deposition. The resultant depth dose curves have been utilized in order to determine the depth dose curves of the fast neutron beam of the Essen facility for the 14 radiation field sizes available in this facility. This determination requires the initial neutron spectrum. As this spectrum could not be measured at the Essen facility, the initial neutron spectrum of the Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt, Braunschweig, Germany, which operates the same cyclotron, was used. The calculated depth dose curves were compared to experimental depth dose curves that have been obtained in water at the University Hospital of Essen. The comparison between calculated and experimental depth dose curves showed significant deviations in the case of large radiation fields and of depth less than 5 cm. In the case of radiation field areas less than <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7040-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7040:mp7040-math-0002\" /> and depth more than 5 cm (usual clinical situation), the measured and calculated values are in a good agreement.

While strong evidence exists of an association between ENSO signals and flooding in the region, this association is open to more than one interpretation depending on: (a) the metric used to test the strength of the association; (b) the definition of critical flood events; (c) site specific features of watersheds; and (d) the decision environment of flood management institutions.

This structural distinction, based on differences in the employment relationship, is analytically powerful, has validity, and is not in question here. The working class, however, is not homogeneous in all respects. This paper focuses on a sizeable group within the working class who perceive themselves as having (or having had) a career. As well as having this perception, they exhibit a forward-looking perspective, both in the world of employment and with regard to more general planning. They demonstrate degrees of planning, in work and non-work areas, strikingly comparable to service class respondents, and significantly greater than working class respondents without career perceptions. They believe that they can achieve their plans and indeed some have done so successfully. This exercise of forethought is materially aided by this group's possession of rather greater resources of various kinds than the rest of the working class. But this is by no means the whole story. The findings suggest strongly that a willingness to exercise or not to exercise forethought sharply distinguishes two groups within the working class, and may indicate a significant and hitherto unreported cleavage worthy of further investigation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Greater Addo Elephant National Park project (GAENP) involves the establishment of a mega biodiversity reserve in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Conservation planning in the GAENP planning domain requires systematic information on the potential distributions and estimated spatial requirements, and population sizes of the medium to largesized mammals. The potential distribution of each species is based on a combination of literature survey, a review of their ecological requirements, and consultation with conservation scientists and managers. Spatial requirements were estimated within 21 Mammal Habitat Classes derived from 43 Land Classes delineated by expert-based vegetation and river mapping procedures. These estimates were derived from spreadsheet models based on forage availability estimates and the metabolic requirements of the respective mammal species, and that incorporate modifications of the agriculture-based Large Stock Unit approach. The potential population size of each species was calculated by multiplying its density estimate with the area of suitable habitat. Population sizes were calculated for pristine, or near pristine, habitats alone, and then for these habitats together with potentially restorable habitats for two park planning domain scenarios. These data will enable (a) the measurement of the effectiveness of the GAENP in achieving predetermined demographic, genetic and evolutionary targets for mammals that can potentially occur in selected park sizes and configurations, (b) decisions regarding acquisition of additional land to achieve these targets to be informed, (c) the identification of species for which targets can only be met through metapopulation management,(d) park managers to be guided regarding the re-introduction of appropriate species, and (e) the application of realistic stocking rates. Where possible, the model predictions were tested by comparison with empirical data, which in general corroborated the predictions. All estimates should be considered as testable hypotheses.</jats:p>"

Location of electrode contacts on the cortex was identified and schematically indicated on native cortex prints. Accordingly, transfer of contact positions to a 3D MRI brain‐surface rendering was carried out manually by using the rendering software. Results of the electrophysiologic evaluation were transferred to either electrode contact reproduction and co‐registered with imaging‐based techniques such as single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), positron emission tomography (PET), and functional MRI (fMRI).</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Digital photography allows precise and highly realistic documentation of electrode contact positions on the individual neocortical surface. Lesions underneath grids can be highlighted by semitransparent MRI surface rendering, and lobar boundaries can be identified. Because of integrating electrode contact positions into the postprocessed 3D MRI data set, imaging‐based techniques can be codisplayed with the results of the electrophysiologic evaluation. Comparison with CT/MRI co‐registration showed good accuracy of the method. However, grids not sewn to the dura at implantation can become subject to significant displacement.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Digital photography in combination with preimplantation 3D MRI allows the generation of reliable tailored resection plans in neocortical epilepsy surgery. The method enhances surgical safety and confidence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We describe a method for generating CT images at multiple respiratory phases with a single spiral CT scan, referred to as respiratory‐correlated spiral CT (RCCT). RCCT relies on a respiration wave form supplied by an external patient monitor. During acquisition this wave form is recorded along with the initiation time of the CT scan, so as to “time stamp” each reconstructed slice with the phase of the respiratory cycle. By selecting the appropriate slices, a full CT image set is generated at several phases, typically 7–11 per cycle. The CT parameters are chosen to optimize the temporal resolution while minimizing the spatial gap between slices at successive respiratory cycles. Using a pitch of 0.5, a gantry rotation period of 1.5 s, and a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1177-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1177:mp1177-math-0001\" /> reconstruction algorithm results in <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1177-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1177:mp1177-math-0002\" /> slice spacing at a given phase for typical respiration periods, and a respiratory motion within each slice that is acceptably small, particularly near end expiration or end inspiration where gated radiotherapy is to occur. We have performed validation measurements on a phantom with a moving sphere designed to simulate respiration‐induced tumor motion. RCCT scans of the phantom at respiratory periods of 4, 5, and 6 s show good agreement of the sphere's motion with that observed under fluoroscopic imaging. The positional deviations in the sphere's centroid between RCCT and fluoroscopy are <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1177-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1177:mp1177-math-0003\" /> in the transaxial direction (average over all scans at all phases <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1177-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1177:mp1177-math-0004\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1177-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1177:mp1177-math-0005\" /> in the longitudinal direction. Reconstructed volumes match those expected on the basis of stationary‐phantom scans to within 5% in all cases. The surface distortions of the reconstructed sphere, as quantified by deviations from a mathematical reference sphere, are similar to those from a stationary phantom scan and are correlated with the speed of the phantom. A RCCT scan of the phantom undergoing irregular motion, demonstrates that successful reconstruction can be achieved even with irregular respiration. Limitations from x‐ray tube heating in our current CT unit restrict the length of the scan region to 9 cm for the RCCT settings used, though this will not be a limitation for a multislice scanner. RCCT offers an alternative to the current method of respiration‐triggered axial scans. Multiple phases of respiration are imaged with RCCT in approximately the same scanning time required to image a single phase with a triggered axial scan. RCCT scans can be used in connection with respiratory‐gated treatment to identify the patient‐specific phase of minimum tumor motion, determine residual tumor motion within the gate interval, and compare treatment plans at different phases.</jats:p>",

A specially designed mechanical tool has been elaborated to transfer the preoperative implant axis planned on 3‐dimensional imagery into a surgical template by a numerically controlled drilling machine. The main drawback of image‐guiding systems is the use of preoperative computed tomography, which is expensive and delivers high radiation doses. Therefore, in this study the image‐guiding system was coupled with a cone‐beam tomograph that significantly decreased both cost and radiation doses. Three edentulous models were used. To determine the accuracy of the system, the ability of a 1.8‐mm diameter drill to enter a 2.0‐mm diameter, 10‐mm‐long titanium tube inserted on the model with no contact was verified. Because the drill entered the tubes with no contact and went beyond the end of the tube, the transfer error was less than 0.2 mm for translation and less than 1.1° for rotation. The method presented here is low cost and high precision compared to other technological solutions such as tracking. Further assessment in the surgical field should lead to daily use of this system for flapless surgery, to prepare a prosthesis prior to surgery for immediate loading, to reduce risk of injuring critical anatomical structures and to eliminate manual placement error.</jats:p>",
