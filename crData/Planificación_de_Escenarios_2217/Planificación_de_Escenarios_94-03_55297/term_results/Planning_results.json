As a result of the fall of apartheid, South Africa is\nslowly taking its place in the global village. Foreign companies are\nconsidering South Africa as a good market for their goods and as a\nsource of supply of raw material and partly processed goods. Aims to\nreview the marketing planning practices of large South African\ncompanies. A comprehensive review of the marketing planning literature\nhas been undertaken. A study of 73 companies quoted on the Johannesburg\nStock Exchange was undertaken. It was established that all these\ncompanies had a comprehensive annual marketing plan and they followed\nthe procedures, and used the techniques described in the normative\nmarketing literature. Global organizations looking for South African\npartners will find the level of marketing planning sophistication highly\nsatisfactory.</jats:p>",

Still, at present, only a handful of universities in the world offers anything more than a random course in language policy/planning or simply subsumes the entire field in a couple of lectures in the introductory course in sociolinguistics. In the last decade of the 20th century, real-world events have thrust language policy and planning into prominence. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and the powerful resurgence of language loyalties in various Eastern European polities, the rapid economic unification of a multilingual Europe, changing global patterns of immigration, and global economic difficulties have coalesced to create new linguistic conditions and focus attention on long existing linguistic inequities.

Among the service transformations reviewed are the shift in focus from children to families; the recasting of service personnel from specialists to family supporters; the development of therapies into child‐led transactions as the preferred means of promoting development, and new approaches to evaluating service effectiveness. Examples are given of low‐cost service strategies to meet the needs of the developing world, new styles of training opportunities for parents and communities, and the promotion of policies at a community and national level that nurture the wellbeing of children and families. The primary requirements for successful interventions remain the age‐old values of love, self‐sacrifice and respect for the dignity and worth of each person. Sustaining these in modern society is arguably our greatest challenge.</jats:p>",

A behavioral model postulates that the searcher maximizes the frequency with which the maximum utility will be achieved over a multiple-trip horizon. These models encompass a wide range of behavioral factors, including the perceived travel cost, decision foresight, learning, price motivation, and risk attitudes.

I propose to identify and comment briefly on each of these themes, and then to conclude by alluding to two relatively neglected areas of potential future concern. The five somewhat interrelated themes include: the role(s) of language policy or planning activities in foreshadowing or marking major world (political) events; the growing concern with ethnic revitalization; the correlates and consequences of continuing migration and mobility; the differential perceptions of the role of the mother tongue in primary education; and the potential contributions of language planning to educational and national development.</jats:p>",

Inverse and adjoint techniques are developed to obtain the best beam directions. Both methods rely on determining the “path of least resistance” to radiation from the tumor location to the surface of the section. The effectiveness of beam directions is then determined by monitoring the dose distribution along the section boundary. The inverse and adjoint calculations are performed for three tumor cases using a two‐dimensional discrete ordinates transport code. The proposed treatment plans from these calculations are verified against typical treatment plans. The new techniques improved the dose distribution in the treated section. The inverse calculations are useful in sections involving low‐density tissues. The adjoint technique can effectively deal with multiple target volumes and/or sections with complex geometry. The proposed method is potentially useful in selecting beam orientations for three‐dimensional planning systems and in determining beam intensities in rotational and conformal therapy.</jats:p>",

The increasing mobility and scale of capital have resulted in the necessity for local governments to attempt to lure capital into specific locations and the growing subservience of the state to capital.

Using in-depth interviews with urban planners and property developers in Dublin, this paper examines the impact of these conditions on planning's operation and the outcomes of increased central state intervention in the former territory of planning. It is concluded that planning is being reoriented to become more directly facilitative of the demands of capital. </jats:p>",

However, decision-makers have often been faced with the complex task of selecting a most preferable scheme that balances the conflicting objectives associated with this type of planning measure. To assist decision-makers in this process, an international study of some 30 pedestrian-oriented schemes was carried out which examined the impacts of these schemes upon selected attributes and the importance attached to these attributes by various individuals. This information was used within a series of formal evaluation techniques that have been applied to urban planning initiatives, to see how suitable they were for assisting in the selection of pedestrianisation schemes. The results demonstrated the need to exercise caution in the use of particular forms of evaluation techniques, and suggest that there is value in using a number of techniques to overcome method uncertainty and provide decision-makers with more reliable results. The results indicate that the techniques are applicable to a range of urban planning issues. </jats:p>",

The potential Pareto improvement criterion usually applied in analysis of the economics of externalities is solely concerned with efficiency aspects because it bypasses the question of interpersonal utility comparison. However, in the practice of policymaking, equity issues are often at least as important. This paper contains a partial equilibrium analysis of the question of to what extent optimization and compensation of an external cost are compatible under different schemes of regulation and internalization, and in different model settings: the standard textbook model, a model in which defensive activities on behalf of the victim are allowed for, and a model in which dynamic aspects of entry—exit behaviour are investigated. </jats:p>",

This paper considers the theory of marketing planning and its relevance to small firms, and reports on the key findings of a qualitative research project which investigated the levels of understanding and utilisation of marketing and marketing planning in small Cambridgeshire firms. The results of this project confirm that marketing is misunderstood and underutilised in most small firms. However, the findings also show that many firms are anxious to improve their marketing activity, but are unsure about where to turn for assistance. A practical framework is proposed which would assist small firms in taking a more disciplined approach to marketing without adopting strategic marketing planning, which is seen by many as daunting and inflexible. The findings of this research project have implications both for small firm owner/managers and for service providers who want to assist small firms to survive and grow in the mid‐1990s and beyond.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The general aims of the paper are, first, to discuss the role of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as a regulator of the UK scheduled airline industry, prior to the implementation of European Community liberalisation of air transport on 1 January 1993. Second, the reactions of the industry itself to CAA policies are examined. Prior to a detailed consideration of the principles which illuminated the CAA's strategy, the constraints upon that policy are elaborated. Largely, these derive from the characteristics of airline economics and also from the UK government's commitment to privatisation, even at the expense of industry competitiveness. The three principles constituting the CAA's strategy—namely, the multi-airline industry, the primacy of long-term user benefits, and the promotion of a profitable UK airline industry—which were implemented primarily through a process of route licensing, are discussed in turn. It is concluded that user benefits have been realised from the CAA's regulation of both the structure and the behaviour of the industry, although a more pronounced latter-day emphasis on competition is detected. This may be related to the advent of European liberalisation which places only the most modest constraints on carriers' rights to fly whichever routes they wish. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent changes in the economic regulation of the for-hire trucking industry in Ontario (Truck Transportation Act, 1988) have provided a new opportunity to investigate the associated impacts of deregulation or regulatory reform. Two main areas of concern are the overall charge rate levels for trucking service and the charge rate levels for shipments involving small remote communities. To investigate these areas of concern, the makeup of shipment revenues before and after the initiation of regulatory reform is analyzed. Emphasis is placed on the variation in intraregional shipment charge rates with respect to commodity type as well as the size and remoteness of the communities involved. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of the multivariate analysis indicate that the overall charge rate levels have not declined in the majority of industry sectors examined. With respect to charge rate levels for small communities, the basic question concerns the existence of cross-subsidization. This can occur when carriers, ‘obliged’ to serve remote communities under regulation, subsidize shipments to such areas from revenues earned in busier markets. The analysis of data in this paper provides evidence that cross-subsidization was present in some sectors of the industry but not in others. </jats:p>",

By tying these four concepts together, the theory urges planners to nurture a substantively democratic planning process in the face of power relations that either support or threaten this vision. We argue that this theory meets the criteria for any social theory to be empirically fitting, practically appropriate, and ethically illuminating. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A critical examination is undertaken of the methodology underlying the controversial Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs), which became a key feature of the local government finance system in England in 1990. Brief evaluations are made of statistical versus judgmental methods of estimating spending needs, and of the use of past outturn expenditures and client numbers to measure local authorities' need to spend on services. The impacts of SSAs on restructuring spending power between individual local authorities are estimated for personal social services and ‘all other services’. Such impacts are found to be substantial and to display some systematic patterns in terms of the characteristics of authorities most affected. More limited evidence for educational services partly supports these findings. Some of the identified changes in spending power appear to be attributable to statistical deficiencies in the existing SSA formulas and to the use of a limited range of need indicators. As central government is unlikely to replace SSAs in the short to medium term, there is a need to improve their methodology, but not to treat them as highly accurate predictions of spending needs. </jats:p>",

Differences in the population distribution of areas can affect levels of demand and also the costs of supplying services. The authors begin by questioning whether the measures of population density and sparsity in the current formulae adequately represent the effects of the settlement patterns of an area on service costs in particular. To illustrate the issue, the effects of population distribution on fire services are examined in detail. The differences in principle between the basis of the funding formula for fire services and the criteria by which the detailed activities of fire services are scrutinised by a different government department are discussed. Using a geographic information system, the authors show that the information which underlies the detailed scrutiny of each fire service could also be used to assess the effect of settlement patterns on service costs. </jats:p>",

This article provides perhaps the most detailed clarification of the access concept, especially the crucial linkages among the various access dimensions, and presents a comprehensive conceptual framework for evaluation and planning activities as they relate to people's access to health care services. The proposed conceptual model recognizes access as the outcome of a process involving the interplay between the characteristics of the health care service system and of potential users in a specified area, and moderated by health care related public policy and planning efforts. An elaborate typology of access, incorporating four pairs of access dimensions, is also derived. This atomization of the concept allows us to focus on specific aspects of the access to health care problem, and to develop precise outcome indicators of health system performance for evaluative purposes. Further, it enables the access concept and its pertinent dimensions to be put into proper perspective when assessing the health care access situation in a specific national or regional context. The relevance of the proposed access model and the typology to health care planning in general, and to spatial planning of health care service systems in particular; is also discussed. </jats:p>",

The viability of the conventional (pyramidal) organisational structures is being challenged in conjunction with major shifts in the roles of mid and top managers. In many countries, the pace of the above socio‐economic events and uncertainties is happening at an unprecedented pace. Some markets are showing signs of potential gigantic expansions while others (historically prosperous) are on the verge of complete collapse (Dent, 1991). In responding to the socio‐economic challenges of the nineties, organisations (across the board) have resorted to dismantling the conventional pyramidal structure and adopting so‐called “leaner” structures (see Zeffane, 1992). The most common struggle has been to maintain market share in an economic environment increasingly characterised by excess labour supply (Bamber, 1990; Green &amp; Macdonald, 1991). As organisations shifted their strategies from “mass production” to “post‐fordism” (see, for example Kern and Schumann, 1987), there has been a significant tendency to emphasise flexibility of both capital and labour in order to cater for the niche markets which are claimed to be rapidly emerging, world‐wide. This has resulted in massive organisational restructuring world‐wide.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Families are rapidly becoming unpaid givers of complex care. Using McKeehan &amp; Coulton's systems model, this critique reviews the evolution of the structure and processes of discharge planning programmes. It explores three common assumptions: discharge planning programmes are cost‐effective, allow for enhancement of patients' and families' quality of life, and ensure continuity of care between hospital and community. Funds are saved due to decreased lengths of initial hospital admissions and readmission rates. However, the cost of additional hospital and community resources is rarely considered. Little evidence supports the concept that discharge planning directly affects a patient's health status. Patients and families often do not perceive the same level of benefit from discharge planning as do health professionals. Several issues surrounding research methodologies used in the reviewed studies are identified. Of particular concern is the lack of qualitative research into patients' and families' experiences. The critique concludes with an exploration of ethical issues and challenges arising from increased emphasis on cost‐effective discharge planning. These include patients' rights, provision of sufficient human, social and financial resources, improved hospital–community communications, and control over hospital‐developed but community‐implemented programmes.</jats:p>",

The results suggest a series of relationships between the incidence of successful process innovation, new product development, and market performance. Data from the survey are explored in the context of recent perspectives on the economic role of flexible specialisation, new product launch, and regional SMF development. A major finding is that modern production technologies can assist the competitive efforts of small industrial firms, especially those that serve export markets. A further finding is that SMFs in import-sensitive industries can partially counteract external competition by adopting new manufacturing methods. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the academic and regional policy implications that flow from the survey results. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The American foreign language system, far from being resistant to change, is in a constant state of flux. One of the geniuses of the American system is that decision making is almost totally dispersed and experimentation and innovation are constantly taking place. Mechanisms for making these changes cumulative and their effect widespread are relatively weak. Moreover, these changes only occasionally affect the overall architecture of the system, and basic dissatisfaction with the results of that system remain. There are, however, a number of attempts to intervene in the system to make basic changes. These interventions have taken a variety of forms, directed by actors including state governments, faculty review committees at colleges and universities, the federal government, and private foundations. This article also discusses the most common targets of intervention by various federal and private funding projects. All of the project-specific interventions share a set of problems that limit their effectiveness. The principal problems characteristic of project-style interventions are reviewed. </jats:p>",

In the single-period problem, random capacity does not affect the optimal policy but results in a unimodal, nonconvex cost function. In the multiple-period and infinite-horizon settings order-up-to policies that are dependent on the distribution of capacity are shown to be optimal in spite of a nonconvex cost. In the infinite-horizon setting an intuitive description of the situation leads to the notion of a class of extended myopic policies, requiring the consideration of review periods of uncertain length. </jats:p>",

The ready availability of data on the physical attributes of the environment, and the patchiness of biological data, have made reservation planning based on environmental classifications an attractive option for decision makers. We developed an environmental classification based on ecologically relevant variables and used it to plan a forest reserve system for Tasmania. We then used biological distributional data and the same targets and procedures to choose a forest reserve system. The analyses based on the environmental classification selected the same areas as equivalent analyses based on biological distributional data to a greater degree than could be expected by chance. Many rare species and communities missed selection by environmental classificatory units (environmental domains), however, and the proportions of ranges of selected taxa varied widely. Conversely, environmental domains were missed by a reservation strategy based only on biological data. These domains might reflect some gaps in the biological data. A reservation planning approach based on both biological data and domains may produce better results than either used in isolation.</jats:p>",

Attention focuses on the Conservation Coalition, where agricultural and environmental interests converged to hammer out the compromises that would solidify the crucial support the Coalition as a whole could offer to a farm bill. The intent is to explore the degree to which Lowi's typology is useful to the analysis of complex relations between political arenas and to suggest avenues for extension of Lowi's typology to such situations. Two conclusions emerge. First, distributive and regulatory political forms, as described by Lowi in his fourfold typology, were much in evidence. Lowi's scheme has considerable ability to link policy proposals, political styles, and political outcomes, and hence to clarify political patterns and conflicts. But, second, an application of the typology to complex political processes requires that the power relations that underlie the typology be made explicit. The typology relies for its predictability on a routinized exercise of power not in evidence in this or many other cases. Explicit attention to power helps to resolve the ambiguities of application that critics have noted and clarifies a dynamic and complex struggle which weaves together the expression of Lowi's policy types. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Both optimization techniques and expert systems technologies are popular approaches for developing tools to assist in complex problem-solving tasks. Because of the underlying complexity of many such tasks, however, the models of the world implicitly or explicitly embedded in such tools are often incomplete and the problem-solving methods fallible. The result can be \"brittleness\" in situations that were not anticipated by the system designers. To deal with this weakness, it has been suggested that \"cooperative\" rather than \"automated\" problem-solving systems be designed. Such cooperative systems are proposed to explicitly enhance the collaboration of the person (or a group of people) and the computer system. This study evaluates the impact of alternative design concepts on the performance of 30 airline pilots interacting with such a cooperative system designed to support en-route flight planning. The results clearly demonstrate that different system design concepts can strongly influence the cognitive processes and resultant performances of users. Based on think-aloud protocols, cognitive models are proposed to account for how features of the computer system interacted with specific types of scenarios to influence exploration and decision making by the pilots. The results are then used to develop recommendations for guiding the design of cooperative systems. </jats:p>",

Under both models, rebound of consumption occurs as a result of distributing more-efficient wood-burning stoves into households. It follows that policies premised on the assumption that the use of scarce resources can be curtailed simply by raising the energy efficiency of appliances used in the household are flawed. The same policies, however, when judged according to their contribution to the utility of the household appear to be better. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Analysis of sports-related demands of potential users of an organization is a very important aspect of its functioning and helps it cover its demands and needs. In the context of sports, analysis of demands related to planning and provision for sports areas is important for various social agents and is a relevant contribution of psychology towards development and improvement of sports management. This article presents the results of a survey from 625 users of 43 facilities in the Spanish Autonomous Community of Valencia. The survey was centred on their demands respecting provision for sports facilites. Three main aspects were considered: values and function of the practice of sport for respondents, users' preferences for the type of facility that should be used, and certain preferences and opinions about facilities' management and ownership. Outstanding results are: great centrality of sport for respondents, predominant orientation towards sport as a means of leisure and recreation, a preference for state-owned facilities, even though respondents believe private ones are better managed, consideration of in-door pavilions and covered sports centres as facilities that should get priority in local building plans, and a preference for decentralization of new facilities. This analysis can be of great help in order to plan the provision for new sports services and infrastructure, and a supporting tool in the management of facilities.</jats:p>"
