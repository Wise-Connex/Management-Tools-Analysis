      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explores the reasons why the failure to site and implement waste disposal facilities in the United States and Canada has become commonplace, using the example of waste environmental impact assessment (EIA) programs in Ontario, Canada. The inability of governments to site new waste disposal facilities can be traced to a slavish adherence to planning’s most common paradigm, the rational comprehensive model. The article also addresses whether the extensive public consultation programs associated with waste EIAs are effective. The study concludes with a discussion of how the communicative action of planning should be researched in waste management to develop more efficient and less socially divisive planning programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning at the edge of cities has, in the past, largely been concerned with containment, with the promotion of more compact urban form, and with the planned separation of rural and urban land use and activities. However, there has been some inevitable blurring of these uses, to create a unique landscape—an interface between town and country—sometimes labelled the rural–urban fringe. This landscape has been created more by fortune than design: less favoured urban uses—sewage works, mental institutions, asylum centres, breakers' yards, etc—have been pushed away from residential areas. Rural uses, mainly farming and forestry, have become mingled with this particular assemblage of urban activities to create a hybrid landscape. Planning, however, has been a relatively inert force at the edge: seeking to contain (perhaps through greenbelts) but not seeking to improve or to manage. In England, our principal focus in this paper, a number of commentators have expressed a concern for this apparent inertia, arguing that planning could do more to ‘manage’ the fringe, creating new social, economic, and environmental opportunities. We draw on a review of policies and programmes affecting the fringe, and argue that spatial planning—able to integrate land uses, and different activities and interests-may create such opportunities. We highlight what planning might seek to achieve at the edge, and how any programme of change might be driven forward. </jats:p>",

Likewise, the quality of schools depends on the quality of cities. This article is focused on looking at our public schools as public infrastructure, particularly in the context of inner cities and older suburbs. The article argues that there is a profound and detrimental “cities and schools disconnect,” and as a field, planning has virtually ignored our public schools. City planning scholars need to increase their engagement with public schools and school facilities and think more critically about how development and redevelopment decisions ultimately impact our public schools. </jats:p>",

In this paper I provide a brief overview of the principles that underpin the discipline, and provide a critical evaluation of the extent to which it is guided by ecology or simply uses the label for rhetorical support. I suggest that simply appealing to ecological analogies is not sufficient to ensure that the impacts of industrial activities are reduced. Further, I propose that the technical process of industrial design needs to be embedded in legitimate social processes if social acceptability is to be attained. </jats:p>",

A review of the literature finds that there have been few evaluations of performance-based planning, despite its being used by many governments. The authors provide a comparative review of the experiences of various jurisdictions in implementing this form of zoning and present observations on its relative strengths and weaknesses. Findings suggest that many of the jurisdictions that adopted performance-based planning subsequently abandoned it because of the heavy administrative burden required, and where performance methods survived, they were typically hybridized with traditional zoning. If performance-based approaches continue to be used, there is a need to better understand the administrative and implementation implications of this type of land use regulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1995, Judith Innes recognized the increasing influence of a new type of planning theorist. Adverse to “armchair theorizing,” these theorists have taken a fine-grained analysis of planning practice as the basis for reconstruction of planning theory. Despite the proliferation of this theoretical project, its impact on urban planning has yet to be analyzed in a comprehensive manner. The major impetus for the research is to assess the ways that empirical research in planning practice has informed or failed to inform planning theory. Have empirical studies of planning practice resolved existing theoretical contentions? Or have they generated only more conflicting opinions and a lack of resolution of the existing debates? This article presents a meta-analysis of empirical studies in planning theory. </jats:p>",

Therefore in this paper I use building blocks from literature (planning and business) and my experience in practice to construct a workable normative definition of the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of strategic spatial planning. Five main characteristics (selective, relational annex inclusive, integrative, visioning, and action orientated) that constitute the hard core of the ‘strategic’ in the normative view are confronted, in a first broad scan, with nine so-called strategic plans from different planning traditions in Europe (Italy, France, Spain, the Czech Republic, Belgium, and the Netherlands) and in Australia (Perth). The confrontation highlights some hesitant shifts towards the normative view but also makes it clear that there is still a long way to go. </jats:p>",

Site selection for these facilities is complicated by negative perceptions of CCC impacts on the part of potential host communities. I solve the CCC-location problem through the use of a framework based on value-focused thinking and quantitative decision models. The first of two mathematical models for CCC location is a novel integer programming formulation that incorporates neighborhood characteristics and equity considerations; the second is a straightforward application of the analytic hierarchy process. These models are applied to a case study in the city of Pittsburgh, PA. In contrast to traditional dispersion models, the mathematical programming model identifies sites in high-amenity neighborhoods which are argued to be associated with beneficial CCC client outcomes. Also, I find that sites selected using multicriteria decision models are relatively easy to generate and are competitive with mathematical programming models in terms of objective function measures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Peering between network providers is modeled as a set of interconnections at hub nodes. The paper employs probabilistic methods to determine the likelihood of a path between nodes, under a variety of simulated disruptions or failures of parts of a network. Reliability is measured as the probability of withstanding failure of network components such as nodes or linkages. A reliability envelope is devised in order to define a range of impacts—with the recognition that the damage to subsets of the network can vary from a relatively benign effect to a much more critical or lethal impact. Thus, we describe a range of scenarios from best to worst, within the same level of infrastructure loss. With the use of simulation data for the United States, results show the critical role of major hubs in sustaining communication among cities. In the paper we highlight especially reliable nodes (for example, Chicago and Atlanta) and those that are most susceptible (for example, Birmingham, Alabama, and Nashville, Tennessee). Failure in major hub cities such as Chicago, Dallas, and San Francisco would significantly influence adjacent areas and could cause severe degradation for the entire network with a loss of resiliency to below tolerable levels. An important finding is that various patterns in the reliability envelope can be influenced by factors such as network structures, hub structures, and geographical locations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors explore the relationship between land-use, or spatial, planning and the environmental sustainability of major areas of public policy. First, the planning–public policy relationship is conceptualised within a framework that challenges narrowly instrumental accounts of the role of planning in the promotion of environmental sustainability, emphasising instead how the exploitation of opportunity structures in planning has impinged over time on dominant sectoral objectives. This framework is then used to analyse reformist pressures on planning, with particular reference to England's ‘modernising planning’ agenda. The argument is developed through a critical analysis of how, in the light of key components of this agenda—rescaling, streamlining, and the introduction of a statutory purpose—planning, public policy, and environmental sustainability might be expected to interact in future. Early signs suggest that the initial reform proposals—to accelerate the delivery of development by restructuring opportunities for participation—were diluted (but not displaced) by strong opposition. Tracing the long-term impacts of the reforms will require research into the relations between the reconstituted tiers of planning and the ability of interest groups to use the new opportunity structures effectively—tasks that should interest analysts of the greening of the state as much as planning researchers. </jats:p>",

In Dutch water management an emergent discourse of ‘accommodating water’, which is competing with the traditional ‘battle against water’ discourse, can be seen. In Dutch spatial planning there is a debate on new practices of area-specific development planning, which are considered to reflect new ideas on spatiality better than the traditional Dutch planning doctrine. The authors discuss these recent developments, and attempt to analyse institutional changes with the help of the perspective of policy arrangements. The analysis is focused on the interrelations between the two policy arrangements, and both new ‘rules of the game’ and new policy practices are considered. The question is posed as to whether these practices are forerunners of new arrangements or do they merely reflect a revised policy and planning agenda of the existing institutional order? </jats:p>",

This transition from RPG to RSSs is one outcome of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. Another outcome is the abolition of the Structure Planning function of English county councils, potentially resulting in a strategic vacuum in sub-regional planning. The Regional Assemblies (together with Regional Development Agencies and Government Offices) will need to address the subregional agenda, providing strategic leadership in what are often diverse and complex regional settings. The authors report on research undertaken on behalf of the South East England Regional Assembly and its partners. They examine both the changing policy context in this region, and the means by which a hitherto regional—and top-down—policy agenda is being ‘spatialised’ to address subregional diversity. In doing so, they also look at the move away from historic subregional boundaries, the redefining of ‘subregional’, and the shifting institutional ownership of the planning process at this particular tier. </jats:p>",

By means of hazard modeling, a significant negative association was found between a husband's reporting of using physical domestic violence against his wife and the couple's adoption of a modern method of contraception. Community norms that were more tolerant of domestic violence were, in contrast, not a significant predictor of subsequent method adoption. The results highlight the need to address the issue of support for women experiencing domestic violence within existing family planning services and to sensitize service providers to the specific needs of women experiencing such violence.</jats:p>",

The greatest concern is whether women with contraindications for use are given access to the pill. Clearly, women without such contraindications should be given access to it and be offered adequate information about its correct use. In 15 pharmacies in Jamaica, mystery clients approached pharmacists to determine their willingness to sell oral contraceptives and to solicit information from them about correct use of the method. In addition to data from mystery‐client observations, interviews were conducted with 78 pharmacists and with 524 pharmacy customers who bought oral contraceptives, providing complementary information about knowledge of, attitudes toward, and experiences with the method. Analysis of the combined findings suggests that over‐the‐counter provision of oral contraceptives is a safe, practical, and effective method of distribution in Jamaica.</jats:p>",

Barriers are defined as the constraining factors standing between women and the realistic availability of the technologies and correct information they need in order to decide whether and when to have a child. The barriers include limited method choice, financial costs, the status of women, medical and legal restrictions, provider bias, and misinformation. The presence or absence of barriers to fertility regulation is likely an important determinant of the pace of fertility decline or its delay in many countries. At the same time, barriers inhibit women's ability to avoid unintended pregnancy. Problems of quantifying barriers limit understanding of their importance. New ways to quantify them and to identify misinformation, which is often concealed in survey data, are needed for future research.</jats:p>",

The scaling laws might be the Rosetta Stone to understand the complexity of human geographical systems because they take the form of Horton and Strahler's laws in geomorphology and Gutenberg and Richter's laws in seismology indicative of fractals and self-organized criticality (SOC). An empirical analysis is conducted with the use of data from southern Germany, given by Christaller. The fractal dimensions, D<jats:sub>f</jats:sub>, of four systems are calculated as follows: D<jats:sub>f</jats:sub> is 1.733 for Munich, 1.685 for Nuremberg, 1.837 for Stuttgart, and 1.481 for Frankfurt. SOC theory is employed to interpret the fractality of central places, and the power laws are seen as signatures of feasible optimality, thus yielding further support to the suggestion that optimality of the system as a whole explains the dynamic origin of fractal forms in nature. </jats:p>",

However, current geospatial technologies do not support work by crisis management personnel, most of whom are not technology specialists—a key impediment is that the technologies require the user to learn the system's language. In addition, geospatial technologies are not ‘collaboration friendly’—they impede rather than facilitate group work. In this paper we address both issues by presenting (1) a theoretical framework for understanding the roles of visual mediation in map-supported human–human dialogues, and (2) a computational approach for enabling such roles in collaborative spatial decisionmaking contexts. Building upon our initial implementation of a map-mediated collaborative environment, the DAVE_G system [a natural, multimodal, dialogue-enabled interface to geographical information systems (GIS)], we model human–GIS and human–GIS–human dialogues as complex visual-cognitive signification processes in which maps become dynamic facilitators. Using a scenario simulating two crisis managers dealing with a major nuclear release event, we demonstrate how visual display (in DAVE_G) actively mediates human–human dialogue directed to situation assessment and action planning in real applications. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The compact-city paradigm has received increased attention worldwide for its ability to achieve sustainable development. However, the claim that the compact-city paradigm contributes to sustainability has not been sufficiently verified. In this study we evaluate how major concepts in the compact-city paradigm affect urban sustainability. Correspondingly, the complementary strategies for facilitating compact-city progress are recommended. Structural equation modeling was applied to ninety-two samples of medium-sized or small-sized cities in Taiwan. Latent variables and observed variables were analyzed in the model's structure. According to the results a high-density pattern and intensification negatively affect the environmental and social sustainability, but positively affect economic sustainability. Furthermore, mixture of land use is beneficial to economic sustainability, and does not significantly affect environmental or social sustainability. On the basis of the empirical results, strategies that guide the compact-city paradigm toward the goals of sustainability are also proposed. </jats:p>",

The objective of this study is to investigate whether individualized CT-based nodal contour guided planning of axillary fields in breast cancer improves nodal coverage and minimizes dose to normal tissues. There have been no previous studies addressing this issue. Methods: Thirty 4-field radiotherapy plans were selected as ‘traditional’ plans: 15 without nodal contours (traditional field placement) and 15 with radiation oncologists’ nodal contours. The following structures were contoured on each patient CT, regardless of previously contoured structures: level I, level II/III, supraclavicular(SCV)/infraclavicular(ICV) lymph nodes, ipsilateral brachial plexus and lung. Dose volume histograms (DVHs) of the listed contoured structures were obtained for the 30 original plans. All 30 patients were then re-planned with the same anterior dose prescription as the original plan (4000cGy/16 fractions (#) or 4500cGy/25#) but adjusted depth of midplane dose prescription based on nodal depth; MLC blocking was adjusted to the ‘study’ nodal contours. DVHs of the contoured structures for the new nodal-based plans were compared with the DVHs of the original plans, using two-tailed paired t-tests. Results: Volume receiving 90% dose (V90) was significantly improved for SCV nodes: original plan 84.67% vs nodal plan 95.76%(p=0.0005). V90 were similar for level I and level II/III nodes, but hot spots in these nodal groups were significantly hotter in the original vs nodal plan: mean hot spot for level I 120.8% vs 116.3%(p=0.0008), mean hot spot for level II/III 118.1% vs 113.2% (p=0.000003). Dose to 90% of the brachial plexus (D90) was significantly higher in the original vs nodal plan: 79.92% vs 40.92%(p=0.0028). V20 lung were not significantly different. Mean total body dose was significantly higher in the original vs nodal plan 831.8cGy vs 677.7cGy (p=0.0015). Conclusions: CT-based nodal contour guided planning significantly improves coverage of the nodes, particularly supraclavicular nodes, while markedly reducing the dose to critical normal structures, such as brachial plexus. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The spectacular growth of gated communities around Latin America’s largest cities has been widely noted. In Buenos Aires, after the upgrade of the northern highway in the 1990s, the number of gated communities along the road more than tripled, reaching 500 by the year 2001. Yet, the geographic distribution of these communities was uneven, with the majority concentrated in municipalities with the highest percentage of poor households. Why, given similar land prices, land availability, access to infrastructure and distance to the city’s core, did developers build gated communities in the poorest municipalities? This article argues that the decentralization of planning controls contributed to these patterns of distribution. While wealthier municipalities used this prerogative to enforce tighter controls on land use, the less affluent ones relied on their capacity to modify planning codes to lure real estate developers. Unlike well‐serviced municipalities, who perceived the gated communities’ privatization of services as a potential danger to their fiscal tax base, the municipalities that lacked urban services in most of their territory saw gated communities as a fast and inexpensive way of increasing local economic activities in less productive lands. As a consequence, after decentralization of planning capacities, the development of gated communities clustered in less affluent municipalities, hence deepening the social polarization in these jurisdictions.</jats:p>",

Additionally, a further two conformal plans, with three and four treatment fields respectively, were produced using the Addenbrooke's Radiotherapy Planning System (ARPS). In order to simulate the patient‐beam positioning for all plans identically, the XiO plan was imported into ARPS. Patient‐beam positioning errors were simulated in ARPS by shifting the treatment isocenter by 5 and 10 mm superior, inferior, left, right, anterior and posterior. For every isocenter position the resultant dose distribution and rectal DVH was calculated without altering the beam configuration or beam profiles. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The effects of patient‐beam positioning uncertainties are found to be significant when the isocenter is shifted along the A‐P direction. The rectal V95% for the unshifted plans was smallest for the IMRT plan. However, a 5mm posterior shift increases the V75% (55.5Gy) by 11.5% for the IMRT plan. This compares with increases of 10.1% and 10.6%, for the 3‐field and 4‐field plans respectively. In the higher dose region V90% (67Gy) increases by 10.4%, 9.7% and 9.4% for the IMRT, 3‐field and 4‐field plans respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Rectal DVHs for the IMRT plan seem to be more sensitive to patient‐beam positioning uncertainties along the A‐P direction in the medium dose region compared to the conformal plans. An acceptable plan, determined using dose constraints can become an unacceptable plan when geometric uncertainties are taken into account.</jats:p>",

For eight headand- neck cancer patients, we generated IMRT plans with localization uncertainty margins of 0 mm, 2.5 mm, and 5.0 mm. The beam intensities were then applied on repeat computed tomography (CT) scans obtained weekly during treatment, and dose distributions were recalculated. The dose–volume histogram analysis for the repeat CT scans showed that target coverage was adequate (V100 ≥ 95%) for only 12.5% of the gross tumour volumes, 54.3% of the upper-neck clinical target volumes (CTVS), and 27.4% of the lower-neck CTVS when no margins were added for PTV. The use of 2.5-mm and 5.0-mm margins significantly improved target coverage, but the mean dose to the contralateral parotid increased from 25.9 Gy to 29.2 Gy. Maximum dose to the spinal cord was above limit in 57.7%, 34.6%, and 15.4% of cases when 0-mm, 2.5-mm, and 5.0-mm margins (respectively) were used for PRV. Significant deviations from the prescribed dose can occur during IMRT treatment delivery for headand- neck cancer. The use of 2.5-mm to 5.0-mm margins for PTV and PRV greatly reduces the risk of underdosing targets and of overdosing the spinal cord.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in Bangladesh remained steady between 1995‐99 and 1999‐2003 (41‐42 deaths per 1,000 live births), evidence from the management information system (MIS) of a large nongovernmental organization (NGO) program indicates that the NMR declined by about 50 percent between 1996 and 2002 in the area served. This study aims to validate the recording of neonatal deaths among the cohort of children registered as born in 2003 and to assess the evidence of a decline in the NMR. It also measures the coverage of reproductive health outreach services, focusing on 12 of the 27 NGOs that have provided services in the same areas since 1996. Field‐workers' registers, verbal autopsy reports, and immunization records were checked to confirm infants' survival. Interviews were conducted with 142 mothers of children who died within 28 days postpartum and with a random sample of 109 women with registered stillbirths. Out of 11,253 registered live births in 2003, 210 neonatal deaths were found, compared with 194 deaths that were reported in the MIS for 2003. The corrected NMR was 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, and it was in the range of 15‐29 deaths per 1,000 live births in 11 of the NGO areas. Because underreporting of neonatal deaths was probably higher in 1996 when the MIS‐reported NMR was 39 deaths per 1,000 live births, the decline in the NMR is likely to have been genuine.</jats:p>",

A total of 11362 residential transactions from a cluster of data for a large private-housing estate, considered to be representative of Hong Kong's private residential market, were used to test four hypotheses that evaluate the impact of shocks on property prices through the use of a hedonic price model. The influences based on the statistical findings, which satisfy the relevant goodness-of-fit tests, are (a) that the sovereignty crisis exerted immediate significant negative price effect, but property prices rebounded after a big decline when open diplomatic dialogue between the Chinese and UK governments began, (b) that the Tiananmen Square (4 June) incident had no significant price effect; (c) that the AFC caused a drastic decline in property prices; and (d) that the impact of the SARS outbreak was significantly negative for Amoy Gardens but not so for estates with fewer reported SARS cases. </jats:p>",

With the advent of autonomous mapping, it is feasible to have high quality information of obstructing sea minefields and their environment before moving into them. The challenge remains to use this knowledge optimally to minimise risk, time and effort in crossing the sea minefield. To achieve this, two interlinked processes are required, consisting of finding the shortest route with acceptable risk or route with minimum risk through the sea minefield, and if no route of acceptable risk exists, removing the optimum combination of sea mines to create a route of acceptable risk. This paper describes the use of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm and a genetic algorithm to achieve practical strategies and a method in which two optimisation techniques interact to provide a safe route considering the risk of both the sea mine and the environment and making it applicable to sea mine avoidance. This methodology may readily be applied to general ship routing in risk areas and may be expanded to routing through any area where no known routes exist.</jats:p>"

It analyses Tanzania's shift from a comprehensive development planning to a decentralized planning in 1980 in terms of sector and area plans and indicative planning, in the form of Poverty Reduction Strategy. This shift, which had more to do with the surge of neoliberalism than domestic conditions, resulted in a simplified and more interactive planning, and lesser dependency on foreign experts than before. While Tanzania experienced rapid economic growth under the new planning regime, this was not without serious trade-offs, particularly in terms of reduced priority to industrialization and economic nationalism. The paper shows the various planning approaches as having been donor-driven, and also maintains that the way the Government has recently been trying to institutionalize O&amp;OD planning is likely to lead to village dependency on the Districts.\n</jats:p>",

This lecture provides an overview of the models that are commonly employed for purposes of treatment planning for megavoltage (MV) photon‐beam IMRT achieved through multi‐leaf collimator (MLC) delivery. IMRT treatment planning models will be examined which include models of: ionizing‐radiation dose computation; fluence‐map optimization; MLC delivery sequence optimization; dosimetric plan evaluation; and “biologic” plan evaluation. Models will be studied with focus on the assumptions, merits, and limitations involved with different models. The differences between reality and the models will be explored. Emphasis will be placed on plan characteristics that exist in reality but are not reflected in the model of the IMRT delivery. The influence of the algorithms employed to implement the models will also be discussed including methods that involve discretization, rounding, and limited numerical precision. Practical examples that demonstrate the influence of modeling differences on IMRT plan quality will be presented.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Notably, the United States made a similar transition after World War IL Indeed, the reconversion from a wartime command economy to a market- oriented postwar economy, a transition accomplished with astonishing speed and little apparent difficulty, constitutes one of the most remarkable events in U.S. economic history. Nevertheless, economists and economic historians have devoted little attention to that episode, and their explanations of it are, on close inspection, extremely problematic. With few exceptions, scholars have not yet recognized the problems inherent in dealing with that great event. In this chapter, I consider some major issues of measurement and explanation related to the reconversion of the U.S. economy between 1945 and 1947, a transition that laid the groundwork for the prosperity of the following half century.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Three‐dimensional radiation therapy (RT) planning tools provide detailed information regarding the degree of radiation exposure to different volumes of organs. Presently, we have incomplete knowledge regarding the tolerance doses for different normal tissue organs. The classic “Emami paper” (IJROBP 1991) provided broad dose/volume guidelines for 3D RT planning, based on somewhat limited clinical data. More recently, there has been dramatic increase in the number and quality of clinical studies that attempt to relate dose/volume parameters to normal tissue risks. Presently, dosimetric parameters predictive for injury are available for several organs (e.g. the lung, heart, esophagus, parotid, and brain), and additional/better data is rapidly accumulating. However, for most organs, the presently‐available predictive models are suboptimal. The continued challenges include: non‐uniform definitions of toxicity (e.g. radiologic vs. analytic vs. symptomatic), clinical comorbidities that make the diagnosis of RT‐induced toxicity uncertain, the confounding effects of concurrent chemotherapy (that is being used with increasing frequency), and multiorgan nature of some clinical endpoints. Further, it is not clear if the dose/volume guidelines developed in the “3D era” are applicable in the hypofractionated/radiosurgery/IMRT era. Extreme caution is warranted to the extrapolation of dose/volume guidelines beyond the scope within which they were defined. For example, the variable fraction size delivered to the surrounding normal tissues with IMRT/radiosurgery is fundamentally different than the relatively‐uniform fraction sizes received by the normal tissues in the 3D era. Since most normal tissue effects are very sensitive to fraction size, this variable needs to be considered. IMRT actually makes the decision‐making process more complex for the physician, as we now have greater flexibility regarding where to deposit the “extraneous/incidental” RT dose. Thus, the need for better dose/volume guidelines, that include consideration of fraction size, has increased with IMRT. When normal tissue dose/volume data becomes more robust, we will be better able to exploit the full potential of 3D/IMRT to minimize radiation‐induced normal tissue injury.</jats:p>",

This software will be able to track the status of the patient's treatment plan and remind the responsible parties of intermediate deadlines. Alerts are sent each morning to the radiation oncologist, residents, dosimetrists, and physicists about the current stage of the treatment planning. <jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> The patient planning management software was written in Visual Basic 7.0 and incorporates Microsoft Excel's spreadsheet. The programs display is viewable over anywhere in the department. The program shows each patient's data in a separate row and color coded according each radiation oncologist. The patient's CT and start date are entered for each patient. The deadlines included are that for the approval of the PTV and normal tissue, plan approval, and completion. The program will change the color of the patient's data from yellow (warning) and red (alarm) based upon approaching deadlines. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> This planning software continuously updates patient information. This program eliminates the time consuming process of paging, emailing, and tracking down responsible parties to communicate completion of various tasks. Since the inception of this software the mean time interval to complete a plan has decreased by 30%. The mean time required to get target volumes approved has dropped 25%. One significant benefit is the 50% increase in time between the completion date and start date. Without an increase the overall planning time, this has allowed more time for physics checks, quality assurance, and therapist review. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> In the face of increasing patient numbers the dynamic automated patient management software has enabled our department to complete our patient's plans in a more efficient manner. This increased efficiency allows all responsible staff adequate time to complete their responsibilities for each patient.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Combinations of external‐beam radiation therapy (EB) and brachytherapy (BT) and have been used for many years. Conventionally, the EB and BT components are planned independently and limited to combinations of doses and dose‐time‐fractionation patterns that have been directly validated by clinical outcome studies. Ongoing research in radiobiological modeling, deformable image registration, and quantification of dose delivery uncertainties has the potential to provide the scientific foundation for truly integrated EB‐BT planning that could significantly improve clinical outcomes. First, the complementary strengths and weaknesses of BT and highly conformal EB methods, such as intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), will be reviewed. Both IMRT and BT can support high dose conformality. IMRT can treat large surgically inaccessible target volumes with relatively homogeneous dose distributions. Where BT can be surgically realized, large dose fractions can be delivered with much higher geometric precision than with current IMRT delivery techniques. Next, clinical settings where integrated BT‐IMRT can have benefit will be reviewed. One example is definitive treatment of cervical cancer in which IMRT is used to compensate for primary tumor underdosing or normal tissue overdosing by the intracavitary BT insertions as well as for conformal treatment of the pelvic lymph nodes. Finally, the scientific and clinical challenges to integrated BT‐IMRT will be reviewed. For example, in high dose‐rate (HDR) interstitial BT of the prostate combined with IMRT whole pelvic irradiation for intermediate risk disease, a major source of dose‐delivery uncertainty is the conversion from physical‐to‐isoeffective dose needed to account for differences in fractionation.</jats:p>",

When opinions of the general public are considered, methods that are simple to understand and easy to use are required. One such method is multicriteria approval (MA). It is based on approval voting, where the voters have been replaced by criteria. In MA, alternatives are approved or rejected with respect to each voter, i.e., each criterion. In the basic version, the approval threshold is crisp and defined by the system. The varying importance of the criteria is considered using the concept of ordinal dominance. Thus, the importance order of the criteria is needed to make a recommendation. The basic MA approach favors solutions that may be mediocre with respect to all criteria. A crisp approval threshold used in MA may also lead to awkward recommendations. We propose a new method using a concept of fuzzy approval for solving these problems. The fuzzy approval also easily extends to group decision-making problems. Two forestry applications are presented, where the fuzzy version of MA is tested and compared to the results of original MA. The possibilities of using fuzzy approval in forestry decision support are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the quest for sustainable development, numerous examples of ‘best practice’ have been created and circulated in national and international arenas. Yet despite the vast array of examples, demonstration projects, case studies, and the like, little is known about the ways in which best practices are produced and used, and their role in processes of policymaking. Focusing on best practice for urban sustainability, the author argues that, rather than conceptualising its role and impact in terms of policy transfer or lesson drawing, the creation, dissemination, and use of best practice can be better understood as a discursive process, in which not only is new knowledge created about a policy problem, but the nature and interpretation of the policy problem itself are challenged and reframed. Drawing on insights from concepts of governmentality, the author argues that best practices are at once a political rationality and a governmental technology through which the policy problem of urban sustainability is framed and defined. Illustrations of the practice of best practice show how contradictions emerge between claims for general applicability and the need for policy actors to understand the contingencies of the process of urban sustainability, in order to enrol it for their own struggles over sustainability. The local stickiness of best practices points to the very real struggles that the rationalities of urban sustainability have in competing with other governmentalities which seek to shape urban futures. </jats:p>",

Plans with one beam based on CBCT and CT of phantoms and patients were compared using MU/cGy values and isodose distributions. For patient cases, 3D plans and IMRT plans based on CT images were generated, and then verification plans based on CBCT were generated. The isodose distributions and dose values at the isocenter were compared between two plans. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> HU values of CBCT are very close to those of CT in Catphan. However, HU profiles of homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms in CBCT show inhomogeneous distribution compared to those in CT with large scatter. Large scatter contribution becomes greater in patient cases. The lung or fatty tissue appears with even lower HU values in CBCT than in CT. Resulting MU/cGy differences are generally within 2%, but a beam passing through a significant amount of the lung or bone shows 2 – 3% of MU/cGy difference. The isodose distributions of CBCT‐based verification plans and CT‐based plans for brain and prostate patients are very similar with the dose values less than 2% different. The dose value is about 4% higher in CBCT‐based verification plan than in CT‐based plan for the thorax patient and the isodose distributions in the high dose area inside of the lung shows disagreement between the two plans. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This study validates CBCT‐based treatment planning by comparing with the gold standard CT‐based treatment planning. CBCT‐based plans could be used for most cases. However, beams should be selected with a consideration to avoid a large part of lung.</jats:p><jats:p>Research partially sponsored by Varian Medical System.</jats:p>",

Methods and Materials: We applied gEUD—based optimization to obtain IMRT plans for H&amp;N and CW cancer patients and compared them with the corresponding plans a) optimized with stringent multiple D&amp;V objectives and b) optimized with the standard in‐house physician requested (phys) D&amp;V objective. The D&amp;V optimized plans were created with objectives based on the resultant gEUD plans with the same weight of importance, in order to drive the optimization as close to the gEUD plan as possible. The plan comparison at this point was based on DVH analysis. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For all H&amp;N and CW cancer patient in the study, we found that gEUD‐based optimization led to superior sparing of OARs, even beyond the specified requirements, with the same or better target coverage when compared to either the phys‐based or D&amp;V‐based plans respectively. In order to avoid dose inhomogeneities in the target volumes created by the gEUD‐based optimization, use additional D&amp;V objectives just for targets needed to be employed. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The general conclusion drawn from our investigation is that the EUD objective function uses smaller number of parameters compared to the D&amp;V and, allows a larger number of solutions with different DVHs but the same EUD. Thus, a better plan was delivered with EUD compared to multiple D&amp;V objectives optimization for either the H&amp;N or CW treatment sites. The use of EUD can allow the plan evaluation to be based on both DVHs and EUD. Details of the method will be discussed. <jats:sup>1</jats:sup>Niemierko A. Med.

Quality assurance (QA) of imaging devices (CT, PET, MR) which are used for radiation therapy imaging will therefore have different or additional goals compared to QA for diagnostic imaging purposes. Use of PET and MR imaging in radiation therapy is constantly increasing and reliable performance of these imaging modalities is important to avoid potentially significant errors.</jats:p><jats:p>Quality assurance for CT scanners used for radiation therapy scanning is relatively well established and defined. This process remains to be adequately defined for PET and MR scanners that are used for treatment planning. Evaluation of image quality of CT, PET, and MR scanners is generally adequately addressed by procedures which were established for diagnostic imaging. Design of QA protocols for radiation therapy scanning should be founded on procedures which are used for diagnostic imaging. Evaluation of mechanical accuracy and image spatial integrity is unfortunately not a major concern in diagnostic imaging and these parameters are often not sufficiently addressed in diagnostic QA protocols. All three imaging modalities have multiple potential sources of spatial and geometric errors and understanding of these parameters is necessary for design of an effective quality assurance program. The design of QA programs for these devices will be affected by the location of individual scanner and distribution of its utilization for diagnostic and radiation therapy imaging. Scanners which have dual purpose (diagnostic and treatment planning imaging) should have a QA program designed jointly by diagnostic and radiation therapy physicists to ensure that the program meets the needs of both groups.</jats:p><jats:p>The quality assurance for these imaging modalities in the radiation therapy goes beyond the QA of the scanners and should include evaluation of implementation of images in the treatment planning process. This should include evaluation of data transfer, image registration, potential degradation in image quality, image distortions, and evaluation of process for delineation of tumor and normal structure volumes. MR and PET images can contain biologically active regions which may not correlate with any readily visible anatomic features. Correct identification and use of these regions in the treatment planning process should be a major concern of the QA program.</jats:p><jats:p>This lecture will provide an outline and description of QA program for CT, PET, and MR scanners used in radiation therapy. The fundamental goals of such program will be described and information which can be used for establishment institution specific QA programs will be provided.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Radiation planners know that too small a dose to the tumor can result in recurrence of the cancer, while too large a dose to healthy tissue can cause complications or even death. The best solution is to build an accurate planning simulation system to provide better treatment strategies based on each patient's computerized tomography (CT) image. We are developing a web‐based customized cancer radiation therapy simulation system consisting of three important computer codes; the parallel Monte Carlo high‐energy beam code (PMCEPT code) for calculating doses against the target generated from the patient CT image, the parallel mixed integer linear programming code for optimizing the treatment plan, and scientific data visualization code for efficient pre/post evaluation of the results. This independent system with a Beowulf PC cluster of about 100 CPUs is operated by the client‐server system via web because managing a big PC cluster and continuous updating of the complicated MC and optimization codes are not an easy job for a hospital. Another benefit for an independent client‐server system is to provide high quality results to many hospitals, which will eventually lead to decrease the medical cost and provide high‐quality medical service to local area hospitals. At the conference, we are going to introduce the idea and progress of this project. This work was supported, in part, by the SRC/ERC program of MOST/KOSEF (grant number: R11‐1999‐054).</jats:p>",

The whole system is built in a personal computer. The image acquisition is implemented using an image frame grabber (DT‐3120, Data Translation, Inc., MA) to acquire ultrasound images from a transrectal ultrasound unit in real time during a treatment. The software converts information about the organ geometries and the actual locations of the light sources on a template with 0.5‐cm grids. These data are then input into the calculation system for prediction of light fluence rate distribution. The three‐dimensional (3D) geometry of the prostate and the actual source arrangements are reconstructed and are used in the calculation, which takes into account the effect of optical heterogeneity. Treatment planning is accomplished with the prediction of 3D light fluence rate distribution. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The system has been tested in experiments. In a phantom experiment, transrectal ultrasound images of the prostate phantom during treatment were acquired and the actual locations of the linear sources were recorded. The geometry of the phantom was reconstructed and light fluence rate was calculated in the geometry with the accurate source locations. The capability of calculating light fluence rate distribution in a heterogeneous phenomenon was tested in a patient prostate. The reconstructed prostate geometry, actual source strengths, and measured heterogeneous optical properties, were used in the calculation. The predicted light fluence rate distribution showed the effect of heterogeneous distribution of optical properties. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The real‐time treatment planning system provides an efficient tool for prostate PDT, which improves accuracy in treatment planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we explore the practice of interdisciplinarity by examining how the UK research councils addressed the problem of the sustainable city during the 1990s. In developing their research programmes, the councils recognised that the problems of the sustainable city transcended conventional disciplinary boundaries and that an interdisciplinary approach was needed. In practice, however, initially radical proposals to research the city as a complex combination of science and technology and society contracted into more cognate collaborations that emphasised either science or technology or society, with the result that interdisciplinarity came to be located within research councils rather than between them. This, in turn, led to the development of a third kind of interdisciplinarity as the responsibility for making the connections between the research programmes was outsourced to the user communities—the local authorities. Unfortunately, local authorities struggled to find the resources to conduct this work so that the radical interdisciplinarity recommended at the start of the decade remained unaccomplished at the end. In describing these events we emphasise roles of paradigms and epistemic cultures in shaping research approaches and the complications they raise for the triangulation between approaches that is assumed in the idea of interdisciplinarity. We do not wish to be entirely negative, however, and conclude by suggesting some ways in which the quality and success of this much-needed interdisciplinary work could be increased. </jats:p>",

Three IMRT methods have been utilized; the first is Forward Planning (FP) technique using segment weight optimization for selected set of objectives such as GTV, PTV, lung, heart, etc. The second method is Inverse planning (IP) technique using Direct Machine Parameters Optimization (DMPO) with same objectives used in FP plus an extra segment to account for flash. The third is IP technique using DMPO with same objectives used in FP plus an extra objective called “Flash Planning Target (FPT)” defined by expanding the PTV by 2.5–3.0 cm in the interior direction of the breast depending on the required amount of flash. The “FTP” objective is defined as a uniform dose with 80% or higher of the prescribed dose with an extremely minimum dose in the order of 1E‐15. “FPT” objective is included in the DMPO to generate sufficient flash (due to breathing parameter) which could not have happen without including this objective in the IP optimization. Comparing all methods, IP technique using the two DMPO methods will allow having a Flash for most of the treatment without defining segments and they will give better coverage of the breast from the superior and inferior direction with better controlling the dose to the surrounding organs. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Using the “FPT” objective along with DMPO techniques provide the open segment higher percentages for each beam with some other segments generated by Pinnacle not by the planner are superior over FP method. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Inverse planning techniques using DMPO technique mentioned above will give a better coverage of the breast from the superior and inferior direction with better controlling the dose to the surrounding healthy tissues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent developments in statistical methodology have facilitated international innovation comparisons. These, however, inevitably reflect both the industrial structure of the underlying economies, and the innovativeness of firms within each element of the industrial structure. The authors consider the extent to which structural differences between economies can influence international innovation comparisons. The impact of structural differences is considered both in conceptual and in empirical terms, with the aid of data from the first and second Community Innovation Surveys (CIS 1 and CIS 2). Conceptual analysis suggests a very restricted range of scenarios under which structural adjustment will be effective. Empirical results are more reassuring, however, suggesting that, although structural effects are in some cases quite large, they do not significantly distort international innovation relativities. The comparisons do, however, highlight significant inconsistencies between different innovation indicators and suggest policy priorities. </jats:p>",

The implementation includes the sampling of particles from a multiple‐source model, modeling of accessories, and commissioning of the model based on beam data measurements. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> In this work, the radiation output from a linear accelerator was modeled using a multiple‐source model with separate sub‐sources for primary radiation, extra‐focal radiation and electron contamination. This approach enables the commissioning of an individual accelerator using a previously developed procedure, which determines the model parameters by minimizing deviations between measurements and superposition dose calculations. The same source model was used both for the superposition and for the Monte Carlo based dose calculation method. Physical wedges, MLCs, blocks and compensators were modeled by transporting particles sampled from the source model through a detailed geometrical model of the specific accessory. The MLC model accounts for tongue‐and‐groove, divergent leaf alignment, air cavities between adjacent leaves, and rounded leaf tips. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The accuracy of the developed algorithm was studied by comparing calculations to measurements for open fields, wedged fields, and irregular MLC apertures for 6 MV and 18 MV beam energies. The agreement between measurements and calculations was within statistical uncertainties for all of the studied cases. The calculation of a typical treatment plan takes from minutes to few hours, depending on the required statistical accuracy. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> It has been demonstrated that VMC++ with an optimized multiple‐source model and particle transport through accessories results in accurate dose distributions in a wide range of conditions. The developed algorithm has acceptable calculation speed, and has large potential for improving dose calculation accuracy in complex situations and heterogeneous cases compared to traditional dose calculation algorithms. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Research sponsored by Varian Medical Systems Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Significant advances have occurred in heuristic search for planning in the last eleven years. Many of these planners use A*-style search. We report on five sound and complete domain-independent forward state-space STRIPS planners in this paper. The planners are AWA* (Adjusted Weighted A*), MAWA* (Modified AWA*), AWA*-AC (AWA* with action conflict-based adjustment), AWA*-PD (AWA* with deleted preconditions-based adjustment), and AWA*-AC-LE (AWA*-AC with lazy evaluation). AWA* is the first planner to use node-dependent weighting in A*. MAWA*, AWA*-AC, AWA*-PD, and AWA*-AC-LE use conditional two-phase heuristic evaluation. MAWA* applies node-dependent weighting to a subset of the nodes in the fringe, after the two-phase evaluation. One novel idea in AWA*-AC-LE is lazy heuristic evaluation which does not construct relaxed plans to compute heuristic values for all nodes. We report on an empirical comparison of AWA*, MAWA*, AWA*-AC, AWA*-PD, and AWA*-AC-LE with classical planners AltAlt, FF, HSP-2 and STAN 4. Our variants of A* outperform these planners on several problems. The empirical evaluation shows that heuristic search planning is significantly benefitted by node-dependent weighting, conditional two-phase heuristic evaluation and lazy evaluation. We report on the insights about inferior performance of our planners in some domains using the notion of waiting time. We discuss many other variants of A*, state-space planners and directions for future work. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> In the dose optimization based on equivalent uniform dose (EUD), a single dose value is assigned to PTV or organ at risk. Obviously, this optimization problem is poorly defined ‐ there is an unlimited number of nonuniform dose distributions (and, correspondingly, beam intensity functions) which will satisfy the EUD‐based objective function. Together with the ill‐posedness of the underlying integral equation, this may present a challenging mathematical problem. We propose an objective function for the EUD‐based inverse planning which can solve this problem and produce stable and accurate numerical solutions. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We apply to EUD‐based inverse treatment planning a variational regularization technique which was previously studied for the least squares dose optimization. The regularization parameter is found using the L‐curve method which is based on minimization of the residual norm and the smoothing norm of beam intensity functions. The optimization technique is applied to the prostate cancer treatment. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We have compared inverse treatment planning with the standard least squares objective function and an EUD‐based objective function. The dose distributions obtained from EUD‐based optimization are extremely nonuniform with significant hot spots in the PTV. We have applied to the EUD‐based optimization the variational regularization technique with the L‐curve method for determining an optimal value of the regularization parameter. We demonstrate that the regularization method decreases dose variance and mean dose in the PTV while keeping EUD of the same value. The regularized dose distribution is stable and uniform in the PTV. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Inclusion of a variational regularization technique into the EUD‐based dose optimization produces robust dose distributions and beam intensity functions without deterioration of optimization accuracy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to recast the politics of obesity in the United States in light of the unsatisfactory nature of the current, popular debates on this problem. The paper begins by taking stock of contemporary discussions about obesity through a review and analysis of the popular and academic literature on the topic. We show how discussions of obesity that rely on unidimensional structural, biological, and political causes are not only simplistic but also do not adequately historicize the present so-called epidemic of US obesity. To answer the questions ‘why now?’ and ‘why here?’, we argue, requires an ontological rapprochement between the more dialectical approaches to political economy, cultural studies, and political ecology. After laying out this more integrated approach, we apply it by showing how today's twin phenomena of the discursive war on obesity and the so-called epidemic itself are better understood through the historical lens of neoliberalism, both as a political–cultural economic project and as a form of governmentality. Our argument is that some of the central contradictions of global capitalism are literally embodied. The problem of obesity in its multiple material and discursive senses can then be seen as a partial fix—in some respects, even as a spatial fix—to some of the contradictions of neoliberalism. At the same time, we contend that the neoliberal shift in personhood from citizen to consumer encourages (over)eating at the same time that neoliberal notions of discipline vilify it. Those who can achieve thinness amidst this plenty are imbued with the rationality and self-discipline of perfect subjects, who in some sense contribute to the more generalized sense of deservingness that characterizes US culture today. </jats:p>",

Conventional CT images of 2.5 mm slice thickness were taken with a GE discovery LS CT/PET system. CBCT images slices were also reconstructed from flat panel system on a Varian LINAC 21IX. Eclipse treatment planning system was used to compare treatment plans from the conventional CT and CBCT images. The AAA algorithm was used in the treatment planning system for inhomogeneity correction. Regions of interest around the bone, soft tissue, and lung in both CT and CBCT images using identical HU threshold values were drawn. Identical targets located in the lung were used in each treatment plan. Analysis of the treatment plans was performed by comparison of geometrical dimensions, total volumes and dose volume histograms of the target and regions of interest. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Geometric comparison of actual external spatial dimensions and others in lung and bone were found to be within 1 mm. Volumetric comparison of the regions of interest resulted in a 2.8% difference of the vertebrae, 3.3% of the right lung, and 3.7% of the total external volume. Dosimetric results show similar dose distributions. Dose volume histograms are also comparable. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Results demonstrate that treatment planning based on CBCT is feasible. Plans created from CBCT images are comparable to plans created with conventional CT systems. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Partly funded by Prostate Cancer Foundation grant UW 133‐HR30.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Intensity modulated radiation treatment planning for difficult cases is typically a time‐consuming manual search for a plan which gives an acceptable tradeoff between tumor coverage and critical structure sparing. We develop a method to calculate the efficient tradeoff surface of a multi‐objective IMRT inverse planning problem. This serves two purposes: to eliminate the time‐consuming manual search process, and to provide the treatment planners with the complete tradeoff information, allowing them to make more informed decisions. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We formulate a linear multi‐objective IMRT treatment planning problem, the solution of which is a set of Pareto optimal treatment plans. Since each Pareto optimal plan involves a lengthy optimization, it is prudent to represent the complete surface with as few points as possible. Given the current set of Pareto surface plans, we use geometric considerations to formulate the optimization problem which computes the next plan. In this way, plans are added to the Pareto database until the surface is well represented. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The algorithm is applied to two clinical cases. For the prostate case, we display a tradeoff between the prostate coverage, femoral head sparing, and rectal sparing. For the skull‐based tumor, we display a tradeoff between tumor coverage, and the maximum doses of the chiasm, pituitary, and brainstem. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We provide a method to efficiently generate Pareto surfaces for treatment planning, even when the number of organs to be traded off exceeds two or three. The method is applicable to any convex objective functions, including equivalent uniform dose, as well as the more standard quadratic penalty IMRT formulations. We expect that the clinical benefit of being able to visualize the tradeoff information — e.g. exactly how a decrease in critical structure dose degrades the tumor coverage — during the planning process will inspire a surge of research in this field.</jats:p>",

The story also illustrates broader changes in the culture of policymaking in American health care. From the Progressive Era through the 1960s, reform‐minded experts in health worked to advance the public interest. Thereafter, they increasingly left behind public‐interest ideals and their underlying extramarket values in favor of organizing and improving health care markets.

Measurements of ρ<jats:sub>e‐</jats:sub> are typically performed with kilovoltage CT (kVCT) and its calibration assumes that object is tissue equivalent. In this work, we demonstrate that kVCT presents confusing information when objects have varying atomic number (Z). At the same time, we demonstrate that megavoltage CT (MVCT) may be preferred over kVCT in treatment planning since its calibrated pixel value, or CT number, is proportional to ρ<jats:sub>e‐</jats:sub>, independent of atomic number(ignoring pair production), and is suitable for non‐tissue equivalent materials(e.g. hip prostheses). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A dual‐energy kV &amp; MVCT benchtop is used to image a tissue‐equivalent phantom as well as samples with various combinations of ρ<jats:sub>e‐</jats:sub> and Z. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The plot of CT number to ρ<jats:sub>e‐</jats:sub> for the tissue equivalent phantom is non‐linear for the kVCT, but linear for the MVCT. For the non‐tissue equivalent samples, the MVCT number increases linearly with ρ<jats:sub>e‐</jats:sub> for all the samples, however the kV CT number to electron density is complicated by the two material components of the kV attenuation: atomic number and electron density <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> For all the samples presented the MVCT number increases with the electron density of the sample. The kVCT number assessment of electron density is only reliable for low atomic number materials. Beam hardening affects the kVCT number even for relatively small samples. Beam hardening effects for MVCT is slight and only apparent in large patients. Ignoring image‐quality to dose considerations, MVCT should be preferred for electron density assessment. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work was partially supported by grant from the NIH (PO1 CA088960) and a contract from TomoTherapy Inc.</jats:p>",

But housing and labour-market problems are not confined to London. In this paper we highlight the extent and nature of affordability, recruitment, and retention problems in a high-cost location outside the capital: Surrey in South East England. We suggest that changes towards a more professional and managerial workforce have impacted on housing demand and hence prices. Planning and physical constraints have contributed to housing shortages and exacerbated rising housing costs. High housing costs are linked to recruitment and retention difficulties not only for public-sector employers but also for certain types of private-sector employers in Surrey. This raises problems for the sustainability of the local economy. Measures introduced to address these difficulties are helping ‘key workers’ to access housing locally, but this simply bids up house prices rather than increasing the overall supply of housing that is affordable. </jats:p>",

In this work, a beam angle optimization algorithm to be used in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) treatment planning has been developed. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The plan optimality is defined by constraints set on the Dose‐Volume Histogram (DVH) of the target(s) and of the critical organs. The same constraints may be applied both in beam angle and in beam profile (beamlet) optimization. In beam angle optimization, either a co‐planar or a non‐coplanar initial search space may be used. The search space is covered with a preset number of uniformly distributed fields. Thereafter, a few beamlet optimization iterations are calculated in order to produce optimal beam profiles. Each field is then removed from the plan, and the corresponding value of the objective function is calculated. The fields with a low importance value are thereafter removed. The process is continued until the desired number of fields in the plan has been reached. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The optimized plans have been compared with equispaced beams, class solution —based plans and manually made plans. Beam angle optimization has been found to decrease the OF value typically to 20–80 % of the original value calculated with reference plans. The improvement has been clearly visible also in the shape of the DVH curves. The algorithm has been designed to execute fast (less than 30 minutes) in order to be applicable in routine use for patient‐specific planning. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The new beam angle optimization algorithm has been able to produce IMRT plans with superior quality to class solution or manually made plans. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work has been funded by Varian Medical Systems Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT) is a rotational approach to IMRT in which the leaves of the multileaf collimator move continuously during arced beam delivery. Overlapping arcs are used to deliver optimized intensity patterns from each beam direction. Despite the promising nature of IMAT, its potential has gone largely unrealized due to a lack of robust inverse planning tools. To address this, we have developed an IMAT arc sequencing algorithm that translates optimized intensity maps into deliverable IMAT plans. <jats:bold>Material and Methods:</jats:bold> The arc‐sequencing algorithm uses simulated annealing to simultaneously optimize the aperture shapes and weights throughout each arc. The sequencer enforces the delivery constraints while minimizing the discrepancies between the optimized and sequenced intensity maps. The performance of the arc sequencer has been tested for ten patient cases. An IMRT plan was developed for each case using the Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> treatment planning system, and the arc sequencer translated the optimized plans into deliverable IMAT plans. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Ten IMAT patient plans were developed covering the following sites: 3 prostate, 3 brain, 2 head‐and‐neck, 1 lung, and 1 pancreas. Seven coplanar IMAT plans were created using an average of 4.6 arcs and 685 monitor units. Additionally, three noncoplanar plans were created using an average of 16 arcs and 498 monitor units. The results demonstrate that efficient IMAT delivery plans can be developed that combine the dosimetric advantages of arc therapy with the dose painting capabilities of IMRT. Only modest degradation was seen between the pre and post sequenced plans. Plan accuracy was verified using Monte Carlo dose calculations with each arc approximated as static beams separated by two degrees. An average sequencing time of under 25 minutes was observed. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> An arc‐sequencing algorithm has been developed that can serve as the first robust inverse planning tool for IMAT.</jats:p>",

In this study, the above physics modeling improvements were verified by comparing the peripheral dose profiles for the small MLC fields calculated by the new Pinnacle v7.4f and the old Pinnacle v6.2b with those obtained from measurements experimentally. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Three test MLC fields with different jaw sizes were prepared, and specific dose profiles (along cross‐line, in‐line and diagonal axis) at different depths were measured using a Varian 21EX linear accelerator with 120‐leaf Millennium MLC, big scanning water tank and photon diode. Estimated dose profiles for the test fields were calculated using Pinnacle v6.2b and v7.4f. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> By comparing the measured and calculated results, both v6.2b and v7.4f performed well in calculating the cross‐line (along the gap between the longitudinal lengths of two leaves) and diagonal axis dose profiles at different depths. However, v7.4f gave calculated doses closer to the measured field for in‐line (gap between junctions of two rounded leaf ends) axis dose profiles at different depths. For the shape of profile along the in‐line axis, v7.4f calculated a flat “platform” dose profile of about 34.3% (inter‐bank leakage) at depth d<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> beyond the MLC field edge using a clinical dose grid size of 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.4 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, compared to the “zigzag” dose profile varying between 35.4% and 42.1% measured using water tank and diode. However, both versions calculated the percentage depth dose for the test fields well compared to the measurements. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The physics improvements of the rounded leaf end, tongue‐and‐groove structure, inter‐leaf and inter‐bank leakage corrections as new features of v7.4f were verified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Preemptive Goal Programming (PGP) facilitates the use of soft‐constraints in a hierarchical manner for solving complex inverse planning problems. It is a highly effective multicriteria strategy for IMRT planning. However, in order to ensure good numerical performance, a robust constrained optimization algorithm with a practical strategy for handling degeneracy is required. This study identifies cases when PGP introduces challenging problems that do not hold a conventional constraint qualification. Numerical performance for such problems is evaluated using nonlinear planning metrics (DVH, EUD, and NTCP). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> PGP, as implemented in our in‐house planning system, solves a series of nonlinear least‐squares problems by a sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm provided with precise Jacobians by an automatic differentiation algorithm. In the presence of constraint degeneracy, an elastic mode (feasibility bound relaxation) is used to ensure a positive step taken at all iterations. Dosimetric as well as numerical performance is evaluated for dose (or EUD) escalation cases with critical organ dose constraints. Reformulation of constraints is also studied as a potential way of reducing degeneracy in these problems. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Optimization levels involving strongly active constraints showed degeneracy near optimality, thus requiring use of the elastic mode for convergence. This mode exhibited robust convergence (typically &lt;∼100 iterations) for all IMRT cases studied. Highly nonlinear models (NTCP or EUD with high +/−powers) were handled well by SQP. A strategy of constraint reformulation showed a monotonic decrease in merit function value and its dosimetric performances were comparable to those without reformulation. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The optimization task of escalating target dose is limited by binding dose constraints of OARs, which can also create degeneracy in PGP. This study shows SQP with an elastic mode exhibits a stable convergence using the dose‐volume, EUD and NTCP metrics. Numerical performances can be further stabilized by reformulating degenerate constraints.</jats:p>",

We use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Study—a longitudinal study of mobility and neighborhood change in the Los Angeles region—to contrast the mobility outcomes for white and Latino households. In a separate analysis we examine planned mobility and extend the analysis of the role of neighborhood variables in explaining expected mobility. Through the incorporation of measures of neighborhood satisfaction and dissatisfaction we find, as hypothesized, that low levels of satisfaction and whether or not the neighborhood is perceived as ‘close-knit’ are modest predictors of the likelihood of future moves. However, the additive effect of neighborhood variables on intentions, beyond the structural effects of age and housing needs, is quite small. </jats:p>",

In order to validate the process and the accuracy of the IMRT dose delivery, three Solid IMRT plans (a prostate, a head and neck, and a breast) were created in Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. The plans had the following number of beams/gantry angles: prostate plan, 5; head &amp; neck plan, 7; and the breast plan, 2. Solid IMRT modulators were designed, built, and verified for individual beams. In order to conduct QA on the fabricated solid modulators, both film and diode array dose measurements were collected. The measured dose distributions were analyzed vs. calculated QA planar doses from the TPS. The process yielded high‐quality dose distributions and excellent agreement between the calculated and measured dose values. This study presents a valuable solution that enables Pinnacle users to upgrade to Solid IMRT delivery. Research sponsored by .decimal, Inc. corporation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Monte Carlo simulations represent the gold standard in radiotherapy dose calculation. While numerous tools have been developed to facilitate accelerator and patient modeling within a Monte Carlo simulation, there are few commonly available tools for interfacing a Monte Carlo dose engine with a fully‐featured treatment planning software package. We report on the development of tools to integrate a Monte Carlo dose engine with clinically useful radiotherapy planning software. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The initial release is configured to operate with PLanUNC, a freely available open‐source radiotherapy planning tool. The Monte Carlo integration package consists of several modular scripts and programs that act as a bridge between the treatment planning software and the Monte Carlo dose engine. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Using PLanUNC as a front end for the Monte Carlo, the user can develop a treatment plan, export beams and patient information to the Monte Carlo, recover the dose distribution, and analyze the results of the calculation in PLanUNC according to isodose, DVH, or EUD, as well as compare the results of the Monte Carlo simulation with results from other calculations. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The Monte Carlo interface package facilitates the clinical use of Monte Carlo by allowing a fully‐featured radiotherapy planning suite to be used as a front end, allowing flexible treatment planning and analysis of the Monte Carlo results. The modular nature of the software makes it straightforward to adapt these tools for use with other treatment planning software packages.</jats:p>",

The paper grew out of a multiyear activist project to redirect campus planning at our university onto a more sustainable footing. In our engagement with the unique institutional character of the university, we were required to address, on the one hand, its resistant power structures and, on the other hand, its real potential for fostering progressive social change. On the basis of this practical work, we develop a theoretical perspective on place-based change and articulate a situated conception of what we call ‘social rationality’. Turning from analysis to prescription, we then suggest a strategy of ‘comprehensive local innovation’ to allow universities to open up their potential to become working precedents that can address global issues through local action. Although the present paper does not articulate detailed proposals for specific institutional reforms, we consider such proposals in a related book.</jats:p>",

To provide a sharper penumbra, measurements were conducted with short SSDs (70–85cm). Aperture sizes (AS) ranging from 7–100mm (surface) were configured for measurements and modeling, using BEAMnrc MC code with 10<jats:sub>9</jats:sub> particles incident on the exit window and DOSXYZnrc for phantom dose calculations.

Verification measurements were performed with film and micro‐ion‐chambers. Calculated and measured data were analyzed in MatLab. Once validation of static fields was successfully completed, modulated portals (segmented and dynamic) were configured for treatment and composed for calculation using DOSXYZ. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Beam penumbra sharpness degraded with: decreasing energy and AS; and increasing SSD. PDD decreased significantly with AS. Nearly identical profiles when fluences were delivered by segmental and dynamic MLC sequences. The exception was in the peripheral and bremmstrahlung dose, which was higher in the segmented and dynamic deliveries, respectively. Calculations agreed with measurement within a distance‐to‐agreement of &lt;3mm. With segmented delivery, we found it necessary to introduce small (∼1.5mm) gaps between segments to retain ranges desired in the particular segment's path. The treatment time to deliver 5 segments of 3 energies, was ∼90s, including console reprogramming. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> This study shows that MERT is feasible and provides conformal electron‐beam dose distributions.</jats:p><jats:p>Acknowledgement: The primary author thanks Varian for technical support.</jats:p>",

The Pinnacle treatment planning system generates plans that are delivered in a different fashion than Eclipse. Whereas the Eclipse‐generated plans are delivered by scanning the treatment area from one side to the other, Pinnacle‐generated plans are delivered in a seemingly random fashion, treating multiple small areas within the field. This makes diode measurements at a point potentially more uncertain since the diode may be exposed fully or partially to multiple small fields during one single field's treatment as opposed to being exposed to very few segments scanning the point during an Eclipse‐generated delivery.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organ motion blurs dose distributions. The blurring can be described in a statistical way by use of a motion probability (density) function (PDF). The motion‐blurred dose distribution is obtained by a convolution of the “sharp” (static case) dose distribution with the motion PDF. This holds true for both inter‐ and intra‐fraction motions. In the case of intra‐fraction motions an “interplay” effect is superimposed on top of the blurring effect. It has been shown that the interplay effect averages out during the course of a fractionated treatment, and that it is usually negligible after a typical number of fractions. The convolution model relies on the linear superimposition principle, which holds true for dose values but not for the biological effect. This issue has recently been addressed and will be discussed.</jats:p><jats:p>Several investigations have now looked at the feasibility of un‐doing the motion blur through the use if intensity‐modulation. In principle it should indeed be possible to de‐convolve the motion PDF from the intensity maps, in order to compensate motion effects. This approach has been called 4D optimization or 4D inverse planning. Motion de‐convolution cannot, however, compensate motion effects exactly and it cannot be applied in a naïve straight‐forward way, because that would lead to undeliverable intensity maps with sharp spikes and negative values. The method of choice is rather to include the motion PDF in the IMRT optimization process. It has been shown that this can indeed yield a surprisingly high degree of motion compensation and it can even compete with other motion compensation methods such as gated delivery. However, this is only true if the motion characteristics (the PDF) are known with great precision. If the actually realized motion PDF deviates substantially from the planned PDF, the method becomes less useful and can, in principle, make things worse. More recently, uncertainties in the knowledge of the motion characteristics have been taken into account by use of robust optimization techniques. With these one can now compensate for motion effects in an approximate way for a large class of motion characteristics. In terms of the sparing of normal structures, the results are in between the use of conventional margins and the idealistic case of perfect motion compensation. The resulting intensity maps exhibit “horns”, which can shave off a few mm from the margins.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

The proposed method is based on a local planner and a boundary following method for rapid solution finding. The local planner is replaced by the boundary following method whenever the robot gets stuck in a local minimum. This method was limited to 2-DoF mobile robots and in this work we showed how it can be applicable for a robot with n degrees of freedom in a dynamic environment. The path planning task is performed in the configuration space and we used a hyperplane in the n dimensional space to find the way out of the deadlock situation when it occurs. This method is, therefore, able to find a path, when it exists, no matter how cluttered is the environment, and it avoids deadlocking inherent to the use of the local method. Moreover, this method is fast, which makes it suitable for on-line path planning in dynamic environment. The algorithm has been implemented into a robotic CAD system for testing. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the ability of this algorithm to find a path no matter how complex is the environment. These examples involve a 5-DoF robot in a cluttered environment, then two 5-DoF robots, and finally three 5-DoF robots. In all cases, the proposed method was able to find a path to reach the goal and to avoid the dynamic obstacles. </jats:p>",

The design includes a workstation GUI for treatment planning tools, and anonymous access to standard low cost hardware for MC dose calculation. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Before using MMCTP, treatment plans are converted into the so‐called McGill RT format. This new file structure was designed for saving patient plans on the workstation. The current MMCTP features are: (a) DICOM and RTOG imports; (b) transverse/sagittal/coronal slice viewing for contours, CT scans, dose distributions; (c) contouring tools; (d) colour‐wash and isodose line display; (e) DVH analysis, and dose matrix comparison tools; (f) external beam editing; (g) thumbnail CT navigation tool; (h) EGS/Beam calculation and XVMC patient transport for photon and electron beams. MMCTP uses a two‐step process to generate MC dose distributions. The MC module controls egs/Beam and XVMC calculations. Input files, prepared from the beam geometry, are uploaded and run on the cluster using shell commands. Upon completion of XVMC, the GUI downloads individual dose files. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The MMCTP GUI provides a flexible research platform for the development of patient specific MC treatment planning for photon and electron external beam radiation therapy. MMCTP uses an internal storage format that is flexible in that it allows for multi‐instance multi‐modality image information useful in the planning process. The visualization, dose matrix operation and DVH tools offer extensive possibility for plan analysis and comparison to plans imported from commercial treatment planning systems through well‐documented image storage protocols such as DICOM.</jats:p>",

Critical structures, a node‐like CTV, and 2mm surface structure (‘skin’) were contoured on a CT image of the phantom with and without an immobilization mask. A PTV was generated by expanding the CTV 5mm in all directions up to the body contour; three modifications were then implemented, pulling back the PTV 0, 3 or 5mm from the body contour. Seven‐field IMRT plans were created using Eclipse to maximize PTV coverage, with one of the following strategies: (1) aim for maximum 110% hotspot, 115% allowed, (2) maximum 105% hotspot, (3) maximum 105% hotspot and 50% of skin to get maximum 70% of prescribed dose, (4) 99% of PTV volume to receive 90–93% of prescribed dose, maximum 105% hotspot, and dose to skin structure minimized.

The AIP images are used to represent tumor motion during treatment planning and delivery in extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (ESRT). Planning DRR images are created for each treatment field. Cine EPIs are collected for each treatment field. The apertures are segmented from EPIs by thresholding, and then used to register the EPIs and the associated DRRs. The segmented EPIs are enhanced to highlight the tumor area. Then enhanced EPIs and DRRs are fused together in the aperture to produce a fusion movie. Cine EPIs are averaged to produce an average EPI. The tumor movement in each EPI is enhanced by subtracting the average EPI from the original Cine EPI. A sequence of tumor movement images is sorted to form a subtraction movie. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The registration procedure is performed automatically without user supervision. Fusion movies show the target motion against the static background of DRR, providing a visual perception of the moving anatomy around the target. Subtraction movies show clearly the track of the target motion inside the aperture. Periodic displacement of the tumor reflects respiratory movement. The size, deviation, and deformation of the tumor can be observed. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> This technology will benefit the verification of treatment planning and delivery, the evaluation of the patient set up, and the visual inspection of the tumor movement during ESRT. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Part of this work was funded by Elekta, Inc., Norcross GA.</jats:p>",

This interactive planning tool will help users to select the best available plans in the IMRT solution space.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> IMRT often is a time consuming iterative optimization process between evaluation of the dose distribution and redefinition of the object function. An IMRT planning optimization tool (Multi‐Criteria Optimization, MCO™) has been introduced for non‐clinical evaluation to acquire the best available solutions. Based on a Pareto's solution concept, this tool could search the solution space and offer users a limited set of deliverable IMRT plans. With this interactive process, users can set the target and critical structures dose constraints with the biological model (EUD) to obtain the best solution. We used Pinnacle system as the benchmark to compare the dosimetric gain from the MCO algorithm, DVH indicated excellent sparing with better PTV coverage is achievable from the MCO process in KonRad system.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Dosimetric findings are summarized as 1) MCO optimization testing shows that much better dose distribution can be achieved compared to the current planning results (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). Due to the confined solution space, the optimal results are easily achievable. 2) MCO with Pareto's approach is durable in the solution searching process. It is interactive with the graphical interface which the dose distribution along with the DVH can be compared simultaneously (Fig. 3). 3) IMRT dose optimization and summary based on the MCO methodology are very conceivable. With pre‐calculated IMRT solutions, final results help users to select the best available plan from the solution domain in real time (Fig. 4). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> From this interactive MCO planning tool, we can calculate the best IMRT results in a very reasonable time frame. Human factors for determining an acceptable plan can be dramatically reduced.</jats:p>",

Here we present a preliminary evaluation of a commercial electron Monte Carlo algorithm. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Percent depth dose and profiles of 6‐20 MeV electrons and 6×6 – 25×25 cm cones were measured in a water tank at 100 cm SSD using a Farmer chamber for electrons. Absolute output was measured at 110 and 100 cm SSDs. Outputs and distributions of two extreme test cases were measured: a 2.1 cm × 3 cm insert in a 6×6 cone and a 2.8 cm × 15.7 cm long slit on a 25×25 cone. The algorithm's ability to accurately model relative and absolute dose of an obliquely (30°) oriented beam was evaluated ionization chamber measurements. Clinical cases with were checked using Mosfet dosimeters <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic>. Monte Carlo calculations were performed with a 2 mm grid, and smoothing filters provided with the algorithm were applied to minimize noise in the data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Agreement of 2% of measured and modeled doses was found over the evaluated range of energies, cones, obliquities and SSDs. Compute times of 1–5 minutes were a function of increasing field size. Visual comparison of the shapes of the profiles was in agreement with measurement. Profiles of the eccentric geometry test cases appeared to be to be physically unrealistic (e.g. an inverted V) in the smaller dimension suggesting that the beam model was not valid. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The Monte Carlo electron algorithm provides accurate distributions for most clinical cases. For extreme cases, measurements should be made to test the accuracy of the system, and further development of the algorithm is recommended.</jats:p>",

Drawing on insights from both poststructural and regulationist approaches, I situate their development and crises in what Jenson and Phillips term ‘citizenship regimes’. Local representation of labour and equity groups could be effective and reflected struggles over both recognition and redistribution. However, representation often depended on resources drawn from other scales and especially on the relationship of stakeholders with the provincial and national state. Local representation has some autonomy from macroshift in citizenship regimes, but in both cases there is strong evidence that the state is able to incorporate stakeholder representation into what Jessop terms ‘metagovernance strategies’, although it cannot necessarily control it. </jats:p>",

The superior fields are ideal for IMRT but possible interplay effects between leaf and mediastinal motion makes IMRT less desirable for the inferior fields. A new, differential smoothing IMRT technique is compared to matched and extended field IMRT plans. <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold> The differential smoothing IMRT technique treated the superior portion of the target with 7 fixed, low smoothing rate (LSR) beams while the inferior portion was treated by 3–4 highly smoothed, fixed beams with an overlap region. All beams existed in a single IMRT plan and were optimized simultaneously. This technique was used to plan treatments for three head and neck cancer patients with mediastinal involvement. These patients were also planned using two alternative techniques: (1) A matched field technique, with conformal radiation therapy used for the inferior portion, and an LSR IMRT plan used for the superior portion; (2) An extended field LSR IMRT plan treating the full extent of the disease. The plans were compared dosimetrically. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The differential smoothing technique provided homogenous, continuous coverage throughout the target volume while the matched field plan demonstrated discontinuous coverage in the match region. The extended field IMRT plan had coverage comparable to the differential smoothing plan. However, patient and leaf motion could compromise coverage in practice. The average MLC leaf opening in the inferior differentially smoothed beams was 1.5–2 times greater than the average opening in any of the LSR beams (1.55cm for LSR beams verses 3.04cm for highly smoothed beams) thereby potentially reducing the impact of patient motion. Lung DVH's were similar for all three techniques. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The differential smoothing technique offers continuous, more homogenous coverage than the matched field method and is probably less susceptible to patient motion than the extended field technique.</jats:p>",

The balloon was identified and contoured on the CT images using Plato BPS. A PTV was created by volumetrically expanding the balloon volume by 1cm. The final volume, PTV_EVAL consisted of the PTV minus the balloon volume. Six reference points were added along the outside edge of PTV_EVAL. Four points were added at locations lateral to the axis of the catheter, and two points were added along the axis of the catheter. Dose was prescribed to the six points individually, and DVHs of PTV_EVAL were calculated. Then dose was prescribed to 4, 5, and 6 reference points simultaneously, and a new DVH was created for each of those three cases. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For each prescription, the V150, V100, V90 and D95 from the DVH for PTV_EVAL were recorded and averaged across the four patients.

Only the dose in the ROI (excluding the external) is required, and is stored as integers. Three equations were tested to determine the number of sampling points within each ROI. The first was to keep the same relative percentage of volume for all ROIs. The second was proportional to the hyperbolic tangent of each ROI volume, while the third was proportional to the cube root of the volume. A least square objective function was calculated on all resulting sampling methods. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> By saving dose values as integers instead of doubles, a 75% reduction is seen in file size, while keeping accuracy to 0.001%. The objective function computational efficiency improvement is directly proportional to the data storage reduction.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> GammaPlan, the planning software for Gamma Knife stereotactic radiosurgery, approximates many parameters to increase calculation speeds. These approximations can introduce dosimetric errors. We investigate the magnitude of these errors. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A planning algorithm was written to avoid the use of approximations. Skull scaling is accomplished through a simple edge detection algorithm on the imported images. Dose calculations are accomplished through the use of TMR measurements and beam profiles taken at various depths, and of all collimators. To measure the TMR of one beamlet, 200 of the 201 sources were plugged. A tungsten sphere was designed to provide additional attenuation of unwanted beamlets when taking film and ion chamber measurements in its center. Ion chamber measurements are obtained for various amounts of water‐equivalent ABS plastic for the 14 and 18 mm collimator. Additionally, Gafchromic film is placed between the pieces of plastic to obtain both PDD and TMR measurements of all collimators. The Gamma Knife calibration sphere was then modeled in both GammaPlan and our algorithm, and treatment times for isocenters placed throughout the sphere were calculated using both algorithms. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The 18 mm collimator TMR showed small deviations past 40 mm from the 0×0 curve used by GammaPlan, and differences up to 2% are seen at shallow depths. The 14 mm collimator showed similar behavior. Discrepancies of 3.8% on average (maximum 8.9%) were calculated for shots placed in various locations throughout the calibration sphere. Differences increased with the distance from the middle of the sphere and increasing gamma angle. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We developed a robust Gamma Knife planning software, effectively reducing errors due to approximations. Our results agree with GammaPlan's calculated times. Skull scaling differences are the major source of the discrepancies between the two calculations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the recent significance children's geographies have been afforded within many geographical subdisciplines, their experiences of migration have received relatively little attention. However, children do migrate and their migration is often distinct from that of entire households. In this paper we explore children's migration in southern Africa within the context of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, focusing in particular on the impacts of moving house on children's sociospatial experiences. Migration has consequences for several areas of children's lives, and the nature of those consequences is shaped by the context within which migration takes place. In southern Africa AIDS is an unavoidable aspect of the sociospatial context, but the impact it has on children varies. This exemplar has wider implications for two areas of geographical research. First, in the paper we advocate the importance of including children's experiences of migration within culturally informed studies of migration. Second, there is a need for research in children's geographies to extend beyond the microlevel. We advocate a refocusing of research beyond children's static relationship to environments to also encompass children's transient geographies in discussions of their life experiences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Gamma knife treatments are usually planned manually, requiring much expertise and time. We describe a new, fully automatic method of treatment planning. The treatment volume to be planned is first compared with a database of past treatments to find volumes closely matching in size and shape. The treatment parameters of the closest matches are used as starting points for the new treatment plan. Further optimization is performed with the Nelder‐Mead simplex method: the coordinates and weight of the isocenters are allowed to vary until a maximally conformal plan specific to the new treatment volume is found. The method was tested on a randomly selected set of 10 acoustic neuromas and 10 meningiomas. Typically, matching a new volume took under 30 seconds. The time for simplex optimization, on a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7314-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp7314:mp7314-math-0001\" /> Xeon processor, ranged from under a minute for small volumes (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7314-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp7314:mp7314-math-0002\" /> cubic mm, 2–3 isocenters), to several tens of hours for large volumes <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7314-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp7314:mp7314-math-0003\" />.

In 4/10 acoustic neuromas and 5/10 meningiomas, both overtreatment and undertreatment ratios were equal or better in automated plans. In conclusion, data‐mining of past treatments can be used to derive starting parameters for treatment planning.

This paper examines a critically important aspect of this approach: the relationship between radically novel sociotechnical practices in niches and the mainstream social–technical regimes they seek to influence. Although the literature notes the significance of this relationship, it does so in a paradoxical way. It is argued that niches are more likely to influence mainstream change when they show a degree of compatibility with the incumbent regime. Yet this compatibility criterion blunts the scope for niches to be radically innovative, thereby undermining the degree of regime transformation being sought. The case of organic food is used to explore this paradox empirically. The history of the organic niche, and its engagement and entanglement with the mainstream food regime, suggests a dialectical relationship between sociotechnical niches and regimes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of stable markets in ecosystem services is now a major neoliberal policy initiative in the United States and elsewhere. Such markets, however, require ecosystem scientists to play a new and challenging role in certifying the value of the commodities traded, which are defined using the holistic measures of ecology rather than the uncontroversial measures of weight, volume, or time. As ecosystem science increasingly serves as a metrical technology for the commodification of ecosystem services, its fine and fragile distinctions increasingly bear the weight of capital circulation. In this paper I report on fieldwork among ecosystem assessment technicians, and suggest that this new round of the commodification of nature may overwhelm the capacity of science to provide stable representations of commodity value. The methods and techniques of ecosystem assessment must describe a nature that capital can ‘see’—that has an uncontroversial measure—in order for trade to occur. However, these assessment methods currently produce unstable data that are rendered meaningful in economic terms only by dint of creative and ad hoc efforts at translation by field technicians. It is suggested that this may represent a practical limit or crisis point in the expansion of capital relations, or at least a complication in the streamlined neoliberal narratives about the commodification of ecosystem services. </jats:p>",

Evidence suggests a continuing expert-deficit model of lay knowledge, with suspicions that the public misunderstand environmental issues. Although the need for public ‘buy-in’ to the solutions to problems such as air pollution is supported, this does not translate to a more proactive engagement of lay knowledge in the assessment of such issues. Experts seem to be personally challenged by such notions.

For example, RTOG is initiating a new hypofractionation regimen (RTOG 0438) to treat liver cancer patients. To evaluate the radiobiological equivalence between different regimens, which is useful in the design of these trials, requires reliable radiobiological parameters. The purpose of this work is to estimate a plausible set of such parameters for liver tumor based on published clinical data. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A phenomenological expression inspired by the linear‐quadratic (LQ) formalism was developed to fit a series of clinical survival data for radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. The data are from different institutes using different fractionation (e.g., 1.5, 1.8 or 4.88 Gy). The phenomenological expression consists of 6 fitting parameters including radiosensitivity parameters α and α/β, potential doubling time T<jats:sub>b</jats:sub>, and clonogenic cell number K. The expression considers the prescription dose, dose per fraction, overall treatment time and the elapsed time at which the survival data were collected. We have developed an algorithm to take into account the tumor cell repopulation during the elapsed time. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The newly developed phenomenological expression was found to fit well to the available clinical data. Based on the fitting, we have estimated a set of plausible radiobiological parameters for liver tumor: α/β = 12.8 ± 1.0 Gy, α 0.013 ± 0.002 Gy, the potential doubling time: 123 ± 9 days, and colonogenic cell number: 1302 ± 47. Using this set of parameters we have calculated a series of dose fractionation regimens that are biologically equivalent based on BED. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A plausible set of radiobiological parameters have been obtained based on clinical data.

Methods and Materials: A Gammex RMI 467 tissue characterization phantom was used to generate CT numbers for both the Elekta XVI CBCT and the Picker 5000CT. For both devices, the RMI phantom was positioned using the manufacturer's recommendations. Hounsfield numbers (HU) were obtained using a default window and level and a ROI of 1cm diameter over the center of the rod (insert). The numbers were recorded and a HU vs. electron density correction curve was generated. For the cone beam portion, we used the Elekta XVI CBCT with M10 collimator and no filter. CBCT data, conventional CT data and correction curves were transferred to our CMS XIO treatment planning system. To verify the consistency of CBCT numbers, we added a 1cm of bolus to the phantom and repeated the procedure. A single field treatment plan was generated with heterogeneity and non heterogeneity corrections for CBCT and CT datasets, and for nonbolused and bolused geometries. The Gammex phantom tissue equivalent rods were modified to accept TLD for measurement verification. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Calculated doses for treatment plans generated without heterogeneity correction for data sets from CT and CBCT agreed within ∼1%. CBCT numbers for the same insert differed with a small change in setup (ie. adding 1cm bolus). When heterogeneity correction was turned on, a difference of 14% was found between CT and CBCT nonbolused plans. TLD measured doses agreed with those from the calculated CT set. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Without heterogeneity correction, the dose calculation with CT and CBCT has excellent agreement suggesting a consistency in contour acquisition. One has to be extremely cautious in using CBCT data for heterogeneity corrections since significant error can occur.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> HDR dose optimization may be performed using a combination of Geometric Optimization (GO) and manual adjustment e.g. Graphical Optimization (GrO), but is time‐consuming. Optimization using anatomy based inverse planning e.g. Inverse Planning with Simulated Annealing (IPSA) can generate a solution in minutes. This study compares optimization using IPSA and GrO for treatment of prostate cancer. <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold> A retrospective comparison was performed of 63 consecutive patient plans generated and treated using GrO then re‐planned using IPSA. The clinical target volume and critical organs were contoured using PLATO v14.2.6 (Nucletron). A dose of 10Gy per insertion was prescribed to the 100% isodose. Dose optimization was performed using a combination of GO and GrO. For GrO, the isodose was dragged to the desired position, and the system automatically recalculated the appropriate dwell times. For each plan, the following dosimetric comparisons were made between that generated by IPSA and that generated and treated using GrO: prostate V100, V150, V200, urethra V120, Rectal V80, bladder V80, Homogeneity Index (HI) and Conformity Index (COIN). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The V100 was slightly lower with IPSA (GrO=97.5%, IPSA=96.7% p=0.001) but with a greater reduction in V150 (GrO=35.6%, IPSA=30.2% p=0.000) and V200 (GrO=12.7%, IPSA=10.7% p=0.000). Similarly, V120 for urethra (GrO=16.1%, IPSA=6.7% p=0.000), V80 for rectum (GrO=2.1%, IPSA=1.3% p=0.000) and V80 for bladder (GrO=2.3%, IPSA=1.3% p=0.000) were significantly lower with IPSA. HI increased (GrO=0.63, IPSA=0.69 p=0.000) while COIN was lower (GrO=0.71, IPSA=0.68 p=0.000). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> IPSA enables the rapid generation of dose‐optimized plans. The resultant plans provide comparable target coverage but with greater dose homogeneity, a lower high dose volume and lower dose to critical organs. Planning time was reduced using IPSA. This is a significant advantage over other methods of dose optimization in a clinical environment.</jats:p>",

MC simulation parameters are read and calculated from the DICOM RT objects. The CT image set is then used to generate a virtual phantom in a manner analogous to that of CTcreate (the relevant EGSnrc program), but with the added advantage of incorporating the structures in RT Structure Set for volume definition within the phantom. The MC simulation is broken into stages that progress from the target in the head of the accelerator (modeled explicitly), through the various stages of collimation, and into the phantom using both BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc on a dedicated cluster of 18 processors. Using RT Dose, we compare absolute dose differences between the TPS and MC quantitatively in 3D using a χ metric. To illustrate the implementation, we compare dose distributions for an unblocked four field pelvis plan at 15 MV. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Simulation of the complete plan took &lt; 7 hours, achieving statistical uncertainties of ∼1.6% for each field (at isocenter) in 2.5 ×.2.5 × 3 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> voxels. Within the body contour 98.4% of the MC dose voxels agree with the TPS (2%/2.5 mm criteria).

Second, we globally optimize a plan quality score over the six most sensitive parameters in an outer loop to determine acceptable parameters, using a search algorithm based on multiscale random sampling. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Experiments on a 36‐patient dataset showed that a clinically acceptable five‐field 8640cGy prostate IMRT plan could be automatically determined in 35 minutes on the average in 87% of the cases. Compared to the plans from the planner's protocol default settings, the mean value of the minimum dose in PTV increased from 67.5% to 79.7%, and the mean value of PTV V95 coverage increased from 82.2% to 94.1%. The mean values of rectal wall V54%, rectal wall V87% and bladder wall V54% are 50.4%, 12.6% and 36.1%, respectively. The outer‐loop‐optimized plans met DVH constraints defining clinical acceptability and were comparable to manually‐determined plans. Confining the parameter search to the sensitive parameter set greatly improves the quality and speed of the outer‐loop optimization. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The reduced‐order outer‐loop optimization can facilitate parameter selection for dose‐volume‐based IMRT objectives. It may also be applicable to other types of objective functions, and has the potential to ease the manual burden of IMRT planning in more complex sites (e.g. head and neck).</jats:p><jats:p>Supported by National Cancer Institute grant 5P01CA59017‐13 and the NSF Center for Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems, grant EEC‐9986821.</jats:p>",

Accounts of these events tend to rehearse a common narrative about mass urban protests that frame such demonstrations as a conflict between proglobalization governments and antiglobalization activists. This narrative focuses on the physicality of the protests without considering their performative qualities, assumes that state practices and dissent are distinct, mutually exclusive realms of action, and takes ‘globalization’ to be a scale-fixed process. We call this narrative into question by pursuing two lines of inquiry. First, we analyze the spatial and discursive practices of three different groups of protesters so as to identify crucial affinities and distinctions in their positions and strategies. Second, we challenge the view that capitalist states are simply ‘proglobalization’ by considering resistance to the US delegation by South American delegations within the FTAA ministerial. From our reading of these events we draw lessons regarding the political and strategic effects of mass urban demonstrations.</jats:p>",

The accuracy of the MC physics models was established in previous studies and the model of the therapy unit is described elsewhere (Newhauser et al, Zheng et al., separate contributions to this conference). MC simulations of proton beams with different range, field sizes and modulation widths into various phantom geometries, comprising cubic water phantoms with lung and bone equivalent material slabs, cylindrical inhomogeneities and non‐flat upstream surfaces, were carried out to compare depth dose profiles, lateral profiles, penumbral widths and field size values to predictions from the treatment planning system. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> More than 30 different beam configurations have been investigated. Range differences, and differences in the 80%–20% penumbras larger than 2 mm were observed twice, while differences in the 50%–50% field size were smaller than 1 mm. The range differences were not related to the inhomogeneities, but are due to differences in the proton stopping powers used in the MC and TPS systems. The deviations in the penumbras were mostly seen in the 90%–10% penumbra comparisons of profiles at large depths, where contributions from multiple Coulomb scattering started to become more visible in the MC simulations, but less in the TPS predictions. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Monte Carlo simulations proofed to be a valuable tool to verify the dose predictions in heterogeneous phantoms from a commercial treatment planning system. The treatment planning software performed well in most cases considered. This investigation helped to substantially reduce the time required for testing and the treatment planning software package and provided valuable feedback to the TPS developer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of planning agreements to provide funding for transport improvements required to support development proposals is discussed. The legislation and Government guidance referred to applies to England, but there is similar legislation and guidance applicable to Scotland and Wales. Planning policies since the late 1980s have required developments to be accessible by non-car modes of transport as well as by private vehicles and planning agreements are thus usually used to secure improvements to all transport modes. Planning agreements have been in use since the early 1970s and many agreements have secured highway improvements. These have usually been for single large-scale developments. Securing improvements needed to meet the cumulative impact of a number of developments has not been very successful with the result that many developments cause an impact but the necessary transport infrastructure has to be provided by the transport authorities. New Government advice issued in 2005 has made it clear that standard charges and pooling funding from several developments for the provision of transport infrastructure is acceptable. Some methods have been developed and are reviewed in the paper. Compared with the standard charge methods that have been developed for the provision of open space and educational facilities those for transport lag well behind. The result of this is that much needed funding for transport is not being collected. </jats:p>",

We recorded neuronal activity while monkeys performed a behavioral task during which two visual instruction cues were given successively with an intervening delay. One cue instructed the location of the target to be reached, and the other indicated which arm was to be used. We found that the properties of neuronal activity in the PMd and PMv differed in many respects. After the first cue was given, PMv neuron response mostly reflected the spatial position of the visual cue. In contrast, PMd neuron response also reflected what the visual cue instructed, such as which arm to be used or which target to be reached. After the second cue was given, PMv neurons initially responded to the cue's visuospatial features and later reflected what the two visual cues instructed, progressively increasing information about the target location. In contrast, the activity of the majority of PMd neurons responded to the second cue with activity reflecting a combination of information supplied by the first and second cues. Such activity, already reflecting a forthcoming action, appeared with short latencies (&lt;400 ms) and persisted throughout the delay period. In addition, both the PMv and PMd showed bilateral representation on visuospatial information and motor-target or effector information. These results further elucidate the functional specialization of the PMd and PMv during the processing of visual information for action planning. </jats:p>",

Each of these areas is explored with reference to different theoretical perspectives. I conclude that the multifaceted nature of place attachment requires a multidisciplinary approach to the study of people and their environments.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Introduction:</jats:bold> A new Elekta “Synergy S” dedicated stereotactic machine has been commissioned and clinically implemented. This linac has special features, including a kV cone beam CT (CBCT) and a multileaf collimator (MLC) system, termed as “Beam Modulator” (BM), with no back up jaws. Dosimetric parameters of the BM are compared with those of Radionics mini multileaf collimator (MMLC). The two MLC systems have different dosimetric parameters, chiefly due to different shapes, field sizes and isocentric distances. The effects of these differences on tumour dose coverage and sparing organs at risk (OAR) are evaluated. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> The leaf thickness and maximum field size at the isocentre are 4mm and 16×21cm for the BM and 3.75mm and 10×12cm for MMLC. The leaf‐bottom isocentric distances of the two systems are 45.2cm and 33cm, respectively. Radionics treatments planning (XKnife RT3.01) is used for planning comparison. Dose penumbras and percentage depth doses were measured using diode detector and XV2 films for different field sizes. CBCT doses were measured using an ion‐chamber and MOSFET. Two different clinical cases were chosen for the treatment planning comparison. <jats:bold>RESULTS:</jats:bold> MMLC dose penumbras (80–20%) at dmax for a 9.6×10.4cm field were 5.4mm and 5.6mm for the leaf sides and leaf ends, respectively and 5.8mm and 6.5mm for BM. As a result, Radionics MMLC has the advantage of better sparing of OARs. Also, Radionics MMLC delivered the prescribed doses using fewer segments and less number of monitor units by up to 20%. The CBCT dose to head phantom was in the range of 1.5 to 3.0 cGy per scan. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> In this work it is shown that the above MLC systems are overall clinically comparable, with Radionics MMLC marginally better sparing normal tissues. The Elekta BM however has the advantage of larger field size and better isocentric clearance.</jats:p>",

The use of scenarios to explore ecological dynamics of alternative futures has been given a major boost by the recently completed Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a 4‐year initiative to investigate relationships between ecosystem services and human well‐being at multiple scales. Scenarios, as descriptive narratives of pathways to the future, are a mechanism for improving the understanding and management of ecological and social processes by scientists and decision makers with greater flexibility than conventional techniques could afford. We used scenarios in one of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's subglobal components to explore four possible futures in a Southern African river basin. Because of its ability to capture spatial and temporal dynamics, the scenario exercise revealed key trade‐offs in ecosystem services in space and time and the importance of a multiple‐scale scenario design. At subglobal scales, scenarios are a powerful vehicle for communication and engagement of decision makers, especially when designed to identify responses to specific problems. Scenario planning has the potential to be a critical ingredient in conservation as calls are increasingly made for the field to help define and achieve sustainable visions for the future.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

First step in the process is to correct the MR images for 3D geometrical distortions by applying a novel distortion correction procedure. The next stage is to segment the datasets into anatomical structures by using an automatic segmentation tool suited for MR brain images. Once the MR images contain both the target volume and the electron density information, they are ready to be used for dose calculations. The resulting CT+MR and MR‐based plans were compared in terms of isodose distributions, DVHs and NTCP/TCPs. A plan ranking TCP‐based method for heterogeneous irradiation, which does not require the knowledge of radiobiological parameters, is used. <jats:bold>Results</jats:bold>: For all patients investigated, we found that MR‐based plans (1.5T and 3T) are in good agreement (within 1%) with their corresponding CT+MR‐based plans in terms of PTV dose coverage, DVHs and NTCP/TCPs. We compared tumor contours drawn on both 1.5T and 3T MR images in terms of shape, volumes and their impact on CRT plans. For all patients the delineation of the tumor was simpler for 3T images due to higher contrast. For some patients the tumor volumes drawn on the 3T images were up to 60% higher than on 1.5T images. RT plan ranking shows that the 3T plans are significantly better than 1.5T ones. <jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: The proposed MR‐based treatment planning procedure was found to perform as good as the current clinical procedure based on CT+MR. Due to a higher contrast the tumor may be significantly better delineated on 3T images.</jats:p>",

Some patients have undergone both three dimensional conformal therapy (3D‐CRT) and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) using two commercially available treatment planning systems which we will refer to as system (1) and system (2), respectively. In order to quantify the fusion results bony landmarks, such as the ramus of the mandible or part of the skull bone, were outlined on the reformatted MRI and the position of the outline in reference to the same bony landmark on the CT image were measured. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Based on what was acceptable fusion for our clinicians, this preliminary study showed registration accuracy between CT and MRI within 3 mm and 2 mm for system (1) and (2), respectively. On system 2 the quality of the fusion, the bar display, was in the range 62.5% – 100%. We also found that getting full bar (100% — ‘perfect match’) is possible with reasonable effort if one uses three fiducial marks. Though the bar showed 100% fusion quality the fusion results were not satisfactory. We found better fusion using five or more fiducial points with 62.5 % to 75 % fusion quality. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Fusion software in both systems provides sufficient CT‐MRI fusion accuracy. However, one has to be careful in interpreting the semi‐quantitative bar display in system (2) fusion results. We found that instead of going for a perfect matching bar using few fiducial marks one has to use more points, at least five, even if one gets lower percentage match as this is averaged over more landmarks.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> IMRT can play an important role in the irradiation of head and neck tumors traditionally treated by lateral fields matched with an anterior supraclivicular field. However, due to the complex PTV geometry, these IMRT plans result in large numbers of segments leading to inefficient deliveries. We have developed an alternative IMRT planning technique utilizing Direct Aperture Optimization (DAO) to streamline the planning process and provide significant efficiency gains. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The process begins with the placement of traditional 3D conformal fields (laterals and anerior superclavicular). Next, the dose is calculated with this beam arrangement. The 90% isodose line is converted into a PTV with surrounding critical structures (e.g. spinal cord, parotid glands, posterior medial neck region) excluded from the PTV definition. The resulting PTV serves as the target for IMRT planning. For our planning technique, we have used the DAO algorithm in the Prowess Panther planning system. DAO plans generally result in significantly fewer segments as compared with those generated by traditional IMRT planning techniques. This is of critical importance since traditional IMRT plans for these cases have excessively long treatment times. Using DAO allows practical treatment times without sacrificing plan quality. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Fifteen patients were planned and treated with this technique. Seven equispaced beams were used in each. The objectives were PTV dose conformity and low dose to any avoidance regions. The spinal cord limit was 40Gy. For the DAO plans, treatment times ranged from 9 to 17 minutes on an Elekta SL20 acclerator. For corresponding plans produced using Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, treatment times ranged from 30 to 45 minutes. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> An IMRT treatment technique for head and neck cancer has been devised. This technique removes field matching and allows the initial 50Gy to be delivered with a single plan. Using DAO provides significant reductions in treatment times.</jats:p>",

Various component modules were used to consider the head design including the target, primary collimator and multi‐leaf collimators (MLC). The percentage depth dose (PDD) and beam profile in a water phantom were generated using the phase‐space data below MLC and then compared to measurements. Using tools from the BEAMnrc package, the phase‐space data above MLC were used to extract a dual source model, consisting of a ring photon source located at the target and another ring source located at the primary collimator. The source model was verified in the following steps: (1) the source model was used to reconstruct the phase‐space data below MLC, which, in turn, was used to calculate PDD and beam profiles, (2) the PDD and beam profiles generated by (1) were compared to those generated by the original phase‐space data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> It was found that the PDD and beam profiles using Monte Carlo methods (the phase‐space data) agreed well (within 2%) with the measurements. The dose distributions using the source model were found to agree with (within 2%) the Monte Carlo and measurement data, indicating the source model is suitable to replace the Monte Carlo simulation for dose calculations in routine treatment planning. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Monte Carlo simulation of a Tomotherapy unit has been carried out and a source model suitable for dose calculations in treatment planning has been derived.

In this paper we contribute to this literature by presenting new evidence from a firm-based survey within three Turkish industrial centres about the causes of differentiated network activity. Using multivariate analysis, we show that locational rather than sectoral differences explain local-linkage intensities, but this is not the case for global links. Second, there is an important relationship between firm size and local-linkage and global-linkage densities; the density of local networks decreases with increasing firm size, whereas the density of global networks increases with firm size. Third, there is a positive relation between globalnetwork density and firm productivity. We argue that the comparative and quantitative analysis we employ is a useful adjunct to case-study analysis, which could help avoid misconceptions and lead to a more realistic theory. </jats:p>",

A movable lung phantom was built using the NEMA IEC body phantom containing 6 hollow spheres with diameters ranging from 10 to 37 mm. The phantom volume was packed with Styrofoam beads and filled with water to reach the density close to the density of lung 0.3g/cc. The tumor motion was simulated by a movable acrylic table that provided variable amplitudes and frequencies of movement to the phantom. The spheres were filled with 1.14 mCi/ml of FDG. There was no background activity in the body phantom outside of the spheres. Scans were performed for variable amplitudes ranging from 0.5 to 2 cm. CT and PET images were auto‐contoured on Pinnacle workstation using variable thresholds relative to the maximum SUV. The threshold that best measured the volume of each sphere in static mode and the effective volume in dynamic mode was assessed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The SUV threshold that best defines the target volume in static mode and the effective volume in dynamic mode when no respiratory gating is applied depends on the motion amplitude. The small spheres are more sensitive to the inhomogeneity of the medium, most probably because the positron range is greater in lung equivalent medium then in water. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The study shows that it is not accurate to apply a constant threshold for target volume delineation in radiation therapy for all tumor sizes and variable tumor movement. The change of target delineation threshold is more due to the increase of the partial volume effect when the tumor activity is spread over a large volume proportional to the magnitude of movement.</jats:p>",

The motion effect for the normal lung volume receiving dose was not correlated with the tumor volume or the location. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Respiration motion may significantly influence the tumor dose in lung radiotherapy and 4D dose calculation may be necessary when treating tumors in the lower lung or when the tumor volume is small.</jats:p>",

The target was the union of the exhale and inhale GTVs, uniformly expanded by 5mm(ITV). Patients were planned with both AP/PA and 3‐D conformal plans using the exhale (“static”) dataset, assuming unit density, for 100±5% ITV dose coverage. Each of these plans was further used to calculate: (a) heterogeneous “static” dose; (b) homogeneous cumulative dose; (c) heterogeneous cumulative dose. The same number of MU were used for each of the calculations and was based on the homogeneous “static” plan. Cumulative dose distributions consisted of a time‐weighted sum of exhale and inhale doses. Doses were calculated using the DPM_MC code which includes secondary electron transport for the heterogeneous computations. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Relative to unit‐density plans, tumor EUD, and lung NTCP increased in the heterogeneity corrected plans; primarily due to the reduced beam attenuation through lungs and the larger than coin‐size tumors investigated. In comparing 4D cumulative dose plans with static plans, clinical EUD and NTCP estimates were relatively unchanged. The insignificant tumor EUD change was a consequence of good target design, while the small lung NTCP change was due to its large volume effect. Accounting for tissue heterogeneity resulted in average changes of 10% in MLD. Accounting for 4D breathing motion effects resulted in &lt;1% changes in MLD from the static value. The magnitude of these effects was not correlated with the dose distribution conformality. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> In this study we found that tissue heterogeneity effects are likely to have a larger clinical significance on tumor (if ITV is properly designed) and normal lung clinical treatment evaluation metrics than occurs with 4‐D respiratory‐induced changes.</jats:p><jats:p>Supported by P01‐CA59827, R01‐CA106770.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A set of megavoltage (MV) and kilovoltage (kV) images are obtained during a patient's image‐guided radiotherapy treatment (IGRT). The kV images are acquired prior to treating the fields using an on‐board x‐ray imager. However, The MV images can be acquired both prior and during the actual treatments. Fan‐beam reconstruction of back‐projected kV images obtained at four or more gantry angles can be used to orient the planning CT to match the treatment geometry. Registering the planning CT to the treatment geometry is necessary if one is to perform dose reconstruction using the multi‐planar images and the planning CT, in the absence of a cone beam CT. The MV and kV images provide the exit fluence information for 3D dose reconstruction. Using these 2D treatment images along with the 3D planning CT volume provides adequate information about the treatment anatomy that is needed for the dose reconstruction process. This system might alleviate the need for cone beam CT for patient positioning and/or dose reconstruction. The planar treatment images provide adequately sampled sinogram planes in the spatial dimension, but not in the radial direction. Nonetheless, there is enough data in the sinogram space for registering the treatment geometry to the planning CT. Canny edge finding method is used to decipher anatomical structure in the limited reconstructed volume as well as in the CT volume. This technique can detect both strong and weak edges; and it is less likely than the other edge finding techniques to be fooled by noise. The resulting edge maps are registered to each other by affine transformations. The transformation matrices are then applied to the CT volume in order to register it to the treatment geometry.</jats:p>",

It selects automatically the active dwell positions and optimizes the dwell times to fulfill the dose objectives. It is setup to maximize the prostate dose coverage while taking into account other clinical objectives like the dose homogeneity and the organs at risk protection. Multiobjective optimizations are performed using the IP for one small (23cc), one intermediate (35cc) and one large (80cc) prostate. 10 inverse plans were generated with different compromises between dose coverage and dose homogeneity. This was performed first with the prostate alone and then with all the organs at risk. In addition, 10 inverse plans were generated with different compromises between dose coverage and urethra protection. 90 DVH were generated and analyzed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> When only the prostate is included, the prostate V100 varies from 100% to 97% and the homogeneity index (HI) from 0.06 to 0.68. When all the organs at risk are included, the prostate V100 varies from 97% to 91% and the HI from 0.52 to 0.72. When the urethra protection is increased, the prostate V100 varies from 100% to 89%, the urethra V100 from 100% to 89%, the urethra V120 from 87% to 0% and the urethra V150 from 3% to 0%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> For simple cases where only a target is defined, the dose homogeneity is adjustable with the IP. For complex cases where organs at risk are added, this anatomy‐based optimization automatically adjusts the dose homogeneity to protect the urethra. Additional organ protection can be achieved with specific penalty. This research was supported by Nucletron Corporation.</jats:p>",

This may allow more accurate treatment planning for patients with metallic implants. The Radiological Physics Center's (RPC) pelvic phantom was modified to accommodate a commercial Co‐Cr‐Mo hip prosthesis and imaged with both kVCT and MVCT. On the TomoTherapy Hi‐Art II planning system, the MVCT‐to‐density table was extended to high‐Z materials by including stainless steel and lead in the calibration. Contours were drawn on kVCT images without the prosthesis present and fused to the MVCT image set. Helical tomotherapy plans were created using the MVCT images with no constraints on beam entry or exit location. The delivered dose distribution was measured using TLDs in the PTV and EBT radiochromic film in the coronal and sagittal planes. Criteria based on TG‐53 recommendations were used for comparison between measurements and calculations. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Dose calculation with MVCT images resulted in minor variations between calculated and measured dose. It was found that on average 97% of the dose distribution measured with film agreed with the treatment planning system to within +/−5% or 3mm. Profiles across the PTV also showed good agreement between measurement and calculation. The average TLD dose at the center of the PTV was 96.0% of the expected dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Using dose calculations based on MVCT images, it is possible to accurately calculate the dose distribution in the pelvic region while treating through a high‐Z prosthetic implant.

The original dose‐volume histogram (DVH) constraints were used as the initial parameter setup of the automated method. For each organ, the output dose was evaluated based on the percentage of dose received by a specific percentage of volume. The average dose difference between the automated and manual plans was calculated over a set of specified percentage volumes (99%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 10%, 5%, 1%). In addition, an experienced clinical physicist evaluated the acceptability of the plans generated by the automated method in terms of isodose distributions and DVHs. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Adoption of the automated method achieved both a comparable coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) and a substantial dose sparing of organs at risk (OARs). The mean dose was reduced by 30% for bladder, and 25% for rectum. There were few hot spots observed on OARs due to the overemphasis of PTV dose coverage. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Preliminary results show that the automated parameter optimization method results in a significant dose reduction of OARs while maintaining a comparable PTV dose coverage. The automated method is able to relieve the burden of routine trial‐and‐error procedures done by planners, and has the potential to improve the resulting plan. However, minor manual intervention is still necessary to incorporate certain case‐specific information, which is beyond the capability of the automated method.

This democratisation process is argued to be the result both of new governance structures and of new practices of governing which produce a new, more democratic, politics. The case of Scottish devolution is one example of where constitutional change was constructed as heralding a ‘new politics’. This proposition is analysed through a specific policy intervention in the devolved Scotland—the designation of a national park in the Cairngorms. This designation is traced from the instigation of national parks legislation to the formal creation of the park. The claim that devolution can bring about a more open and participatory approach to governing is critiqued. It is proposed that, although democratisation has a formed a political rationality of devolution, the actual practices of governing owe more to traditional rationalities of managerialism. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, when used for IMRT treatment planning, dose‐volume metrics are computationally complex (non‐convex) and can warp DVHs near the constraint dose. We investigate whether the generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD) can be made to highly correlate with different parts of the DVH curve by tuning the exponential parameter. If so, gEUD may be a smooth and computationally attractive replacement for dose‐volume metrics in treatment planning and evaluation. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We correlated gEUD with various values of its parameter <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> and clinically applicable dose‐volume constraints. Three datasets were used: lung, esophagus, and prostate, with 219, 263, and 291 patient plans, respectively. We tested values of <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> between −10 and 10 by intervals of 0.2 and in some cases tested values as low as −40. The dose‐volume constraints tested include: V10, V20, and V30 for lung, V55 for esophagus, and D95 for prostate PTV and lung PTV. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For all cases tested, we found a Spearman correlation between 0.917 and 0.989 (mean correlation 0.956) with negligible (&lt;1×10<jats:sup>−6</jats:sup>) p‐values.

The practical application of this is that for a particular dose‐volume metric, we can find the value of <jats:italic>a</jats:italic> (the gEUD parameter) with the highest correlation and use the convex gEUD function in place of the non‐convex dose‐volume constraint in the IMRT optimization, thereby allowing optimization to be faster and more able to efficiently achieve a global optimum. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> Partially supported by NIH grant R01 CA85181 and a grant from TomoTherapy, Inc.</jats:p>",

In this study, the above physics modeling improvements were verified by comparing the peripheral dose profiles for the small MLC fields calculated by the new Pinnacle v7.4f and the old Pinnacle v6.2b with those obtained from measurements experimentally. Three test MLC fields with different jaw sizes were prepared, and specific dose profiles (along cross-line, in-line and diagonal axis) at different depths were measured using a Varian 21 EX linear accelerator with 120-leaf Millennium MLC, big scanning water tank and photon diode. Estimated dose profiles for the test fields were calculated using Pinnacle v6.2b and v7.4f. By comparing the measured and calculated results, it was found that both v6.2b and v7.4f performed well in calculating the cross-line (along the gap between the longitudinal lengths of two leaves) and diagonal axis dose profiles at different depths. However, v7.4f gave calculated dose values closer to the measured field for in-line (gap between junctions of two rounded leaf ends) axis dose profiles at different depths. For the shape of the profile along the in-line axis, v7.4f calculated a flat “platform” dose profile of about 34.3% (inter-bank leakage) at depth d<jats:sub>max&gt;</jats:sub> beyond the MLC field edge using a clinical dose grid size of 0.4×0.4×0.4cm3, compared to the “zigzag” dose profile varying between 35.4% and 42.1% measured using the water tank and diode. However, both Pinnacle v6.2b and v7.4f calculated the percentage depth dose for the test fields well compared to the measurements.</jats:p>",

The model's parameters are rescaled based on the density of the medium. A differential equation is introduced to model the interface build‐up processes of CAX primary and scatter dose. Primary dose profiles are calculated using density‐dependent kernel integration, interpolated in the FSPB axis direction and evaluated depending on the density at the point of interest. Scatter dose profiles are computed using scatter integration and evaluated locally. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The new heterogeneity inclusive FSPB was implemented in a development version of CORVUS. Original and new FSPB dose calculations were compared with Monte Carlo calculations performed using PEREGRINE. For a heterogeneous semi‐slab phantom and for an IMRT lung plan, the dose distribution generated by the new FSPB agrees well with MC results, while the original one shows substantial discrepancies. IMRT plan optimizations were carried out using both original and new FSPB, and then a final dose calculation was performed using PEREGRINE. The plan calculated using the new FSPB shows better target conformality than the one computed using the original FSPB. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The new FSPB possesses greatly improved accuracy as demonstrated in a variety of phantom and patient cases, both for dose calculation and IMRT optimization. FSPB best features were preserved with little extra computational overhead promising accurate and fast inverse planning and real‐time dose sculpting and dose volume histogram manipulation.</jats:p><jats:p>Research sponsored by North American Scientific, NOMOS Radiation Oncology Division.</jats:p>",

The most important issue when it comes to IMRT breast treatment planning is to control the flash opening between the breast and the MLC in order to consider the breathing parameter. In forward planning 80% of the dose is delivered by open segmentation, and similarly, in IMRT the percentage of open segmentation can be controlled by drawing a flash target volume by extension of the PTV by 2.5 cm to 3.0 cm depending on the amount of flash desired. This flash target volume is included in the objective list of the IMRT parameters as “Uniform Dose” assigned to a minimum of 80% of the total prescribed dose and a minimal weight contribution such as 1E‐15. In comparing IMRT and forward planning techniques, IMRT not only allows a percentage of flash similar to the forward plan but it also achieves a more uniform dose coverage of the breast both at superior and inferior borders with reduced dose to the surrounding structures such as heart and lung. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Using a flash target volume with minimal weighting as a objective parameters allows a higher percentage of each beam to be treated open in the modulated segmentation. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> For IMRT breast treatment planning, a flash target volume can be used as an objective parameter during optimization to help increase the percentage of segmentation to be treated as open.</jats:p>",

For each image set, the ROIs: Primary GTV, Nodal GTV, Cord, left Parotid, and right Parotid were contoured by three experienced physicians. The difference of two contours drawn by different physicians was measured using: (1) the radial difference of the paired contours where the center‐mass of a contour is used as the origin of the polar coordinate system, and (2) the ratio of the common area of two contours over the total area of those contours, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic>=2[<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>1∩<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>2/(<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>1∪<jats:italic>C</jats:italic>2)].

Questionnaire survey data obtained from deans and institutional leaders, ICT support staff, teachers and students (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 333) at the University indicate that strategic planning has proceeded well, and all the faculties of the University have developed virtual university strategies in order to continue existing ICT initiatives, to further increase the use of ICT in teaching and to assure student information literacy. The data indicate that all the faculties and institutions have monitored and reported the use of ICT in teaching, but quality assurance or enhancement as tools for monitoring were mentioned less frequently. The available ICT training was found satisfactory to meet the actual training needs of the teachers, but their lack of time was judged to be the main obstacle to their participation in it. The teachers identified two basic functions of ICT in teaching: (1) distribution of course material via the web, and (2) the creation of interactive and collaborative learning opportunities. The male teachers and students consistently estimated that their ICT skills were stronger when compared with the judgements made by female teachers and students. The teachers generally felt that the greatest problems arose from students’ lack of time management skills and from deficiencies in the usability of the technology. The students did not perceive lack of time management as a problem. Rather, they experienced isolation, loneliness and the lack of practical ICT usability to be the main obstacles to learning. The teachers had a higher assessment of students’ learning than the students did. The greatest difference between teachers and students concerned the contextual nature of learning in a virtual environment. The fact that the teachers’ views were markedly more positive signals a distinct challenge for pedagogy.</jats:p>",

The purpose of the current study was to quantify the accuracy of a DIR algorithm by comparing automatically transferred and manually segmented structures on 4DCT images. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> 780 structures were manually segmented on thirteen patient 4DCT image sets each consisting of 10 respiratory phases. A large deformable diffeomorphic DIR algorithm, integrated with a commercial treatment planning system, was used to map each CT set from the inspiration respiratory phase CT image set respiratory phase images. The calculated displacement vector fields were used to deform and transfer structures defined on the inspiration CT to the other respiratory phase CT image sets. The manually and automatically segmented structures were compared using volumetric, displacement, and surface congruence metrics. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Deformation with respiration was observed for the lung tumor and normal tissues. This deformation was verified by examining the mapping of high contrast objects, such as the lungs and cord, between image sets. The auto‐ and manual methods showed similar trends, with a smaller difference observed between the GTVs than other structures. The auto‐contoured structures were more consistent both in terms of centroid displacement and volume as a function of respiratory phase than manual contours. 1.6% of the time, deficiencies of manual contouring has been detected using auto contouring. Image artifacts play a crucial role in auto contouring. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> An automated system is established to auto‐contour structures starting from one 4DCT image phase to other 4DCT image phases. The auto‐contoured structures generally agree with the manually drawn structures. However the auto‐contoured structures are more consistent in trajectory and volume, and also highlighted some large errors in the manually drawn contours. Careful assessment is needed in the presence of 4DCT artifacts.</jats:p>",

With IMRT, the optimization of the fluence map renders the flattening filter unnecessary. Flattening‐filter free therapy for IMRT has been investigated recently, but clinical evaluations have not been conducted. In this study we compare IMRT treatment plans for prostate therapy generated with and without a flattening filter. Methods and Materials: IMRT plans were generated at 6MV for 4 early stage prostate patients using clinical dose prescriptions. Plans were generated with Eclipse 8.0 (Varian Medical Systems), which we commissioned with beam data measured on a Clinac 21EX operated with and without the flattening filter. For each patient two plans were generated, one with and one without the flattening filter. The plan DVHs were normalized so 98% of the PTV received 75.6 Gy. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Plans using the unflattened beam required 2 times fewer monitor units (on average) than plans using the flattened beam. Treatment plans using the unflattened beam had more homogeneous PTV coverage. The average maximum dose was 81.0 (0.6) Gy for the unflattened beam and 84.2 (0.6) Gy for the flattened beam. The average minimum dose was 70.5 (0.8) Gy for the unflattened beam and 71.2 (0.8) Gy for the flattened beam. DVHs showed nearly identical doses to critical structures between flattened and unflattened treatments. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Clinically acceptable IMRT plans for prostate cancer can be developed with unflattened beams.

Following on from retail, office, and residential regeneration within many city centres, leisure and cultural policies have also been adopted. The British city of Swansea, which has developed such policies since the 1990s, is a regional city which typifies these processes. Drawing on large-scale surveys and in-depth interviews, the authors argue that four policy challenges are facing the development of a thriving leisure and cultural economy in smaller regional cities across Europe and North America. These challenges involve creating a leisure and cultural economy which: embraces a wide range and variety of attractions; appeals to a broad spectrum of social groups; adopts an appropriate spatial strategy; and overcomes friction between the different component parts of the leisure and cultural economy.</jats:p>",

The accuracy of the simulation for IMRT plans was evaluated using the RPC head phantom by comparing MC, Eclipse, RPC's TLD results, and ion chamber in solid water phantom measurements. The MC code was then used to simulate dose distributions for 5 patients who were treated using dynamic IMRT for tumors in the sinus region. The results were compared with absolute and relative dose distributions calculated using Eclipse (modified‐Batho inhomogeneity correction). Absolute dose differences were also compared ion chamber results. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Comparison of the doses calculated on the RPC phantom using MC, compared with Eclipse, ion chamber, and TLD measurements showed differences of −3.9%, −1.4%, and −2.0%, respectively (MC is colder). Relative dose distributions for the patient plans calculated using MC agreed well with those calculated using Eclipse with respect to targets and critical organs, indicating the modified‐Batho correction is adequate. Average agreement for mean absolute target doses between MC and Eclipse was −2.9±2.2%. Agreement between ion chamber and Eclipse for these patients was −2.2±1.9%, compared with 0.2±2.0% for all head and neck IMRT patients. When Eclipse doses were corrected based on ion chamber results, agreement between MC and Eclipse improved to ‐ 0.7±2.0%. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> (1) The effect of inhomogeneities in the sinus region is adequately accounted for by the modified‐Batho correction in Eclipse. (2) Both MC and ion chamber results indicate a small systematic uncertainty in the doses calculated using the treatment planning system for this subset of patients.</jats:p>",

Instead, we designed our own therapy system components using analytical methods. The MCNPX (Los Alamos National Laboratory) Monte Carlo (MC) code was used to simulate beam profiles. Separate codes were developed to create the initial proton sources, the absorbed dose and fluence tallies, and simple homogeneous water phantoms (see Zheng <jats:italic>et al.</jats:italic>, separate contribution). Up to 10<jats:sup>8</jats:sup> proton histories were tracked per simulation to achieve &lt; 2% statistical uncertainties. Additional codes were developed to generate ancillary TPS configuration files, e.g., for the range modulator wheels, flattening filters, and variable range shifter. The MC beam characteristics such as penetration range were compared with values from independent one‐dimensional analytical calculations. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A complete set of configuration parameters and beam profiles were generated, including 832 dose and fluence profiles, in approximately four weeks (simulation time using 60 CPUs). With the simulated configuration data, the TPS has undergone extensive development and testing during the past year. Preliminary results indicate that the MC, TPS, and independent analytical calculations are in good agreement (&lt; 4 mm differences in penetration range). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results of this study demonstrate the practicality of MC models to calculate beam data for configuring a proton treatment planning system. Additional simulations with the manufacturer's preliminary equipment designs are now in progress. Validation tests of Eclipse in heterogeneous media are in progress (see Titt et al., separate contribution). Confirmatory measurements are planned. <jats:bold>Conflict of Interest:</jats:bold> This work was funded in part by a research grant from Varian.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to understand the changes in neovascularity with tumor growth in relevant organ environment, with dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Eleven athymic nude mice underwent orthotopic injection of 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> 253‐J B‐V cells. MR imaging was performed on a 4.7 T small animal MR scanner (Bruker Biospin). Axial T1 weighted spin‐echo and T2 weighted fast spin‐echo acquisitions were performed for volumetric measurements. For dynamic studies, an axial 3D fast RF‐spoiled gradient‐echo acquisition (TR:40ms, TE:1.4ms,slice thickness:1mm) with gadolinium‐DTPA (Magnevist, Schering) was used. The time points for imaging were day 15, day 21 and day 30 after inoculation. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The MR volume measurements were made from the fused T1 and T2 images, which were shown to better delineate tumor margins in previous experiments. The initial area under the curve was plotted at 90 seconds, 120 seconds and 200 seconds. An inverse relationship was noted between larger tumor sizes and their IAUC<jats:sup>90</jats:sup> (correlation=−0.866 (p&lt;0.05). There is no correlation between the slow growing tumors and the IAUC<jats:sup>90</jats:sup> (p=0.708).

The IAUC and tumor growth data correlation could be a predictive tool for radiation response. It could also assist in planning time points for anti‐angiogenic therapy. In future, we plan to use a higher molecular weight gadolinium agent, and stain the tissue for mean vessel density.</jats:p>",

Beams were modeled using Monte Carlo and a parameterized analytic dose engine was created. Radiochromic film (5mm steps) in a solid water phantom was used to evaluate actual delivered doses in multiple planes. Treatment plans using these beams were created by a custom treatment planning system (microRTP) based on imported fiducial‐registered imaging (CT, MR, PET) of animals immobilized in the treatment position. A three‐axis computer‐controlled stage supports and positions animals in the beams according to the microRTP plan. Validation of the positioning system was performed using a phantom and images of phantom and collimator via a kV C‐arm. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The analytic dose model agreed with the Monte‐Carlo predicted dose within 5% and 10% outside and inside the 1 mm deep build‐up regions, respectively.

The objective of this research is to combine CRA, as an alternative to bi‐plane angiography for target definition, with innovative radiotherapy techniques for stereotactic radiation therapy. This preliminary treatment planning study investigates the utility of Helical Tomotherapy, as compared to multiple non‐coplanar dynamic arcs using a conventional linear accelerator (linac). <jats:bold>Materials and Methods:</jats:bold> A Siemens Axiom scanner was used to acquire CRA images for this treatment planning study. Non‐coplanar dynamic arc treatments were planned using Theraplan Plus. These plans were designed for delivery on a conventional linac (Varian 2100 EX) equipped with a multileaf collimator (5 mm leaf width at isocentre). The same images and regions of interest were used to generate plans for helical tomotherapy delivery (TomoTherapy Inc., Hi‐Art II). Tomotherapy is a dedicated intensity modulated radiation therapy system that delivers a narrow fan‐beam, modulated by binary multileaf collimators (6.25 mm leaf width at isocentre). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The CRA images have an isotropic voxel spacing of less than 0.38 mm, with a signal‐difference‐to‐noise‐ratio greater than 20:1. These high quality images facilitated the delineation of the complex target volume for treatment planning. Each of the treatment planning techniques offered specific advantages. Multiple non‐coplanar arc plans generated a lower integral dose to the surrounding healthy tissue (a 12 Gy isodose volume of 40 vs. 100 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> for presented sample patient). Tomotherapy inverse‐planning provided a more homogeneous dose distribution over the target volume (homogeneity index of 1.006 vs. 1.087), as well as better avoidance of critical structures (maximum brain stem dose of 8.2 vs. 13.2 Gy). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Tomotherapy presents an alternative to forward planning with non‐coplanar arcs. Moreover, the megavoltage CT imaging capabilities of Tomotherapy could provide frameless, stereotactic localization for AVM radiotherapy.</jats:p>",

Monte Carlo studies of dose distributions in patients for radiation therapy would benefit from generalized models of accelerator beams especially when the model could be generated by direct measured data. Several previous studies on Varian accelerators have shown that it is possible to derive source model parameters from measured beam data. In this research generic measurement‐based source model is developed where energy spectra are derived from depth dose distributions, fluence distributions are derived from measured profiles and the head scatter information is derived from in‐air output factor measurement. The new photon source model uses a small extended photon source to represent primary photons generated in the target, a large extended source to represent scattered photons from the primary collimator, flattening filter and other linac components, and an extended electron source to represent contaminant electrons emerging from the treatment head. A four‐source model will be used to reconstruct electron beams, which represent direct electrons, contaminant photons and electrons scattered from the first two scrappers of the electron applicator, respectively. <jats:bold>Results: and Conclusions:</jats:bold> An independent program is developed to generate source model parameters with measurement data automatically. The source parameters can be used by Monte Carlo dose calculation codes directly for phase space reconstruction. Comparisons have been done between dose calculated by Monte Carlo using this source model and measurement data for Varian and Siemens accelerators for different beams and energies. The results show excellent agreement (within 1%/1mm), which means that the measurement‐based source model is acceptable for clinical use.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this work is to develop proton treatment planning strategies for mobile tumors with and without mobile intervening structures based on 4D CT, and to assess the planning strategies using 4D CT data and daily in‐room CT information. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Five treatment planning strategies were evaluated based on (1) free breathing CT with small smearing, (2) free breathing CT with large smearing, (3) average CT with small smearing, (4) average CT with CT numbers inside the tumor volume replaced by higher CT numbers, and (5) maximum intensity projection CT. For a lung patient with large, 1.6 cm, tumor motion and immobile surrounding tissues, treatment plans were designed using strategies 1, 2 and 4. Each treatment plan was recalculated on five daily CT images using bony structure alignment. For an esophagus patient with 3.5 cm tumor motion and large cardiac, liver and spleen motion, treatment plans were designed using strategies 1, 2, 3 and 5. Each treatment plan was recalculated in all 10 phases of the 4D CT. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For the lung patient, the tumor coverage evaluated using the five daily CT's is superior when using strategies 2 and 4 as compared to strategy 1. However, the lung sparing is superior using strategy 4 compared to strategy 2. For the esophagus patient, the treatment plans using strategy 2 and 5 covered the targets for each 4D CT phase while the plan using strategy 1 and 3 caused significant under‐dosing. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> With the strategies developed using 4D CT data, good tumor coverage was achieved for the thoracic patients with large tumor and surrounding tissue motion using proton therapy.</jats:p>",

This methodology requires the preliminary constitution of a “reference data set”, obtained experimentally, where correction factors (CF) were calculated as the ratios of the ionization at a depth d beyond the air‐tissue interface to the ionization at the same geometrical point for the reference configuration and for the same number of monitor units. Material and Methods: CFs were obtained from measurements in a phantom that consisted of polystyrene slabs with a 10 cm air‐gap between them. Measurements were performed with a plane parallel ionization chamber at different depths beyond the distal air‐polystyrene interface. They have been repeated with and without the air‐gap at constant source‐detector distance, for a 5×5 cm2 field and for photon energies ranging from 4MV to 23MV and the respective Monte Carlo calculations have been performed the same phantom set‐up. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A number of commercial TPS algorithms were tested: users computed CF using basic beam data from their accelerators and these were compared to reference CF for the corresponding QI. Considering that the error in the determination of CF for all beam energies tested should not exceed 6%, at the tested depths only one algorithm calculated CF within this error. The rest of the algorithms overestimated or underestimated CF in the build‐up region. At depth where electronic equilibrium is achieved, results were acceptable for all algorithms. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> A test that can be easily performed has been designed to validate the calculation algorithm of a TPS for the build‐up effect, using the QI of the incident beam.</jats:p>",

Pencil beam and heterogeneity corrected collapsed cone dose computations can be used. The system can optimize every relevant combination of pencil beam weights, SMLC segments, gantry, couch and collimator angles. It is possible to perform intensity modulated proton therapy planning. Models for tumor repopulation and repair are included and irregularities in the fractionation scheme can be compensated for by allowing the dose to vary between fractions during optimization. The system exhibits a comprehensive GUI and functionality for simulation and evaluation of adaptive/IGRT treatments with algorithms for deformable dose accumulation based on information from portal imaging and 3D imaging modalities such as onboard CT scanners. Errors due to patient setup and organ motion can be counteracted and compensated for by couch shift and on‐ and offline IMRT replanning. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A software environment suitable for studying various advanced topics in modern radiation therapy has been developed.

In this work, we compared tumor coverage in the subsequent treatment delivery using these two approaches. <jats:bold>Materials &amp; Methods:</jats:bold> Consented patients underwent CT simulation consisting 2 short scans taken at maximum inspiration and expiration breath holding conditions, in addition to a normal free‐breathing scan. These same patients went through MRI cine scanning. For treatment planning and delivery, we constructed a PTV from a combination of the targets delineated on all 3 CT scans after image registration by applying 3 mm margin (termed PTV_3CT). For this study, another PTV expansion was generated from the gross tumor volume (GTV) on the free breathing scan by margins that were determined by MRI cine (termed as PTV_MRI). Treatment planning using the same beam configurations and weights was performed on the PTV_MRI. Since a localization CT scan was obtained for each patient using a CT‐on‐rails system prior to each treatment, we are able to obtain the actual GTV in treatment position (GTV_tx) and compare their coverage for the plans designed for either the PTV_3CT or PTV_MRI. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For 5 patients and 20 GTV_tx studied, they were all within the PTV_MRI geometrically and have full dose coverage in terms of D<jats:sub>95</jats:sub>. However, for plans designed for PTV_3CT, 9 out of 20 of the GTV_tx were found, at a varying degree, to be partially out of the PTV_3CT and the coverage varies from 95.9% to 100% of the planned values. Although the difference in coverage is small, it is statistically significant, as the p‐value for the t‐test is 0.006. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The MRI‐cine appears to be a better study of motion than the multiphase CT approach in this study.</jats:p>",

However, its use in radiotherapy is limited since clinical treatment planning systems are currently not able to use the full 4D data. The purpose of this study was to reconstruct a representative single 3D CT scan from the 4D data set (with tumor closest to the mean position) for use in radiotherapy planning of lung tumors to enable reduction of treatment error margins. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> After acquisition of the 4D CT scan (10 frames), the tumor is manually segmented (roughly) in the first frame and automatically (gray‐value) registered to the tumor in the subsequent frames. This gives the motion of the tumor during the respiratory cycle in 3D. Subsequently, from the cranio‐caudal (CC) tumor motion curve, the mean tumor position and its corresponding mid‐ventilation (MV) time‐percentage are calculated. The CT scan for planning is reconstructed at this time‐percentage. As indication of the merit of this concept, its effect on margins from CTV to PTV and on the PTV volume was calculated covering respiratory motion, respiratory baseline variation and setup errors (systematic and random). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Based on 13 patients, the worst tumor position accuracy (with respect to the mean tumor position) in the mid‐ventilation CT scan occurred in the anterior‐posterior direction: −0.7±0.8 mm (due to hysteresis). For these patients, the errors in conventional free‐breathing CT were estimated to be 0±3.4 mm (CC) and 0±1.4 mm (AP). The mid‐ventilation concept resulted in margin reduction up to 45% and a PTV volume reduction up to 35%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The mid‐ventilation concept, based on tumor motion, is a simple method to obtain an artifact‐free CT scan with smaller systematic errors compared to conventional CT scans. Significant reduction of the PTV volume can be achieved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Drug resistance in HIV‐1 protease can also occasionally confer a change in the substrate specificity. Through the use of computational techniques, a relationship can be determined between the substrate sequence and three‐dimensional structure of HIV‐1 protease, and be utilized to predict substrate specificity. In this study, we introduce a biased sequence search threading (BSST) methodology to analyze the preferences of substrate positions and correlations between them that might also identify which positions within known substrates can likely tolerate sequence variability and which cannot. The potential sequence space was efficiently explored using a low‐resolution knowledge‐based scoring function. The low‐energy substrate sequences generated by the biased search are correlated with the natural substrates. Octameric sequences were predicted using the probabilities of residue positions in the sequences generated by BSST in three ways: considering each position in the substrate independently, considering pairwise interdependency, and considering triplewise interdependency. The prediction of octameric sequences using the triplewise conditional probabilities produces the most accurate results, reproducing most of the sequences for five of the nine natural substrates and implying that there is a complex interdependence between the different substrate residue positions. This likely reflects that HIV‐1 protease recognizes the overall shape of the substrate more than its specific sequence. Proteins 2006. © 2006 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
