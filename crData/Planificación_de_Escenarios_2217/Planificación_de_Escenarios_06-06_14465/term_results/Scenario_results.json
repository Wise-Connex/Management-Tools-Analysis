      "abstract": "<jats:p>Temperate horticulture is a very important component of  horticulture as it is only confined to the hilly regions of a country.  For fruit crops, it represents a group, which is physiologically diverse from the sub-tropical and tropical fruit crops grown in other regions.  For vegetables and floriculture it has immense potential for the keeping the nation well supplied with off-season and exotic vegetables and flowers all the year round.   This book, being published to mark the centenary year of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (1905 – 2005), strives to highlight the status of temperate horticulture in India.  Articles on biotechnological and bioinformatics, genetic resources and manipulation, cropping patterns, drip irrigation, hill horticulture and economics of temperate horticulture contributed by scientists from IARI, Dr. YS Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, NBPGR, CIPHET, CPRI and various RRS’s of IARI , NBPGR and ICAR Research Complex for Eastern and NEH Regions.     The book will prove as a complete handbook of temperate horticulture as it will not only serve as a reference material for research workers in horticulture, but will also play a vital role in combating problems and planning future strategies in the field of horticulture.</jats:p>",

The most recurrent schemas are as follows: CONTAINER, SOURCE -PATH-GOAL, BALANCE, FORCES, CENTRE - PERIPHERY, etc. This article focuses on two of them - CONTAINER and SOURCE - PATH - GOAL attempting to reveal how negative feelings affect (hatred, anger, fury, vengeance) alter. The so-called prototypical scenario of feeling alternation, which implies the destruction of the container, is described in cognitive literature. The article aims at another scenario, which is realised in the sphere of Christian ethics as an alternation of controlled negative feelings-affects.</jats:p>"

The focus is on an indoor wireless link and a DSL link, and we consider systems where the packets are protected by means of retransmissions with and without forward error correcting (FEC) codes. In order to achieve a satisfactory performance with restricted latency, we propose an unconventional retransmission procedure. The overall conclusion is that retransmissions without FEC achieve the best performance with the lowest latency, lowest overhead and lowest complexity, both in the wireless and the wired home scenario.

The use of scenarios to explore ecological dynamics of alternative futures has been given a major boost by the recently completed Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a 4‐year initiative to investigate relationships between ecosystem services and human well‐being at multiple scales. Scenarios, as descriptive narratives of pathways to the future, are a mechanism for improving the understanding and management of ecological and social processes by scientists and decision makers with greater flexibility than conventional techniques could afford. We used scenarios in one of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment's subglobal components to explore four possible futures in a Southern African river basin. Because of its ability to capture spatial and temporal dynamics, the scenario exercise revealed key trade‐offs in ecosystem services in space and time and the importance of a multiple‐scale scenario design. At subglobal scales, scenarios are a powerful vehicle for communication and engagement of decision makers, especially when designed to identify responses to specific problems. Scenario planning has the potential to be a critical ingredient in conservation as calls are increasingly made for the field to help define and achieve sustainable visions for the future.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",
