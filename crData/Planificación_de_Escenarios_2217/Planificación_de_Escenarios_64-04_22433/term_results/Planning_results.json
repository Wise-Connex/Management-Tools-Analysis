These expected returns must also reflect the capabilities a firm has to implement this strategy and the resulting competitive situations it will face. The mathematical techniques of Markov processes and dynamic programming are used in this paper to develop an analytic framework which will select optimal product strategies for a firm that are consistent with its capabilities, that will meet its competitive situations, and that will maximize expected returns in the long run. This model is applied to a selected set of Michigan machine tool firms. The results indicate the general importance of total firm capabilities and the greater importance of management capability over the supporting capabilities in the selection of optimal product strategies. </jats:p>",

The optimum decision rule is derived under one resource restriction and an explicit parametric solution has been obtained. The model has then been extended to incorporate more than one resource restriction, for which certain parametric solutions have been obtained. </jats:p>",

The plan is designed to evolve the most compact equipment and most efficient “in flight” experimental procedure necessary for obtaining a given list of physiological data. This list is then developed in such a manner as to produce a table containing minimum necessary equipment and also a table itemizing the most efficient combination and sequence of “in flight” experimental procedures. This plan reduces equipment volume, weight and duplication as well as minimizing the amount of time and physical manipulation necessary to obtain the desired data, thereby optimizing the logistics of the “in flight” physiological data program. </jats:p>",
