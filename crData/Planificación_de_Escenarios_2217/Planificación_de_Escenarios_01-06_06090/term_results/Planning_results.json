Tracing the contents of successive American Planning Association (APA) (and its predecessors’) mission statements and several versions of the “Green Book” (and its predecessors) reveals these dramatic changes and demonstrates the profession’s remarkable adaptability. In the future, as practitioners continue to elaborate the art of planning, they must maintain and strengthen their own internal links, remain focused on the profession’s underlying themes and, most important, emphasize and reward applied research drawn from in-field experience. The Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning and the APA/American Institute of City Planning have decisive roles in this effort. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article explores planning education as a fabric. Over the past century, the central strands of planning knowledge and pedagogy have been remarkably consistent despite changing labels. Nevertheless, tensions persist regarding the identity of planning and nature of professional education. The biggest changes have occurred among the weavers. During the latter half of the twentieth century, social scientists replaced practitioners as teachers. Also, students emerged as demanding learners, calling for an interactive role in their education. Further, the field emerged from one where the planner was a “man who” to acute consciousness about ethnic and gender diversity. The author concludes that planning education in the twenty-first century should draw from multiple theories of practice— applied knowledge that helps planners understand ethical responsibility, communicate effectively, and address community problems meaningfully as they create the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How are planning educators responding to the challenges and opportunities of distance education? The authors explore this question through a planning school survey, a case study, and brainstorming about change factors. They find that planning education programs are slow to adopt new technology, except for incorporation of e-mail and Web technology into traditional on-campus courses. Most respondents believe that distance learning will be important, but few distance learning courses are taught. Reported obstacles are extra demands on faculty, lack of compensation for course development, low faculty interest, incompatibility with course content, and inadequate technical support. The case study describes the design and teaching of a successful distance learning course in which student work improved. Four catalysts that could speed adoption of distance learning are (1) generational change, (2) program survival, (3) institutional conformity, and (4) practice demand. The authors conclude that as future-oriented professionals, planners should lead in applying technology to improve planning education. </jats:p>",

Planners are also important players in “organizational learning.” In this article, the authors describe how organizational practices change through learning. Drawing from the sociological literature on organizational behavior, the authors develop a conceptual model of organizational learning. This model is then applied to the case of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) engaged in development planning in western India. We show not only how learning processes have led to behavioral change in this NGO but also ways in which learning has been constrained. </jats:p>",

A two-tier investigation involved exploring the conservation practices of these local authorities and examining four recent development cases. Interviews with a wide range of local players built up a picture of the perceptions of local conservation culture. The results suggest that tensions are created as the national emphasis towards conservation's more flexible contribution to regeneration is exposing weaknesses in some underlying assumptions. In drawing away from the traditional development control aspect and covering such a breadth of justifications, this creates professional, political, and public misunderstandings which may undermine support for conservation. </jats:p>",

In this study, couples' concurrence on use and method used is compared by means of data from 23 countries, mostly in sub‐Saharan Africa. Husbands report higher levels of use than do their wives in every country studied, with ranges from 2 percent higher (Brazil) to 150 percent higher (Mali). Many of the discrepancies are the result of husbands' sole reports of periodic abstinence and condom use. Couples with polygynous husbands show less concurrence than do monogamous couples, although the majority of these differences could result from a data‐collection problem. Monogamous couples in which one or both spouses reported having extramarital sex partners show less concurrence than do monogamous couples reporting no other partners. Problems of validity of both husbands' and wives' reports are discerned, and in the few instances where a direct comparison is possible, wives' reports are shown to have greater validity. Logistic regression results show that spousal discussion about family planning and greater female education are consistent predictors of concurrence.</jats:p>",

Using data from a 1998 study of 585 monogamous couples in rural Malawi, the analysis identifies a systematic gender component to reporting: For many of the survey questions considered, when spouses disagree, husbands are more likely to say “yes” and wives “no.” The findings are interpreted in terms of gendered strategies in the interview process.</jats:p>",

Pedestrians can move freely only at small pedestrian densities. Otherwise their motion is affected by repulsive interactions with other pedestrians, giving rise to self-organization phenomena. Examples of the resulting patterns of motion are separate lanes of uniform walking direction in crowds of oppositely moving pedestrians or oscillations of the passing direction at bottlenecks. If pedestrians leave footprints on deformable ground (for example, in green spaces such as public parks) this additionally causes attractive interactions which are mediated by modifications of their environment. In such cases, systems of pedestrian trails will evolve over time. The corresponding computer simulations are a valuable tool for developing optimized pedestrian facilities and way systems. </jats:p>",

At the same time, adolescent childbearing levels remain high: More than 30 percent of 19‐year‐old girls are reported to have given birth at least once. Evidence from focus‐group discussions conducted in urban and rural areas in South Africa with young black women and men, and with the parents of teenage mothers, is used to consider the experience of early parenthood, including the role of paternity, education, work opportunities, and subsequent fertility. In South Africa, in contrast to many other settings, teenage mothers may return to school once they have given birth, and this opportunity is strongly related to a long delay before the birth of a second child. Educated girls also tend to bring more bridewealth, which may encourage parents to support their daughters' schooling, and perhaps their return to school following childbirth. The support of the child, however, is often subject to paternal recognition and. commitment, even though boys are unwilling to admit paternity because it jeopardizes their educational and employment opportunities.</jats:p>",

The geographic space occupied by human activities and by buildings also changes over time. Those two aspects of urban evolution are linked and, as such, should be studied in tandem. In this paper we present an analysis of the process of formation of urban centers as a result of growth spurts and the structured behavior of individuals. We propose a dynamic model of the spatial self-organization of a town. The model yields descriptions of the temporal evolution of the urban population and of the space occupied by it. At the backdrop of the model is a particular conception of the behavior of land developers. The evolution of the town emerges from the juxtaposition of centripetal and centrifugal forces that represent the key elements in the developers' behavior. Through computer simulations, the model has been applied to Petah Tikvah, a small town in the Tel Aviv metropolis. The comparison between the simulations and the real town growth is very good. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This collection of essays, coauthored with other distinguished economists, offers new perspectives on saving, intergenerational economic ties, retirement planning, and the distribution of wealth. The book links life-cycle microeconomic behavior to important macroeconomic outcomes, including the roughly 50 percent postwar decline in America's rate of saving and its increasing wealth inequality. The book traces these outcomes to the government's five-decade-long policy of transferring, in the form of annuities, ever larger sums from young savers to old spenders. The book presents new theoretical and empirical analyses of altruism that rule out the possibility that private intergenerational transfers have offset those by the government.While rational life-cycle behavior can explain broad economic outcomes, the book also shows that a significant minority of households fail to make coherent life-cycle saving and insurance decisions. These mistakes are compounded by reliance on conventional financial planning tools, which the book compares with Economic Security Planner (ESPlanner), a new life-cycle financial planning software program. The application of ESPlanner to U.S. data indicates that most Americans approaching retirement age are saving at much lower rates than they should be, given potential major cuts in Social Security benefits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Local governments rarely use risk analysis, the most sophisticated level of hazard assessment, to inform their planning and development decisions. But new tools are rapidly becoming available to accomplish such analysis. In this paper we present an example of an earthquake risk analysis for Los Angeles County, using available land-use maps, a probabilistic earthquake hazard model developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's new HAZUS earthquake loss estimation software. We computed the annual expected loss owing to earthquakes and the spatial variation of this risk. The analysis shows that the annual long-term earthquake risk in Los Angeles County, as a result of direct structural and nonstructural damage, is $388 million per year. We also investigated the extent to which planned future land-use growth would affect this risk estimate. We found that planned growth of 14.2% would result in an increase in annual risk to $449.5 million, a 15.8% increase over the risk to current land uses. Because of ever increasing disaster costs, planners need to be able to evaluate the risks that their communities face, both in the present and in the future. It is particularly important for planners to be sure that they are not disproportionately planning future growth for hazardous locations. In this paper we describe some ways in which to perform such evaluations, by using tools that have only recently become available. </jats:p>",

Holding household resources constant, a woman's control over economic resources affects the couple's decisionmaking. Compared with a woman with no assets that she perceives as being her own, a woman with some share of household assets influences reproductive health decisions. Evidence suggests that her influence on service use also varies if a woman is better educated than her husband, comes from a background of higher social status than her husband's, or if her father is better educated than her father‐in‐law. Therefore, both economic and social dimensions of the distribution of power between spouses influence use of services, and conceptualizing power as multidimensional is useful for understanding couples' behavior.</jats:p>",

A review of the literature shows that such models have been developed to explain and predict macro, meso, and micro movement patterns. However, recent developments in modelling techniques, and especially advances in agent-based simulation, open up the possibility of developing integrative and complex models which use existing models as ‘building blocks’. In this paper we describe such integrative, modular approach to simulating pedestrian movement behaviour. The STREETS model, developed by using Swarm and GIS, is an agent-based model that focuses on the simulation of the behavioural aspects of pedestrian movement. The modular structure of the simulation is described in detail. This is followed by a discussion of the lessons learned from the development of STREETS, especially the advantages of adopting a modular approach and other aspects of using the agent-based paradigm for modelling. </jats:p>",

Survey data are analyzed that were collected in Punjab province in 1996 and that contain unusually detailed measurement of various perceived costs of practicing contraception, as well as focused measurement of fertility motivation. The framework guiding the research specifies six major obstacles to contraceptive use: the strength of motivation to avoid pregnancy, awareness and knowledge of contraception, the social and cultural acceptability of contraception, perceptions of the husband's preferences and attitudes, health concerns, and perceived access to services. Net effects of each obstacle are estimated through structural equation modeling of the intention to practice contraception in the near future, in which the six obstacles are treated as latent variables. The estimates indicate that the two principal obstacles to using a contraceptive are the woman's perception that such behavior would conflict with her husband's fertility preferences and his attitudes toward family planning and her perception of the social or cultural unacceptability of contraception. The results confirm the value of taking contraceptive costs seriously, and, in particular, of attempting to measure these costs in empirical research on family planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Our aim in this paper is to build and test a model which classifies and identifies pedestrian shopping behaviour in a shopping centre by using temporal and spatial choice heuristics. In particular, the temporal local-distance-minimising, total-distance-minimising, and global-distance-minimising heuristic choice rules and spatial nearest-destination-oriented, farthest-destination-oriented, and intermediate-destination-oriented choice rules are combined to classify and identify the stop sequences and route choices of shopping pedestrians. First, several linear networks with a single entry node and a few stop nodes are investigated. For these networks, the global-distance-minimising and spatial choice heuristics classify and identify the sequences of stops very well. Although the local-distance-minimising choice rule identifies pedestrian route choice quite well, another heuristic is needed to improve the identification. In this paper a new, attractive-street-oriented heuristic is suggested to improve the identification ability of the model. This choice rule suggests that shopping pedestrians will never leave the attractive shopping streets before completing their shopping. The model is then applied to empirical data of pedestrian shopping behaviour in Veldhoven City Centre in The Netherlands. The findings of this application suggest that the model based on choice heuristics might be useful to classify and identify the sequences of stops and route choice behaviour of shopping pedestrians in a shopping centre. </jats:p>",

The envi ronment is based on a multi-agent architecture such that each sensor is controlled by an autonomous in telligent agent. This allows the user great flexibility in manipulating the number of sensors and also the capabilities of each sensor. The simulation system permits the user to visualize the outcome of the de ployment for various sensor configurations prior to implementation in the real world. Currently, the system focuses on the use of cameras for visual in spection tasks in which a single camera would be inadequate due to occluding objects in the scene or the sheer size of the target. </jats:p>",

In spite of the efforts of the planners, some degree of local management for local ends continues and people revert to the old ways once control or incentives are withdrawn. There are innumerable instances of external initiatives in soil conservation, grazing control, and the conservation of forests and wildlife that have been undermined during implementation or discontinued once external funding ceased. For example, an evaluation of twenty-five projects sponsored by the World Bank recorded that thirteen had been abandoned a few years after financial assistance ended, and concluded that the main causes of failure were lack of participation by the local communities and lack of attention to building local organizations (Zazueta 1995). On the other hand, there are many examples of successful development based on participation of the local community (see Boxes 8.2, 8.9, and 8.12) and instances of enthusiastic and widespread adoption of new practices that yield immediate benefits to the land users and, at the same time, fit easily into the existing system of</jats:p>",

Its population is about 30 million (projection from 1988 census), growing at 2.8 per cent per year (Bureau of Statistics 1992), giving a sparse overall density of some 3 ha/person. However, the density is much higher (&amp;lt;0.5 ha/person) in some rural areas where rainfall is more reliable and soils relatively fertile. The movement of farmers and pastoralists to those well-endowed areas that still have relatively low population densities is bringing increasing conflicts over land ownership. Tanzania is also a poor country. GDP per caput in 1995 was US $120 and 90 per cent of the population is supported directly or indirectly by agriculture, which contributes half of the GDP.</jats:p>",

The problem is derived from the latent conflict in the relationship between franchisor and franchisees. An empirical study was carried out to compare benefits of two different outlet allocation decision modes: centralised planning mode (locations allocated by the franchisor) and decentralised planning mode (franchisees given autonomy to select the location of their own outlets). Research findings revealed that the decentralised location decision mode is more beneficial to the franchise system with a lower level of customer loyalty.</jats:p>",

Land users have always made plans to meet their needs from the resources at their disposal, though these plans have usually been informal, and limited in scale and scope. More formal land use plans have often attempted dramatic changes in land use in a short space of time to cope with unprecedented demands on land resources. Land use planning on a scale beyond the individual plot reached nearest to the sun in the Soviet Union as a centralized, technocratic exercise whereby national demands upon the land were matched with those areas deemed best able to support them. This planning, on an unprecedented scale, was supported by a heroic effort to gather the natural resources information needed to underpin the decisions. The strides made by the planned economy and its apparent immunity to the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s, as well as pressing needs elsewhere to respond to environmental catastrophes (e.g. the Dust Bowl in the USA), led to the espousal of planning in some form by responsible authorities world-wide.</jats:p>",

Because of the complexity of a process plant, it is a time‐consuming job for maintenance managers to achieve certain Lockout/Tagout plans for Turnaround Maintenance. Process flow and layout information are essential to this planning, so Computer‐Aided Design (CAD) systems are becoming very useful resources. In this study, we propose a computer‐aided method for planning Lockout/Tagout programs in process plants. To isolate certain equipment, minimum required operations are explored and reported automatically. Algorithms that investigate CAD data are shown in order to determine isolated areas. Data structures which mitigate limitation of calculation time are applied for large‐scale plants. We also consider the integration of isolated areas and the elimination of overlapping operations.</jats:p>",

With the widespread introduction of loyalty card schemes across the UK, Europe and North America, retailers now have the opportunity to link detailed shopping pattern information to the individual consumer. Data gathered from loyalty card transactions can be referenced to the address of the individual, and as such, can be considered to be a particular type of potential geographic information. Based on detailed semi‐structured interviews within five UK retail organisations that have implemented loyalty card schemes, the article shows the nature of data analysis and applications at present, with data being mostly utilised in direct marketing. It is argued that recognition of the geographic nature of loyalty card data is currently lacking amongst scheme operators, yet is vital if higher order functions are to be realised. To that end, the paper presents visual frameworks that position loyalty card data within the organisational hierarchy and highlight potential techniques and applications that can be achieved via loyalty card data analysis.</jats:p>",

Detailed analysis of the power relations and tactical interactions between different actors in the negotiating arenas revealed that planner/community relations in the case study were dominated by a process identified as ‘containment’. Containment refers to a strategic management of public involvement by the planning agencies, and it hinged on three fundamental social actions: avoidance of conflict; exclusion of dissent; and control over knowledge and procedure. Actions by local stakeholders that served to undermine containment constitute ‘counter‐containment’. The paper discusses these mechanisms in depth, before developing a comparative analytical framework of containment and counter‐containment to help explain disparities in planning progress between different sites.</jats:p>",

In this study, we use a recently validated measurement model of strategic planning to examine the planning‐performance relationship in the California processing tomato industry. Results indicate a strong correlation between the degree of emphasis firms place on strategic planning and financial performance. Moreover, several specific strategic planning tools, specifically, the use of a mission statement, long‐term goals, and ongoing evaluation, were also more heavily emphasized by high‐performing firms. These results suggest that strategic planning does pay off in terms of improved financial performance and that some planning tools may have a significant impact.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Managing highly skilled employees is extremely complex because of the need to balance the costs and time lags associated with their training against the need to meet demand as quickly as possible. Unlike previous approaches to this problem in the staffing literature, this paper develops an optimal staffing policy at the strategic level to cope with nonstationary stochastic demand for a staff characterized by unproductive apprentice employees and fully productive experienced employees. The paper then explores the implications of this policy in different industries, using empirical data. Aside from the optimal policy, this paper's primary results include: (1) demand volatility reduces average productivity, most especially under conditions of low (or slightly negative) growth and—nonintuitively—low employee turnover or knowledge obsolescence rates; (2) there is a trade-off between meeting demand and high productivity; (3) firms with longer business cycles should smooth their hiring and firing policies; and (4) firms in industries with longer training times should smooth their hiring and firing policies. The paper also explores the possible rewards from reducing training times and turnover rates. Finally, it discusses managerial implications and possible future directions in research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the most significant events that swept through Europe during the Renaissance was a renewed interest in oculocentrism, extending the power of vision, and disseminating it in more visually accessible ways. In this paper the concept of the globe is explored through the work of William Shakespeare by examining its links to geometry, optics, and spectacle in the context of the theatre and the world in which the poet lived. At the outset the globe is examined in relation to Shakespeare's playhouse, which exhibited strong Vitruvian antecedents. The optical manipulation of space is then explored through the use of globes in Shakespeare's literary landscape, illustrating that Elizabethans were not only familiar with these geographical models, but that Shakespeare reinforced these new ways of seeing the world on his audience. Finally, research illustrates that globes were not only in Shakespeare's dramaturgy, but the theatre was also in the world, and the paper explores in detail how spectacle was used by learned Elizabethans to represent the globe to themselves. </jats:p>",

It does so through a detailed study of one particular group, the Shuar, indigenous to the Ecuadorian Amazon. Formerly an acephalous society of hunter-gardeners, the Shuar now constitute a federation with a democratically elected, hierarchical leadership and are at the forefront of indigenous movements in Latin America. The author analyzes this transformation in the context of colonialism but argues that colonialism involves far more than the movement of people from one place to another or the extension of state authority over new territory. Rather, he reveals colonialism to hinge on the transformation of sociospatial boundaries. Such transformations were critical not only to Shuar ethnogenesis but also to Ecuadorian state-building. That is, colonialism involves a dialectical reorganization both of the state and of its new subjects. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author critically evaluates the impact and potential of a community currency—or local money system—known as the ‘local exchange trading scheme’ (LETS), to contribute to sustainable local development (SLD). Two distinct and contrasting models for sustainable development are described: a mainstream approach, focused on local regeneration [termed here the ‘local economic development’ (LED) approach]; and a radical ‘green’ or ‘new economics’ strategy (referred to as ‘sustainable local development’ or SLD). In the elaboration of these models the functions of community currencies within each perspective are outlined, and the basis for an evaluate framework is provided. Most previous analysis of LETS has used a broadly LED perspective; this paper focuses on an evaluation for SLD, as this has not previously been comprehensively done. For SLD, community currencies should enable people to: meet local needs through informal employment; revalue and redefine ‘work’; promote localisation and self-reliance; shift consumption patterns towards sharing, recycling, reuse, and reducing resource use; and build green social networks. Findings from a case-study LETS indicate that this community currency is successful in allowing participants to make small changes in their lifestyles, consumption, and employment patterns towards SLD, but there are limitations of size, scope, funding and management to be overcome before this could be achieved more effectively with LETS. However, following the LED-relevant prescriptions for upscaling and mainstreaming would undermine the qualities which align LETS with SLD perspective, and this highlights the importance of choosing appropriate evaluative frameworks, particularly when appraising sustainable-development initiatives. </jats:p>",

Africa is stereotypically ‘excluded’ from globalization, and research has not clarified that general negative assessment for specific places in Africa. To redress this deficiency, I examine globalization empirically from the ground upwards through an analysis of foreign companies. Primary and secondary data were collected at the local level to examine the nature and extent of foreign corporate activity in Accra, Ghana. The evidence points to growing inclusion in, rather than exclusion from, the world economy, to increasing service-sector rather than extractive-sector investment, and to foreign companies producing for local and regional markets as well as for international markets. Foreign companies employ a range of strategies to embed themselves in the local market: establishing joint ventures, developing local products, joining national stock markets, and historicizing their presence in the market. This study reemphasizes the need for place-specific fieldwork to enable us to make accurate statements about globalization in particular locations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Political attention to the plight of the ‘socially excluded’ in contemporary Britain suggests a renewed interest in issues of class and inequality at government level. This paper addresses the nature of that engagement by analysing the dominant discourse of welfare reform as a cultural reconstruction project which references goals of modernisation and multiculturalism. The centrality of the white working-class poor to the realisation of these goals is examined as a racialised positioning, a stage in the reconstruction of nation through the reconstruction of white working-class identities. The shift from naming the working-class poor as ‘underclass’, a racialised and irredeemable ‘other’, to naming them ‘the excluded’, a culturally determined but recuperable ‘other’, is pivotal to the recasting of Britain as a postimperial, modern nation. Analysis of the modes of modernisation and multiculturalism through which new definitions of nation are being established shows the constitutive role of neoliberal and class-based interests. The use of the white working-class poor as symbols of a generalised ‘backwardness’ and specifically a culturally burdensome whiteness, is examined as a form of class racism, the product of a dominant class-based anglocentrism. The paper concludes with a consideration of class as an illegitimate discourse within the dominant representational fields of media, politics, and academia and the author argues the need for a politics of representation that can recognise difference where it may not be visibly marked, that can see class through whiteness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many robotic tasks require compliant motions, but planning such motions poses special challenges not present in collision-free motion planning. One challenge is how to achieve exactness, that is, how to make sure that a planned path is exactly compliant to a desired contact state, especially when the configuration manifold of such a contact state is hard to describe analytically due to high geometrical complexity and/or high dimensionality. The authors tackle the problem with a hybrid approach of direct exploitation of contact constraints and randomized planning. They particularly focus on planning motion that maintains certain contact state or contact formation (CF), called a CF-compliant motion, because a general compliant motion is a sequence of such CF-compliant motions with respect to different CFs. This paper describes a randomized planner for planning CF-compliant motion between two arbitrary polyhedral solids, extending the probabilistic roadmap paradigm for planning collision-free motion to the space of contact configurations. Key to this approach is a novel sampling strategy to generate random CF-compliant configurations. The authors also present and discuss examples of sampling and planning results. </jats:p>",

These firms take in used components, disassemble them, and assemble saleable products from the good parts they find. There is considerable uncertainty in the supply of used components, the good parts in those components, and the demand for remanufactured products. Our system is based on material requirements planning logic, something that many firms in the industry are already familiar with.

The ambiguous nature of such groups does not simply reflect divisions within the colonising elite, but also the acts and representations of subalterns, including the liminal groups themselves. Focusing on the debates about the poor whites and freedmen in early 19th-century Barbados, the author seeks to explore a project of ‘racial reinscription’ which focused on a particular attempt to reproduce colonial whiteness. The resistance to and failure of this project reveal the dynamic and contested nature both of liminality and of colonial whiteness. In this way, the author aims to contribute to the growing critical literature on whiteness, and to do so in a way that avoids its recentring. </jats:p>",

The full profile approach is employed in order to capture all the alternative combinations present. The main contribution of this article is the assessment of changes in the weightings of the key attributes over the period. Findings indicate that in the early stages of the decision‐making process, prospective students view course content as the most significant factor, but that as the consumption process nears, location becomes increasingly important. Reputation is an exchangeable element throughout and is considered less important. Implications for the marketing of higher education courses are discussed.</jats:p>",

Long-term contractual supply commitments are made at a set price with fuel suppliers at the beginning of each year. Each month the procurement planner can use fuel from these contracts or purchase fuel at the current market price. Motivated by practical insights from this market, we propose a two-phase dynamic procedure to determine a procurement plan. In the first phase, the minimum contract purchases for each month are determined at the beginning of the year. In the second phase, given the minimum contract purchases, the more detailed procurement decisions are determined at the beginning of each month with the most up-to-date information. We perform intensive computational experiments that show that this procedure produces high-quality solutions comparable to a rolling-horizon stochastic-programming heuristic, is easier to maintain and generalize, is computationally faster, and is robust to random fluctuations in demand requirements, spot market prices, and other sources of uncertainty. </jats:p>",

As the landscape of public enterprise support in Britain changes and new institutions come on stream, this case poses searching questions about the manner in which policy for economic growth can be delivered in the English regions. Efforts to eliminate confusion and incoherence in the support infrastructure appear not to have succeeded. Findings indicate that barriers between policy ambitions and effective take-up by client communities continue to exist. Clients perceive behavioural rigidities as a barrier to the development of the most effective public-private relationships. A sometimes centralist perspective (arguably, the predisposition of the support infrastructure) is in danger of allowing the benefits of support tailored to regional need to be overlooked. The objective is by “constructively discrediting the system” (as Bowen et al suggest) to stimulate useful debate about the way in which the enterprise culture might be supported. </jats:p>",

Based on preparations for an Objective 1 programme in Wales, in this paper we critically evaluate the progress made by the devolved National Assembly for Wales in challenging the central government interpretation of additionality. This suggests that, in the context of devolution, matters surrounding Structural Fund finances will become more fiercely contested, exposing significant tensions between processes of decentralisation and centralisation within the UK polity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author builds on recent work on the history of geographical thought by focusing on the career of American geographer Daniel Coit Oilman, who was the first President of the Johns Hopkins University. It is argued that Oilman's influential work in professionalizing an instrumentalist approach to knowledge production in the new institution of the research university forms an important link between the philosophically oriented geography of Alexander von Humboldt and the geopolitics of Isaiah Bowman. The author extends work in the history of the discipline by showing how geographical knowledge came to be seen in instrumentalist terms not only in the institutional context of geographical societies and European imperial administration-the focus of much of the historical scholarship-but also within the context of an intellectual division of labor that emerged in the second half of the 19th century as the modern research university took shape. It is suggested that a full account of the way in which Humboldt's project was displaced by Oilman's may give us a better understanding of the role that geography might play in moving knowledge production beyond a purely instrumentalist orientation and into more liberatory projects of social justice. </jats:p>",

Educators, employers and professional organizations also have a key role to play in fostering the career planning and development of nurses, usually the largest employee group in most health care organizations. This article provides an overview of what career planning and development is and why it is important for nurses. A career planning and development model is described that provides nurses with a focused strategy to take greater responsibility for engaging in the ongoing planning process that is crucial throughout the major stages of their career. Finally, educators, employers and professional organizations are challenged to collaborate with individual nurses on career‐development activities that will enable nurses to continue to provide high‐quality care in ever‐changing health care systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In late 1990 the British government published a two-volume White Paper, Children Come First: The Government's Proposals on the Maintenance of Children, announcing its intention to establish a Child Support Agency (CSA). In contrast with most of the literature associated with the British CSA, my main concern in this paper is not with the direct identification of the problems, or the perceived problems, the agency has experienced since its inception in 1993; it is with how the agency was developed, and how this can help explain many of its subsequent problems or perceived problems. More directly, I will show that the origins of the agency are to be found in policy transfer from the USA, and that the difficulties inherent in this process led to important implementation problems. To do this, the paper is divided into four sections. In the first section I examine why the Thatcher government decided to develop the agency, rather than continuing with the Department of Social Security (DSS)/court-based child-support award system in operation at the time. Second, I demonstrate how parallel developments in Britain and the USA led the British government to be interested in, and then borrow, the key elements of the US Child Support Enforcement System (CSES). Third, I discuss the key elements of the CSA that were transferred from the USA. In the final section I illustrate how policy transfer offers an important, even if partial, explanation of the CSA's implementation problems, and why two successive governments have used considerable legislative time attempting to ‘fix’ the CSA. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although strategic management of R&amp;D portfolios is common practice in private sector R&amp;D, government R&amp;D management tends to be more discrete and ad hoc, focusing on generating maximum output from individual projects. Often, there is no clear notion of the desired public sector output. Whereas private sector R&amp;D evaluation is generally straightforward, with the function of R&amp;D being measured in terms of a company's internal return on investment, the benefits of public-sponsored R&amp;D tend to be more diffuse with respect to both type and impact. Drawing from evidence developed in twenty-four case studies of R&amp;D projects sponsored by the Department of Energy's Office of Basic Energy Sciences, one of the primary sources of funds for basic research in US universities and national laboratories, we examine implications of R&amp;D project impacts for a sort of ‘portfolio management’ of government-sponsored R&amp;D. Although the meaning of ‘portfolio’ is not the same in public sector R&amp;D management, it is nonetheless possible to think strategically about projects and their cumulative impact. Indeed, it is clear that many government R&amp;D managers already do so. In this study, we contrast two types of ‘portfolio’: (1) R&amp;D output portfolios (focusing on one type of scientific output, such as, for example, fundamental knowledge or technology development); and (2) a balanced portfolio that considers both R&amp;D outputs and ‘scientific and technical human capital’, the capacity created by R&amp;D projects. The case-study evidence shows different approaches to achieving each portfolio type. An analysis of the relation of project attributes to output types focuses on aspects of projects potentially under the control of strategic public managers, including magnitude of funding, degree and type of management oversight, and interorganizational and intraorganizational linkages. Each of these variables affects the type of project outputs obtained. From the results, we suggest that a balanced approach to government R&amp;D portfolio management is appropriate for many government agencies. That is, government managers may wish to consider the extent to which their projects both produce traditional outputs such as articles and patents, as well as provide contributions to scientific and technical human capital. </jats:p>",

Compared with the results of a survey conducted in 1977, any change in the prevalence of severe disability, or of the most severely physically disabled, has been relatively small. However, the prevalence of severe disability was found to be markedly higher among young people of South Asian background, compared with the rest of the population.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Poland's membership of the EU will involve economic integration across a variety of fields, with important potential implications for the external environment in which business is conducted in Poland. These implications stem first from the need to adapt Polish legislation, regulatory systems, and methods of certification and standards to EU requirements; and, second, from the continuing process of transforming the Polish economy into a market-based system. Although integration processes have important potential implications for Polish firms of all sizes, it can be argued that there are size-related characteristics of SMEs that can affect their ability to cope with potential threats and respond to new opportunities presented. The paper draws on two studies commissioned by the Polish SME Foundation, in which the authors were involved. The first was concerned with a comparison of the conditions for SME development in Poland with those in EU member states; the second specifically with the implications of accession for Polish SMEs. In this context, the paper considers three key questions: (1) What are the main sources of threat and opportunity for Polish SMEs, arising out of EU membership? (2) What are the main implications for Polish and EU policymakers? (3) To what extent are the implications of Poland's accession to the EU similar to or different from the issues faced by SMEs in the United Kingdom at the time of Single Market completion? </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1998 the UK government introduced a new, integrated transport policy signalling a move away from the principles of ‘predict and provide’ towards ‘new realism’. Labour's approach involved promoting a reduction in car use through (among other things) seeking to improve public transport provision and, in line with the trend which had begun in 1994, scaling down the national trunk-road building programme. But despite claiming that building new roads to resolve traffic problems would generally be a measure of the last resort, Labour's most recent statement of transport policy, Transport 2010: The 10-Year Plan, makes provisions for a large programme of trunk-road construction against a background of continued traffic growth. In this paper we compare the scale of trunk-road completions achieved by the generally pro-road Conservative governments of 1979–97 against those anticipated in Labour's 2000–10 plans. We suggest that the annual level of trunk-road completions in England over the next decade will in fact be little different from that achieved by the Conservatives. At a broader scale, we identify the emergence of a new paradigm in transport policy which we call ‘pragmatic multimodalism’. </jats:p>",

Many local governments lacked concrete plans and failed to think strategically about the Y2K problem at the beginning of 1999. A logistic analysis shows that the decision to form a concrete Y2K strategy depended on management attitudes and the technological sensitivity of local decision makers rather than on resource constraints or system characteristics. However, insufficient resources, not management attitudes and system characteristics, were the key determinant of the eventual outcomes of planning. This study concludes that local governments should think more strategically in IT planning and that senior management should take a more active role in the planning process. Local governments, especially counties, may need state assistance to improve IT planning for the information revolution in the new millennium. </jats:p>",

Despite claims to be ‘customer focused’, Australian police services have conceptualised customers as a unity rather than an amalgam of discrete groups. Furthermore, police services have not specified the desirable elements of a customer-focused organisation beyond modest corporate statements, nor formulated rigorous indicators of success along the road to achieving customer service excellence. Against the backdrop of a philosophical discussion about the reinvention of communities as customers in corporate planning strategies, some of the broad-level business planning techniques that Australian police services should apply, it is argued, before claiming to be truly ‘customer focused’ are identified. These new planning tools — defining customer segments, competitive positioning and ‘blue-sky’ planning — are introduced as useful techniques to move police organisations from their current position to a desired future position as customer-centred organisations. </jats:p>",

In this analysis we investigate the genuine composition of coalitions in each and every municipality in Norway, describing which parties serve as the majority base for the mayor and the deputy mayor. This approach gives us the opportunity to investigate both the impact of the genuine political office holders, as well as the structural properties of coalitions, on policy output. Using a decomposition of school expenditure suggested by Falch and Ratts0, we are able to ask in what ways money is spent inside the sector, in addition to how much money is spent. The empirical results show that coalitions can be linked to policy output; the preferred spending objects vary both according to the parties forming the coalition and the structural composition of the coalition. </jats:p>",

First, they focus on the way in which funds for education are targeted on disadvantage at the level of the local education authority (LEA). They explore the relationship between various indicators of disadvantage and national test and public examination results and find that the relationship between one measure of disadvantage—the proportion of children dependent on Income Support recipients in an LEA—has a stronger negative relationship with examination results of that LEA than the additional educational needs (AEN) index currently used by central government in the formula to distribute resources to local authorities. Second, the authors focus on the relationship between expenditure and performance and find evidence that higher expenditure by LEAs on education is associated with better examination results once poverty (as measured by the Income Support measure) has been controlled for. The first finding suggests that targeting educational need could be improved by substituting the Income Support measure for the current AEN index; the second lends support to the use of increased expenditure as a means of combating educational disadvantage. </jats:p>",

East Central Europe became a legally and institutionally constructed ‘buffer zone’ between Western Europe and the CIS, Commonwealth of Independent States—the former USSR. The opportunities for and costs of migration in the buffer zone were shaped by the ‘double territorial shock’ of the transition: reinterationalisation and the withdrawal of massive state intervention in support of regional convergence. The authors provide a comparative study of mobility and migration into and out of the buffer zone, through case studies of Ukrainians working in Slovakia, and Slovakians working in Austria. Whereas the Ukrainians are largely confined to the secondary-labour market, the Slovakians are found in both segments of the dual labour market. This leads to different implications in respect of ‘brain drain’ and ‘brain waste’ of international skilled-labour mobility, as well as amplifying income differences. The overall effect in both cases is to contribute to the reproduction of economic inequalities in the buffer zone, and this is explored through an analysis of savings and investment and future employment intentions. The conclusions are particularly pessimistic in respect of the wage differentials required to persuade Ukrainian migrants to return to their country of origin. </jats:p>",

Our results suggest that the nature of internal auditors' compensation and work affect audit planning recommendations differently. The opportunity to receive incentive compensation results in less reliance on internal auditors' work and greater budgeted audit hours, but only for the subjective task. Although a consulting role decreases perceived internal auditor objectivity, it has a limited effect on planning recommendations. Specifically, consulting has no effect on reliance, and leads to greater budgeted audit hours only when incentive compensation is available.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Physical planning in Ireland was originally envisaged as a rational decision-making process involving the definition of objectives for the development of the locally governed area in question, the evaluation of alternative methods of furthering growth, choice and monitoring of results. This paper examines the extent to which the process as it has evolved now displays these characteristics. While the process of making local authority development plans is seen to conform to this model of decision-making, the subsequent development control process, where an individual proposal at a given location is evaluated, gives cause for concern. The authors note the absence of a rational process where a comparative evaluation of a number of sites is undertaken in order to show that the location under consideration is the best available one for the proposal. The inability of the planning authority or appeals board to assess the project on a full set of environmental criteria is also highlighted, together with the lack of connectivity between the stages in the development control process and the uneven access of relevant actors to these stages. The Masonite Corporation's application to Leitrim County Council for permission to construct a timber manufacturing plant at Drumsna is used as a case study to highlight the lack of rationality in decision-making within the physical planning process. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the centre wants the provision level to be such that at least a minimum standard is provided. If the imposition of such a standard is constitutionally ruled out, what should an appropriate grant look like. It is explicitly recognised that the decision whether or not to accept the proposed grant scheme may vary for different types of recipients. In addition, the grant must be incentive compatible. This is achieved by including information-eliciting payments in the transfer, which in turn influences the optimal provision level: more types will be set at the minimum-provision level, relative to a perfect-information setting. The qualitative nature of the optimal grant scheme itself is profoundly influenced by just the addition of information asymmetry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The reproducibility of an interactive image registration technique used as part of the radiotherapy treatment planning process was investigated for 3D CT and MR pediatric head images. Over a nine month period, 85 CT/MR image registrations, required for treatment planning, were repeated, 52 by the same operator and 33 by a different operator. All were performing image registrations for normal clinical care and the first registration was used clinically. Inter‐ and intra‐operator reproducibility of the translation and rotation were calculated separately. The standard deviation of the average total translation and rotation was 0.39 mm and 1.7°, and 0.58 mm and 2.8°, respectively. The maximum difference between registrations was 1.1 mm and 4.1° when repeated by the same operator, and 1.4 mm and 5.8° when repeated by another operator. The variation for the lowest resolution parameters, out of plane translation and rotations, was 2 to 3 times larger than for in‐plane movements. A registration took between 5 minutes and over half an hour for difficult cases, with a mean of 14.3 minutes. One to two millimeter reproducibility was not achieved and interactive registration was relatively time consuming. There is a clear image resolution effect on registration reproducibility, suggesting that reducing slice thickness could considerably improve registration reproducibility.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.57. –s</jats:p>",

With the aid of data from national surveys on the use of ICT by the Swedish population, our objective is to investigate the overall spread of ICT-based modes of work such as telework, mobile work, and teleconferences in an emerging informational society. The concepts of home-based, commuting-based, and mobile work form a starting point. The numbers and proportions of teleworkers are estimated using different criteria regarding the role of ICT. The current diffusion of telework is at a low and constant level, although general access to computers and telecommunication equipment is widespread, high, and increasing. Gender, type of profession, type of employment, and possession of a driver's license influence group-level differences between those who do telework and those who do not. Income and computer access are the dominating factors of influence at the individual level. In the main finding we contrast expectations of a rapid replacement of travel-based modes of work by ICT-based modes. An activity-based framework for a better understanding of the acceptance of ICT-based activities and their effects on the employment–travel landscape is outlined. </jats:p>",

We concluded that many of the needs of such families could be addressed through improved application of the principles of advance care planning, including regular structured discussions, involvement of surrogate decision-makers, and anticipation of clinical decisions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper and its sequel we investigate the contribution of suppressed and induced traffic to emissions and user benefits derived from new roads and capacity changes under different pricing regimes. Equilibrium transport models are used to appraise selected highway and pricing policies over the period 2000–20. Here we examine the suppression of demand through increasing congestion in two reference states against which capacity changes will be appraised in the second paper. The first state is the consequence of ‘doing nothing’ over the twenty-year period; the second corresponds to the imposition of marginal cost (congestion) pricing on network links. Taking both a network model of Cardiff, and a single representative link (SRL) model, we estimate the effect of suppressed demand on the emission of: carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and carbon dioxide. We show both analytically and numerically that, by reducing effective growth and moderating speeds, the suppression of traffic can have significant implications for vehicle emissions in the peak period, the effect varying in proportion to the elapsed time from the base year. At a travel time elasticity of −0.25, congestion pricing is shown to make an important contribution to containing all emissions, reducing carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide peak volumes by a quarter to a third of their unpriced level by the year 2010. </jats:p>",

The 1990s were marked by at least three drought events of which the 1998 to 1999 was the most recent. In spite of this recurrence, ongoing drought monitoring and mitigative planning efforts are not as advanced as they could be and no official drought plan exists for the state. This article is the first of two in this volume. It summarizes the cascade of drought types that impacted the state during the 1998 to 1999 episode. From a number of precipitation statistics and drought indices, fine spatial scales (county or better) were found to best capture the character of drought impacts, while the weekly time step is recommended as the temporal unit around which to base planning and monitoring efforts. The companion article outlines a possible framework for drought planning efforts and highlights key constituencies to be included in the process.</jats:p>",

Geological, environmental and socio-economic characteristics of this section of the watershed provide a heterogeneous landscape mosaic of interconnected natural and anthropic elements. In this work, the Sapato Creek watershed is used as a case study for an environmental analysis of the Lower Camaquã system. Landscape elements were identified, described and modelled as a way to understand their structure and dynamics. Satellite images (1:100,000) and field checking were utilised in the characterisation of the landscape elements and identification of land use categories. The results supported the characterisation of the structural and functional organisation of the watershed, potential impacts and the suitability of land use for the system. A conceptual methodological strategy is presented as an effective tool for transferring the recommendations produced in this work to decision-makers directly involved with environmental management in the region. The strategy relies on the interaction between scientists, decision-makers and watershed stakeholders to foster the identification of possible educational actions that could lead to a rational use of land and natural resources in the watershed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors address two research questions: (1) Are populations with lower socioeconomic status, compared with people of higher socioeconomic status, more likely to be exposed to higher levels of particulate air pollution in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada? (2) How sensitive is the association between levels of particulate air pollution and socioeconomic status to specification of exposure estimates or statistical models? Total suspended particulate (TSP) data from the twenty-three monitoring stations in Hamilton (1985–94) were interpolated with a universal kriging procedure to develop an estimate of likely pollution values across the city based on annual geometric means and extreme events. Comparing the highest with the lowest exposure zones, the interpolated surfaces showed more than a twofold increase in TSP concentrations and more than a twentyfold difference in the probability of exposure to extreme events. Exposure estimates were related to socioeconomic and demographic data from census tract areas by using ordinary least squares and simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) models. Control for spatial autocorrelation in the SAR models allowed for tests of how robust specific socioeconomic variables were for predicting pollution exposure. Dwelling values were significantly and negatively associated with pollution exposure, a result robust to the method of statistical analysis. Low income and unemployment were also significant predictors of exposure, although results varied depending on the method of analysis. Relatively minor changes in the statistical models altered the significant variables. This result emphasizes the value of geographical information systems (GIS) and spatial statistical techniques in modelling exposure. The result also shows the importance of taking spatial autocorrelation into account in future justice – health studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1995, the City of St. Louis undertook a major strategic planning effort for its municipal information systems. The project was initiated in the midst of acrimonious debate regarding mainframe bottlenecks, the proliferation of independent computing systems, organizational problems in the delivery of management information systems (MIS) services, and rapidly changing technology. A strategic planning process tailored to this complex environment was developed and executed, engaging individuals at all levels to articulate needs for information, identify problems with existing systems, suggest organizational changes, and define potential MIS projects. As in most governments, organizational issues and managerial processes proved more daunting than technical issues. The implementation of technical recommendations proved much easier than changing the organizational culture to take full advantage of new technologies. To realize fully the benefits of new information technology, more effective ways must be found to facilitate the spanning of formal organizational boundaries. </jats:p>",

For PLATO, the same test gave rise to a difference of 10.2%. Comparing the two systems, NPS calculated doses for points in the forward direction 14% greater than those calculated by PLATO. The entry of points using the digitizer accounted for less than 1% of any difference. <jats:italic>For the patient case:</jats:italic> the dose difference between NPS and PLATO planning for all patient reference points entered from films ranged from 1 to 4%. The difference in dose between optimized and nonoptimized planning was approximately 0.5% for prescription points (points <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>), while for the bladder and rectum the differences were 6% and 20%, respectively with NPS, and with PLATO, 8% and 22%, respectively.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusion</jats:bold>: This study highlighted the effects of the differences in the calculational algorithm between the older and newer planning systems from Nucletron. While the differences were minimal on the perpendicular bisector of the source, along the axis they become considerable. In a practical gynecological case, these differences mostly affect the dose to the rectum, since that organ receives the greatest proportion of its dose from rays near the same axis. Overall, the PLATO system plan required about 2.5% less integrated reference air kerma than the NPS plan for the same dose to point <jats:italic>A</jats:italic>. For either planning system, optimization is crucial in decreasing dose to bladder and rectal points. © <jats:italic>2001 American College of Medical Physics.</jats:italic> [DOI: 10.1120/1.1384528]</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j</jats:p>",
