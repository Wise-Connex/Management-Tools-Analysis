They draw on stories, which are most natural and powerful ways of representing, and understanding, sets of events. Scenarios look at the past and present, and offer insights into a future where things are generally uncertain. They are used by many organisations as part of strategic planning and as a way of forecasting what core competencies the organisation needs to develop for survival and competitive advantage. These ideas are applied to current library practice.</jats:p>",

It is the direct descendant of correspondence and home study courses, that were developed in the nineteenth century. What is new, however, is the wealth of telecommunications and telematics options available today that enable the provision of this high‐tech educational environment and the enlargement of the potential user base. Libraries have a central role in education, learning, and vocational training in support of increasing knowledge. The rapid evolution of information and communication technology in the learning field imposes, supports and stimulates the re‐engineering of the library.

Owing to the new sensitivity arising towards the environment, power generation design must respect the environment. Today no standardized design criteria exist; the present work aims to elaborate a specific methodology for power plants consisting of a predictive instrument (the Environmental Impact Evaluation), a management tool (the Environmental Management System), and a series of environmental studies and checks. After showing the methodology, the authors tested it with an application to a real scenario: the heat and electrical power needs of a pharmaceutical firm. Cogeneration seemed to be the best available technology from an economic and environmental point of view. In the proposed case study, all possible impacts have been quantified verifying legislative standards and accomplishing the ISO 14000.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Scenario-based modeling is emerging as a key technology in software development because scenarios are easy to describe and understand, naturally describing the real world, and highly used in several development phases. Scenario-Based Software Modeling (SBSM) represents scenarios with a formal method, and then integrates each scenario into a global one excluding redundant, incomplete, and inconsistent elements. An issue which is not yet proposed a clear solution in SBSM is the handling of different abstraction levels. In the existing proposals, this problem is hidden with an implicit assumption that all such scenarios have the same abstraction levels, which we believe to be unrealistic. In our research, we propose a Hierarchical Object-Oriented Petri Net (HOONet) as a method to specify the scenarios, and also suggest a method to integrate scenarios including different abstraction levels as well as redundancy, incompleteness, and inconsistency. Coordinating abstraction levels of scenarios can be achieved by considering scenario models as state-based transition models and verifying the transition models with respect to behavioral equivalence. In order to show the effectiveness of our suggestion, overall processes of SBSM using HOONet are explained with a practical example. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The risk through chemical exposure is commonly characterized by ratios of exposure concentrations and effect levels (risk quotients). For chemicals with many different applications such as solvents, however, in addition to the risk quotients of different exposure situations it is useful to determine the corresponding numbers of exposed individuals, that is, not only the magnitude but also the extent of the risk. To this end, the Scenario‐Based Risk Assessment (SceBRA) method has been developed that makes use of a large set of scenarios, each of which describes a typical situation regarding handling a solvent or solvent‐containing product. The scenarios cover the life‐cycle steps of production, distribution, and use of solvents. For each scenario, SceBRA provides the risk quotient, <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>, and the number of exposed individuals, <jats:italic>N.</jats:italic> This study investigated seven solvents that are used in large amounts in Switzerland. For each solvent, characteristic distributions of <jats:italic>r</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> values were calculated, making it possible to compare different solvents with respect to their risk profile. Graphical representations of the <jats:italic>r</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> data provide an informative way for analyzing and communicating the results of SceBRA.</jats:p>",
