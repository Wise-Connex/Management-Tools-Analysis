Regarding its main uses or functions, there are four: explanation, prediction, justification, and normative guidance. Each of these four roles is briefly explained before moving on to the core of the article regarding the scope of planning theory, as the use of city planning theory bears directly on its reach, and vice versa. This discussion addresses the question of the contribution of planning theory to urban development, and suggests how to explain that contribution. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>John Rawls’s ‘political liberalism’ provides a firm moral basis for contemporary planning theory, offering both a procedure for arriving at the ethical principles which should govern a society, and the substantive principles of justice which he argues best embody the moral ideals of liberty and equality for constitutional liberal democracies. It offers an objective justification for public planning which does not require foundationalism, and fits a liberal democratic context. In 2001, Rawls’s Justice as Fairness: A Restatement summarized the revisions to (or clarifications of) his original theory over the previous 30 years. This article reviews aspects of his theory which are relevant to public planning, concluding that Rawls offers a normative rationale for planning, a basis for practical critique, a reason for hope, and a vision of reasonable, free and equal citizens cooperating to achieve justice as fairness.</jats:p>",

Here the democratic process fails because the issues of contention are pre-shaped and ‘technically’ determined and the rationality deployed only allows a limited range of ‘sensible’, i.e. pre-framed, dreams of what constitutes the ‘good’ city. This article draws on both Lacan and Lefebvre to explore the dichotomy between seeking a common harmony of social vision while at the same time avoiding any exclusion of cultural and related difference in lived space. </jats:p>",

Despite this, however, few studies of property market performance consider the influence of retail planning policies. This paper seeks to fill the gap. The empirical part of the paper uses data derived from a survey of local planning authorities to construct a range of measures of planning policy stance. The indicators demonstrate that the role of policy is complex and multidimensional. The paper then explores the relationship between planning policies and measures of property market performance. The results show that, while proactive policies do not guarantee a vibrant market, they can play an important part in stimulating occupier and investor demand, even where there are poor economic fundamentals. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We investigate an off‐line strategy to incorporate inter fraction organ movements in IMRT treatment planning. Nowadays, imaging modalities located in the treatment room allow for several CT scans of a patient during the course of treatment. These multiple CT scans can be used to estimate a probability distribution of possible patient geometries. This probability distribution can subsequently be used to calculate the expectation value of the delivered dose distribution. In order to incorporate organ movements into the treatment planning process, it was suggested that inverse planning could be based on that probability distribution of patient geometries instead of a single snapshot. However, it was shown that a straightforward optimization of the expectation value of the dose may be insufficient since the expected dose distribution is related to several uncertainties: first, this probability distribution has to be estimated from only a few images. And second, the distribution is only sparsely sampled over the treatment course due to a finite number of fractions. In order to obtain a robust treatment plan these uncertainties should be considered and minimized in the inverse planning process. In the current paper, we calculate a 3D variance distribution in addition to the expectation value of the dose distribution which are simultaniously optimized. The variance is used as a surrogate to quantify the associated risks of a treatment plan. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated for clinical data of prostate patients. Different scenarios of dose expectation values and corresponding variances are discussed.</jats:p>",

Perhaps out of frustration, communication and behaviour change efforts are receiving lesser attention. But as long as heterosexual intercourse remains the predominant means of transmission of HIV in sub‐Saharan Africa, there is the inherent danger of more people getting infected thus mopping up the gains from other approaches. This paper therefore argues for evidence based behaviour change interventions in sub‐Saharan Africa, revisits the behaviour change theories and their relevance to the African situation. It proposes an integration of models based on the convergence of three existing theories of social learning, diffusion of innovation and social networks and the author's understanding of some African culture. The beauty of the model is based on the fact that ‘social norms are best understood and influenced at the level of social networks’; existing chains of communication and the naturalness of exchange of information. A case is made for application of the ‘model’ to precipitate sexual behaviour change and HIV reduction in sub‐Saharan Africa. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The authors argue that, contrary to the perceptions that this context may increase NGO's financial vulnerability, a SWAp and a decentralized system may provide an opportunity that should be embraced by NGOs to enhance their sustainability and effectiveness by reducing their current dependency on donor funding. The paper discusses the systemic weaknesses of many NGOs that currently make them vulnerable, and observes that unless these weaknesses are addressed, such NGOs will lose their space in the SWAp and decentralization arena. The authors suggest that NGOs need to recognize the opportunities that participating in public‐private partnerships through a SWAp can offer them for long‐term and significant funding. They need also to develop their capacity to pro‐actively participate in a SWAp and decentralized context by becoming more entrepreneurial in nature, through re‐orienting their organizational philosophies and strategic planning and budgeting so as to be able to partner effectively with the public sector in accessing funds made available through health sector reform.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In order to understand the impact of specific maternal health interventions, it is necessary to understand the likely effect of the health system structure. An important aspect of this structure is the organizational culture. Many systems in low‐income countries have been based on a centrally planned and financed system. In recent years a series of organizational changes have been introduced into many systems and these substantially alter the way in which the system operates and impacts on reproductive health care provision. The main changes reviewed in this paper are: (i) decentralization, (ii) privatization and (iii) integration and sector wide approaches. Each of these changes is seen to have important implications for reproductive health. In each case it is clear that the nature of the impact depends crucially on the way it is implemented. Quantifying the impact of these changes remains extremely difficult given the many different ways they can be introduced and the many confounding factors that affect the overall impact. The literature does, however, point to a number of key issues that impinge on the way in which change is likely to affect reproductive health initiatives.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Shanghai's health care system is facing a serious challenge of an ageing population, as 14% of its 17 million residents are 65 or older. In 2000, a community health reform was implemented to provide comprehensive and continuous primary care to community residents with a focus on seniors. The study employed the theoretical framework of examining primary care in terms of the constellation of its four unique elements (first contact, comprehensiveness, longitudinality and coordination) and three healthcare components (structure, process and outcome). The study aimed to evaluate the extent to which the reform has achieved its process goals and how the organizational context influenced the level of implementation. In‐depth interviews with 25 health providers, 15 seniors and four community leaders were carried out. The study found that the Shanghai community health reform has improved the structure and process of primary care regarding first contact, comprehensiveness and longitunality. However, the reform is constrained by structural barriers on seniors' financial access to resources and the capacity of primary care providers. The previous organization system also constrains the reform in CHCs financing and administration. The Shanghai case illustrates that a broad societal view has to be taken when analysing health reforms, which requires the involvement of multiple sectors including the government, health providers and health consumers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Emissions trading with carbondioxide (CO2 certificates shall probably be the market-oriented instrument of environmental policy with the broadest impact. Consequently, one should also expect considerable spatial effects. Therefore, the question, of what kind these effects will be, should be asked at an early stage so that spatial planning can prepare for them. The analyses of this paper, which due to the lack of experience and consequently of quantitative data can only be of an exploratory kind, show that the spatial effects shall vary greatly. Most probably the consequences will hit the — already disadvantaged — old-industrial regions beyond proportion. As opposed to this, modern agglomerations will be best off, not least because of their stronger power to shift the burden. Under the anyway increasing conflict of interest between national growth and interregional equalization, which spatial planning faces, this is an important result. Thus, if emissions trading increases by volume, as is to be expected, spatial planning has to be prepared early for noticeable spatial effects. To demonstrate the spatial structure and approximate relative importance of this burden, was the intention of this paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper extends the framework of partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) to multi-agent settings by incorporating the notion of agent models into the state space.  Agents maintain beliefs over physical states of the environment and over models of other agents, and they use Bayesian updates to maintain their beliefs over time. The solutions map belief states to actions. Models of other agents may include their belief states and are related to agent types considered in games of incomplete information.  We express the agents' autonomy by postulating that their models are not directly manipulable or observable by other agents.  We show that important properties of POMDPs, such as convergence of value iteration, the rate of convergence, and piece-wise linearity and convexity of the value functions carry over to our framework.  Our approach complements a more traditional approach to interactive settings which uses Nash equilibria as a solution paradigm.  We seek to avoid some of the drawbacks of equilibria which may be non-unique and do not capture off-equilibrium behaviors.  We do so at the cost of having to represent, process and continuously revise models of other agents. Since the agent's beliefs may be arbitrarily nested, the optimal solutions to decision making problems are only asymptotically computable.  However, approximate belief updates and approximately optimal plans are computable. We illustrate our framework using a simple application domain, and we show examples of belief updates and value functions.</jats:p>"

The market forced the company to change its sales and production strategy from “make-to-order” to “make-to-stock.” The decision to change the strategy involved not only the company’s decision to invest much more money in accumulation and keeping stocks of finished goods, it required a complete redesign of its production planning system, which was an integral part of an ERP system that used SAP software. A team of IT specialists and production planning personnel was formed for designing computer support for the new production planning system business processes. There was no consensus in the design group. IT specialists were sure that existing SAP software could provide adequate computer support. The production planning staff had doubts that SAP modules are relevant to their business processes. They argued that poor fit between the business processes implicit in the software and the business processes of EA Cakes will result in failure. To resolve the problem, the management invited a consulting company. The consultants suggested quickly designing a rough prototype system. Analyzing this system would help the working group to reach a consensus. Apart from giving adequate computer support to the new production planning system, the SAP implementation had to solve several implementation problems identified by consultants. The question is: can a standard software system like SAP give adequate computer support to an individually designed business management system?</p>",

The project involved four SIUC undergraduate landscape horticulture students and the researcher visiting the 100-acre site, students and faculty of the Community College, as well as residents of the reservation. The purpose of the project was to: 1) explore developing a distance learning landscape horticulture program as a model project; 2) offer hands-on learning experience for the undergraduates; and 3) develop a master plan for a cultural, wellness, and environmental educational center. Developing the master plan involved four stages conducted by SIUC and Turtle Mountain participants. This included an inventory of the site and surrounding area, visiting classes at Turtle Mountain Tribal College, and interviewing numerous people from the reservation. An analysis was completed to review desired activities, such as a native plant garden, medicine wheel garden, pow wow site, and an outdoor kitchen, in relation to physical and observed features of the site. Environmental concerns, including water quality of the lake, were also addressed in the analysis. A master plan was completed after design concepts were explored. Future goals to complete the Anishinabe project include educational workshops and seeking funds to implement the master plan. Participants felt that the learning exercise for this model project was rewarding and successful. Therefore, SIUC and Turtle Mountain will continue to develop distance learning opportunities for students and potentially invite other tribal colleges with an interest in landscape horticulture to be involved.</jats:p>",

This leads to the formulation of the problem as a two-stage recourse program whose optimal policy structure features two forms of flexibility denoted as operational hedging: (1) production hedging, where the firm deliberately produces less than the total demand; and (2) allocation hedging, where due to unfavorable exchange rates, some markets are not served despite having unused production. Our characterization of the optimal policy structure leads to an economic valuation of production and allocation hedging. We show that the prevalence of production hedging is moderated by the degree of correlation between exchange rates. A comprehensive examination under the following four generalized settings provides the depth, scope, and relevancy that our proposed operational hedges play to facilitate aggregate planning: (1) multiple periods, (2) demand uncertainty, (3) price setting or monopolistic pricing, and (4) price setting under demand uncertainty. We show that production and allocation hedging are robust for these generalizations and should be integrated into the overall aggregate planning strategy of a global manufacturing firm. </jats:p>",

This case study of a student technical writing group explores how group members used gestures to create a conversational interaction space that they then treated like a physical text that they manipulated, wrote on, and pointed at. These gestures suggested a group pretext that helped group members translate abstract goals into concrete plans. However, the close proximity of gesture to the physical act of writing may mislead students into thinking that the tricky work of translating abstract ideas into final written form had already been completed. Gestures and adaptor movements (such as fidgeting with a pen) also seemed to conspire to help individuals control the conversational space and call attention to themselves as writers. Implications for future research on gesture and collaborative writing, gender, and writing technologies are discussed. </jats:p>",

We assume that the computers are multithreaded, and have differing architectures leading to varying and inconsistent processing rates. The model is based on a discrete‐time, continuous flow model developed by Graves [Oper Res 34 (1986), 522–533] which provides the steady‐state moments of production and work‐in‐queue quantities. We make several extensions to Graves' model to represent distributed computing networks. First, we approximately model control rules that are nonlinear functions of the work‐in‐queue at multiple stations through a linearization approach. Second, we introduce an additional noise term on production and show its use in modeling the discretization of jobs. Third, we model groups of heterogeneous computers as aggregate, “virtual computing cells” that process multiple tasks simultaneously, using a judiciously selected control rule. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Understanding human thinking is crucial in the design and evaluation of human-computer interaction. Computing devices and applications are at this moment employed ahead of the desktop, in dissimilar environments, and this tendency toward ubiquitous computing is gathering speed. As computers become major necessity and having connectivity widespread, we are increasingly becoming competent to access computer power, data, information and knowledge from anyplace and at anytime. Conversely, in order to fetch the benefits of such accessible intelligence (commonly known as ‘ERP’ or a latest buzzword in a contemporary scenario and in the field of information technology too); we should not overlook the ongoing evolutions and revolutions in human-computer communications and its interfaces. Indeed, as the human factors of information systems and knowledge systems emerge as a research area in and of itself, it is thoughtful to go on board on this electrifying field of study. The operation of the Human-Computer with a flavour of ERP is to encourage interdisciplinary study and education in user-centered computer systems. The location of ERP is to make interactive and intelligent human-computer interfaces, in order to effectively enable users to accomplish their desired tasks. This paper present a personal outlook of the HCI landscape in a historical perspective. The paper also aims part to support newcomers in the filed to grasp the origins of HCI and in part to provide grounds for a discussion of the field of usability that is being challenged by the social and cultural developments (Jorgensen 2000). This paper has argued that in order to properly understand the interaction between ERP system and human computer interactions networks one must scrutinize the mutual flows of influence and the dynamic interaction between the two. Thus to bridge this gap, the paper critically reviews the existing ERP in a humanity context and upgrade decision-drivers, synthesizes a framework based on the literature, and extends the framework as necessary. At last but not least the paper show-off a personal, historical overview of these develoments in accompanying ERP system as seen form a HCI perspective. </jats:p>",

The results are based on a household survey carried out in the region of Dresden, which is put in context with empiricial results of other studies. The results show that migrations correspond with the housing requirements and locational preferences of the respective household, but they are also influenced by external conditions. As a consequence, locational behaviour affects mode choice and activity spaces of the household members, but in turn, locational behaviour itself is influenced by household motorization. The contribution concludes with some considerations on the compatibility of the locational preferences of private households and individuals with the guiding principle of compact settlement structures.</jats:p>"

It is one of the most widely used planning tools today, but its ability to promote biodiversity conservation is largely unexplored. We studied the ecological component of the Israeli EIA system by reviewing a representative sample of 52 environmental impact statements (EISs) produced since 1995 and their corresponding guidelines issued by the Ministry of the Environment. Quality of both EISs and guidelines was determined using a simple scoring approach. Lack of quantitative data, meaningful analyses, and ecosystem perspective was apparent throughout. Many EISs failed to perform field surveys and their qualitative nature hampered meaningful impact prediction. Most EISs concentrated on aesthetic mitigation measures and did not assess their feasibility and likely success. Most of these flaws reflect poor standards rather than true scientific limitations. Guideline quality scores were the most important factor determining the quality of EISs; second was the involvement of an ecological consultant in preparing the EIS. We found a decreasing trend of EIS quality scores over time. Improvements in EIA procedures, particularly in ecological guidelines and the incorporation of ecological consultation, are important for upgrading ecological impact assessment so that the potential of EIA to advance biodiversity conservation can be realized.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to develop an urban land-use-demand forecast model using a metropolitan input–output model and gravity-type spatial interaction models. The feasibility of the proposed model is tested with actual data from the Seoul metropolitan area by estimating the effects of urban-growth-control policy on urban economy, employment, population, and land-use demand. Three main features are highlighted: (1) the proposed model can estimate and project urban land-use demand on a firm theoretical foundation because land-use demand is determined by the interindustrial and interspatial relations of production, income formation, and consumption through metropolitan input–output multipliers; (2) the proposed model has practical advantages over other urban land-use models in terms of operational cost because it is relatively easy to operate within the input–output framework and it has fewer requirements of data and parameter calibration; and (3) the proposed model has the capability to incorporate changes in attractiveness, accessibility, land availability, and other policy variables in projecting and estimating urban land-use demand, which is an important feature for policy evaluation. The simulation results prove the feasibility of the proposed model as an urban-policy evaluation tool, which provides significant implications to urban policy analysts. The simulation results indicate that a growth-control policy decreases output and employment for the overall urban economy. The model results also show that a city with a growth-control policy is negatively impacted with regards to output, employment, population, and residential and nonresidential land-use demand, whereas the surrounding cities receive positive spillover effects due to the land-use regulation. </jats:p>",

However, the pressures of economic change can exert opposing forces on social capital—strengthening it, as reciprocity networks are increasingly called into play, and eroding it, as households' ability to cope deteriorates and trust breaks down. Drawing on the above, I examine the complex ways in which individuals in Koforidua, Ghana network for resources, identity, and space by using their social interactions. I focus specifically on how networks are employed as assets to guard against and alleviate the hardships of a changing socioeconomic landscape. Network interactions are explored through four key lenses: (a) household, kin, and neighborhood ties; (b) alumni ties; (c) occupational ties; and (d) religious associations. I conclude that the ongoing networks, symbolizing different scales of social space, are what guide individuals to appropriate forums. They make survival possible. They also encapsulate and communicate identity. </jats:p>",

Two ablation simulations with targeted postoperative surfaces perpendicular to either the visual or corneal morphological axis were made for each eye. All ablations were programmed for correction of corneal irregularities, including corneal astigmatism. The manifest refractive error was not corrected. Optical diameter was 6.5 mm and total diameter was 7.5 mm. Maximum ablation depths and maximum transition zone gradients were registered and analyzed.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>RESULTS: In eyes with secondary irregular astigmatism, mean maximum ablation depth was 48.21 ± 25.96 µm and 26.31 ± 14.08 µm, whereas mean maximum transition zone gradient was 29.07 ± 25.15 µm and 9.88 ± 6.41 µm in ablation simulations based on the visual and corneal morphological axes, respectively. The difference between the ablation strategies was highly statistically significant for both parameters (P&lt;.001). In virgin eyes, only a minor difference was noted between the visual and corneal morphological axis ablation simulations (P=.15 for maximum ablation depths and P=.19 for maximum transition zone gradient).</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>CONCLUSIONS: In secondary irregular astigmatism, ablation based on the corneal morphological axis appears to minimize corneal tissue consumption and allows a smoother transition zone.

The paper explores state-of-the-art QoS technologies and implementations and provides a framework for the provision of QoS for ERP systems that utilize Internet Protocol (IP) networks. Four individual case studies, including both leading ERP vendors and network technology vendors, were conducted. Cross-case analysis confirmed that the traditional approaches for ensuring the performance of ERP systems on IP networks do not address network congestion and latency effectively, nor do they offer guaranteed network service quality for ERP systems. Moreover, cross-case comparative data analysis also reviewed existing QoS implementations and suggested that while QoS is being acknowledged increasingly by enterprises as an important issue, its deployment remains limited. The proposed framework focuses on providing a structured approach to implement end-to-end IP QoS that accommodates both ERP systems and their Web-enabled versions, based on traffic classification mechanisms.</p>",

I utilize Butler's performativity theory along with geographic theories of race, racial difference, and racism to argue that teenage girls reinstate racial difference through their everyday spatial practices. The paper has two substantive sections in addition to the introduction and the conclusion. The first explores the segregated high school lunchroom. Here I examine two girls' narratives and suggest that these girls encounter the spatiality of racial difference in the lunchroom and repeat the practices of segregated sitting. Thus, they reinscribe racialized difference and identity through their spatial practices of sitting with same-race friends. The second substantive section focuses on girls' practices of identifying others' racial identities. In this section I argue that these identifications are spatialized and that racial difference and categorization are achieved through spatial policing and boundary making. Throughout the paper I argue that racial identity and racial difference are performative, but that performativity must account for the normative spatiality of social and racial practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ethical trade, involving codes of conduct for worker welfare, has recently emerged as a form of corporate self-regulation for global commodity chains in the context of a neoliberal trading environment. I present a particular critique of ethical trade based on its embeddedness in corporate strategies and management systems. The ethical trading strategies of leading UK food and clothing retailers form the empirical focus of inquiry, and theories found in the literature on economic geography concerning corporate strategy and interfirm organisation are used to gain critical insight into the management systems used by these retailers when they attempt to put ethical trading principles into practice in their global supply chains. Variations are observed between retailers in terms of their commitment to ethical trade, which are shaped by issues of corporate culture, financial management, and corporate restructuring. Varying levels of commitment to ethical trading strategy are argued in turn to influence organisational approaches to social auditing in the supply chain. Three contrasting modes of organisation for ethical monitoring are suggested to be used by retail companies—the arm's-length approach, the coordinated approach, and the developmental approach—each of which holds contrasting implications for suppliers and workers at production sites. I argue that corporate approaches to ethical trade vary markedly and that these variations have the capacity to shape the regulation of labour conditions at sites of export production. </jats:p>",

In project planning, the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is one of the fundamental tools, but the terms “product” and “activity” are frequently confused and results in inefficiency in the support of project management tasks. By clarifying the nature of project planning and execution, an integrated method for WBS planning has been developed in this research. It includes the product‐oriented WBS (P‐WBS), the activity‐oriented WBS (A‐WBS), and the contract‐out WBS (C‐WBS). The technology roadmap is used to transform the P‐WBS into the A‐WBS. Using the proposed integrated WBS planning method as the basis, an integrated methodology for new product development has been given to align strategic management to project management. Finally, the successful application of this methodology to develop a project for the re‐host of a full scope training simulator of a nuclear power plant in Taiwan is illustrated.</jats:p>",

However, repeated efforts to assess the impact of constituency marginality on the propensity of individual electors to participate have met with failure. The 2001 British General Election was no exception to either result. This presence of an ecological aggregate-level relationship which is not replicated at the level of individual voters is paradoxical. However, the paradox can be resolved when two analytical steps are combined. First, nonvoters are classified into two groups according to their reasons for abstention: those who abstain on purpose (‘voluntary abstainers’), and those who fail to vote for reasons largely beyond their control (‘involuntary abstainers’). Second, attention is paid not only to actual marginality but also to perceived marginality. Individuals who think their constituency is competitive are less likely to abstain deliberately than individuals who think their constituency is safe. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is an increasing demand for active public involvement in forestry decision making, but there are as yet few established models for achieving this in the new sustainable forest management (SFM) context. At the level of the working forest, the fields of forest sustainability assessment, public participation, decision support, and computer technology in spatial modelling and visualization need to be integrated. This paper presents the results of a literature review of public participation and decision-support methods, with emphasis on case study examples in participatory decision support. These suggest that emerging methods, such as public multicriteria analysis of alternative forest management scenarios and allied tools, may lend themselves to public processes addressing sustainability criteria and indicators. The paper develops a conceptual framework for participatory decision support to address the special needs of SFM in tactical planning at the landscape level. This framework consists of principles, process criteria, and preliminary guidelines for designing and evaluating SFM planning processes with community input. More well-documented studies are needed to develop comprehensive, engaging, open, and accountable processes that support informed decision making in forest management, and to strengthen guidance for managers. </jats:p>",

However, for many highly diverse countries, this information is not available. Here we present the methodology and the results of the three‐part construction of a conservation planning database in Colombia: (1) the actual distribution of the ecosystems; (2) their original‐potential distribution, which is important to calculate fixed targets for conservation; and (3) the chorological types, which are groups of spatial related ecosystems that account for biodiversity process that operate at larger scales. The procedure consists of integrating the results of the interpretation of satellite images, and the construction of ecological diagrams and biogeographical regions. The limits of the original‐potential ecosystems in the transformed landscapes can either still be seen on the images or are reconstructed on the base of the information from the ecological diagrams. The chorological types are constructed by clustering of ecosystems on the base of the shared boundary length. The implementation for Colombia resulted in maps of 337 ecosystems and 63 chorological types. This database was successfully used for the identification of the priorities for conservation.</jats:p>",

This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning. </jats:p>",

One particularly intriguing, but highly elusive, aspect of this issue is the question of whether equity gaps have a regional dimension: are certain regions at a systematic disadvantage with respect to the provision of equity capital? In this paper, we explore this question in the context of the UK and German venture capital industries, drawing both on unpublished industry data and on information obtained from original surveys of venture capital firms in the two countries. We report clear evidence that the venture industries in both countries are spatially constituted. Despite important national differences, venture capital firms tend to be concentrated in identifiable clusters and their investment outcomes show clear evidence of spatial proximity effects; investment is disproportionately concentrated in those regions that also contain the major clusters of venture capital firms. However, how far this spatial form produces regional equity gaps is hard to determine. Venture capitalists themselves argue that they do not intentionally discriminate between regions in their decisionmaking, and many acknowledge the existence of funding and deal-size gaps but not regional gaps per se. But their perception of project risk is, nevertheless, regionally sensitive. We argue that the notion of a simple supply gap overlooks the way in which the localised form of the industry is based on a dynamic learning process in which demand and supply processes combine with their embeddedness in social networks and individual perceptions in a mutually reinforcing way. Less-favoured regions, with low investment rates, few local venture capital firms, and a dearth of experienced specialist intermediaries, may thus be trapped in a situation of both depressed demand for and supply of venture capital investment. </jats:p>",

A survey of 253 accredited graduate and undergraduate health education programs (response rate = 56%) was undertaken to gather information about planning and the professional preparation of health educators. Results revealed that planning instructors were primarily full-time, experienced, and about one half were CHES certified. Overall, 88% (113/129) of respondents taught the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, and 62% (81/131) taught the planned approach to community health (PATCH) model. Few planning differences were found at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Content analysis of 56 course syllabi revealed that 80% (45/56) required students to complete a program plan proposal or document as the culminating project for the course. Implications for teaching, research, and practice are discussed. </jats:p>",

Some species will persist only if they can colonize new areas, although in some cases their dispersal abilities may be very limited. To address this problem we devised a quantitative method for identifying multiple corridors of connectivity through shifting habitat suitabilities that seeks to minimize dispersal demands first and then the area of land required. We applied the method to Proteaceae mapped on a 1‐minute grid for the western part of the Cape Floristic Region of South Africa, to supplement the existing protected areas, using Worldmap software. Our goal was to represent each species in at least 35 grid cells (approximately 100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) at all times between 2000 and 2050 despite climate change. Although it was possible to achieve the goal at reasonable cost, caution will be needed in applying our method to reserves or other conservation investments until there is further information to support or refine the climate‐change models and the species' habitat‐suitability and dispersal models.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

The treatment planning systems at the two institutions were connected and videoconferencing units were installed. We explored the feasibility of remote treatment planning, supervision, second opinions and education. Tests involved two dummy cases and six patients. Remote simulation procedures were carried out for five patients. A cost-minimization analysis was performed. Treatment planning was not completely successful as the software could not handle plans including bolus or weighting between the fields. Remote supervision was possible. A common patient record and radiotherapy system, including digital imaging, digital prescription and approval forms and digital signature, were felt to be desirable. The threshold (break-even point) comparing the costs of telemedicine with those of transportation by air was 12 patients/year. Telemedicine in radiotherapy appears to be feasible, but some limitations must be overcome. </jats:p>",

However, accessing the point of deposition and manipulating the direction of deposition require a coordinated control of two kinematical systems; one is related to the deposition platform, whereas the other is related to the deposition head.

To avoid errors in the preparation and execution of hip surgery, reliable correction of the magnification of the projected hip is a prerequisite. So far, no validated method exists to accomplish this. We present validated geometrical models of the x‐ray projection of spheres, relevant for the calibration procedure to correct for the radiographic magnification. With help of these models a new calibration protocol was developed. The validity and precision of this procedure was determined in clinical practice. Magnification factors could be predicted with a maximal margin of error of 1.5%. The new calibration protocol is valid and reliable. The clinical tests revealed that correction of magnification has a 95% margin of error of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp4293-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp4293:mp4293-math-0001\" /> to <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp4293-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp4293:mp4293-math-0002\" />.
