When utilizing liner rotation while cementing with proper displacement mechanics, it is possible to obtain an optimum liner cement job. Employing recent tool development and cementing techniques with proper displacement mechanics will result in more successful primary liner cement jobs. This paper presents an improved liner cementing technique. State of the art equipment, its historic development, design, and recommended procedures are discussed. Theory, test results, and field experience of displacement mechanics are combined to illustrate the relative importance of proper planning to displace drilling mud from the annulus.</jats:p>",

The results for the voice initiation times indicated that advance planning of the whole utterance occurred, whether it was one sentence or more than one. While the number of finite (surface) clauses added to planning time, the number of basic (deep) clauses did not. Probability of pausing during the output was highest at sentence boundaries, and finite clauses were preceded by pauses more often than basic clauses. Since the probability of pausing was determined largely by the degree of linguistic integration of the succeeding unit with the preceding one, the pauses appeared to have primarily a rhetorical rather than a planning function. In demonstrating considerable pre-planning and the importance of the finite clause, the results differed from those obtained in spontaneous speech situations, presumably because of the reduced cognitive and semantic processing load. </jats:p>",

Hence, to meet its financial requirements, a hospital is forced to shift more of the financial burdens onto its private patients. This procedure has contributed to double digit inflation in hospital prices and to proposed federal regulation to control the rate of increase in hospital revenues. In this regulatory environment, we develop nonlinear programming pricing and cost allocation models to aid hospital administrators in meeting their profit maximizing and profit satisficing goals. The model enables administrators to explore tactical issues such as: (i) studying the relationship between a voluntary or legislated cap on a hospital's total revenues and the hospital's profitability, (ii) identifying those departments within the hospital that are the most attractive candidates for cost reduction or cost containment efforts, and (iii) isolating those services that should be singled out by the hospital manager for renegotiation of the prospective or “customary and reasonable” cap. Finally, the modeling approach is helpful in explaining the departmental cross subsidies observed in practice, and can be of aid to federal administrators in assessing the impacts of proposed changes in the Medicare reimbursement formula. </jats:p>",

The evaluative process was found to be the most successful, followed by the historical model and off‐the‐shelf processes. Nova and search processes had the least success. Contextual factors, such as time pressure and resources available, were included in the analyses to identify conditions of use for each process type. In situations where time pressure was high or the planning concerned services, the off‐the‐shelf model produced the best results; in situations where time pressure was low or the planning concerned internal operations, the historical model produced the best results.

Blind application of library technology is considered themain reason for the failure of library education programs in someMuslim World countries. A balance of application, in accordance withthe four principles, is recommended.IntroductionI. The Muslim WorldWhat is meant by the phrase “the Muslim world” is those countrieswhich have a high percentage of Muslims compared to non-Muslims.The Muslim World is a part of what is called “less developed countries,”“developing countries,” the “Third World,” or the “South.” The phases areused to refer to those countries-including the Muslim world-which areless advanced in technologies due to the existence of many factors, someof which are: ...</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Apart from occasional anecdotal observation, there has been little systematic study of the patterns of local inflation. The strongest theoretical argument is that local price inflation should be no different from national inflation. Alternatively, it has been suggested that spatial price equilibrium is implausible and that spatial price interdependence is more likely. Quarterly data for some sixteen large US urban areas over the period 1950–1980, are analyzed via stochastic time-series models. It is concluded in this paper that, although inflation does vary, if only slightly, between cities and with respect to the nation, in some instances national inflation may fairly represent local inflation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The misspecification of gravity spatial interaction models has recently been described by the author. The bias in parameter estimates that results from such misspecification appears to produce the ‘map pattern effect’ or ‘spatial structure bias’ in estimated distance-decay parameters. A further aspect of the misspecification bias in gravity parameter estimates is explored here. The severity of the bias is shown to vary in a predictable manner with variations in spatial structure. In particular, the bias is shown to be dependent upon the pattern of accessibility that exists within a spatial system. The relevant aspects of this pattern are discussed for intraurban and interurban (or interregional) flow matrices. It is shown that from an examination of the spatial structure of centres in a spatial system it is possible, a priori, to identify whether significant bias will arise in the calibration of a gravity model. Certain configurations of centres are shown theoretically to produce maximal bias. The author thus answers the question, “why do gravity parameter estimates appear to be biased in some systems but not in others?” </jats:p>",

However, the current models attempt to generalize activity sequences across a range of projects with differing objectives. They also tend to abstract project planning from its institutional context, and to make little allowance for the possibility that alternative approaches to organizational and managerial problems may be available. The article outlines a technique that facilitates the analysis of active‐organization patterns. Commencing with the classical tripartite system, a number of standard forms are identified and described. A series of observations are then offered on the organizational choices and control procedures that are available for public sector projects. The paper concludes with some remarks on the relationship between project planning and strategies for the development of indigenous institutional capacity in developing countries.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the authors introduce a method of approximating the parameter values of gravity models from measures of information or entropy associated with the observed pattern of spatial interaction. The method builds on the previous work of the authors in which parameter values were estimated in a two-stage process which involved utilising the log-linear properties of entropy models through the canonical form of entropy, together with other approximations based on Kirby's method. Here the method is elaborated by adopting a consistent set of information measures to which the parameters of the model are related and this negates the need for other approximations. The original framework is first reviewed and then elaborated through the introduction of a weighted entropy measure. The traditional family of spatial interaction models is sketched and the new method developed for each of these models. The models are then applied to various aggregations of trip data in the Reading (United Kingdom) subregion, and estimates of parameter values based on the old, new, and conventional methods are compared. The new method is demonstrably superior to the old method and various extensions through the spatial disaggregation of entropy measures are noted in conclusion. </jats:p>",

The model divides the problem into a master linear program, which generates trial expansion plans, and a set of nonlinear subproblems, which compute production cost and system reliability for the trial plan. Modifications of the original model described in the paper include a more efficient method for the subproblem computations based on the Gram-Charlier representation of probability distributions, representation of multiple unit plants, computation of upper and lower bounds on the optimal cost, and inclusion of nonthermal generating technologies. The paper also describes computational experience with the model and comparison with a dynamic programming model of the same problem. The Appendix discusses the convexity properties of the model with the modifications introduced in the paper. </jats:p>",

Through an examination of the urbanization records, policies, and performance of the lower order cities in these two countries we discuss the ‘top-down’ versus the ‘bottom-up’ approaches to urbanization strategy and national development. We conclude by discussing the nature of the differences between the urbanization policies of China and India and the transferability of the Chinese experience to other contexts. </jats:p>",

In the paper, the deterministic version of the optimum control problem with linear dynamic equation and quadratic performance criterion is briefly presented. In the model, the objective function contains an index that is regarded as representing the unemployment due to underutilization of sectoral capacity, which is minimized. The state variables are the sectoral gaps between actual output and potential (full-capacity) output; the control variables are the variations in the sectoral final demands accomplished by the government. In the empirical simulations, data from the Brazilian input-output table, built by IBGE, are used. The results show that the service and the civil construction sectors are the most responsive to policies intended to minimize sectoral unemployment, due to its wage coefficients and backward linkages, respectively. Other good reasons to stimulate those sectors are the acceptable degree of government intervention and the small consumption of imported inputs, which characterize them. Government intervention is then recommended to be concentrated on those two sectors.</jats:p>"

A range of technologies are described which utilise computer, electronic, and telecommunications equipment to produce, store, obtain, and transfer information. Economic pressures on the banks to use the equipment are considered. The influence of the organisation of banking institutions on the introduction of technology is outlined. It is argued that technological change seems unlikely in the short term to be associated with a considerable decline in employment in the banking sector, but that there could be important changes in the nature and location of work. The introduction of technology appeared initially to support the concentration of employment in the main centres of banking activity. However, present evidence and likely future trends indicate that some dispersal of banking activities from London and the South East of the country is possible. </jats:p>",

The strong components—sets of mutually reachable vertices—of each digraph are determined by an efficient algorithm. The results indicate that the broadest migration bases are possessed by a pair of Southeastern Florida counties (Dade and Broward); a pair of Chicago area counties (Cook and Du Page); the District of Columbia; and Pierce County, WA, which has a strong concentration of military installations. Several two-county Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas; the four counties of Hawaii; and most of Connecticut; as well as most of Rhode Island are found to function as migration regions. Though no contiguity constraints are imposed, the clusters—especially relatively small ones—are, as a strong rule, connected. A null hypothesis that these clusters are random can, using asymptotic approximations in this 3140-unit analysis, be rejected. Under an assumption of symmetric linkages, a systematic tendency for counties to have broad migration bases is exhibited. </jats:p>",

This article briefly reviews factors which have contributed to problems in this area including marketing and promotional practices of the pharmaceutical companies, rising drug import costs, and the unsuitability or poor quality of available drugs. This analysis is primarily concerned with policies that have emerged from efforts to alleviate such problems, to increase control over multinational drug companies, and to bring about changes in the technology transaction processes and in the pharmaceutical sector. It focuses on two cases: the regional cooperation scheme of the Caribbean countries (CARICOM) and the national-level policy of Cuba. It is shown that the CARICOM strategy has significant limitations, primarily due to its voluntary nature and lack of enforcement mechanisms for member countries. On the other hand, the Cuban approach has brought about positive effects and progressive changes, made through political commitment to achieve social benefits, and in conjunction with integrated broad reforms of the entire health system within a socialist framework. Thus, the problems and promises of such strategies are viewed in a context which emphasizes the prevailing forces of the global political economy. The lessons from this study, applicable to other developing countries, not only reveal important measures for the pharmaceutical sector, but also stress the ultimate need for strong commitment to enforce policies at the national level and for major structural changes, in order to adequately meet the health and medical needs of the people. </jats:p>",

The first level requires an assessment of the behavioral deficits and excesses of the child. The next level examines the family in terms of their behavioral skills and the impediments that occur when they implement behavior change programs. The third level involves assessing the family unit to identify obstacles to change. While many well‐functioning families may be stressed by the crises that arise in raising an autistic child, other families are predisposed to dysfunction regardless of the presence of the child.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dans son introduction et à partir du compte rendu de la littérature existante, l'auteur présente les diverses critiques des thèses de C. Wright Mills sur l'existence d'une élite aux commandes du pouvoir politique et économique des Etats-Unis. Si ces critiques ne contestent pas l'existence d'une telle élite, elles mettent en question son emprise sur le pouvoir en affirmant que sa cohérence n'est pas établie. Le travail de l'auteur a été largement consacré à la démonstration de la cohésion de cette élite par le biais de l'analyse de membres des clubs sociaux et des groupes de planification et de discussion fréquentés par cette élite. </jats:p><jats:p> La méthode utilisée était l'analyse des réseaux. Son intention était de démontrer que les mêmes hommes politiques et hommes d'affaires puissants fréquentaient les mêmes clubs en dehors de leurs fonctions officielles, confirmant ainsi un comportement social de groupe cohérent. Parmi les clubs étudiés se trouvent le \"Bohemian Grove\" et le \"Ranchero Visitadores\", tous deux en Californie. Les groupes de planification étudiés comprenaient le \"Council on Foreign Relations\", le \"Committee for Economic Development\", le \"Business Council\" et le \"Brookings Institute\". </jats:p><jats:p> L'étude présentée ici poursuit dans la même voie tout en prenant une base de données plus large (30 clubs, groupes de planification ou fondations) et une méthode d'analyse des réseaux qui fait ressortir non seulement la distribution des liens entre les individus, mais aussi le dégre d'enchevêtrement entre les divers clubs, groupes et fondations (voir \"Table 1\"). Cette méthode détermine aussi la centralité de chaque club, groupe et fondation par rapport à la population totale (voir \"Table 2\"). </jats:p><jats:p> La centralité et le degré d'enchevêtrement indiquent que les clubs sociaux jouent un rôle fondamental dans l'univers social de cette élite et témoignent d'une très forte cohésion à l'intérieur de cette même élite. </jats:p><jats:p> L'auteur termine en suggèrant d'autres pistes de recherche pour poursuivre l'étude du fonctionnement de cette élite tant d'un point de vue sociologique qu'éthnologique. </jats:p>",
