Natural, faced with this situation, had severed, options available. Initially, some discussion was given to purchasing a commercial simulator program. However, with 13 reservoirs and the time and investment involved along with the uncertainty of the final product, Natural took a different approach. Mainly, organizing data so that both trend and analytical analysis can be performed quickly and easily. With past problems of rigid data bases where data was too structured and inflexible for review, the decision was made to put as much data into spreadsheet programs as possible. From here data can be reviewed or extracted into another spreadsheet for analysis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will track data from the wellhead (type and frequency) to planning models (the final product).

In recognition of this, a two-stage approach to forest planning is proposed. This paper describes two modeling approaches or methods representing the two critical stages in planning: (1) generation of alternatives, and (2) evaluation and prioritization of these alternatives. The method for generating alternative solutions adopts a fuzzy approach, which allows for a more robust and flexible generation of alternatives. The second method enables the decision maker to examine the generated alternatives, elicit his or her perceptions and judgments, and use these judgments to synthesize a set of prioritized alternatives. A multiple-use planning problem adopted from the Shawnee National Forest is used to illustrate the methods. For. Sci. 35(2):481-502.</jats:p>",

From an analysis of market shares for annual retail sales of women's and children's clothes it was found that there are certain oscillations between the twin cities. As these oscillations are derived from the strong competition between closely-located twin cities, they are called competitive oscillations. In order to analyze the generation of the competitive oscillations, an attempt to reproduce a strongly competitive condition by constructing a dynamic model of two-centre competition was made. As the twin cities share a large part of their populations, they are under strong competitive conditions in which major retail development at one city produces an absolute loss to the other city. Therefore, the twin cities seesaw through the introduction of innovations such as large shops in order to gain a more advantageous competitive position, resulting in competitive oscillations between them. This finding implies that the introduction of innovation to centres is a competitive device in the medium-term and is consistent with the view that the diffusion of innovation is closely related to the competitive process. </jats:p>",

The proposition that high-technology industry is responsible for the polarization of work forces is operationalized and statistically assessed in this paper. Operating from a definition of ‘high technology’ used by government agencies, a county-level analysis of the relation between employment in high-technology firms and in various higher-skill and lower-skill occupations reveals only limited empirical support for the ‘high-technology work force polarization’ (hereafter HTWFP) argument. This suggests that generalizations about the occupational impacts of high technology have been overdrawn, and that further research should focus less on extrapolating to the general case and more on examining and comparing a variety of high-technology industries and their relationships to local labor-markets. </jats:p>",

If applied to a system of discrete points in space, however, the standard potential formula with an exponential distance-friction does not convey the desired information in the case of sufficiently large distance-friction parameters. The reason for this defect is that the so-called eigenpotential is inappropriately defined by the standard formula. After reviewing the theoretical foundations of the potential index and advocating its derivation from stochastic choice theory, this paper proposes a modification of the potential formula. The basic idea is to handle the region to which the potential refers as a continuous space with equally distributed density of mass. This leads to an index with desirable limiting properties with respect to the distance-friction parameter. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The West Edmonton Mall, situated on the northwestern extremities of the Canadian Prairies, and the largest shopping–leisure complex at the time of writing, draws shoppers from all over North America and even Japan. As a privatized public space which diverts consumers from other urban areas it has occasioned much civic boosterism. It presents a fascinating set of interventions in the local social spatialization of a regional capital on the North American cultural periphery. The Mall both imposes and implies changes in the spatial patterns of everyday life, in the imaginary geography of sites of consumption in North America, and in conceptions of the world as a space of distance and difference. To draw on Lefebvre, the creation of such a space in the built environment, called a hyperspace by some, amounts both to a new representation of the spatial and to a ‘space of representation’. Building upon the work of Benjamin and Bakhtin, an analysis of liminality and carnival in the Mall's reunion of the rational and the ludic provides a critical perspective from which to evaluate recent work by Gottdiener on shopping malls. This leads to a view which pays close attention to users' resistance to the above suggestions through refunctioning and ‘hijacking’ the mall space for their own purposes. </jats:p>",

The rate at which this transition occurs will depend on the quantities of fuels available, production costs, government policies, and the choices of major producers. In this paper, we analyze the transition to nondepletable fuels, first in the context of a social planning model, then using a Stackelberg model to represent the dynamic game between owners of depletable and nondepletable fuels. We show that the pace of capacity expansion in the nondepletable sector has a strong influence on socially optimal energy prices and production rates. With the Stackelberg model, we characterize the strategy a market-dominating producer of depletable energy will use against the nondepletable sector. Numerical implementations of this model allow us to compare the socially optimal and market-determined outcomes. Our results show how a dominant depletable-energy producer can manipulate the nondepletable sector by pricing at the marginal cost of backstop output during an early phase of resource depletion. </jats:p>",

However, given their dialectic relationship, tension between production and consumption in the landscape remained. Eventually the state was called on to attempt a spatial balance, when private efforts to defend nature as personal consumption space were no longer effective. Today, as in the past, individuals, in their defense of nature as consumption space, continue to be driven toward private positions which may be antagonistic to a collective class interest in capital accumulation. Acknowledgement of this possibility is important to realize new class alliances and the revolutionary potential of consumption-based social movements. </jats:p>",

The decline in unemployment was as much the result of low average labor-force growth as it was of rapid job creation. Also Massachusetts has experienced increases in income and wage inequality, and there has been a dramatic slowdown in employment growth. The manufacturing sector is still deindustrializing and high-tech job growth has virtually ceased. Several complementary explanations are offered for these changes. First, a chronic labor shortage is constraining company expansion. Second the declining rate of growth of federal military procurement may particularly affect Massachusetts. Third, the state economy may have begun to converge on a new equilibrium structure. A shift–share analysis of employment changes during the periods 1973 – 79, 1979 – 84, and 1984 – 87 reveals that the state's competitive advantage has narrowed to a small number of business services and their associated real estate and construction activities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although shift – share is an inexpensive and easy means of making regional forecasts, its accuracy depends on the method used in forecasting the competitive component of the region. As theory is unclear as to the sign, let alone the magnitude, of the competitive component of the next period, it would be appropriate to use time-series techniques to forecast it. Unfortunately the typical method of application of shift–share results in too few data points for the application of time-series analysis. In this paper an alternative method of calculating the competitive component that resolves that problem is presented. In an empirical test of the technique, time-series methods are used to forecast the competitive series for a metropolitan region. The results are found to compare favorably with the forecasts of other techniques. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the first paper of this series of three, Harvey's ‘circuits of capital’ argument was discussed, and was linked first to ground rent theory, and second to forms of social change and crisis in advanced, Western-style economies. In the present paper these various theoretical insights are used to reflect upon the urban housing market in Melbourne from the 1930s to the 1980s. It is concluded (1) that average rent (average annual cost relative to wages), and thereby housing-related accumulation, rose virtually uninterrupted from 1932 to 1977, providing the incentive to the suburbanisation boom of the 1950s and 1960s; (2) that an extraordinary rise in average rent in 1973 – 74 (to be viewed as ‘absolute rent’) created an affordability barrier, inhibiting the ability of the housing sector to provide an outlet for speculative investment in the current ‘global crisis’; and (3) that differentiated shifts in monopoly ground rent (that is, price rises in some submarkets and falls in others) thereby became increasingly important in providing incentive for both speculative and productive investment in housing. The third paper will extend this empirical exploration to the social conditions enabling these processes, and in turn affected by them. </jats:p>",

The case of the Cambridge Phenomenon is reviewed in detail, drawing upon a range of recent research to document the scale, nature, and impacts of rapid high-technology growth in the Cambridge region, especially in the 1980s. The volume of such growth in the period 1981–84 was greater in Cambridgeshire than in any other county of Britain. The reasons for Cambridge's exceptional performance are discussed, and to conclude there is a brief consideration of policy issues arising from the region's experience, including the role of universities and science parks, of government defence and procurement policies, of local small-firm assistance structures, and of selective help to ‘threshold’ firms. </jats:p>",

In Australia, the primary mechanism for promoting TOCs has been technology parks. In this paper the purpose is to review technology park developments in Australia from a perspective which emphasises some key conceptual features of the literature in this area: Agglomeration economies of high-technology firms and firm–university interaction; the creation of new high-technology complexes; and locational factors which make technology parks attractive to high-technology companies. Three Australian case studies, based on interviews with high-technology firms, are reported. One of the key findings from the research is that if Australian technology parks are aiming to establish TOCs that exhibit a high level of interaction between the park and a host university, then the present situation in Australia is far removed from this goal. </jats:p>",

The Minority Enterprise Small Business Investment Company (MESBIC) program pursues this goal by increasing the access of minority business enterprise (MBE) to both human and financial capital. This research provides an exploratory empirical description of the regional, industrial sector, and funding-stage preferences of MESBICs. It is concluded that these preferences are largely antithetical to the formation and expansion of MBEs in growth sectors that offer the market potential for entrepreneurial takeoff. The primary problem seems to be the small size of the majority of MESBICs. Policies governing licensing requirements and administration should therefore be reconsidered. </jats:p>",

Private family planning offers easier access, greater convenience, and higher satisfaction, albeit at almost double the cost. Clinic usage is influenced by lack of a regular source of medical care and lack of insurance coverage more than poverty level per se. Clinic patients report greater patient education regarding contraceptive methods, but less general medical care during clinic visits. They are more likely than private patients to express a desire for a different source of family planning care. </jats:p>",
