Recently, communicative action, informed by Habermasian critical theory, has enlivened these ideas. The author draws on ongoing feminist debates to rethink this “public” through two conceptual devices: the social and the global. In planning, the public has always been contested, but a feminist perspective demonstrates how the discursive constitution and legitimation of the public has crucial implications for social entitlements. And if communicative action has shown how the public interest is shaped by the dialogic parameters of the public domain, then feminist contentions point to the geopolitical conditions under which participatory dialogue is possible. The author offers this feminist interrogation of the ideal of the public not with the intent of replacing it but instead with the hope that it will strengthen the everyday idea of the public. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information technology plays a growing role in planning procedures. A procedure step which has not been supported by specific computer tools up to now, is asynchronous discussions. Such discussions can occur in public participation as well as between planners during plan design. In this paper I introduce argumentation models as a way of structuring debates, and review existing tools for recording argumentation. A limited number of tools support design-related or map-related discussions. Their short-comings for analyzing geographically referenced arguments are discussed. Finally, the concept of ‘argumentation maps’ is described, which combine the strengths of rigorous argumentation modeling and detailed geographic location to support map-based discussions in on-line planning. </jats:p>",

Little field experience exists to date, however, to indicate how to implement this approach. This study describes afield project in Davao del Norte and Compostela Valley provinces in the Philippines that implemented the reproductive health approach on a quasi‐experimental basis. The intervention was designed to address clients' self‐defined reproductive needs by providing them with relevant and accurate information and services of good quality. It consisted of two components: Providers were trained in information exchange at fixed clinics, and supervisors were trained in facilitative supervision. The results presented here indicate that the client‐centered intervention was successful in enhancing service providers' knowledge and improving the content of information exchange between providers and clients. One provincial health officer has expanded the intervention throughout his province, while other provinces are interested in duplicating the model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine the potential of the World Wide Web to augment traditional urban design methods and theories. Specifically, I describe how I used new web-based technologies in a university–community collaborative planning process to assist participants and planners in visualizing a community in Chicago. Lynch's five elements of city imageability (paths, nodes, edges, districts, and landmarks) provide the underlying structure for organizing visual representations of the community. The visual images include GIS maps, virtual reality, linear and nodal movies, and still and animated photographs. I explore web interface design, graphics, and cartography to communicate urban design. I argue that the web is an effective medium to visualize a community in an interactive, associative, realistic, and accessible way that is not available with traditional media. The web enables dynamic visualizations of urban design and architectural details that enhance participants' memories of the project's spatial context. I hope that the experiences described in this paper will assist others who want to utilize the web in community planning and design. </jats:p>",

With increasing Internet access, a majority of the urban population will be potential users of urban planning systems in the near future. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analysing these systems. Our particular interest is the potential for such systems to be agents for change in attitudes and decision-making in urban lifestyles and urban policy. Our premise is that such change will come about only through widely held consensus. The building of this consensus is seen as a learning process. Thus, the construction of our methodology relies on well-established theories of learning. We also relate aspects of learning systems to the features of Internet, VR, and GIS technologies used to build models. We assess these models as virtual city models and models for public participation. We reflect on the potential of future models to build up a ‘learning society’ equipped to understand and act on complex urban problems such as sustainable development. </jats:p>",

There has been little if any consideration of how Highway Six can help redress the economic imbalance between Israel’s Arab and Jewish sectors. Land compensation is a complex process whenever expropriations take place. The development impact, which affects both private and public interests, has to take into account the differences in culture and legal status between two communities: Jewish Israeli and Arab Israeli. This article offers a set of mechanisms that, only if agreed upon in advance, could ensure a system of shared capital among all stake-holders working toward jointly arrived-at solutions and would lend substance to the concept of cultural sensitivity in planning. </jats:p>",

The Luminous Planning Table is one of the first prototypes that use a tangible computerized interface. The use of this system is unique in the design and presentation process in which, at the moment, the activity of viewing physical models and the viewing of animation and computerized simulations are separate. This ability to engage and provide an integrated medium for information delivery and understanding is promising in its pedagogical, professional, and public engagement outcomes. </jats:p>",

In this paper I discuss a framework for the design of a web-based public participation system (WPPS) that integrates Internet GIS, Internet communications, and scenario-building tools. The design framework is based on a taxonomy that is created to describe the level of services in serving public participation according to the information content, level of user interactivity, and system functionality. The system is designed to enhance public participation in the planning and decision-making process by providing the general public with data, analysis tools, and a forum to explore knowledge, express opinion, and discuss issues. The unique feature of the WPPS using Internet GIS is that it provides users not only the option of evaluating, commenting, and selecting alternatives, but also the capability of forming their own alternatives. I also discuss system components and design issues in the WPPS. </jats:p>",

Dramatic increases occurred, however, among women younger than 25 who entered their reproductive period after the end of the state socialist period. This finding suggests that contraceptive gains in the country will come largely as a cohort‐replacement process. From these data, no separate program impact appears for special clinics established to provide direct, subsidized delivery of modern contraceptives to women in selected cities. The special clinics opened in cities where contraceptive use was already above the national average. During these five years, other cities lacking special clinics managed to gain in prevalence of modern contraceptive use, leaving a relatively homogenous urban‐rural difference in levels of use throughout the country.</jats:p>",

Most municipalities submit plans; the majority adopt plans that are consistent with state goals. Voluntary planning may therefore constitute a viable alternative to planning mandates if states offer incentives and assistance. The research finds little evidence that higher status municipalities are more likely to plan, casting doubt on the hypothesis that planning is driven by exclusionary motives in Maine. Municipalities’ planning actions correlate more consistently with indicators of their residents’ attitudes about property rights. </jats:p>",

However, such organizations are largely inexperienced at implementing formal partnerships with other groups, leading to a potential for significant conflict. The article presents the case study of three small community-based organizations and illustrates the rather unexpected result that even with high degrees of interagency conflict, collaboration can result in highly effective programmatic outcomes. </jats:p>",

The results suggest that, although neither the school nor the home appears to influence whether boys engage in sex prior to marriage, for girls, a school characterized by a gender‐neutral atmosphere appears to reduce the risk of their engaging in premarital sex. Furthermore, although policymakers in Kenya are clearly concerned with the problem of “schoolgirl pregnancy,” the data indicate that in this sample, pregnancy is not the primary reason that girls leave school.</jats:p>",

This study provides evidence from the Santa Barbara project in southern Brazil showing how vasectomy was introduced into the municipal health system. It demonstrates that once the necessary operational and quality‐of‐care improvements were in place, and sufficient political and technical support existed to proceed, it was possible to establish low‐cost, well‐used, and sustainable vasectomy services free of charge. The findings show that careful attention to the development of strong technical competence and an informed choice process resulted in high user satisfaction. Focus‐group discussions with men who underwent vasectomy indicate that they had no objection to being served in the context of a women's health center and that they act as opinion leaders who draw an increasing clientele to the service.</jats:p>",

The main objective of the study is to assess whether the young people exposed to a peer educator gained greater knowledge and practiced more protective behaviors than did those in the control community and those who were not exposed. During the 18‐month intervention period, the peer educators were able to reach a large number of young people, specifically those who were sexually experienced and in need of reproductive health information. Multivariate analyses indicate that contact with a peer educator is statistically significantly associated with greater spontaneous knowledge of modern contraception, the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections, and greater use of modern contraceptives, including the condom. In the absence of a peer‐education program, current contraceptive use in the intervention community would have been significantly lower.</jats:p>",

This network aims to contribute to the health of the region's human and natural environments through facilitating partnerships among individuals and organizations that are already working toward this goal. Initiated at a time when cooperation, public learning, and information sharing increasingly depend on digital information technologies, this effort represents a turn away from earlier attempts to create centralized data sharing systems toward a more people-centered and project-centered approach. After introducing the Gulf of Maine Environmental Information Exchange and its region, particular projects will be described, along with the on-line technologies that are being applied including those related to digital mapping. A description of the purposes of the Information Exchange follows, with details about a network organization which is being shaped based on principles that have emerged through participant interactions. Public participation GIS and the community-based fisheries management movement are presented as examples of participatory governance that have contributed to discussions within the Information Exchange. We conclude with a summary of the accomplishments of this network building process and the challenges its participants recognize at this time. </jats:p>",

This is a significant challenge and librarians need the practical skills and the vision to implement such projects in a controlled and manageable fashion. This article describes the key issues in project planning for managing a digitisation project covering the key areas of identifying the vision and the risk management in such technology‐based projects. This article also considers the implementation issues and costs associated with digitisation projects.

In the studies that have looked at the linkage between the environment and the strategic planning process, the strategic planning process has been treated like a black box. The literature does not delve into the box and examine the linkage between the environment and the characteristics (components and context) of the strategic planning process, but rather it has only looked at a simple relationship between the environment and this entity called the strategic planning process. It is this omission that is addressed in this study. This paper suggests that there is a need to open the black box and examine the relationship between the characteristics of the strategic planning process and the external environment of the organisation.</jats:p>",

At one level of access, we can study this recycling particularly clearly in a language such as Esperanto, whose speech community has a strong global norm and much weaker local norms, unlike English or French. The present note empirically examines the issue in the strategically convenient context of domestic Esperanto use, working from a recent compilation by Lindstedt et al. But a deeper version of the problem of recycling merits analysis in general linguistics, a point developed in the conceptual parts of this note. The author argues that word-meaning recycling reflects the same fundamental principles as sentential recursion, and that a linguistics theoretically sensitive to these principles strengthens practical efforts towards the social goal of an open speech community.</jats:p>",

Proteus is a fused deposition modeling system that extrudes a thermoplastic in beads through a nozzle. Determines within each layer of the layered manufacturing process, the material deposition paths as well as the regions where local structures are required to support these paths. Computes the paths with the goal of reducing the amount of supports needed to build the physical prototype of the part by taking advantage of the two novel manufacturing techniques of shelving and bridging that had been developed previously. The path planning algorithms presented are designed to utilize the above techniques and address the variety of conditions that appear in practice allowing the Proteus system to “build in air”.</jats:p>",

Management has recently been enticed to look toward these new information technologies and philosophies of manufacturing for the key to survival or competitive edges. Although there is no shortage of glowing reports on the success of ERP installations, many companies have tossed millions of dollars in this direction with little to show for it. Since many of the ERP failures today can be attributed to inadequate planning prior to installation, we choose to analyze several critical planning issues including needs assessment and choosing a right ERP system, matching business process with the ERP system, understanding the organizational requirements, and economic and strategic justification. In addition, this study also identifies new windows of opportunity as well as challenges facing companies today as enterprise systems continue to evolve and expand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There is growing concern about the spread and influence of English worldwide. In Cyprus, the influence of English on the Greek Cypriot dialect has attracted much interest in recent years, becoming the subject of frequent media attention and, at times, creating acrimonious public discussion. While some people have reacted mildly to this phenomenon, others express strong views, seeing the ‘influx’ of foreign words as a ‘linguistic invasion’ that ‘contaminates’ their language, and referring to the ‘suppression’ of the Greek language by English. Such ‘protectors’ of language warn of a colonialist ‘dominance’ of English in the lives of Cypriots. This paper (a) examines concerns and fears that were expressed recently about the influx of English loanwords in Cypriot Greek and in general the influence of English in Cyprus and (b) reviews papers presented at a conference held in 1992 that dealt with the dominance of English and the ‘suppression’ of Cypriot Greek.</jats:p>",

Komence la celo estis esplori la motivojn por elekto de unu internacia lingvo inter la ekzistantaj kandidatoj, inkluzive de Esperanto, Ido, kaj Latino sine flexione. Tamen, pro la influo de eminentaj usonaj kaj eŭropaj lingvistoj, precipe Edward Sapir kaj Otto Jespersen, la esplorprogramo reorientiĝis, unue al komparado de komunaj trajtoj de okcidentaj lingvoj, poste al la kreado de nova interlingvo, Interlingua.

In Hong Kong, the reuse of shopping bags is a common phenomenon. What are the important reasons for consumers to use and reuse shopping bags? What are the usage frequencies of different kinds of shopping bags? There are no published studies relating to shopping bags, therefore, this exploratory study aims to provide an initial insight toward consumer perceptions of shopping bags. After qualitative work, a survey consisting of a total of 200 personally‐administered questionnaires was conducted at a selection of Hong Kong’s Mass Rapid Transport (MRT) stations in Hong Kong. The target sample included males and females aged 15 or over, with an equal distribution of each gender. The findings indicated that the majority of interviewees would like to use and reuse paper shopping bags rather than plastic shopping bags. In addition, the interviewees desired different attributes from paper shopping bags when compared with plastic shopping bags. Finally, the relationship between the duration of keeping a shopping bag and the frequency of reusing the same bag is identified.</jats:p>",

This policy was meant to provide equal status to the indigenous languages and promote their use in power domains such as education, government, media and business. However, recent studies show that English has been expanding its domains at the expense of the other ten languages. At the same time, the expanded use of English has had an impact on the varieties of English used in South Africa. As the number of speakers and the domains of language use increase, the importance of Black South African English is also expanding. The purpose of this paper is to analyze current studies on South African Englishes, examining the way in which expanded use and domains for BSAE speakers will have a significant impact on the variety of English which will ultimately take center stage in South Africa.</jats:p>",

In an attempt to provide some answers to this question I juxtapose three different modes of exploration and evidence: discussion of contemporary experiences of subjection as narrated by members of the Latrobe Valley community, analysis of historical documents that represent moments when specific forms of subjection first became embedded in practices of governmentality in the Valley, and speculations on the relations between being and becoming by social theorists Judith Butler and William Connolly. An analysis of selected techniques of governmentality affords some insights into how the Economy became the ultimate ‘real’ in the Valley whereas the Region has always figured as a ‘construction’. And encouraged by Butler's and Connolly's work on the possibilities and politics of becoming some glimpses of new regional economic becomings are caught. </jats:p>",

In comparison, the other group contained “experienced” firms, having at least limited experience in these same markets (EXP). The findings suggested that over the two years of the study, differences existed between the two groups’ strategies. Newcomers to the markets used their first visit to: establish market presence through agents; gain access to business networks; and obtain an understanding of the functioning of the market. For exporters who had already visited the market, these visits were a means to: expand the span of their activities in the market to new networks; and strengthen their presence in previously established networks. The longitudinal methodology employed offers a contribution to knowledge at the public policy/ international entrepreneurship interface by expanding on earlier studies that have been restricted to single timeframes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Group autonomy is often invoked as a tool to accommodate linguistic diversity and remedy potential conflicts in multilingual societies. This article analyses two different models of autonomy — namely the territorial and personal models — and assesses their ability to adequately respond to demands of linguistic recognition. Each model offers a mechanism for drawing internal boundaries within a given state in a way in which diverse linguistic groups can coexist. But while the territorial model draws internal boundaries in terms of concrete geographic lines, the personal model defines internal boundaries within a state in terms of more abstract lines of identity and group-membership. Analysis of the two models shows that although both models have strengths, they also have limitations. This creates a need to look for ways of integrating the two models such that they complement each other and overcome the limitations inherent in each. But the tension between the two models presents a challenge. As a solution, an asymmetrical integration, which gives precedence to territorial autonomy and supplements it with the personal model, is proposed.</jats:p>",

In the present study, power transformation is used to normalise the weekly rainfall data and then normal distribution is used to predict the minimum assured rainfall at different probability of exceedance in all weeks of the whole year. In addition, probability of occurrence of different amount of rainfall in various weeks has been estimated. The study reveals that chances of drought are more at critical growth stage of paddy and there is a scope for in-situ moisture conservation and runoff collection in tanks for supplemental irrigation. Rabi crop is found to be grown under moisture stress. Probable values of I-day maximum rainfall are predicted by power transformation and the values are seen to decrease from 144.7 to 48.1 mm as probability of exceedance increases from 5 to 95%.</jats:p>"

Owing to seasonal demand, the industry builds up stock in winter to meet the high demand in summer. As concrete products are heavy and vary in shape and size, proper stocking in terms of layout and methods of stocking of products on the yard is essential. Industrial practice suggests that stockyard space management gets less attention during strategic and budget planning as it is left to the stockyard manager. The industry experiences space congestion for both the storage and dispatch of products. During dispatch process, greater retrieval time is required, long queues of lorries (shipping vehicles) are formed and desired level of service cannot be maintained. Presents a review of stockyard operations, analysis of parameters affecting loading and dispatch process on the yard and strategies to optimise the stockyard layout. It is expected that proper layout planning will reduce the cost of delivery of products by 5‐10 per cent in the industry where profit is less than 5‐8 per cent.</jats:p>",

Specifically, I contrast how modernist-influenced theory treated surfaces with how some architectural theorists today are beginning to think about them. Whereas modernist theory saw surfaces as dedicated to the expression of interior volume, recent interactive technologies such as ‘smart walls’ mean that surfaces no longer are fixed but can, instead, be changed in ways that are beyond the control of the architects who designed the structures of which they are a part. This means that surfaces are much less predictable and much more subject to transformation by individual users than in the past. Such a technological revolution, I argue, is ‘de-authorizing’ architecture as it is understood in conventional, professional, and disciplinary terms, and is bringing about new conceptions of time and space in architectural practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Professional structure and its relations to certain social fields is an underdeveloped topic of research. A common understatement is that new eras require new professions, that is, when fields change the professional structure also changes. In some cases, the statement might be correct, but this common-sense understanding has little theoretical or empirical support. It ignores the fact that professional structures sometimes actually remain unchanged for long periods, even though the related fields have developed, or vice versa. Nor does it take into account that the knowledge base of the professions can be modified to suit new requirements. Moreover, it seems to underestimate the opportunities for professions to take part actively in field definition. In this paper, a conceptual framework is proposed to enable an analysis of professional structures and their relations to social fields. The professional structure is defined as the composition of professional groups and the power relations between them. The social field is defined as an institutionalized power area comprising actors and institutions struggling for influence. Swedish urban planning offers an excellent case for illustrating the theoretical and methodological findings in the paper. It is concluded that the field of urban planning has changed in some respects, but not fundamentally. The professional structure, on the other hand, has shifted dramatically. The variation in jurisdictional claims and influence can explain why the structure has developed in the ways it has. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is now commonplace to assert that the contemporary discursive landscape is strewn with an abundance of environmental narratives. Yet these stories about nature seldom speak of the material geographies that link practices of postindustrial consumption to often-distant spaces of commodity supply. A postscarcity narrative in which the availability of natural resources no longer poses a limiting factor on economic growth, therefore, characterizes the current period. In this paper I examine how these narratives of ‘resource triumphalism’ construct the nature of commodities and the places that supply them. Using a range of sources, I illustrate how extractive spaces are constructed through a discursive dialectic which simultaneously erases socioecological histories and reinscribes space in the image of the commodity. The paper advances the claim that, despite their apparent marginality in narratives of postindustrialism, primary commodity-supply zones play a key role within broader narratives about modernity and social life. I draw on Hetherington's reworking of the concept of heterotopia to argue that commodity-supply zones be considered contemporary ‘badlands’, marginal spaces in and through which broader processes of sociospatial ordering are worked out. By examining the geographical imaginaries associated with mineral extraction, I demonstrate how contemporary discourses of commodity-supply space facilitate the material practices through which such ordering occurs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although it is widely accepted that urban housing markets are too complex to be described by unitary market, equilibrium models, the role of submarkets has not been embraced in applied research. In this paper it is argued that this is unsurprising and can be traced to the failure to establish a theoretical or empirical basis for submarket modeling. I note that, throughout the housing economics literature, the term ‘submarket’ is subject to a range of definitions; the means of identifying submarkets has varied; empirical analyses have employed differing tests; and case studies have focused on a range of different cities and different time periods. This inconsistency has prevented the development of a coherent analytical approach. By using data from the Glasgow housing market a range of alternative definition and identification schemes are compared. The evidence suggests that submarkets are important and that, rather than being based exclusively on the similarity of property characteristics or geographical contiguity, the dimensions of housing submarkets are determined by both spatial and structural factors simultaneously. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Declarative problem solving, such as planning, poses interesting challenges for Genetic Programming (GP). There have been recent attempts to apply GP to planning that fit two approaches: (a) using GP to search in plan space or (b) to evolve a planner. In this article, we propose to evolve only the heuristics to make a particular planner more efficient. This approach is more feasible than (b) because it does not have to build a planner from scratch but can take advantage of already existing planning systems. It is also more efficient than (a) because once the heuristics have been evolved, they can be used to solve a whole class of different planning problems in a planning domain, instead of running GP for every new planning problem. Empirical results show that our approach (EVOCK) is able to evolve heuristics in two planning domains (the blocks world and the logistics domain) that improve PRODIGY4.0 performance. Additionally, we experiment with a new genetic operator—Instance-Based Crossover—that is able to use traces of the base planner as raw genetic material to be injected into the evolving population. </jats:p>",

In 1993 the Hong Kong Government implemented a methodology for capital cost estimating using risk analysis (ERA) in its public works planning. This calculated amount replaces the pre‐1993 contingency allowance, which was merely a percentage addition on top of the base estimate of a project. Adopts a team approach to identify, classify and cost the uncertainties associated with a project. The sum of the average risk allowance for the identified risk events thus becomes the contingency. A study of the effect of ERA was carried out to compare the variability and consistency of the contingency estimates between non‐ERA and ERA projects. The preliminary results of a survey showed a highly significant difference in variation and consistency between these groups. This analysis indicates the successful use of the ERA method for public works projects to reduce unnecessary and exaggerated allowance for risk. However, the contingency allowance for ERA projects was also considered high. Adds data from the UK with descriptions of 41 private sector projects which fall into the non‐ERA category and reflect better performance in the determining of contingency allowances.</jats:p>",

It then investigates the establishment of the use of Greek after the enactment of Law N.67/1988 brought the reversal of the linguistic situation. The law, which aimed at putting into action the provisions on language of the 1960 Constitution of the Republic of Cyprus and at safeguarding the use and protection of Greek, derived from Hellenocentric tendencies and its ultimate purpose was to foster Greek ethnic identity rather than to enhance the identity of the state of Cyprus. The above observations are illustrated in the analysis of the legislation on language in the courts, the linguistic situation in the judicial proceedings, and the court verdicts/judgments pertaining to language use. Finally, the article draws parallels between Fishman’s ‘nationism’ and ‘nationalism’ and the Greek-Cypriots’ language selections and identity orientations.</jats:p>",

The paper has two main aims: first, to review developments in neighbourhood regeneration policy and, second, to assess New Labour's third way in respect of neighbourhood regeneration. The paper is in four main parts. The first provides a broad-brush review of the New Right approach to neighbourhood regeneration in the form of the Thatcher and Major governments. This provides the point of departure for the second part, which discusses the Blair government's neighbourhood regeneration policies in terms of policy change or continuity in four substantive areas: welfare policy, housing policy, regeneration, and the institutional context for regeneration. The third part identifies some of the key themes in New Labour's approach and the final part draws some overarching conclusions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent academic discourses pertaining to a ‘new regionalism’ in economic development and territorial representation, in parallel with the constitutional restructuring of certain nation-states, have done much to revive a widespread debate about regional change. Although cautiously welcoming this, the authors raise a concern that much contemporary reasoning has a tendency to conceal fundamental questions relating to political struggle and the contested social and cultural practices through which societies assume their regional shape. They contend that the geohistorical approach of Anssi Paasi, a distinguished proponent of the ‘new regional geography’, can help to unravel the culturally embedded institutionalisation of regions and thereby advance a meaningful understanding of regional change. Paasi's reconstructed geography of regions is then deployed to analyse a series of struggles to construct ‘the North’ as a fully institutionalised territory within the political and cultural landscape of Britain. The paper concludes with some thoughts on how to practice a re newed geography of regions in the hope of sparking a more imaginative regional cultural politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing upon a recent Council of Europe conference on markets and social solidarity and related interviews with financial industry elites on the prospects for pan-European pensions, this paper sets out the code words used to describe the ‘new’ Europe. After a century of enormous destruction and fragmentation, those now wishing to join Western Europe look towards the institutions of the European Union with hope and ambition. In doing so, the language of vision has become an essential reference point in understanding contested futures. In this context, elites are particularly self-conscious about their use of code words. These code words are especially relevant to issues such as the expanding geographical borders of Europe, the value and practice of democracy, and the apparent threat posed by Anglo-Saxon financial markets to continental nation-state social contracts. In large part, the paper is an exercise in documentation—identifying defining and explaining the contested status of selected code words I believe to be important in the European project. But the paper is also quite contentious, theoretically speaking. In order to explain the significance of these code words, the paper begins with the relationship between words and concepts in the context of arguments by Fodor and Jackson. Here, a way is threaded between those who see words as the essence of political ideas, and those who believe words are simply the reflection of a robust material world. Political concepts are disputed, especially their relationships to one another and their place in specific institutional and geographical settings. To do so requires explaining how and why my approach goes beyond Raymond Williams's Keywords. In conclusion, implications are drawn with respect to the current debate over the likely long-term impacts of territorial incorporation for Western Europe. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author examines the role of workforce development—in the form of skills upgrading and training—in integrating and embedding foreign direct investment (FDI) in the economy of Wales. He finds that by far the most important deciding factor in choosing Wales as an investment location is the availability of the government grants and subsidies that facilitate the initial location process. If this assistance were not available then the majority of FDI projects would not be attracted to Wales. The perception during the location decisionmaking process by potential FDI plants of the availability and quality of skilled labour in Wales is good compared with that of other potential regions. However, upon locating it appears that there is a significant shortfall between this perception and the actual quality of skilled labour available. Although the large majority of FDI plants utilise ‘aftercare’ training and skills-development initiatives facilitated by regional institutions and agencies the programmes in place in Wales are not always of the standard required by inward investors. The author finds that training budgets are significantly higher among FDI companies in Wales than comparably sized businesses in the United Kingdom as a whole, indicating that their contribution to regional workforce development has been underemphasised. It is concluded that, despite some recent restructuring, inward investors in Wales have attempted to act as ‘local’ agents, exerting an influence on and having an interest in the socioeconomics of their residing localities, suggesting an increasing degree of embeddedness. </jats:p>",

This paper reports findings from a research study which was conducted to determine the effect of self‐image congruity on brand preference and satisfaction in the precious jewellery market in the UK. A questionnaire was sent to 500 consumers of precious jewellery in five major cities of the UK. Results indicate that self‐image congruity was a very strong predictor of consumers’ brand preferences and a good predictor of consumer satisfaction. Respondents with higher levels of self‐image congruity were more likely to prefer the brand and enjoy higher levels of satisfaction with the brand as compared to those with lower levels of self‐image congruity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> East European industry is making radical adjustments as a result of the transition to a market economy. After some four decades of centrally planned development geared to large-scale production for a relatively undemanding Comecon network, private domestic entrepreneurs now have access to a global market. But there are major constraints, notably through the difficulty in raising capital at sustainable rates of interest. Consequently foreign direct investment (FD1) is of crucial importance both for the restructuring of old industries and for the development of new projects with export potential. However, FD1 is highly uneven, both within and between countries, and it is important to consider the reasons for this discrimination. The author discusses the location decisions of foreign companies, especially with regard to the large urban centres which are attracting the bulk of the investment. Reference is made to urban entrepreneurialism, industrial estates and special fiscal regimes, infrastructure, and environmental quality. Although some cities are particularly well endowed, most have only limited strengths to highlight as trade-offs against deficiencies. The question therefore arises as to whether all cities and their regions can exploit their strengths—and make positive use of spatial unevenness—to restructure their industrial sectors and provide gateways into the rural areas. Here there are both positive and negative views. Optimists see good prospects over the longer term through overspill and ‘trickling down’ through East Central Europe and indeed the Confederation of Independent States, whereas pessimists doubt whether even the more successful cities can attract sufficient FD1 and generate enough indigenous small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to eliminate unemployment and deliver growing prosperity. </jats:p>",

A wider spectrum of competing stakeholders now exists and as a result corporate strategies and governance structures are subject to greater demands for transparency and accountability. In this context, reputation, of which the public relations practitioner is custodian, is now a company’s most valuable and fragile asset. To help rationalise the accountability dynamic, proposed changes to UK company law could enable a more inclusive approach to corporate reputation management through a change in definition of directors’ duties and the introduction of a non‐mandatory operating and financial review (OFR) to include intangible assets within a company’s reporting framework. The proposals are likely to be the subject of a white paper and legislation in the this session of parliament. This paper argues that by demonstrating greater emphasis on planning, research and evaluation the public relations practitioner can more effectively inform the company reporting framework and exceed the demands of accountability necessary for successful strategic corporate reputation management.</jats:p>",

Therefore, based on the results of a study involving a questionnaire survey of budgetting and budgetary control processes of 473 manufacturing SMEs in Australia, this paper attempts to provide an analysis of the impact of both financial planning and control of the sample firms on their performance.

When the Asian engineers defy their American colleagues' directives, they are referred to as ‘Asian spies’ and are threatened with dismissal. In this case, I demonstrate how these nationalist turf-battles inside a corporation are struggles over the form of value itself.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Public relations practitioners continue to lament the fact that their contribution to management is not taken seriously nor given sufficient weight. This paper examines some of the obstacles to management acceptance of public relations’ contribution to important management tasks. The paper focuses on the possibility that managers may not value public relations’ contribution because their preparation for the management role does not give them the perspective that would enable them to see its value. The paper suggests that this perspective is one which enables the complexity of the external world, the world external to the organisation and in which the organisation functions, to be imagined and incorporated into decision making. This perspective has not been developed in the present generation of senior and middle managers. The paper reviews literature relating to this suggestion, before going on to examine programmes aimed at preparing managers for their roles at business and management schools in the USA and Europe. The paper concludes that unless changes are made to the ways in which managers are prepared for their roles, they are unlikely to develop an appreciation of the perspective which underlies public relations practice, or to make full use of the potential contribution of public relations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The widespread concern in recent South African poetry with landscape and the question of what place the poet occupies in that landscape arises less as a response to the turn of the millennium than to the historical end of formal apartheid, but nonetheless marks an epochal shift in sensibility. Whereas much poetry of the 1980s evoked a sense of extreme dislocation in recent time and local space (marked by references to a precarious present of forced removal and migrancy, and unspecified, unsettled futures), some significant recent work has been marked by a desire to relocate the human presence in South Africa in terms of geological time and continental space. This generalization needs to be qualified by reference to racial and political positioning within South Africa, and in this paper I distinguish between the work of committed white writers such as ex-political-prisoner Jeremy Cronin (now Secretary of the South African Communist Party) and Barry Feinberg (now curator of the Mayibuye Centre), and the work of black writers such as Don Mattera, Seitlhamo Motsapi, Lesego Rampolokeng, and Daniel P Kunene. The regrounding of the human presence in South Africa by white writers such as Cronin and Feinberg attempts a radical remapping of South African cultural identity in utopianly unraced terms, while the reclamation of continental African and local South African place names by black writers such as Mattera, Motsapi, Rampolokeng, and Kunene draws attention to the material reality of a postapartheid heterotopia in which South Africa's postmodern landscape is being divided up and sold off in ways that combine a very old-fashioned rhetoric of class and space with a new/old racial coding. </jats:p>",

For Innis resource or staple economies are subject to extreme spatial and temporal disruptions that are both creative and destructive. Single-industry towns are on the front line of both that creativity and that destructiveness. They enjoy rapid growth when a new resource is found, but are equally hastily abandoned when resources run out, or prices fall. Innis used the metaphor of the cyclone to depict this pattern of staples accumulation and consequent crisis. This paper will, first, elaborate on Innis's general cyclonic scheme that joins space, time, and staples production, and second, provide a case study of the forest-industry town of Port Alberni, British Columbia, to exemplify his argument. </jats:p>",

These initiatives have established hierarchical systems of forest management planning that consider multiple uses of the forest and various aspects of sustainable forest management at different scales. We describe the systems established in Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, Russia, Finland, and Sweden. Most jurisdictions employ some form of three-level planning framework, in which strategic, tactical, and operational plans and considerations are presented with successively greater detail and spatial explicitness. However, planning scales and time horizons vary considerably, as does the level of consideration given to biodiversity and social concerns. We examine these systems in the context of sustainable forest management, raising a number of questions to be addressed in future research, adaptive management, and policy reform. In particular, we note (1) a need of new landscape and regional planning tools to evaluate the long-term and large-scale impacts of various land uses and (2) a general lack of responsiveness to global carbon and climate change concerns.

The representational has been recognized as more than just colourful rhetoric, being also a construction of reality that contains implicit understandings of how economic processes work and the corollaries of such processes in terms of government policy. Furthermore, the connections between understanding processes, making policy, and retaining legitimacy mean that such metaphors are highly political. The author explores some of the metaphors that have been employed by political leaders in understanding the Asian financial crisis of 1997–99. Two sets of contrasting metaphors are highlighted in the rhetoric of leaders in Malaysia and Singapore, respectively: in Malaysia, metaphors of colonial domination and militaristic aggression dominate; in Singapore, ‘natural’ metaphors of typhoon damage and tectonic shifts tend to prevail. These representational strategies can be linked to discourses of political power and the construction of economic policy in each context. </jats:p>",

This is done through a critical examination of the European Commission's project of sponsoring cross-border cooperation. Drawing on a case study from the Portuguese — Spanish frontier, he examines contradictions that have arisen and are mediated through an unresolved dispute concerning the demarcation of a short section of what is the longest, poorest (in terms of material underdevelopment), and oldest (in terms of relative stability) border between two EU member states. Focusing on the EU-funded (re)construction of a ruined bridge across the border, he examines the way in which the boundary dispute (and attendant Portuguese irredentism) has become enfolded within and disrupts the strategic visions of the EU Working with a mixture of historical and contemporary documents, media accounts, archival records, and interviews relating to this case study, the author reflects on and elaborates broader understandings of the spatiality of power in the EU. </jats:p>",

Coupland's essay can be interpreted as a challenging experiment with time and space. His Brentwood has various faces and they are evoked in a text that relies on a number of creative and disciplinary traditions, including cultural philosophy, social and cultural geography, new journalism, and literature. His representation of Brentwood is not only based on his personal observations, but it is also informed by three powerful cultural myths, involving notions generally associated with utopia, dystopia, and the ideal of upper class suburban life. If we are to grasp the meaning of the “Brentwood Notebook” properly, we should focus on what the text reveals about this California community and especially on how it conveys the author's understanding of that place. A close reading suggests that the tension between presence and absence, between the visible and the hidden, as well as between progress, stasis, and decay characterizes Brentwood in particular. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent decades, in most western countries, conventional transport planning has encountered growing social opposition from environmentalists and increasing scientific criticism on the grounds of its unsustainability. In some places, including the United Kingdom, the assumptions, beliefs and values (‘storylines’) about transport have shifted to some degree away from the car in favour of public and slow forms of transport. The article elaborates a concept of ‘ecosocialization’ to describe and explain the various reform pressures that have sought to reorient transport planning away from car‐dominated approaches. We use this concept in preference to the more familiar one of ‘ecological modernization’ in order to foreground the influence of embedded value systems and habits, as well as institutions and rules, on key pathways of social development. Whilst these reformist pressures and their consequences have been evident for decades, it is also apparent that in other contexts, after moments of subordination to alternative policy settings, conventional car‐dominated transport planning has reasserted its pre‐eminence. Our article explores the shifting discourses and practices of transport planning in three national policy settings, charting the contest between critiques of car‐dominated approaches and those ‘countermodernizing’ forces, especially road building institutions, that have resisted this ‘ecosocialization’.</jats:p>",

AI research has shown that in certain problems partial‐order planners, which manipulate partial plans while not committing to a particular ordering of those partial plans, are more efficient than <jats:italic>total‐order planners</jats:italic>, which represent all partial plans as totally ordered. This research asks whether total‐order planning and/or partial‐order planning are accurate descriptions of human planning, and if different populations use different planning techniques. Using a simple planning task modeled after tasks designed in artificial intelligence we tested 7–8 year‐old children, 11–13 year‐old children, adult controls, and adults with damage to the prefrontal cortex. We found that adults and older children exhibited performance on planning tasks of varying complexity which matched that of artificial partial‐order planners, and that this pattern of performance did not vary with multiple presentations of the planning task. In contrast, young children and adults with damage to the prefrontal cortex exhibited performance matching that of artificial total‐order planners. This pattern of performance did vary, however, with multiple presentations of the planning task, with the young children and adults with cortical damage displaying aspects of total‐order planning. In a further study we found that adolescents who had sustained damage to the prefrontal cortex as children displayed two different patterns of performance; when measures of reaction time were analyzed they revealed a pattern of performance suggestive of partial‐order plan representations. However, analyses of the adolescents' protocols revealed a pattern of performance suggestive of total‐order plan representations. The significance of these results to psychology, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence are discussed.</jats:p>",

An interview schedule coupled withfocus group discussion (FGD)was used in gathering the data needed in the study. Respondents were couples from the upland municipalities of Ilocos Sur. Data gathered were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively using frequency distribution and percentage. Both family planning acceptors and non-acceptors were interviewed. Results showed that both sets of respondents are aware of the benefits of family planning. However, they had limited knowledge about the facts and scientific information on family planning. Non-acceptors generally relied on hearsays which affected their perception on family planning methods. Moreover, rural couples believed that family planning methods affect the couple's sexual drive. Non-acceptors believed that sexual drives decreases to a minimal extent but acceptors believed that it increases to a great extent. This indicates the negative perceptions of non-acceptors on family planning and the positive effects that contraceptives bring in enhancing the sexual relationship of acceptors. It is recommended, then that there should be an intensive information and dissemination on family planning at the community level to erase whatever negative notions that people have about contraceptives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The incorporation of multiple imaging modalities into radiotherapy treatment planning offers the potential to improve identification of regions of pathology. This work outlines and evaluates a methodology for registration of magnetic resonance images (MRI) and spectroscopic images (MRSI) to computed tomography (CT) images, and visualization of the multimodality data on the treatment planning workstation. Volumetric magnetic resonance images were acquired during an examination prior to the initiation of radiotherapy. Registration between these images and the treatment planning computed tomography images was performed using an automated alignment routine, and was improved manually using an interactive registration tool. The parameters of the alignment were then used to transform the spectroscopic images into the same reference frame. The spectroscopy data were represented in terms of a statistical measure of abnormality, and embedded within the MRI data as overlaid contours. These images were sent via DICOM transfer to the treatment planning workstation. An analysis of the reproducibility of the MRSI contours for varying acquisition grid positions was also performed. The technique was applied to ten patients with malignant gliomas. In each case the quality of the final CT/MR registration was demonstrated by at least a 97% volume overlap. All data were reliably transmitted across the PACS network to the treatment planning workstation, and were able to be evaluated by a radiation oncologist prior to treatment planning. The median variation in contour location for a half‐voxel shift of the MRSI acquisition grid was found to be 1.4 mm. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of including functional magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging information in the treatment planning process for radiation therapy. This technique has facilitated research into uses of MRSI in radiation therapy, and we are currently investigating methods of implementing our procedure into commercial treatment planning systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To understand local government social welfare policies in large metropolitan areas, we need to pay attention to the processes by which amorphous social problems are translated into well-defined services amenable to local government structures of provision, and we need to place these processes within an interjurisdictional context that is more complex than a simple ‘city-suburb’ binary opposition. In this paper I explore the interjurisdictional allocation of responsibility for social welfare in a fragmented metropolitan region, through a case study of city responses to the suburbanisation of homelessness in Los Angeles County in the 1990s. The results of a 1991 survey of all eighty-five local governments in the county revealed wide variations in the extent to which cities acknowledged responsibility for dealing with homelessness, and in the forms of actions adopted by cities. Some city characteristics (population size, median household income, and charter city status) were significant factors affecting the level of action on homelessness. However, the variation in city action must also be understood as a product of the metropolitan context, where city officials develop welfare policies with close attention to the actions of neighbouring cities, and with a keen awareness of the opportunities for burden shifting and ‘beggar thy neighbour’ responses. Although the relative mobility of homeless people (both forced and voluntary) heightens the impact of policy disparities among cities, a similar scenario can be imagined for other social needs in a politically fragmented region. </jats:p>",

Sound ecological principles should be integrated with state‐of‐the‐art\nmonitoring and management practices. This article presents the ways in which population‐based models can\nanswer basic ecological questions necessary for decision making about remediation and restoration, and for\nmonitoring to ensure long‐term stewardship. Discussed are the uses of food‐web and\npopulation‐based models for understanding the movement of chemicals through different trophic levels.\nThree examples, including global warming, tributyltin, and monomethylmercury scenarios, are presented to\nillustrate how such models are useful. The responses of the component parts varies, depending on parameters such\nas birth, death, and respiration, as well as feeding rates, predator‐prey rates, and uptake and\nelimination rates. There are several different models available for decision making, with different levels of\ncomplexity, based on the specific hypothesis or question being asked and the amount of current information\navailable. Therefore, it is recommended to use deterministic‐based, population‐based\nfood‐web models for ecological risk assessment. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

In 1998, the state of Maryland adopted one of the toughest nutrient management planning laws in the nation, requiring virtually all agricultural operations to write and implement nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) based management plans by December 31, 2002. The nursery and greenhouse industries are faced with a complicated task to write these nutrient management plans, since these operations grow a large number of plant species utilizing a range of fertilization and irrigation strategies. A nutrient management planning strategy has been identified that will provide an assessment of nutrient loss potential from a wide variety of production scenarios, identify the specific factors that contribute most to nutrient leaching and runoff, and enable targeted best management practices to be implemented to reduce the risk of nutrient run-off.</jats:p>",

They begin by identifying a number of key themes regarding the efficacy and nature of local institutional support for the attraction and embedding of MNE affiliates. The growing interest of governments in embedding MNE affiliates begs questions not only of the rational organisation of government as a distinct set of institutions but, more significantly, of the increasingly indistinct boundaries between the state and firms. Governments adopt different stances toward MNEs, and the credibility of these stances rests crucially on some degree of partnership with MNEs at the local level. These partnerships and associated potential for oneway or mutual forms of capture highlight the increasingly politicised nature of the local state—MNE nexus. The authors illustrate these themes through a study of the relationship between local institutions and some of the most important MNEs in Wales—a ‘region’ noted for its proactive stance in the attraction and, more recently, the development of MNE affiliates. Finally, the authors offer some conclusions regarding the increasingly politicised nature of state—MNE relations at the local scale. </jats:p>",

Some 132 ‘hot spots’ were designated for cleanup and/or environmental restoration. The first phase (phase 1) of the JCP ended in 1997. Analysis of environmental monitoring data from participating states indicate that the first phase failed to meet several pollution-abatement and investment goals prescribed at the outset of the JCP. A key shortcoming of phase 1 was partners' failure to remediate and delist ‘priority hot spots’ that were emphasized at the outset and that reside exclusively in former centrally planned economies. Among key determinants of underperformance in the JCP were the partners' overly optimistic forecasts for program accomplishments. This problem obscured the real achievements of the program, including its mobilization of substantial capital and human resources for hotspot cleanup. The partners' experience offers a cautionary tale to regional environmental program designers who rely on deficient baseline data and who develop program goals with use of crude forecasting methods. </jats:p>",

The authors argue that although the immigrants acquire Hebrew quite fast, which improves their occupational perspectives and enriches their social life, the former Soviet Jewish intelligentsia’s perception of the dominant Israeli policy of language shift to Hebrew is extremely negative: in their view it resembles the Soviet policy of language shift to Russian. However, because of the success of Soviet language policy in suppressing Yiddish and Hebrew, the contemporary cultural world of Russian Jews has been mediated mostly in Russian. Furthermore, the self-identification of today’s post-Soviet Jewish intelligentsia combines the Jewish (mostly Yiddish) legacy and the heritage of Russian culture, which has been created partly by Jewish writers. Therefore, Russian Jews tend to consider Russian a more important channel than Hebrew for conveying their cultural values. The Soviet Jewish intelligentsia in Israel is striving to retain a multilingual identity: while they do appreciate Hebrew and the cultural values it conveys, they share a strong feeling that their own cultural-linguistic identity is of great value to them.</jats:p>",

Formulating a water and nutrient management process for nursery and greenhouse operations that takes both water and nutrient applications into account is very important. Many operations already have implemented improved management practices to conserve water and nutrients. For those operations that do not have these procedures in place, it will be necessary to find cost-effective ways to ensure that these operations can comply with laws, and document that they can effectively reduce the risk of nutrient movement from their operations to a minimum.</jats:p>",

When the planning problem is difficult and the shortest plan is of a reasonable length, this linear search can take a long time; to speed up the process, it has been proposed to use binary search instead. Binary search for the value of a certain parameter x is optimal when for each tested value x, we need the same amount of computation time; in planning, the computation time increases with the size of the plan and, as a result, binary search is no longer optimal. We describe an optimal way of combining planning algorithms into a search for the shortest plan – optimal in the sense of worst-case complexity. We also describe an algorithm which is asymptotically optimal in the sense of average complexity. </jats:p>",

However, it is often not clear how respondents to a contingent valuation survey allocate values when asked for willingness-to-pay amounts. In this paper, we investigate use and nonuse values for the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), an endangered species, by using a survey conducted in Mytilene, on the island of Lesvos, Greece. Using factor analysis of the survey we found five factors which described respondents' attitudes towards conserving the monk seal, which were labelled protection, moral responsibility, ambivalence, limited resources, and tourist potential. Multilevel modelling was then used to compare willingness-to-pay responses with attitudinal and sociodemographic variables. The results suggest that willingness to pay for use, option, and existence values are predicted by different attitudinal variables. </jats:p>",
