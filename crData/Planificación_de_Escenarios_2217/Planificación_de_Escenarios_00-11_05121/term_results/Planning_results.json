      "abstract": "<jats:p> As an element of planning practice, the notion of “ community” is not well thought out. The quest for community in the realm of planning praxis provokes an age-old debate, which, given the current surge of interest in community, needs to be revisited and reassessed. In this article, the author argues that planners need to detach themselves from the idea that physical planning can create a “sense of community.” The integration of the notion of community and planning is analyzed in three parts. The author first assesses how planning practice currently incorporates the notion of community. Included is an empirical analysis of neighborhood planning documents from sixteen U.S. cities. Second, she discusses why the notion of attempting to build community in planning is problematic, and she presents four fundamental reasons why this is the case. Finally, she outlines how the notion of community in planning could be used more appropriately. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This bibliography explores the body of literature that interfaces between professional land use planning and the management of waste. The author has been struggling to understand the dynamics of waste facility siting failures and the sustained public opposition that has become ubiquitous in Canada and the United States. Waste planners may have displayed a general ignorance or intellectual neglect regarding fundamental planning models and theory. This neglect may help us to understand why waste planning appears to be prone to failure. This bibliography provides some foundational readings in planning models that may help us link waste management and planning theory. A literature review was undertaken, with a focus on refereed journals. Three distinct types of refereed journals were examined: planning, waste management and environmental management. Articles were screened for evidence of six planning models as they relate to waste management, including the comprehensive rational, incremental, adaptive, contingency, advocacy, and participatory models. </jats:p>",

The approach is to use one agent to simulate the robot and a second agent to simulate the environment. Both agents employ knowledge bases and an inference engine. The rules for the knowledge bases are developed using first-order logic and the inference method is based on hyper-resolution. A weighting scheme is used by the robot to decide on the action to be taken. After enough domain information is obtained, a task planner, which is also based on rules, is employed. Simulation results validating the methodology are presented for a robot moving inside a warehouse with four rooms. In this example, the environment is initially unknown to the robot. But after mapping the environment, the robot can efficiently plan tasks such as moving an object from one room to another.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis article presents a model based on gravitation theory to anticipate inter-regional purchasing-power flows in the retail sector, and demonstrates how this model may be applied empirically by considering the example provided by the county of Mettmann. Unlike previous forecasting models, this model makes it possible to dispense with setting an arbitrary maximum size for catchment areas. It also enables all of the bilateral purchasing-power flows between a large number of towns or regions, and the key factors influencing them, to be investigated simultaneously. The empirical findings for the county of Mettmann appear extremely plausible. The author discusses three possible areas of application for this forecasting model: to gauge the effectiveness of city-marketing measures; to assess the effects of large (e.g. out-of-town) retail centres; and to predict the impacts of improvements to the road network on retailing in both source and target localities. The results produced by the model are in some cases surprising; the model is, however, capable of providing good explanations for these surprises.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The main purpose of this thesis is to encourage the development of bioeffect planning as an experimental tool by which means bioeffect plans may be compared with standard isodose plans. The limitations of isodose planning become apparent in many common clinical circumstances when such comparisons can be made. Most of this thesis addresses the fundamental problems of the derivation of useful biological models for clinical application and the description of tumor and normal tissue parameter values and their variability. Particular emphasis has been placed on comparing the predictive value of the models and parameters against clinical results of fractionated and continuous irradiation. A bioeffect planning system has been developed using an IGE Target computer and this permits testing the sensitivity of the models to changes in parameter values as applied to an actual patient with or without CT based plans. As a clinician the author is painfully aware of the tantalizing challenge of attempting to perceive the operation of biological systems as a whole when so many variables need to be considered simultaneously. Bioeffect planning provides a means of demonstrating some of these complicated interactions. There are many reasons why bioeffect planning has not been adequately developed. These include concerns about the clinical applications of theoretical models, the uncertainty of normal tissue and tumor parameter values and the nonavailability of suitable computer systems capable of bioeffect planning. These concerns are fully justified and isodose planning must remain the gold standard for clinical treatment. Yet these hazards must be judged against the certainties that isodose planning, in which the only variable usually considered is the total dose, can be substantially misleading.</jats:p>",

An information model for conceptual design is provided in this paper. Conceptual design is a key activity in early product development. It determines product functions, form, and the basic structure. Major manufacturing cost is committed in early conceptual design process. The model presented in this paper includes an activity model for the conceptual design process and an object model for classes used in conceptual design. The activity model sets the context in which the objects are defined and used. The object model describes the data and functions used in conceptual design and integration with process planning. The main purpose of the model development is to initiate standard interface specifications that are necessary for design and process planning integration.</jats:p>",

It can be argued that inadequacies in fail-safety provisions at the very low target failure rates now demanded, is the main reason for the near constancy of the accident rate, and the consequent increase in numbers of accidents as the world fleet grows. In the forefront of fail-safety problems is the inadequacy of its use in the management operations of crew in the modern air transport cockpit.</jats:p>",

In Germany, in some quarters at least, this proposal has met with emphatic resistance. The key (methodological) objections to this proposal reflect reservations about the extremely rigid formalisation of planning processes which this would entail (without this in itself producing any beneficial effects for the environment), and the Problems it would create for the public participation process which it envisages. In Germany no experience has been gathered to date of full plan or programme EIA; there is however already a wealth of experience available regarding the individual requirements. This article presents the results of a Simulation exercise based on application of the EIA directive for plans and programmes in the context of area development planning in the federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

With traditional optimization methods the beam directions are fixed <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> by the operator in recognition of the fact that computer selection of beam directions is a difficult problem. In this investigation, we used a hybrid‐encoding scheme. The binary encoding part of each chromosome was used to select the beam directions, and its corresponding floating‐point encoding part of the same chromosome was used to determine the weights of those selected beams. Before beginning the optimization process, we set a constraint on the number of the beam directions we wanted in the final solution. We present three examples to verify this method. These examples differ with each other in tumor sites, problem sizes, and optimization parameters. Three‐dimensional optimization results and statistical data showed that this method is feasible. We think this method can be easily extended to solve more complex target problems (such as nonconvex target problems).</jats:p>",

This paper presents a long-range planning model designed to maximize the net present value and to create continuous patches of old forest. In this model, the spatial structure of old forest is controlled by core area and edge habitats. Core area is defined as the area of old forest that is free of edge effects from surrounding habitats. The core area requirement is set to a fixed value for each of a number of time periods, whereas the area of edge habitats, which should be as small as possible, is weighted against the net present value. The model is applied in a case study to an actual landscape consisting of 755 stands of forest in northern Sweden and solved using simulated annealing. The results show that distinct continuous patches of old forest are created when both a core area requirement and consideration of the amount of edge habitats are included in the problem formulation. The cost of creating continuous areas of old forest was found to be significant. </jats:p>",

These tables are problematic, even flawed, as a guide, given the recognised broad link between pupil performance and the social and economic environment in which they live. There is continued interest in being able to contextualise school examination scores so as better to reflect relative achievement. The inherent spatiality of inequalities lends itself to analysis using geographical information systems (GIS), particularly in the task of creating context from geodemographic and lifestyle data. In this paper I explore a methodology for creating and analysing a contextual index of ambient disadvantage centred on robust normalisation of data and illustrate this by using census variables, pupil numbers, and test scores for 3687 primary schools in the north of England. Relevant census variables are interpolated using ordinary kriging with an element of smoothing so as to simulate, to some extent, the effect of school catchment areas. Key features of using robust normalisation are that variable weights can be tested and the internal level of support for an index, the weighted absolute deviation, can be calculated and mapped. This latter quantity provides a quality measure for an index. The methodology is critically assessed in relation to other recent approaches. </jats:p>",

Fifty-nine per cent attended a GUM clinic for treatment, 15% were treated at family planning clinics or by their general practitioners (GPs) but 26% remained untreated. The median time from knowing the positive result to attending GUM was more than 3 weeks in 27%. In those that attended GUM, 44% had an associated genital infection and 79% of named sexual partners were traced. As a result of the audit, a new protocol has been introduced in the family planning clinics for the management of women found to have chlamydia. </jats:p>",

Most anatomical situations, such as for prostate and head and neck tumors, are complex and can require geometries with 5–15 catheters with 48 possible dwell positions per catheter depending on the tumor volume. The manual selection of dwell positions using visual checks by trial and error is very time consuming. This can only be improved by the use of a technique which automatically recognizes and selects the optimum dwell positions for each catheter. We have developed an algorithm, termed an autoactivation algorithm, which improves implant planning by providing a facility for the necessary automatic recognition of HDR source dwell positions.</jats:p>",

We elaborate the argument that regional industrial structure and embedded social networks, rather than the multinational firm, should be the focus in the study of transnational business. The complementary regional industrial structures allow economic and technological collaboration between these two regions while the social networks help coordinate these transnational (cross-regional) collaborations. However, we seek to distinguish this account from the dominant perceptions of the role of guanxi (interpersonal relationships) in overseas Chinese business networks (OCBN). In contrast with the arguments for OCBN, that guanxi provides resources for Chinese firms to coordinate and control transnational business, we argue that the skill and competence required for technological upgrading are not necessarily guaranteed within the ethnic network. Although ethnic networks facilitate transnational business and technology cross-fertilization, it seems go too far to argue the Silicon Valley–Hsinchu connection is another version of Chinese guanxi capitalism. </jats:p>",

We utilized individual household-level census data in the United States to detect different responses between single-family housing occupiers and multifamily housing occupiers during the 1980s. We found that although the investment potential for multifamily housing was almost equivalent to that of single-family housing in 1980, multifamily structures had lost their potential by 1990. Given this change, individual households choose multifamily housing as their shelter in a market where housing prices are high. This confirms the hypothesis that, if housing prices rise rapidly in a certain location, then individual consumers who cannot afford single-family housing may try to find a new alternative that meets their financial or other household-specific requirements. </jats:p>",

This heterogeneity is clearly revealed in the studies on supply and demand at two representative outlets: thesBoss andSamtfabrikshops at the “Mecca of factory shops” situated in Metzingen, near Reutlingen (Baden-Württemberg). In addition to forms of supply which are of questionable value to regional economies, there are — as these studies show — also other types of outlet which appear to be less problematic from the spatial planning perspective. Outlets of the latter type offer high-quality products and pull purchasing power into the region. As these outlets are themselves homegrown within the region, the retail sector in the region has been able to adapt to face the challenge they pose.

This would provide vital input into future mine planning and development. The survey benefitted from 10 years of 2-D seismic experience and one previous 3-D mine survey, conducted in the Witwatersrand Basin. The seismic survey at No. 10 shaft accurately and spectacularly delineated the 3-D structure of the Ventersdorp contact reef at depths ranging from 1000 to 3500 m, imaging faults with throws in the 20- to 1200-m range. The resultant structure plans were satisfactorily validated by subsequent surface drilling and underground mapping mining operations during the period 1994 to 1996. These plans have been merged with drillhole, underground, and sampling data into an integrated mine modeling, gold reserve estimation, and mine scheduling package. The geology department now manages the planning function at No. 10 shaft, and 3-D seismics has played a significant role in placing this important responsibility firmly within the geologists’ domain. Building on the success of the No. 10 shaft survey, two other 3-D seismic surveys were concluded over mines during 1996 and 1997. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of the present paper was to measure the variation in mantle planning in Australia and New Zealand. A chest X‐ray (CXR) of a patient in the supine position with a neck node marked by wire was sent to every radiation oncologist in Australia and New Zealand. They were to mark on the CXR the lung blocks that they would use to treat this patient, assuming that the patient had stage IA Hodgkin’s disease. These marks were compared with a small sample of radiologists who were asked to define the mediastinum on the same CXR. Radiation oncologists were also asked to complete a short questionnaire about other modifications to their treatment fields and their experience with this technique. One hundred and six films were sent out and 44 radiation oncologists replied. There was a maximum variation in the placement of their lung blocks of 6 cm. Half of the lung blocks were within a 2‐cm range. One respondent said they would not use a mantle field to treat this patient. Mediastinal coverage was inadequate in at least 50% of cases. There was a very large variation in mantle field planning practices within Australia and New Zealand. For this reason Australasian Radiation Oncology Lymphoma Group has produced consensus guidelines for mantle block design. These are appended to the present paper.</jats:p>",

Their study is set within the wider debates surrounding the attempts to retheorise retail geography, and, more specifically, in the context of retail competition within interwar Britain. The specific focus is on the attempts to control large-scale corporate retailing, and the failure of such strategies. The authors also draw on comparisons with the situation in the USA and show that the British case was very different, as illustrated by the failure of the ‘Balfour Bill’. Within this context they debate a number of reasons why the attempts to regulate retailing failed in Britain. On a broader front they also demonstrate the need for further research into the complex relationships between retailer conflict and regulatory control.</jats:p>",

The first involves a contingent valuation study of mortality risk due in part to pollution-related causes, and the second, a stated preference study for valuing the reduction of risk from road fatalities. It is concluded that the approaches, and particularly that based on stated choice methods, offer practical and consistent methods of establishing unit values in higher-income developing countries. The unit values derived from the WTP methods appear to justify a greater allocation of resources to safety and pollution countermeasures compared with those derived from more traditional approaches.</jats:p>",

Written menus submitted by the facilities exceeded 67% of Recommended Dietary Allowances for age. However, quantities of actual foods served were below requirements. Individual meal components were refused by up to 22% of the children, and no meal components were consumed by more than 65% of the children. Problems in food sanitation were also identified. Results indicate a need to identify barriers that day care personnel encounter in serving safe, adequate, and acceptable meals for children.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Sweden, large‐scale recycling of wood ash to forests is considered a means of replenishing base cations, particularly Ca, taken up by the trees and removed by logging. To minimize negative effects on the forest ecosystem, slow rates of dissolution of the ash and release of Ca would be preferred. Carbonation of wetted ash [Ca(OH)<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>] can reduce the rate of Ca dissolution. In this study, field experiments were performed to evaluate carbonation of ash following application to forest soil beneath a spruce [<jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic> (L.) Karst] stand. To accomplish this, a mass spectrometric analytical method was developed that allowed quantitative estimation and isotopic analysis of the ash carbonate concentration. The dynamic range was between 0.07 and 30 μmol of carbonate, measured as CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> evolved from an acidulated ash sample, which corresponded with between 0.01 and 5 mg of a completely carbonated ash (dried) containing ≈0.30 g g<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> Ca. The method allowed spatially resolved measurements (≈1 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>) of the amount of carbonate and the <jats:sup>13</jats:sup>C/<jats:sup>12</jats:sup>C and <jats:sup>18</jats:sup>O/<jats:sup>16</jats:sup>O isotopic ratios. Following field application, ash granules (8–11 mm o.d.) increased their degree of carbonation from ≈45 to &gt;80% within 3 d and were &gt;90% carbonated after 3 wk. For the initial 3 d, the rate of carbonation, <jats:italic>R</jats:italic><jats:sub>c</jats:sub>, was estimated to be 0.70 (± 0.33) μmol mg<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> d<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> carbonate. During the field carbonation process, the outer granule layer could either be enriched or depleted in carbonate relative to the interior parts, which is suggested to depend on the occurrence of rainfall. These results indicate that the rate of carbonation of ash granule Ca in the field is rapid and probably dominates over Ca dissolution, especially under favorable conditions.</jats:p>",
