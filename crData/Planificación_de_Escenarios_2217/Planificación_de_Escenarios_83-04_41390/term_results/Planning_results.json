Much of the materials in this paper are based on absorbing works of other Muslim scholars. What I have tried to achieve in this paper is to present a platform consisting ofthoughts ofsome of the prominent Muslim thinkers of the past and the present, which appeal to me as very relevant for societal planning, and on which other Mus lim thinkers, leaders, and planners may like to give further thoughts. Whenever I have referred to Islamic tenets on my own accord,are those which, I trust, are common knowledge to all Muslims.My hopes and aspiration in writing this paper has been that Muslims by faith are members of one community; - we should not land ourselves into any controversy, rather on the contrary - this conference should serve as one of the sources of intellectual unity, and pave the way for us to forge ahead as a world community of harmony, peace, progress and leadership.\n\t\t\t</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Much of the work of Artificial Intelligence concerns the representation and symbolic manipulation of various domains. One problem shared by existing systems is their limitation to discrete states and state changes, brought about by the linking of declarative states with points in time. With this identification, models of continuous processes must forego such declarative states, resulting in a loss of decomposability that limits the amount of complexity that can be handled by a given amount of computation.</jats:p><jats:p>In this paper we develop a model for robot problem solving over a domain of continuous actions. The proposed world model consists of a vector of piecewise defined functions of time, i.e. functions that can be represented using finite sets of expressions and finite partitions of time intervals. The critical points of these functions are represented symbolically as discrete events. The goal is represented as a point through which the world model vector must thread at some point in model time. World model functions are transformed by adding events at various discrete points in time which transform the trajectories in the direction of the goal. As events are added, formulas relating the event times are added to the description of the world. The result is a partial order of events which represents a plan for “forcing” the world function to achieve the goal.</jats:p><jats:p>The relationships between this model and the classical problem-solving systems (e.g. <jats:italic>STRIPS</jats:italic>) are utilized in order to produce a planning procedure. This procedure is applied to a robot problem which can be solved using the model. We conclude by presenting an analysis and prospectus of considerations for an actual implementation of these ideas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Peter G. Scotese, now chairman of the executive committee of Springs Industries, learned about planning chiefly by doing it. Successively a salesman, sales manager, and general manager early in his career, he got actively into planning in the 1960s, when he became the chief executive officer of the Boston Store division of Federated Department Stores in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In 1969, he joined Springs Mills, now Springs Industries, as the first non‐family president in the company's history. In the mid‐1970s, he became vice‐chairman and chief executive officer. When he retired from active management in April 1982, he had become a confirmed and practiced planner, and he conducted a thorough search for his successor, Walter Y. Elisha. After Scotese's 12 years with the firm, Springs' sales had tripled and earnings from continuing operations had quadrupled. Among the other companies on whose boards he sits today, are Bell &amp; Howell, Armstrong Rubber, National Distillers, and the Dry Dock Savings Bank.</jats:p>",

Most businesses focus on their balance sheets (capital structure) and several key financial ratios that point up their financial performance and well‐being. Since investment is a significant element of many business decisions, there is usually concern with the cost of capital. Given this, it seemed that a simple model for evaluating the potential importance of business decisions might offer an efficient and consistent way of determining financial outcomes. And since capital structure, financial ratios, and cost of capital don't function independently of each other, this model would need to take account of appropriate linkages.</jats:p>",

The contested meaning, rival formulations, and uncertain status of social justice form a cloudy and dissuasive foundation. The appeal of evaluations of locational justice steers investigation towards new spatial referents for justice and the prospect of principles of spatial justice. However, it seems that in the term ‘spatial justice’ the prefix can only denote concept context and not concept content. Conceptualising space as a social product rather than as a context for society may yield a substantive concept of spatial justice. </jats:p>",

This article reviews the changes made subsequently to the formal processes and assesses how these are currently working. The planning agency is now a permanent organization. Planning and budgeting have been combined and these processes have moved closer to the centre of political power. On the other hand there are difficulties over linking planning and budgeting to the management of economic and fiscal policy; planning is geared to securing foreign aid funds; the planning processes favour large expensive projects which emerge from the more developed areas of the country and discriminate against the smaller projects with a shorter time horizon needed in less developed provinces–thus accentuating economic imbalances. Finally, although the importance of evaluation is recognized, in practice reporting and evaluation are not adequately practised.</jats:p>",

Official documents intended for public mass consumption depict nuclear war as survivable, without discussing the meaning of “survival.” Planners' internal documents show more detailed and realistic appreciation of probable effects, but survival is still imagined in predominantly physical terms, and social or psychological impact is not seriously analyzed. Attempts at planning for administration of post‐attack society present contradicting conceptions of the public: as a pro‐social “us” and an anti‐social “them.” Together with a series of elisions among such concepts as law, order, life, property, control and persuasion, this enables planners with limited imagination to assume the role of guardian of the public interest. There are potential anti‐democratic consequences for present‐day British society as plans are enacted in civil defense exercises and preparations. Civil defense planning is not just about saving lives in the future, but is also closely linked to national defense policy now.</jats:p>",
