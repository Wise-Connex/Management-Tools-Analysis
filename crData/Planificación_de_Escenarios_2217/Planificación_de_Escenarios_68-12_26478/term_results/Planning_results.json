      "abstract": "<jats:p> A critical problem, continually faced by managers in developing “effective” resource allocation plans, is that only limited partial information is available about the system under consideration on which to base these plans. This is particularly true in planning involving the limited information typically available on the relevant behavior and characteristics of large human populations. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper develops the insight that partial information—which at first scrutiny appears to contain only severely limited information about the system—in many important cases actually contains (or stores) a great deal of the relevant total system information needed for planning (or control). This insight leads to powerful methods-for retrieving the needed information about the behavior and characteristics of the total system from the information contained in the partial information data. </jats:p><jats:p> In the present paper, we illustrate these information retrieval methods by developing and applying them to partially specified media audience exposure systems to retrieve certain critical total system information needed for media planning. More specifically, partial information on the audience of a combination of advertising media vehicles consisting of only two information quantities—the sum of the individual audiences, and the sum of the audiences of all pairs of media vehicles in the combination—is shown, in fact, to contain a significant amount of the information about the audience exposure pattern of the combination that is needed for media planning evaluation. Theory and methods are developed which retrieve, from these two quantities, operationally useful information on the unduplicated audience, the average exposure frequency, and the frequency distribution of audience exposure of the combination. </jats:p><jats:p> The retrieval methods developed in this paper have been successfully applied to evaluating and developing “effective” media selection programs. These retrieval methods apply as well to management information systems involving marketing, demographic, socio-economic and related partially specified information systems in which individuals are classified in terms of the presence or absence of each of a large number of relevant attributes. In addition, these retrieval methods can be extended to retrieve additional information about the total system, where required, including the development of usefully precise single value estimates of the critical information quantities of the total system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Jewish agricultural settlement since the 1880's can be\n      characterized by two unique features: the urban, educated people settled\n      and became farmers of their own free will; and the agricultural\n      settlement was carefully planned, first on the farm unit level, and\n      later on the regional and national levels. On both of these the Israeli\n      experience is unique in that each is the reverse of the usual process\n      observable elsewhere. During the twelve years following the attain¬ment\n      of statehood in 1948 Israel absorbed successfully over 1.25 million\n      immi¬grants into agriculture, over two-thirds of whom had none or\n      limited degree of familiarity with the \"modern\" agriculture, as they\n      came from North Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. Nonetheless, they\n      became part of a highly technical and organized farming system. Between\n      1950 and 1965, total agricultural pro¬duction in Israel increased by 500\n      per cent. The productivity of labour in agri-/. culture rose at a\n      remarkable annual rate of 10.8 per cent between 1955 and 1959 and at\n      11.2 per cent between 1958 and 1963.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this short essay Professor Rahman attempts two things. One,\n      he surveys the various facets of the regional disparity existing between\n      East and West Pakistan and traces the genesis of some of them. In doing\n      so, he improves upon the analysis of others writing on the issue, yet\n      essentially the information and the treatment are not new. Two, he\n      suggests \"an approach to a policy for dealing with the problem of\n      regional disparity in the country, one which would impose the least\n      sacrifice to the national objective\". Here he applies his model for\n      \"Regional Allocation of Investment\" which was published in the February\n      1963 issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. This review will\n      mainly deal with this second part of the essay. The principal argument\n      of Professor Rahman's model runs as follows: In a short-term plan,\n      investment should be concentrated in the region where productivity of\n      capital, as depicted by a lower marginal capital-output ratio (MCOR), is\n      higher. But in a long-term plan, one should also consider the marginal\n      reinvestment coefficient (MRC) which is the product of marginal rate of\n      saving (MRS) and the reciprocal of MCOR. This is because a region with a\n      higher MCOR may yet have a higher MRC due to a sufficiently higher MRS.\n      In such a case, earlier investment allocation should be concentrated in\n      the region with higher MRC, since the immediate loss of output will be\n      more than offset by the future growth in output from higher\n      reinvestment. But as the terminal date of the plan horizon draws nearer\n      investment has to be shifted towards the region with higher\n      productivity, i.e., lower MCOR, because, after a break-even point, there\n      will not be enough time left for the higher MRC to recover the loss due\n      to lower productivity. Other side conditions of the programming model,\n      such as employment objectives, removal of regional disparity, may\n      prevent full exploitation of the advantage of higher MRC of a\n      region.</jats:p>"
