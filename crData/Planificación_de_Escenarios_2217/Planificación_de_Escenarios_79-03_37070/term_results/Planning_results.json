This attitude is often reflected by subordinates, for if top executives do not put their influence behind the planning process and create the environment to bring about order out of disorder at their own level, the tasks of lower level managers become more difficult and the planning activity ineffective. The climate usually ends up accentuating the painful aspects of planning and the average manager's chances of planning success are significantly diminished.</jats:p>",

After placing this approach in the context of other planning and decision-making arguments and schemes, an example dealing with choosing a foreign assistance policy is offered to illustrate steps involved in mathematical planning. Those steps are goal setting and weighting, establishing normatively set constraints, relating variables, determining initial conditions, and numerical evaluation of alternative policies. In the foreign assistance example, computer simulation is employed to accomplish the final step. </jats:p>",

However, when the problem is planning for an accident involving any vessel which is part of an operating fleet, the plan must be quite different. Instead of being location-oriented, it must be focused on mobilization, logistics, and people. If the people involved can be properly instructed in their roles beforehand, they will be prepared to be mobilized at the scene wherever it may be and to participate directly in a cleanup operation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper discusses in detail a plan whereby the duties, responsibilities and other activities are identified. They are then described and the overall plan is pieced together. The essence of this particular planning process is that the people assigned to various jobs know who they are, what their jobs are, what will be required of them and have some idea of the resources that may be available to them.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The plan contains job assignments, job descriptions, government contacts, contractors, co-operatives, equipment suppliers and locations, alerting diagrams, the basic organization, and a general description. The plan covers the Gulf and East Coasts of the United States. The approach can be adapted to a geographical area of almost any size.</jats:p>",

As with mechanical measures, both proper equipment and trained personnel must be available in order to employ chemicals most efficiently. This paper reviews those subjects which are particularly important to successful chemical applications, and which must be carefully considered in contingency planning. These are chemical types and their modes of action, design and operation of the equipment required, regulation of chemical dose per unit area, and the limitations (to both boats and aircraft) of a distant operations base.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Various kinds of oil spill control chemicals are likely to be used during a spill incident. Therefore, planning must also provide for flexibility in application equipment design in order to obtain the maximum service per unit. The design and construction of a portable chemical spraying system (which can be used on work boats, tugs, or other vessels of opportunity) is discussed. The adequacy of aerial spray systems is also examined in terms of required pump rates, chemical and equipment load, nozzle types and capacity, spraying time on-site, and volume of chemical delivered. It is shown that small aircraft are only useful near shore, and that (as the spill area increases) several large airplanes will be required.</jats:p>",

The effects of volume and type of oil, use of Oil Herder¬Æ or not, type, location, and time of occurrence of the oil spill, geometry and hydrographic characteristics of the river and wind speed and direction are taken into account. The model is capable of operating in either deterministic or stochastic mode. When the model is used in the deterministic mode, it predicts the path and associated land contamination of a specific oil spill as a function of time. When the model is used in the stochastic mode, it estimates the probability that an oil spill will be transported into a specific region after an accidental discharge within another specified region. In the present study the model is specifically applied to the lower Mississippi River. However, the model is general and can be applied to any river. The predictions of the model are in very good agreement with the observed behavior of actual oil spills on the Mississippi River.</jats:p>",

Data that might effect significant changes in the placement dispositions and outcomes of patients were gathered and subjected to stepwise discriminant function and multiple regression analyses. It was found that the patient's socioeconomic status and the extent of social worker involvement in disposition rather than the patient's medical/psychiatric condition, constituted the best predictors of place ment and success in placement. The model accurately predicted 90 percent of all dispositions and could provide a useful basis for assigning to placements a significant minority of patients who are not placed in accordance with the correlates of optimum placement and placement outcome as determined by the model. </jats:p>",

The review suggests that a reversal is not obvious and may simply appear as a result of a statistical artifact: urbanization which has spilled over metropolitan boundaries may simply be more of the same outward growth but would show up as a metropolitan-to-nonmetropolitan growth shift. A new data file for eighteen other developed countries is examined. These data are suitable for computations of various versions of the Hoover index of population concentration. Such calculations suggest that the eighteen countries examined are experiencing more traditional urban outward expansion. This adds to scepticism of the reversal or ‚Äòclean break‚Äô hypothesis. </jats:p>",

In their aggregate and disaggregate states the measures are practical, enabling measurement into the future and measurement with a minimum of data, but the assumptions that all nodes are potential destinations and that all origins are known severely restrict the meaning and uses of the measures. Time‚Äîspace measures of accessibility do not make these assumptions although they are data hungry, retrospective, and share with the other measures the narrow conception of accessibility as a property of the built environment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A stochastic model for the development of spatial patterns is introduced and used to investigate the process of housing deterioration in an American city. Space is treated as a sequence of discrete locations and a spatial-lag structure is incorporated in the model by defining multivalued random variables whose values indicate conditions at a central location and at a series of spatial lags. The possible combinations of these values define the states of a Markov process, and a description of this process can be obtained by estimating probabilities for the transitions from state to state. Qualitative inferences about the effects of a process on existing spatial patterns are obtained by comparing an initial distribution, for the multivalued random variables, with the limiting distribution implied by the process description. Application of the model involves selection of an appropriate random variable as well as estimation of a set of transition probabilities. Results for Indianapolis in 1977 indicate that the probability of housing deterioration is strongly associated with the presence of deteriorated structures in nearby locations. </jats:p>",

This paper remedies that deficiency by explicitly considering the mechanisms promoting viability across the spectrum of farm-size gradation. Aspects of internal and external economies of scale, interfarm competition, local comparative advantage, and spatial separation are incorporated in a conceptual framework developed for a Canadian Prairie setting (Manitoba). In addition, social and cultural influences on the farm-size determinants are monitored. An equation system is established consisting of three structural equations, one each for large farms, medium-size farms, and small farms, and is calibrated by using two-stage least-squares regression. Results indicate that regional factors tend to overshadow the indices of economies of scale, but that efficiency considerations vary according to the size of farm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper uses a joint-choice logit model of travel demand and residential location to simulate the impact of urban rapid-transit investment on housing values within a radial corridor. The model developed is a clean break with the traditional urban economic theory. Instead the heterogeneous nature of travel and location decisions is recognized and the logit model, consistent with stochastic utility maximization, is employed. Simulation experiments reveal that the aggregate increase in property values caused by transit's impact on work trips is highly sensitive to the aggregate number of vacancies within the corridor. Under reasonable assumptions, transit investment tends to lower central-city property values, to increase central-city vacancies, and to raise suburban property values. It tends to help the poor move further away from the center and penetrate the inner suburbs. Depending on several influences, aggregate property values can increase or decrease and the change can often be statistically insignificant. Calculations show that an equitable taxation (and compensation) of property-value changes may raise a small to modest proportion of a transit system's construction cost. Several considerations suggest that even these modest estimates might be optimistic. These results help develop an improved perspective on ‚Äòvalue-capture policy‚Äô which has not, up to now, benefited from quantitative analysis. Major extensions of the model are briefly considered. </jats:p>",

With increased public awareness precipitated by the required involvement in Water Quality Management Planning (WQMP), the ensuing public interest will ultimately force ground‚Äêwater issues which have been neglected for many years. The preparation of a ‚Äú5‚ÄêYear Strategy‚Äù in each State coupled with USEPA's new emphasis on aquifer protection as a priority issue will provide the mechanisms for funding ground‚Äêwater planning under 208 programs. As the cry for ground‚Äêwater management planning is adopted by the public as well as technicians, emphasis will shift and programs will develop. In addition, planning programs under 208 are usually regional in nature in contrast with the ground‚Äêwater studies in recent years which have been site‚Äêspecific, directed toward the identification and alleviation of local problems. Since the management approach requires that the evaluation of available alternatives include those mechanisms necessary to implement the recommendations, viable alternatives without either management agencies or financial considerations will not be acceptable. Therefore, the strength of the WQMP approach to ground‚Äêwater protection lies in those concepts that make planning under 208 a new breed of governmental program.</jats:p>",

Much less adequately represented are mental maps of general applicability to a diversity of specific areas. In an attempt to adduce such general rules of the cognitive organization of space, two case studies of the North American city are discussed. The first involves student expectations of land-use geography and reveals strong senses of residential segregation and the clustering of commercial land use. The second examines the social geography of the city, constructed on the basis of expectations of the social and neighborhood characteristics of four housing groups: central-city renter, central-city owner, suburban renter, and suburban owner. Although the general rules revealed are reasonable, the contribution of the central-city apartment dweller to metropolitan social geography is seen as quite exceptional. </jats:p>",

Nonpoint sources have not been defined in terms that have hydrogeologic significance. Local and State regulatory agencies have often been unsuccessful in controlling ground‚Äêwater pollution, yet the 208 approach tends to disregard the reasons for this situation.

There is a great lack of ground‚Äêwater professionals in regulatory agencies involved, particularly in the Southwest. This deficiency is paramount at high levels and in many regional offices of EPA. There are no provisions in the approach to insure that qualified ground‚Äêwater geologists or hydrologists will be involved.

The primary obstacle in accomplishing this objective is that responses of sensory groups are extremely variable making the detection of true differences in response due to treatments difficult. It was the objective of this study to perform sensory experiments so that true differences in the main effects of interest could be detected. Consequently, achieving this objective necessitated the completion of the following three facets of an exemplary sensory study. Initially, the experimenter should carefully plan the experiment so as to control variation by rigorously training the panelists and controlling the objective and subjective error components of experimental error. Secondly, the experimenter should choose a restricted experimental design which stratifies the experimental units into homogeneous subgroups and accounts for all known sources of variation. The known but uncontrollable sources of variation should be nullified through randomization. A sufficient number of replications should be run to attain the desired level of precision. The principles necessary for the efficient planning and designing of experiments are presented. Lastly, the experimenter must collect accurate data and employ theoretically sound procedures to analyze that data. A sensory experiment was conducted invoking the above guidelines which made possible the detecting of true differences in steak palatability due to cooking endpoint temperature and marbling level.</jats:p>",
