Formal planning can play as important a role for the entrepreneur as for operating management. Further, it is as vital for the success of small-scale as for large-scale projects. Experience with a number of small-scale projects reveals certain generic insights, if not unique principles, of value in applying formal methods to entrepreneurial planning for the small-scale project. Thus this paper contends that (1) Formal methods have an important role in successful planning for small as well as large-scale projects and (2) “Entrepreneurial” and “Small-scale” present a special set of restrictions and opportunities which should shape the selection and application of planning methods. </jats:p>",

The present area under cultivation in any one season is estimated at 2.6 million ha. The history of land use is described. Agricultural production has declined and land use practice has changed from annual (mainly winter) cultivation to a system of fallow land rotation. This extensive system of land use is the result of water-logging, and salinity resulting from unreliable irrigation combined with inadequate drainage. Future policy for land use is outlined. It is stressed that social and organizational aspects play an important role in the process of land use planning.\nADDITIONAL ABSTRACT: [175.567]Throughout the centuries a general decline in agricultural prosperity and an overall shift in land use practice from annual, mainly winter, cultivation to a system of fallow land rotation is noted. This extensive system of land use is mainly the result of waterlogging and salinization due to unreliable irrigation coupled with inadequate drainage. Future policy is discussed in terms of soil and water resources, farming system, cropping intensity, cropping pattern, size of the farm area, social and organizational aspects.

It is assumed that these power plants will discharge sufficient heated cooling water to make these treatment facilities necessary. The problem that is being considered is to determine the optimal planning of a treatment system. The objective of the planning procedure is to minimize the total annual cost for the construction and operation of the entire system. The constraint on this minimization process is not to violate a maximum temperature requirement within each reach or section of the river. The problem is solved by considering the effect that a bypass‐piping system has on temperatures within the river. The technique of bypass piping consists of piping waste water downstream to reaches of a river where the regenerative powers of the physical system have reduced the level of pollution to the extent that more waste water may be disposed. By noting that the bypass‐piping system allows the beginning and end temperatures of a section of the river to be controlled, a procedure can be developed for separating the optimization model of the entire system. This model is separated into a set of small subproblems that are solved by simulation and a system problem that is solved by dynamic programing. The results of the implementation of this model showed that the bypass‐piping system significantly reduced the cost of the entire treatment system.</jats:p>",

The existence of roadside survey data (for buses) and timetables (for trains) has permitted an analysis of the degree of distorted perception of in-vehicle times, waiting times, and costs. Results show that the use of objective performance data on public transport modes in urban transportation planning models needs to be questioned, as actual times and costs seldom reflect the subjective images of commuters. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a disaggregated model of urban spatial structure which combines the framework provided by the macroscale approach of social physics, to which most models developed to date belong, and the advantages derived from the use of the microscale approach provided by economic theory. The model attempts to integrate both approaches by means of the use of maximum entropy techniques together with concepts from microeconomic theory. The former provides an operational basis for the model, while the latter provides a theoretical explanation of the process. </jats:p><jats:p> At a general level the model introduces the addition of a land market submodel and a transport submodel to the framework provided by Lowry (1964). At a more detailed level the model transforms the employment in the city into economic sectors, socioeconomic groups, and income groups. This allows for the conception of the urban spatial structure in terms of a market where transactions take place between buyers and sellers of goods. </jats:p><jats:p> The disaggregated model presented here has been designed to provide a large number of variables which can be manipulated and controlled as part of policy decision making and planning analysis—this includes, for example, the normal planning controls such as density restriction and changes in the location of manufacturing, government, and agricultural employment. Also, the effect of changes in the costs of transport (car prices, fares, and routing) can be analysed. Taxes and subsidies on income, housing, and housing interest rates can be manipulated within the model. </jats:p>",

Implicit prices for housing services”, describes results for housing price indices, and implicit demand prices for housing characteristics and accessibility measures as services. This third paper contains demand equations, obtained by multiple regression, for housing services aggregated at three levels as a function of household attributes such as income, social status, household size, and stage in family cycle. Further, the paper includes a study of tenure where the real housing costs paid for similar housing by different households are calculated. </jats:p>",

The appropriate rates and ‘at-risk’ populations are introduced as a preliminary to developing the equations of the account-based model. The model is also presented in transition-rate form, which facilitates comparison with alternative models. </jats:p>",
