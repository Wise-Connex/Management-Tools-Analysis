      "abstract": "<jats:p> From 1921 through 1968, the career of Ladislas Segoe (1894-1983) paralleled the evolution of professional planning. Frequently instrumental in the development and perfection of American planning practice, Segoe was involved in all levels and nearly all fields of planning. Through widespread and successful consulting work, publishing, and public speaking, Segoe was a tireless advocate of independent, professional planning. Through the Depression of the 1930s, World War II, the problems of urban renewal in the 1950s, and the civic unrest of the 1960s, he maintained a successful private practice. That success was due to the strength of his personality, the coherence of his vision of planning as an encompassing process, consistent and conscientious follow- through, and an insistence that planners be responsible, reasonable, and honest professionals. This article examines Segoe’s career within several discernible phases that parallel the development of American planning. </jats:p>",

To this end, they contracted with many of the nation’s leading architects to create innovative designs, only to have their efforts thwarted by those preferring the status quo and opting for short-term economic gain. This article focuses on an event that ultimately led to conflict between two of America’s most forceful figures: Frank Lloyd Wright, arguably America’s most esteemed architect of the twentieth century, and John W. McCormack who, for more than forty years, was one of the most powerful members of the U.S. Congress. </jats:p>",

It begins by considering conflict and consensus-building in the environmental domain. There are a number of different approaches that have been taken to the existence of conflict over environmental issues. Such conflicts can be re-presented as issues of common interest.

Economic activity and wealth creation was associated with dirt and pollution. This was true of the factories, mines, and quarries as well as the cities where growing numbers of people lived. Human waste was another aspect of this ‘muck’. And with human waste came disease and public health hazards. The response to this was the first era of environ mental planning, focused on regulating industrial pollution and managing residential environments to remove human waste through sewerage systems and improve the circulation of fresh air. While a decline in public disease episodes provided some evidence of the success of such planning, problems of ill health among urban residents and environmental pollution persisted into the twentieth century.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of emergence has its roots in 19th-century philosophy. Today it is central to many computational systems which retain the hallmarks of emergence laid out much earlier. The role of emergence in creative design and its unique embodiment in shape grammars have been emphasized by March, Stiny, and others. Shape grammars generate emergent shapes—shapes not predefined in a grammar. Emergent shapes are not only the output of a shape grammar computation; they can be the input for further computation. The history of emergence and its characterization in shape grammars are discussed here. Different sorts of shape emergence in grammars are then distinguished: anticipated, possible, and unanticipated. Unanticipated emergent shapes are shapes not premeditated by the author or user of a grammar. Generally, unanticipated shapes require on-the-spot definitions of rules to compute with them. However, for some interesting design problems, it is possible to know in advance what to do with unanticipated shapes, and to predefine rules accordingly. Special rules for computing with unanticipated shapes are proposed here. These rules allow for processes that have previously been handled extragrammatically—outside of grammars—to be handled within grammars. Examples of applications of these rules within a single grammar and across parallel grammars are given. </jats:p>",

In such constructions, Voronoi and Delaunay concepts are used to tessellate an object space with respect to a given set of generators and then the construction is repeated every time with a new generator set, which comprises members selected from the previous generator set plus features of the current tessellation. Such constructions are shown to provide an integrating conceptual framework for a number of disparate procedures, as well as extending the existing functionality of the basic Voronoi and Delaunay procedures to variable spatial resolutions. Further, because they are shown to be fractal in nature, it is suggested that this characteristic can be exploited in the development of new strategies for spatial modelling. </jats:p>",

Some disputes in these areas, however, are by their very nature unusually resistant to resolution, rendering them especially difficult for planners to manage without significant mediation training and skill. By exploring the literature on dispute intractability, this article maps for planners characteristics of intractable environmental, land use, and public policy disputes and discusses the usefulness of the transformative mediation approach for managing intractable disputes. Empirical research on dispute intractability, now in its nascent stages, could be productively applied by planners in making conflict assessments and applying dispute resolution techniques in planning practice. </jats:p>",

We suggest an alternative approach based on a concentration profile which shows the degree to which a group is spatially concentrated according to a range of thresholds. This is illustrated with data on male unemployment in England and Wales in 1991, which also shows the importance of spatial scale to the study of concentrations and, potentially, to the formulation of spatially focused public policies. </jats:p>",

Findings suggest that the current level of information technology applications and the mandate to build a ‘People's Town’ in Singapore's public housing estate have laid a solid base for introducing PPGIS to housing-estate management. The existing channels of public participation in town council management also pointed to a collective form, based on the Residents' Committees, for accessing and using the PPGIS. It is hoped that this study contributes to PPGIS research by extending explorations to a new cultural context and to a new application area. </jats:p>",

The development of this tool emerged from the concept that the spatial openness (SO)—the volume of free space measured from all possible observation points—is an important quality indicator of alternative spatial configurations within given constraints; this concept is based on the idea that the geometry and morphology of the built-up environment influence perception. Previous work showed that comparative SO measurements in alternative spatial configurations are correlated with the comparative perceived density, and in particular that a higher value of SO indicates a lower perceived density. We present a feasible 3D computational method for measuring SO and demonstrate its potential use in the design process. The SO metric is a step towards the development of quantitative comparative evaluation of building shapes and spatial configurations related to the 3D observation of open space. </jats:p>",

This article examines the planning practice implications of development impact fees on housing and land prices. The review of the literature suggests that impact fees contribute to housing price infation in communities where there are no reasonable housing substitutes and that tax burden and infrastructure enhancements are capitalized into the price of home and land. </jats:p>",

The system design combines commercial database and GIS packages to provide a flexible means of predicting the solar energy potential and energy consumption of dwellings. By incorporating customised tools designed to derive useful data directly from digital maps and aerial photographs, it addresses the significant problem of data collection for urban-scale energy modelling. In conjunction with data generated by a new dynamic default data system, the map-derived data provide the necessary input for an embedded domestic energy model and a solar energy calculation engine. In this way, robust estimates can be obtained, at almost arbitrary scales of resolution, of the potential for solar energy to replace delivered domestic energy and to mitigate emissions of carbon dioxide. </jats:p>",

Here, we focus on how the analogues identified by our qualitative system can be visualised effectively for use in location analysis. We discuss the role of analogy in retail location decisionmaking and the advantages and disadvantages of different methods of visualisation. We evaluate the visual aspects of the system developed in the course of our research with reference to users' qualitative responses. The central issue appears to be the value users place on the system being able to summarise analogues simply on key dimensions at a general level, as well as its ability to ‘drill down’ into the detail so that analogue representativeness can be established. </jats:p>",

Rydin provides an in-depth and fully theorized account of the role of talk or discourse within environmental planning, combining theory, reported research, and original empirical case studies. She highlights the problem that planners and others face when trying to expand the space for talk within planning situations and provides a detailed assessment of the prospects for consensus-building and deliberative democracy.

The digital factory software allows manufacturers to simulate factory layout digitally, in order to see how the plant would function under the proposed arrangement and to realize potential problems on the line. In addition to robots, employees themselves can be represented in a digitized version. In this way, engineers can figure out where employees should stand on the line and design workstations for them to both optimize their movements and to ensure they are not under any kind of ergonomic stress.

In this paper we attempt to improve the current evaluation practice by the application of potential, activity-based, accessibility measures for the analysis of job accessibility, using existing traditional land-use and transport data and/or models. We try to improve the interpretability of the results by estimating the separate influence of land-use changes, infrastructure projects, and congestion on the development of job accessibility. A case study of the Netherlands shows the importance of incorporating job competition and the match between educational and job levels in the analysis of job accessibility. </jats:p>",

Creating a practical version of communicative rationality that is actively used within the policy process would provide this. In effect, what is required is a justification for a specific policy approach or a legitimation of such a policy approach in terms of communicative rationality. Policy approaches are continuously justified, either explicitly or implicitly. The search for legitimation is an inherent part of the policy process. In contemporary society, such legitimation takes the form of the demonstration of rationality. The reasons for this will be explored and a distinction drawn between procedural and substantive rationality. In this chapter, the focus will be on procedural rationality, the norm of a rational policy process. The next chapter will con sider the major substantive rationalities, comparing communicative rationality with scientific and economic rationalities.</jats:p>",

These workload and resource plans are key to the development of the corporation's financial plans, such as revenue and income forecasts, forward pricing for future work, and the establishment of overhead rates. Additionally, these forecasts are used to develop the necessary hiring and subcontracting plans and to balance the assignment of manufacturing, construction, and engineering talent across numerous contracts. Lastly, such forecasts provide management a tool to assist in the evaluation of the impact of work scope changes. This paper provides an overview of the approach that Northrop Grumman Newport News uses to develop and manage its workload and labor resource forecasts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Singlish, Singapore’s brand of colloquial English, is accepted by some as an essential marker of\nSingaporean identity but deplored by others as a variety of English that puts Singapore and Singaporeans at a\ndisadvantage because of its lack of international intelligibility. For this reason, it has been argued that\nSingaporeans cannot afford to maintain Singlish as a viable linguistic resource. A campaign known as the\n“Speak Good English Movement” was established in 2000 to counter the ill effects of Singlish\nthrough the promotion of Standard English. This paper addresses the Singlish-Standard (Singaporean) English\ndebate in terms of discourse resources and the politics of language planning in Singapore. It may be true that\nSinglish is not the most internationally intelligible of Englishes, but what is more interesting is the considerable\ndisparity between the official concern over international intelligibility and the reality of life in Singapore,\nespecially for the Singlish speaker. Such a disparity suggests differing notions of what constitutes an important\nlinguistic resource for the nation as a whole and for specific speech communities. On another level, it provides\ninsights into the politics of language management in Singapore. The Singlish-Standard English debate also\nprovides clear evidence of struggles over the determination of the choice of a preferred variety of English and\nthe control over linguistic resources. Through an examination of media reports, official statements, and letters\nto local newspapers, the author considers the implications of this debate for Singaporeans (especially Singlish\nspeakers) and their participation within the society. In the process, the author also examines the power\nrelations that are intertwined in this debate for determining the ideal Singaporean society.</jats:p>",

Its importance lies in its (assumed) capability to make consumers more satisfied and, by this means, to attain the company’s objectives more efficiently. This paper proposes that the time factor should form part of market‐oriented business behavior. The most market‐oriented companies act more quickly and they are quicker when it comes to collecting and disseminating information, and designing market action plans. Using the methodology proposed by Kohli and Jaworski, the time dimensions that give content to market‐oriented behavior are examined in a sample of Spanish companies. Additionally, in an attempt to go beyond the anecdotal evidence, different hypotheses are contrasted concerning the effect of different organizational and environmental antecedents on the time dimensions of market‐oriented behavior.</jats:p>",

The traditional economists' procedure for valuing public goods involves vertical aggregation of marginal willingness to pay, at a given income level. This approach is flawed by failing to recognize that individuals will not work for goods that cannot be acquired individually with higher incomes. There will be a parallel input market failure any time there is a public good output market failure, thus the ‘given income’ of the traditional valuation method is too low. Hence, traditional valuation methods result in underprovision of local public goods (for example, parks, safety, education, and environmental quality) at the urban centers. As a consequence, there will be nonoptimally large levels of suburban sprawl with substantial resulting welfare loss. </jats:p>",

Little has been done on the TQM practices of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in developing countries. This paper investigates the relationship between TQM, planning behavior and firm size by reviewing existing literature and collecting primary data from 54 SMEs in the Republic of Botswana. The findings indicated that the majority of SMEs understand the importance of both TQM and planning activities for their survival and growth. However, their approach to both is unsystematic, non‐formal and short‐term oriented. Both firm size and planning behavior are found to have statistically significant relationships with TQM practices. As firm size increases from small to medium, and as SMEs move from operational to strategic planning, they attach greater degree of importance to TQM practices. However, the planning behavior of SMEs is more strongly related to TQM practices than firm size. Suggests the promotion of business planning as a prerequisite to the adoption of formalized TQM practices. Some implications for SMEs are also forwarded.</jats:p>",

Most importantly, numerous IS/IT strategic planning frameworks do not seem to realize that IS‐related problems are not merely technological, but are also caused by neglecting the interrelationship between IS/IT and organizational context. This study aims to identify and explore the key organizational mechanisms related to IS/IT strategic planning, and thus improve planning effectiveness.

The authors suggest an innovative scenario process, one that provides business continuity planning and medium‐term operational planning with a more rigorous analytical grounding, but without overburdening the process with excessive and ultimately counter‐productive complexity. The authors have introduced alternative scenario‐based tools to respond to this specific need for continuity assurance and near‐term operations planning. Case one: business continuity planning (BCP) for the management of one leading global financial services firm committed to a process of identifying and remedying gaps in the recoverability of its key assets. Workshops developed strategies that would close unacceptable asset recovery gaps in two scenarios. Case two: medium term operational planning for a professional services firm in the weeks that followed 9/11 evaluated the plausible range of impacts on their business and operations as the USA and the world took action and terrorist groups responded further. Case three: three years ago the US Coast Guard developed scenarios for very long range strategic planning for their long view project. The Coast Guard developed ten basic strategies from these scenarios. The fourth strategy was “Acquire full maritime domain awareness”. The goal was to give the Coast Guard the ability to acquire, track, and identify in real time any vessel or aircraft entering America’s maritime domain. Maritime domain awareness (MDA) turned out to be highly relevant for USCG decision making both before and after 9/11. Of all the major US federal services involved in the 9/11 response operation, the Coast Guard was singled out for its agility and preparedness.</jats:p>",

Sexualized metaphors of the house as the feminine, private realm and the city as the masculine, public realm proliferate in the modern period. However, rather than conforming to this conventional opposition, these three authors define the city in terms of the house. Their statements provide a curious link across temporal and geographical boundaries, with significant theoretical implications. In all three cases both the feminine figure and themes of loss and death underlie the desire to project the ideal city. In this paper I argue that these themes intertwine in complicated ways to assert urban identification in terms of a masculine desire of total control and mastery by silencing the feminine figure. </jats:p>",

Certainly, these materials still work – for some applications. But, many of today's drilling operations bear little resemblance to that not-so-distant past. The industry is accelerating its activities in deepwater and depleted zones, both of which present narrow operating limits, young sedimentary formations, and high degree of depletion overbalanced drilling. All of these now-common conditions are ideal for fracturing and lost circulation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Drilling through and below salt formations presents a host of technical challenges as well. The thief zone at the base of the salt can introduce severe lost circulation and well control problems, often resulting in loss of the interval or the entire well. Controlling losses in this zone has proven to be extremely difficult. Very few lost circulation remedies have been successful, especially when using invert emulsion drilling fluids. The lost time treating severe sub-salt losses can last for several weeks, with obvious cost implications, especially for deepwater drilling operations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper reviews the methods applied to avoid lost circulation in the sub-salt thief zone, as well as in the subsequent intervals for a Gulf of Mexico deepwater project and discusses the time and cost savings obtained. For maximum success in these situations, emphasis has been placed on assessment and planning rather than individual lost circulation products.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The authors will detail the Lost Circulation Assessment and Planning process that has been employed to explore and evaluate specific lost circulation problems and link them to existing products, systems and services. The integrative pre-planning process analyzes offset histories and formation data not only to identify risk zones but also to gather information on the exact fracture and pore size as well as fracture density. Afterward, detailed interval-specific decision-tree charts are developed for stopping losses encountered while drilling or tripping in.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition to discussing the application of this Assessment and Planning process, the authors will outline the lessons learned on the deepwater project, featuring pre-planning issues geared toward ensuring circulation is maintained throughout the wellbore.</jats:p>",

Advance care planning—thoughtful conversations between patients, families, and health care providers—will be key in ensuring that patients receive the care they want and the care that is most appropriate for them. To foster the best care, advance care planning must evolve from a document-based system of health care directives focused on specific treatment choices to an ongoing dialogue with the patient and family about health care outcomes.

As a result of global, national, and institutional compressions, the new poverty management tends to circulate these populations, especially the mentally disabled, across an array of unrelated and frequently institutional settings. This restructuring of interactions between mobility and institutional settings, in the form of institutionalized cycling, has yet to be investigated for other potentially vulnerable groups, such as single homeless women. Using a convenience sample of twenty-five women at a shelter in Central Los Angeles, I seek to understand their residential patterns, identify evidence of institutionalized cycling through a fivefold typology, and to elucidate the personal and structural factors behind why some women were prone to institutionalized cycling whereas others were not. Results point to highly uneven evidence of institutionalized cycling across the sample, with the most obvious impacts in the institutional cycler and institutionally accommodated categories. </jats:p>",

In certain contexts, the reverse is true, i.e., customer requirements are somewhat flexible, providing additional options in production planning. This paper considers such an opportunity faced by a specialty steel manufacturer whose customers allow flexibility in product specifications. We develop and test a model and solution methodology to exploit this flexibility during production planning. The model also applies to other situations in which manufacturers can select, within limits, the size or quantities of items produced using limited capacity. We formulate the problem as a profit-maximizing mixed-integer program with an interesting embedded packing subproblem using “expandable” items. We develop a composite solution method that combines model enhancement using strong valid inequalities, Lagrangian relaxation, and heuristic approaches. Computational results using real data from a specialty steel manufacturer and randomly generated test problems show that the algorithm generates solutions that are, on average, within 0.59% of optimality. For the problem instances based on real data, the model increases contribution to profit by over 7% relative to current practice at the steel manufacturing facility. </jats:p>",

Taking a longer perspective than the typical building cycle, the author considers the extended trajectories of office development in Canadian cities and regions; these development avenues are shaped by components originating at various geographical scales. The major purpose is to demonstrate how these components come about in particular settings. The process of identifying and sorting components is quite complex because they are inherently interactive. Trajectories should be interpreted as packages of general and particular arrangements. These arrangements reflect the interactions between components of different geographical scales, interactions that customize place-specific patterns. </jats:p>",

The same skillful facilitation that supports an individual who has a disability will also support an individual with a disability and cultural or language differences. This article provides background and a description of PCP based on process, components, and outcomes and examines each in relationship to working with individuals and families of other cultures and languages. Vignettes are used to provide support and examples of how professionals can be sensitive to differences in culture and language within the process. </jats:p>",

I seek to combine the philosophical insights of Sartre's account of ‘anguish’ with Goffman's sociotheoretical account of the individual's employment of techniques of ‘front management’ and ‘self-presentation’. Such techniques might, I argue, be regarded as a form of coping mechanism for dealing with the anxieties of social existence, especially those stemming from what Sartre terms the ‘look’ of Others. Agoraphobics' testimonies illustrate their difficulties in successfully deploying such techniques in the face of the anxieties they experience in social spaces. Interpreting agoraphobic experiences in this way adds a sociospatial theoretical dimension to existing accounts of the disorder, accounts that are currently of a predominantly psychological nature. </jats:p>",

A substantial amount of research has concentrated on improving the accuracy of these curves. Categorizing construction projects into groups and subgroups has helped, but the fact remains that different construction projects possess different profiles of cost flow. This paper is an attempt at assessing the extent of influence of planning and programming the work on the cost flow curves. One real project was used as a case study and four planners were independently asked to produce programmes for executing the project. These programmes were analysed and converted to cost flow curves using one database of productivity and unit cost rates. Results confirmed that the variations in programmes produced less variations in cost flow curves than the errors to be expected from the use of average curves derived from project groups (mean SDY 2.88 compared to previous studies of 5.5, 8.5 and 10.67). The results suggest, taking due account of the limitations of the scope of the study, that further effort at the categorisation of projects into subgroups will result in a reasonable improvement in accuracy.</jats:p>",

The paper highlights that an evolutionary change in the concept of CRM is required. Three key findings have been made. First, customers should be the major focus, and companies are actually dealing with customer‐managed relationships (CMR). Second, it is not just a one‐to‐one relationship pattern. The linkages with other parties are the cores of the relationships between customers and companies. It should therefore be a one‐network‐one relationship. Third, a co‐creative approach should be used in order to integrate the CRM and CMR concepts to enable customers to participate in corporate strategy formulation and to encourage companies to cooperate with third parties in serving customers. The financial service sector is taken as a major example to illustrate the full concept of CRM and CMR. Managerial implications arising from the implementation of the co‐creative approach are explored, which include market share and mind share.</jats:p>",

We argue here, in sympathy with actor-network theory and nonrepresentational theory, that space is formulated by and formulative of its objects in mutually elaborating occasions and chains of action. The handling of objects that produces regions requires not simply that they are put in a place, but that they are put in a relevant place. Finding the relevant where is bound to the relevant when in the sense that the uses of objects are bound to sequential considerations of the kind: what happens next? Regions are cultural, social, political, and sometimes theoretical entities for economists, geographers, and other professional social scientists, but they are also topics of concern to regional managers of business companies, who are unavoidably and pervasively involved in the practical activities of spatial organisation. In this paper we are pursuing the situated replication of sociospatial technologies, or, in other words, how the same thing is done over and over again by local employees, with both the materials that they have at hand and the contingent circumstances in which they locate themselves. In pursuing our analysis we follow one particular mobile worker as she goes about her daily work of managing her region. What we attempt to excavate from our ethnographic material is the order that is endogenous to those activities. It is an everyday order that does not turn on spectacular technologies but turns, rather, on mundane ones such as stacking cardboard boxes, arranging items in the boot of a car, and driving around a city. </jats:p>",

The proposed jaw configuration and planning approach reduces the search associated with locating the finger contacts from six degrees‐of‐freedom to one degree‐of‐freedom. Closed‐form algorithms for checking force closure and for predicting jamming are developed. Three quality metrics are introduced to improve the quality of the planned grasps. The first is a measure of the sensitivity of the grasp to errors between the actual and planned finger locations. The second is a measure of the efficiency of the grasp in terms of the contact forces. The third is a measure of the dependence of force closure on friction. These quality metrics are not restricted to cylindrical fingers and can be applied to<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>finger grasps.

At an international level, the neighbourhood—or, more specifically, the ‘global neighbourhood'—is being promoted as a moral space through which to manage the complex economic, political, and ecological problems of the planet. Mirroring this process at a national level, in the United Kingdom the neighbourhood has been rediscovered and now provides the parameters through which a range of antipoverty, welfare, and local democracy programmes are being delivered. In light of its contemporary political popularity, this paper presents a critical reanalysis of the concept of the neighbourhood. In particular, the analysis explores the ideological and political uses of the ideal of neighbourhood, and how these processes relate to a particular ‘politics of scale'. In order to unpack the various politics of scales associated with the neighbourhood, the analysis combines theories of scale with Lefebvre's work on the production of space. Drawing on these theoretical insights and the case of neighbourhood politics in the town of Walsall in the United Kingdom, I explore the political narratives and practices through which the neighbourhood scale is produced and contested, and question the ability of neighbourhoods, as they are currently being constructed in the United Kingdom, to offer locally empowering scales of political and social organisation. </jats:p>",

Age, tenure, and room stress (housing-space requirements) are found to be significant predictors of moving. In addition, the life course ‘triggers' of marital-status change and, in some situations, birth of a child play important roles in moving within housing markets in the United Kingdom. The same model, with somewhat lower levels of fit, is also significant for the London region. Variables that measure the desire to move and neighborhood satisfaction also play a role in predicting local moves: those who like their neighborhood are generally less likely to move.

One of their main strengths is their simplicity. They are used to make area statements and to assess trends in occupied habitat, and are an important part of the assessment of the conservation status of species. We show by simulation that these estimates are biased. The bias increases with sample size, and is affected by the underlying shape of the species habitat, the magnitude of errors in locations, and the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort. The errors affect both area statements and estimates of trends. Some of these errors may be reduced through the application of α‐hulls, which are generalizations of convex hulls, but they cannot be eliminated entirely. α‐hulls provide an explicit means for excluding discontinuities within a species range. Strengths and weaknesses of alternatives including kernel estimators were examined. Convex hulls exhibit larger bias than α‐hulls when used to quantify habitat extent and to detect changes in range, and when subject to differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of sampling effort and spatial accuracy. α‐hulls should be preferred for estimating the extent of and trends in species' ranges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author presents the analysis of a survey of 500 high-tech enterprises in Shanghai which was designed to examine the local social, political, and economic environment in which high-tech enterprises operate and compete. Information sought in this survey comes in two kinds: the characteristics of high-tech enterprises; and their assessments of specified elements constituting their business environment. Survey findings suggested that state-owned or quasi-state-owned enterprises are still the leading players although local private enterprises and transnational corporations are becoming indispensable actors in high-tech industrial development in Shanghai. Among these enterprises, those which are locally based are mainly small and medium-sized enterprises and are in the start-up stage of business; they are domestically oriented and are not strong enough to exploit foreign markets. Foreign-based enterprises in Shanghai are, however, mainly subsidiaries, branch plants, or assembly lines, rather than regional headquarters, suggesting that Shanghai occupies a relatively low position in the international division of labor. The second part of the survey suggests that, in boosting the development of high-tech businesses, Shanghai achieves tangible objectives and improves the physical environment efficiently. Nevertheless, it is still quite weak in some soft dimensions, such as dynamic entrepreneurial culture, adequate business-support services, sophisticated educational and professional systems, comprehensive legal framework, etc. However, these dimensions are key components of innovative milieu in which technological innovation and entrepreneurial activities are facilitated and nurtured. </jats:p>",

Indeed, it is now widely recognised that the promotion of entrepreneurship is not only necessary for a healthy economy, but also critical for sustaining prosperity and creating new jobs. The authors discuss the debate on intervention in the business creation process, and pay particular attention to one aspect of such intervention, namely entrepreneurship training. The issue of the effectiveness of this type of training is also addressed, and the results of a comparative study of eight enterprise training programmes in five European countries, are presented. In addition to the intercountry comparison of entrepreneurship training programmes, the research undertaken comprised a three-year longitudinal study of participants in one of these programmes (CCNEA). The combination of the analysis of the comparative study with the more in-depth case study, has highlighted a number of issues which should be of particular interest to enterprise policymakers throughout Europe. These include the need for early stage awareness-raising through the education system, and the importance of providing secure funding for programmes; for pre-programme screening; for evaluation; and the need to ensure wide access. </jats:p>",

Economic concentration in the slaughter sector has increased and hog production has consolidated economically and geographically. Increases in the geographic concentration of hog production have led to water pollution through spills and leakage from high numbers of very large manure storage lagoons centered within limited areas, such as a few counties. The global restructuring of agro-food systems has promoted the development of intensive and concentrated livestock production. However, national, state and local institutions, and dynamics have also influenced the structure of geographic concentration of hog production. Using state-level and national-level time series data from 1975–1996, we find that national-level increases in concentration in the hog-processing sector are positively associated with geographic concentration of production within states. However, we also find that state, and even local, government policy can mitigate, or worsen, the geographic concentration of hog production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Managers need guidance on how to cope with turbulent environments in order to improve corporate performance. Research on environmental turbulence has suggested that firms adopt a less centralized, more organic structure in dynamic, uncertain environments. Little work has been done specifically, however, on how environmental turbulence affects strategy planning for new product development (NPD). In this article, we specify a baseline model with firm innovativeness, market orientation and top management risk taking as antecedents to NPD speed and corporate strategic planning; these in turn are modeled as antecedents to NPD program (not project) performance. Two conceptualizations of the role of environmental turbulence are examined: (1) that market turbulence and technological turbulence are additional direct antecedents to NPD program performance; and (2) that the baseline model is moderated by turbulence (that is, that the strengths of the paths differ depending on levels of turbulence). A cross‐sectional survey methodology including four diverse industries [automotive, electronics, publishing, and manufacturing/research and development (R&amp;D) laboratories] was used to test the hypotheses. The latter conceptualization is supported. In particular, the paths from innovativeness to strategic planning and from risk taking to NPD speed are significantly greater in highly turbulent environments. A set of managerial recommendations and implications are provided. First, managers must recognize the possible improvements in new product performance by actively including NPD personnel in corporate strategic planning and also by involving corporate planners in NPD activities. Second, managers also should recognize that turbulent environments heighten the need to make risky investments, and sometimes, risky decisions; risk‐taking decisions ought to be encouraged in such environments.</jats:p>",

Despite the much lower percentage of households with cars (12.3%) and the higher dependence of passenger trips on public transport (80.2%), the estimated automobile elasticities in Hong Kong are remarkably similar to those reported in New York, where car ownership is high and the automobile is the dominant mode of transport. The empirical elasticity range in Hong Kong is from —0.103 to —0.291. This is similar to estimates for the United States (—0.13 to —0.45), the United Kingdom (—0.14 to —0.36), and Australia (—0.09 to —0.52). The findings suggest that toll increases are likely to be effective in raising revenue for tunnel management authorities but ineffective in reducing or reallocating automobile traffic for transport planning purposes. Policywise, suburbanization or the redistribution of population could have a much stronger influence on the urban transport market than a ‘multifaceted pricing’ strategy of raising the total costs of vehicle ownership and usage (including high vehicle-registration fees, parking, and gasoline prices). Moreover, improvements to railway connectivity and enhancement of travel speed on public transit could be much more effective than toll increases in relieving urban transport congestion problems at critical bottlenecks, such as downtown and suburb–downtown tunnels and bridges. The inclusion of lagged effects into the analysis further strengthens the above policy recommendations. </jats:p>",

Although some of the literature supports or starts from this association, there are also critiques of the clusters concept and its feasibility as a policy development and intervention strategy. Intrinsic to part of these concerns has been a view that clusters cannot be created without business involvement and input at the heart of the process. The paper addresses this issue via an examination of four cases of potential clusters development from the perspectives of the businesses involved. Although clear evidence for the existence of a cluster could only be established definitively in one of the four cases, there were extensive indications of clustering as a collaborative activity across all four cases. Based on this, a process of clusters formation and emergence was developed that applied to the cases. This process consists of several phases of clusters emergence and points to three stages of clusters development: potential, emerging, and established. A key implication is that processes of clusters formation may provide an opportunity for the formulation of ‘bottom-up’, contextually sensitive clusters development strategies for groups of businesses. </jats:p>",

The regional planning procedure involves a major transformation in management of the mental health system, organizational roles and clinical and professional practices. Our assessment of PROS highlights the importance of taking into account the context of implementation and the instrumental value of planning, before judging its efficacy. To transform a complex healthcare system at the regional and local level, the study suggests a revised conception of the main roles played by planning and of the process shaping its implementation. Our study concludes in favour of developing management strategies at the operational, clinical and professional levels, and integrating them as a planning aid that allows a more corporate and matrix-based system to be set up. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past twenty years, the emphasis of policy towards high-technology industry has shifted from national innovation systems to take account of globalisation and the formation of regional clusters. Support for high-technology sectors now takes place at a number of levels—regional, national, and international. However, the extent to which firms operate in these three arenas, and how relevant government action is for the needs and behaviour of firms in respect of these is open to question. The paper reports on a study into innovation in Germany and the United Kingdom, in a particular industry—opto-electronics—which has a highly global character, but is also characterised by concentrations of firms in clusters. The contrasting experiences of firms in two regions—Wales and Thuringia—and the different policy emphasis of the regional government provide a test for the relevance, appropriateness, and impact of government policies towards high-technology industry. By focusing on the experiences of innovating firms, the authors provide a conceptually rich understanding of innovation in terms of two processes, which are often conflated in public policy—stimulating knowledge and technology transfer, and providing resource support. The paper concludes with a suggestion that support for innovation needs to be based around the twin concepts of redundancy and systems thinking, and a series of questions policymakers need to keep in mind are proposed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Intense global competition and the advent of a raft of employment regulations (notably, the national minimum wage, or NMW) have placed the UK garment industry under severe pressure. The prospects for a significant segment of this sector—ethnic-minority-owned businesses—appear to be extremely gloomy, although earlier predictions of its demise proved to be unduly pessimistic. Drawing on case studies of eighteen firms, we present an examination of longitudinal change in the Asian-dominated West Midlands clothing industry. In particular, the aim is to examine the responses of manufacturers to market and regulatory change (in particular, the NMW). The findings clearly illustrate that the sector is in decline, with firms finding it increasingly difficult to cope with cheap imports, labour shortages, and employment regulations. A range of responses was evident and included firms that resorted to operating in ‘grey’ markets; manufacturers that ‘retrenched’ their operations; ‘work intensification’; and businesses that attempted to move ‘up-market’. Finally, potential policy responses are considered. In particular, the case of the Coventry Clothing Centre is examined. The Centre worked with the grain of employment legislation, and appeared to have experienced some success in encouraging local firms to accommodate the NMW and improve working practices. </jats:p>",

The study was based within South Yorkshire. We aim to explore the current relationship between SMEs and the environment and how this affects their concept of ‘sustainable business’. The main finding reported is that most manufacturing and service organisations surveyed believe environmental issues affect their business. However, meeting environmental requirements is seen as a business cost that is not transferable to customers in terms of added benefits and few organisations could show that it led to a competitive advantage. SMEs have only a generalist awareness of environmental legislation, and information provided by most local support services is not presented in a format that is efficient or effective. Our recommendations are that the assistance provided by local support agencies with regards to environmental best practice should be critically reviewed, and this review should seek to understand the reluctance and real difficulties faced by SMEs in comprehension and implementation of environmental legislation. This paper should therefore be used in conjunction with associated information when considering the best way to help prepare SMEs for greater involvement in environmental best practice and the achievement of sustainable business. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we are concerned with the nature and extent of product and process innovation and adoption of information and communications technologies (ICTs) in manufacturing plants and SMEs. The paper is based on extensive postal surveys conducted in southeast (SE) England, Northern Ireland (NI), and the Republic of Ireland (RoI) with a harmonised survey instrument. We confirm the findings of a number of previous studies by demonstrating a positive association between product and process innovation and business performance. Data collected from all three surveys show that sales growth, employment growth, and profit margins were higher for innovators than growth, for noninnovators. It also appears that although foreign-owned plants show a higher propensity for innovation than indigenously owned plants, the latter grew faster than their foreign owned counterparts in all three regions. This suggests that a targeting strategy focused on innovative, indigenously owned SMEs may be particularly rewarding. With regard to the nature and extent of the use of ICT and electronic business (e-business), the survey found a higher level of adoption of nearly all ICT facilities in SE England compared with the levels in NI and the RoI. Differences in ICT capability between the regions are greatest in the case of smaller plants, with the adoption of various ICT facilities being particularly favoured amongst the smallest plants in SE England, most of which are indigenously owned. However, there is evidence to suggest that the technology may be underutilised in each region, possibly reflecting a lack of in-house knowledge and resources in some applications and external barriers in others. SE England was found to have the highest proportion of plants engaged in some R&amp;D compared with the two Irish regions, particularly NI. Unsurprisingly, there is a tendency for the propensity of a firm to be engaged in R&amp;D to increase with firm size. The surveys also underlined sectoral differences in explaining the relative importance of R&amp;D. ‘Technology transfer’ was significantly more common in the two Irish regions, reflecting the higher proportion of externally controlled plants. With respect to the role of external linkages in innovation, links with customers and suppliers were the ones most commonly identified in all three regions. In SE England there is a particularly low propensity to engage in collaboration with external agencies and research institutions, indicating scope here for further policy intervention. We conclude with a number of suggestions for the agenda of the new regional centre of manufacturing excellence in SE England. </jats:p>",

When fused to the treatment planning CT, physiological image studies may allow one to define physiological tumor subvolumes consisting of areas of possible chronic hypoxia, areas of high perfusion, areas of high diffusion, and areas containing high choline concentrations. These physiological tumor subvolumes could be selectively boosted to increase local control of malignant brain tumors once one has determined which of these physiological tumor subvolumes predicts for local tumor recurrence after conventional radiotherapy. </jats:p><jats:p> In this technique a user assisted automatic registration technique is used that is based on an analytical estimate for the transformation matrix needed to register two rigid bodies.

Since this registration technique uses two sets of at least three user-defined landmark points each of which has some selection error associated with it, the final registration will have an error that depends only on the selection error associated with the point sets. </jats:p><jats:p> Since physiological image studies are acquired at the same setting as the T1- w MRI their spatial orientation with respect to the T1- w MRI is known. Therefore, the registration of multiple physiological image studies to the treatment planning CT can be accomplished by first correlating them to the T1- w MRI, and in a second step the T1- w MRI is then registered to the treatment planning CT. The desired registration of the physiological image studies to the treatment planning CT is then accomplished by simply composing the appropriate transformation matrices. </jats:p>",

The study also illustrates the potential application of ROC curve analysis in construction engineering and management research. Planning efforts in a sample of 52 building projects in Australia and 37 building projects in the United Kingdom were evaluated and compared. This study builds on work done in an earlier study in which the concept of optimal planning of construction projects was explored. The ROC curve analysis offers several advantages over the regression methodology employed in the previous optimal planning study. The graphical representation of the relationship between sensitivity and specificity over all possible diagnostic cutoff points provides an insight into the interactions of the variables that was not apparent in the original methodology.Key words: construction planning, project planning, project management, ROC curve analysis, Australia, United Kingdom.</jats:p>",

I examine the initiatives taken by the government in the Netherlands to advance new-firm formation in biotechnology. Drawing on experience in entrepreneurship—its institutional setting in general, and more specifically on developments in biotechnology start-ups—I aim to identify critical success factors for this policy. The policy seems promising in covering all development stages of start-up firms and in using a network approach—with implementation by an intermediary organisation as a solution for coordination problems. The low popularity of entrepreneurship, including some negative regulatory factors in biotechnology, and the danger of the policy focusing on the top innovative start-ups are threats to success. Other threats may be a fragmentation of ferees and a narrow focus on a national situation rather than cooperation with adjacent countries. I suggest a number of critical success factors that can be used in policies to enhance new-firm formation in biotechnology, and indicate some lines for further research. </jats:p>",

Boys with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were compared with age– and intelligence quotient (IQ)–matched boys with attention–deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing (TD) boys, on a drawing task requiring planning for the inclusion of a new element. Weak coherence was measured through analysis of drawing style. In line with the predictions made, the ASD group was more detail–focused in their drawings than were either ADHD or TD boys. The ASD and ADHD groups both showed planning impairments, which were more severe in the former group. Poor planning did not, however, predict detail–focus, and scores on the two aspects of the task were unrelated in the clinical groups.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The first global tropospheric forecasts of O3 and its precursors have been used in the daily flight planning of field measurement campaigns. The 3-D chemistry-transport model MATCH-MPIC is driven by meteorological data from a weather center (NCEP) to produce daily 3-day forecasts of the global distributions of O3 and related gases, as well as regional CO tracers. This paper describes the forecast system and its use in three field campaigns, MINOS, CONTRACE and INDOEX. An overview is given of the forecasts by MATCH-MPIC and by three other chemical weather forecast models (EURAD, ECHAM, and FLEXPART), focusing on O3 and CO. Total CO and regional CO tracers were found to be the most valuable gases for flight planning, due to their relatively well-defined anthropogenic source regions and lifetimes of one to a few months. CO was in good agreement with the observations on nearly all the flights (generally  r &gt; 0.7, and the relative RMS differences for the deviations from the means was less than 20%). In every case in which the chemical weather forecasts were primarily responsible for the flight plans, the targeted features were observed. Three forecasted phenomena are discussed in detail: outflow from Asia observed in the Mediterranean upper troposphere during MINOS, outflow from North America observed in the middle troposphere over northern Europe during CONTRACE, and the location of the \"chemical ITCZ'' over the Indian Ocean during INDOEX. In particular it is shown that although intercontinental pollution plumes such as those observed during MINOS and CONTRACE occur repeatedly during the months around the campaigns, their frequency is sufficiently low (~10--30% of the time) that global chemical weather forecasts are important for enabling them to be observed during limited-duration field campaigns. The MATCH-MPIC chemical weather forecasts, including an interface for making customized figures from the output, are available for community use via http://www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/~lawrence/forecasts.html.\n                    </jats:p>"
