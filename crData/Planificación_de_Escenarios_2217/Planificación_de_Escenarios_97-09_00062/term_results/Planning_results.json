      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the changing views of planning and computer-based information that provide the foundations for a new perspective on computer-assisted planning. It begins by tracing the evolving view of planning as applied science in the 1 960s, as politics in the 1970s, and then as communication in the 1980s. It then reviews the evolving concern of the information sciences with data in the 1960s, information in the 1970s, and knowledge in the 1980s. It concludes by suggesting that the increasingly popular topic of planning support systems (PSS) can be seen as continuing these trends to a include broader concern with intelligence and collective design. </jats:p>",

The increased use of GIS technology for informing planning and public policy decision making is discussed in the first section, followed by a summary of related technical and theoretical disparities. The concept of links is then introduced and used in the final section to demonstrate the contexts in which common themes can be identified for integrating planning norms (ethics, values, communicative rationality, planning process, and context) and GIS methods (data creation, analysis, and presentation). </jats:p>",

A cultural division between \"academic\" and \"practice\" faculty and classes gives higher status and greater influence to academic courses emphasizing research and analysis. Thus university programs tacitly teach that planning is the same as research. Despite rhetoric about \"integrating academics and practice,\" programs give little attention to that challenge. Reforming planning education to teach students to plan requires a change in the culture of planning programs that dissolves differences between \"academic\" and \"practice\" to focus on questions of practice. </jats:p>",

By reducing the market price of parking, minimum parking requirements provide subsidies that inflate parking demand, and this inflated demand is then used to set minimum parking requirements. When considered as an impact fee, minimum parking requirements can increase development costs by more than 10 times the impact fees for all other public purposes combined. Eliminating minimum parking requirements would reduce the cost of urban development, improve urban design, reduce automobile dependency, and restrain urban sprawl. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental designers must be spatially literate: They must be proficient in reading and interpreting spaces and articulating ideas about the quality of the experience of spaces. To promote spatial literacy among environmental designers, we need an effective medium for describing the experience of realworld spaces and for communicating ideas about such spatial experiences. Hyper Space, a computer-based tool, could function as such a medium. In this article, I first discuss the difficulties of communicating ideas about spaces and specify characteristics of an effective medium for communicating spatial ideas. Then, I describe Hyper Space: how it is used and how a simulation is created. After describing and evaluating its use in the classroom, I conclude with a discussion of other uses of Hyper Space in design and planning education and how it cannot be a completely effective medium for describing spaces. </jats:p>",

As a consequence, the Well Engineering team proceeded to plan the first exploration well, which was to be drilled in 1275 metres of water in the Nyk High area off Northern Norway.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The team faced two significant challenges. The rig market for fourth generation semi-submersible drilling units, capable of drilling in these water depths, was such that there were no Norwegian approved vessels available. Hence, they had to plan for the importation of an appropriate rig and introduce a new drilling contractor to the Norwegian sector. Additionally, the water depth was indicative of a dynamically positioned drilling operation and the Norwegian Authorities needed to be convinced that this unit, and the associated drilling programme, were appropriate to the task at hand.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Consequently, there were a number of key processes that were central to the success of this exercise. These included detailed project planning, wide-ranging risk assessments and accessing the knowledge and skills of groups inside BP Exploration with experience of these operations. Visible compliance with our internal technical and HSE systems and Policies was a central feature of this project, and compliance with the Norwegian requirements. As the first well of this nature in the Norwegian sector, these processes were all key to final approval to proceed with the drilling activity.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper describes how these aims were achieved, detailing how the Well Engineering Team managed the project, the risk assessment procedures that were implemented, the approach to Regulatory compliance and the verification processes that were put in place. The detailed engineering studies and the performance of the first well will be reported separately in later papers.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Operation in Norway</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>To anyone unaccustomed to it, the Norwegian sector of the North Sea is a challenging legislative environment in which to operate. The regulations governing oilfield operations are extensive and detailed, figure 1. An operator must be able to demonstrate that he complies with all the requirements of the legislation. Individuals must know the content of the regulations. Additionally, compliance is checked periodically by the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate by formal audit of a company's activities against specific aspects of the regulations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The regulations are designed with protection of the worker and the environment in mind. Compliance must be visible and demonstrable. Operators must therefore implement a system that enables them to do their work knowing that the results will comply with the requirements of the regulations. Whilst the process can appear bureaucratic and the volume of paperwork substantial, the essence of the regulation is simple. The Operator is responsible for all activities in his licence area and he must be able to show that he has assessed and analysed all the key risks, that the operation is being carried out by competent people and that it conforms to the plan.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The well being planned was the first deep water &amp;gt;1000M) well to be drilled on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, figure 2. It was to be drilled with a dynamically positioned semi-submersible rig. The combination of these two presented the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate with a formidable challenge. They had major concerns about the safety and integrity of deep water operations and the use of dynamically positioned rigs for drilling. Hence, a major part of the project effort was devoted to identifying and understanding the concerns of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. Once they were defined they were studied and the conclusions incorporated in the Consent Documentation.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 315^</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Under these circumstances, conceptual design plays a key role to comply with those preferences and requirements, and to shorten the lead time in product development. This is also true in the domain of piping layout design, where a designer makes design in a trial-and-error way to comply with the requirements frequently changed in specification until the final design is formulated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper describes an approach of piping route path planning using genetic algorithm (GA). Optimization technique of GA generates a preliminary route path through evolution of genes which represent the piping route path. A designer evaluates the route path, modifies it, and repeats the procedure until the appropriate path is designed. In this way, a designer can interactively proceed the layout of piping in a collaborative manner using a design support system. The paper shows the procedure of the method and some results of simulation.</jats:p>",

The system is different in architecture from traditional integrated process planning systems, since it is designed specifically to integrate with existing partial planning software with little effort. It does provide all functions of design and process planning for machining of mechanical parts on 3-axis machining centers. Special features of the system include a sophisticated feature recognition system, an optimal machining planner, automated fixture synthesis, setup planning with operation sequencing, and a knowledge based system organizer called the OSCAP core which orchestrates the functioning of all modules. The system can be arbitrarily extended or collapsed by adding or removing functional modules.</jats:p>",

A stacking plan consists of a set of homogeneous transformations describing the configuration of each constituent part of the stack with respect to a world coordinate system. Stacks are constructed incrementally by adding parts to an existing stack. The base part is positioned to maximize stability when placed on a special part buffer. Successive parts are added in a configuration minimizing the height of the stack c.g. and ensuring the stability of the stack and the constituent parts. Evaluation of part and stack stability and analysis of part-part interference and part instability are addressed. Three examples demonstrate the advantage of interference analysis, handling of non-90° part orientations, and effect of features like asymmetric flanges and large holes on computational efficiency.</jats:p>",

First, we identify the setup constraints imposed by various bending operations in the part family. These setup constraints describe spatial constraints on sizes and locations of various tooling stages in the setup. After identifying setup constraints, we try to generate setup plans that can satisfy all setup constraints. Any setup plan that satisfies all setup constraints is capable of accommodating every part in the part family.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Setup changes constitute a major portion of the production time in batch production environments.

For example, architectural firms in the service industry and manufacturers developing new or modified products invest in computer-aided design systems (CAD) to increase the volume of output generated by the engineering specialist. </jats:p><jats:p> A critical element of the IT-knowledge worker model introduced is the inclusion of implementation-related dynamics. In particular we model both the short-term disruption to output that typically occurs at the start of the implementation period and the effect of worker learning during implementation. The ability of the organization to generate output is examined in relation to the levels of workforce, information technology, worker skill, and a variety of features of the IT. Seven production function attributes are introduced to quantify the manner in which output is generated for the IT-knowledge worker system. </jats:p><jats:p> The production function is embedded into an optimization model in which profit is maximized. The formulation is dynamic in order to capture important elements of the decision-making environment, including the learning process, technological change, increasing wages, and changes in the labor supply. Optimal policies are obtained depicting the manner in which an organization should hire and fire its workforce and acquire information technology over time. </jats:p><jats:p> A fundamental result is obtained establishing the existence of a complementary relationship between IT and knowledge workers. It is shown that a greater level of effective IT increases the desirability of hiring additional workers. In addition, as the ability of the IT to enhance knowledge worker productivity improves (reflecting IT features such as ease of use, functionality, connectivity, etc.), the desirability of hiring additional workers increases. Similarly, due to a high volume of workforce or a high level of worker skill, the desirability of acquiring IT increases. </jats:p><jats:p> It is also shown that if an organization ignores the nature of the lagged effect of workforce learning, or if the impact of workforce learning on output is underestimated, then the projected volume of output over time is largely exaggerated. These results have important implications to management decision making with respect to effective implementation practices, technology choice issues, and workforce selection. </jats:p><jats:p> Numerical results are generated to explore the effect of organizational size. It is shown that a smaller organization (as measured by the size of its workforce) relies more heavily on information technology to enhance worker productivity and generate output. Lastly, in response to higher wages, analytic results are derived demonstrating that an organization should reduce its level of hiring and its purchase of IT. Furthermore, numerical results show that an organization paying higher wages should allocate a greater amount of IT per worker to enhance productivity. </jats:p>",

The usage of these tools is illustrated by results obtained for three river basins located in Central and Eastern European countries. Examples incorporate least-cost DO policies, regional strategies to reduce nutrient emissions with special regard to the control of inland sea eutrophication, multi-criteria decision making and the sequential usage of optimization and simulation models to assess the sensitivity of a particular policy in terms of water quality and economic impacts.

The objective is to plan a collision-free path for a robot moving through a workspace populated with obstacles. In this paper, we present a fast and practical algorithm for moving a convex polygonal robot among a set of polygonal obstacles with translations and rotations. The running time is O(c((n + k)N + nlogn)), where c is a parameter controlling the precision of the results, n is the total number of obstacle vertices, k is the number of intersections of configuration space obstacles, and N is the number of obstacles, decomposed into convex objects. This work builds upon the slabbing method proposed by Ahrikencheikh et al. (1994), which finds an optimal motion for a point among a set of non-overlapping obstacles. Here, we extend the slabbing method to the motion planning of a convex polygonal robot with translations and rotations, which also allows overlapping configuration space obstacles. This algorithm has been fully implemented and the experimental results show that it is more robust and faster than other approaches.</jats:p>",

Such full automation is often infeasible in practice for three reasons: (i) the search space of potential plans is huge, (ii) optimality metrics are often context sensitive and can only be elicited through user interaction, (iii) because of the importance of process planning, organizations are more interested in process planning assistants that support human expert process planners rather than standalone process planners.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In this paper, we present a “process planner’s assistant”, which helps the human process planning experts in coming up with process plans. In order to achieve this, the process planner’s assistant must have access to the full search space of process plans, and the ability to modify plans in response to human criticism. The former is provided by basing our system on ASU Features Testbed, a comprehensive and systematic framework for recognizing and reasoning with features in machinable parts. To support the latter, the system is equipped with an incremental and interactive search mechanism. We will discuss the operational details of the resultant system, called ASUPPA.</jats:p>",

The algorithm employs a conjugate‐gradient routine for subspace minimization in order to achieve a higher rate of convergence than the widely used constrained steepest‐descent method at the expense of a negligible amount of overhead calculations. The performance of the new algorithm has been compared to that of the constrained steepest‐descent method for various treatment geometries and two different objectives. The active set algorithm is found to be superior to the constrained steepest descent, both in terms of its convergence properties and the residual value of the cost functions at termination. Its use can significantly accelerate the design of conformal plans with intensity modulated beams by decreasing the number of time‐consuming dose calculations.</jats:p>",

First, we present a comprehensive conceptualization of planning processes along six design dimensions. Second, in addition to examining the effects of environments, technology, and organizational complexity, we assess the effects of the organization's strategic orientation on the design of planning processes. Third, we move towards a configurational approach and explore the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies. The study uses data from a large sample of North American corporations. The results suggest that the forces of context govern the design of planning processes. Furthermore, exploration of the effects of concurrent presence of multiple contingencies provides interesting illustrations of situations where the forces of context are aligned in the same direction as well as situations where the forces pull in opposite directions.</jats:p>",

These technologies have application in many automated assembly contexts, whether robotic or not. Discusses the current state and applications of these two technologies. Both are based on use of a 3D CAD model, which currently must be converted to ACIS form for processing. Archimedes reasons about the liaisons between parts, then derives an assembly plan that is geometrically valid. This plan is improved by interaction with the user, who adds “constraints” to guide replanning. Facilities to define and search for a user’s “optimal” plan are under development. Given a workpiece shape, task constraints, and a description of a fixture kit, HoldFast finds the optimal fixture that can be made from the kit to hold the workpiece in form‐closure.</jats:p>",

Common integral components of stormwater control systems include stormwater management ponds for water quality control. These ponds may occupy valuable urban land and, hence, it is desirable to minimize the land coverage of these facilities while simultaneously satisfying water quality control objectives. The employment of optimization techniques in the planning and design process can thus play an important role by reducing the costs associated with the implementation of such facilities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper presents an optimization methodology for single catchments using a single stormwater quality control pond. This methodology is then further developed for a multiple parallel catchment (each with a single pond upstream of its outlet) optimization procedure employing principles of dynamic programming. The principal constraint of the problem formulation is to meet a specified pollution control level at the outfall to a receiving water body. The optimization technique employs analytical probabilistic models for stormwater management planning and analysis which are in a mathematically closed form and thus easily integrated into an optimization framework. The costs explicitly considered are land-associated costs and construction costs. Operation and maintenance costs can be incorporated into the framework if desired.</jats:p>",

It is a generalization of the well‐known space rule of simultaneously accounting for various system operating goals, in addition to the standard goal of avoiding unnecessary spills, including avoiding leakage losses, avoiding conveyance problems, taking into account the impacts of the reservoir system topology, and assuring satisfaction of secondary uses. Theoretical values of the rule's parameters for each one of these isolated goals are derived. In practice, parameters are evaluated to optimize one or more objective functions selected by the user. The rule is embedded in a simulation model so that optimization requires repeated simulations of the system operation with specific values of the parameters each time. The rule is tested on the case of the multireservoir water supply system of the city of Athens, Greece, which is driven by all of the operating goals listed above. Two problems at the system design level are tackled. First, the total release from the system is maximized for a selected level of failure probability. Second, the annual operating cost is minimized for given levels of water demand and failure probability. A detailed simulation model is used in the case study. Sensitivity analysis of the rule's parameters revealed a subset of insensitive parameters that allowed for rule simplification. Finally, the rule is validated through comparison with a number of heuristic rules also applied to the test case.</jats:p><jats:p>Appendices are available on microfiche.

We explored whether the CNS plans arm movements based entirely on the visual space kinematics of the movements, or whether the planning process incorporates specific details of the biomechanical plant to optimize the trajectory plan. Participants reached around an obstacle, the tip of which remained fixed in space throughout the experiment. When the obstacle and the start and target locations were rotated about the tip of the obstacle, the visually specified task constraints retained a rotational symmetry. If movements are planned in visual space, as indicated from a variety of studies on planar point-to-point movements, the resulting trajectories should also be rotationally symmetric across trials. However, systematic variations in movement path were observed as the orientation of the obstacle was changed. These path asymmetries can be accounted for by a class of models in which the planner reduces the likelihood of collision with the obstacle by taking into account the anisotropic sensitivity of the arm to external perturbations or uncertainty in joint level control or proprioception. The model that best matches the experimental results uses planning criteria based on the inertial properties of the arm.</jats:p>",

This project was initiated by the Research and Development groups of BP Exploration and Halliburton Energy Services, and sponsored by the European Union's Joule-THERMIE Program which supports the implementation of technology in Europe. The objectives of the project were to drill and complete a dual lateral well with commingled production, at minimum risk and cost, and to monitor and report the production performance. The difference between this project and the majority of multi-lateral wells drilled to date will be the installation of a cemented junction with connectivity, isolation and re-entry capability. The successful execution of this project will provide the industry with data on the long term performance of a cased hole, cemented, junction design. It will also provide production performance from a dual lateral well and give details of the challenges facing the management of such a well in a mature field environment. It is anticipated that this will lead to increases in the application of this technology, improve the economical recoverable reserves from mature fields and reduce the cost of new fields.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Multi-lateral wells offer innovative and economical ways to produce hydrocarbons. Economic analysis on Forties shows that for in-fill drilling, the cost to drill and complete a dual lateral well is less than the cost to re-drill two wells and becomes particularly attractive on platforms where the number of available well slots is limited. However, until recently, the application of multi-lateral wells was limited to wells that did not require through tubing reservoir access for stimulation or water, scale and sand management.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Junction construction advances through system development and testing by Longbottom demonstrated the possibility existed of cost effectively constructing and installing a design which provided isolation, access and connectivity. The experience and learning gained by the implementation of this project, enhances the ability to construct a cased and cemented dual lateral, operate each lateral as a separate well and perform those remedial operations presently available to the industry.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The risk and uncertainty surrounding a project of this nature means that without the support of programmes like THERMIE, initial economics are sensitive when it comes to applying new technology in a mature field environment such as Forties. Remaining well targets are relatively small and production is complicated by demands for sand, scale and water management. In-fill and sidetrack drilling is expected to continue at least until 1999. If the recent success of the in-fill program continues, some platforms will become slot constrained. The application of new technologies, like multilateral wells, are expected to enable more targets to be reached from fewer surface locations. This well is the first step in this new direction.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Forties Field Information</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Forties field (Fig. 1) was the first major oil field discovered in the British sector of the North Sea.

We compare the periods of 1968–77 (Labor) and 1978–87 (Likud) to determine whether differences in the stated economic ideologies of the Likud and Labor parties are reflected in their privatization policy. Furthermore, we examine whether there are differences in the techniques used to privatize by the Labor and the Likud parties. Although Labor and Likud policymakers may both choose privatization as a policy, different political environments and political bases may affect such choices. We explore the impact of these differences on the design of the specific privatization techniques selected, assess whether differences in the techniques exist, and attempt to account for such differences. Our analysis reveals that both Labor and Likud parties undertook similar privatization policies. The empirical findings contradict the hypothesis that ideological differences between the two large parties in Israel will be reflected in significant variation in privatization policy. There arc no significant differences between the two parties in number, type, or implementation of privatization policy. We find evidence that an important factor for all Israeli governments is budgetary pressure, operationalized as a deficit variable. We also find some difference between parties in the implementation of privatization, with Labor demonstrating a greater propensity to sell complete enterprises, and Likud engaging in more partial sales of state assets. We argue that this difference results from the differing ability of each party to negotiate with Israel's largest labor union. The fact that there were no significant differences in the number of actions taken by Likud and Labor administrations suggests that there are other barriers to this process. Two explanations for this process are indicated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The history of British local government since the 19th century reveals two opposite organisational tendencies. On the one hand there has been the entrenchment of a decentralised political structure based around the committee system; on the other hand there have been recurrent expressions of concern at the absence of executive unity within councils, and the development of a number of reintegrative corporate initiatives. Sometimes these initiatives have taken a political and sometimes a managerial form; the most prominent managerial expression of the pursuit of corporate cohesion is the post of chief executive, but this post is to varying degrees disabled by the absence of a cohesive political structure in those authorities where politicians actively seek to govern. It is only where politicians are relatively weak, and where local democratic accountability is attenuated and power transferred to the officers, that the post of chief executive can live up to its corporate expectations. The perpetuation of these circumstances reflects in part a reluctance amongst councillors to concentrate local political power in a centralised political executive; a reluctance which, in practice, plays into the hands of those who favour a managerialist future for local governance. </jats:p>",

This fieldwork has involved the delivery of two questionnaires, on the basis of which generalisation for this paper became possible. From the analysis of data pertaining to people's assessment of life quality in their residential environment, that is housing and neighbourhood, perceptual differences between the Arab households and the Jewish households seem to vary along a scale of spatial ethnic mixing and from city to city. The Jews appear more satisfied or happy than the Arabs in general and especially at the city level, but such differences are not always statistically significant. Evidence of less satisfied Jewish households, most notably with regard to their neighbourhood, was uncovered and was associated with the increase in the size of the Arab population in these city subareas. This evidence and that of a similar degree of ‘happiness' (or overlapping scores) emerged once the city subarea became the scale of analysis and once areas were grouped into various ranges of ethnic mixing. Shortages of housing in Arab areas and poor service provisions from the local government seem to structure the order of Arab household basic needs and thus inform their satisfaction priorities and levels.</jats:p>",

This paper concentrates on robot motion planning with uncertainty in both control and sensing, a problem that has already been well studied within the robotics community. First, a new and natural problem in this domain is defined: does there exists a sound and complete termination condition for a motion, given initial and goal locations? If yes, how to construct it? Then we define a high-level language, a logic of time and knowledge, which we use to reason about termination conditions and to state general conditions for the existence of sound and complete termination conditions in a broad domain. Finally, we show that sound termination conditions that are optimal in a precise sense provide a natural example of knowledge-based programs with multiple implementations.</jats:p>",

Not only does the state sponsor globalisation, but also it ‘globalises' itself in the process. Perhaps the most significant dimension of this new development is where labour markets are integrated with global capital circuits under state sanction. The systematic and state-promoted export of temporary migrant workers has transformed the Philippine state, economy, and society. In this paper I examine the globalisation of labour from the Philippines in terms of its magnitude, its historical development, and its impact on restructuring state functions. I argue that the shift of attention on the part of the state to maintaining the economic functions of international labour circuits tends to undermine its national regulatory function thereby compromising the broad legitimacy of the state. These propositions are examined through a case study of the structuring of the Filipino state in pursuing its well-known labour-export policy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By the mid-1970s it had become clear over much of the advanced capitalist world that rapid economic growth, profitable production, rising material living standards, and full employment had ceased to be simultaneously attainable objectives. Moreover, it was also clear that the mass economy had grave environmental impacts. We begin this paper by briefly considering this transition before going on to examine the nature of the contemporary unemployment problem and to evaluate current approaches to job creation. We go on to explore an alternative approach based upon a transition to a different development trajectory, to a more sustainable regime of accumulation and enabling a eco-Keynesian mode of regulation, that simultaneously addresses issues of job creation and environmental valorisation. The appropriate territorial basis of regulation within Europe is then discussed. Last, some conclusions are drawn and the sustainability of the alternative approach is discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers and other social scientists have paid considerable attention recently to what has been characterized as the increasingly social character of economic activity. Of particular interest has been the rise of more collaborative relations among firms and the formation of territorial production networks predicated upon joint product development and manufacturing, trust-based buyer—supplier interaction, and the freer exchange of proprietary information. Much of the empirical evidence for such claims comes from a relatively small number of regional case studies of particular industries which have enjoyed a high degree of economic success in recent years. At issue, however, is the extent to which such collaborative activity has diffused to other industries and other regions, especially the more mature industrial regions. Furthermore, even in cases where collaborative relationships have been documented, much debate remains over their effectiveness and the kinds of benefits arising from such activity, especially in North America. Previous research on the adoption and implementation of advanced manufacturing technology (AMT) in Ontario indicates that strong collaboration between AMT producers (largely outside the region) and AMT users is relatively rare. In this paper this work is deepened and extended by an examination of the frequency of collaboration, the forms such collaboration takes, and the factors which seem to be critical in determining whether or not firms will collaborate with one another. Evaluating the results of a survey analysis of AMT users, follow-up interviews both with users and with producers, and a comparison with the AMT sector in Germany, the authors conclude that the apparent scarcity of collaborative activity in the Ontario AMT industry is closely related to the physical and organizational distance between suppliers and customers, and also arises from the high degree of foreign ownership of AMT users in Ontario. They conclude that, despite the well-recognized rise of global economic players, nationality of ownership and geography still matter. </jats:p>",

They begin to fill a long-standing and, given the land management aims of planning, rather basic gap in the planning data record and have the potential to change the way in which we approach land-use studies and policy monitoring. LUCS data are derived from the process of updating Ordnance Survey mapping and, as a consequence, are recorded with a time lag between date of change and date of survey that varies according to survey regime and land-use type. In the analysis of LUCS data it is essential that an appropriate allowance is made for both the temporal and the spatial incidence of survey lags. In this paper we will discuss three approaches to reducing the impact of recording lags on particular types of substantive research: use of LUCS data based on analysis by survey year, the construction of robust indicators of land-use change, and the fitting of modelled lag descriptions. We conclude with a brief discussion of the implications for land-use theory in general. </jats:p>",

In this paper the authors, through an analysis of the relationship between traditional Thai cultural values, attitudes, and behavior regarding environmental issues, health and environmental practices, and policy, explore whether environmental policies in Thailand effectively reflect the needs of low-income urban communities. A survey of 515 slum dwellers in Bangkok reveals that behavior which improves the quality of life is related to a number of important attitudes as well as cultural values. Cultural values based on the Thai notion of individualism, for example, are an obstacle to community-based environmental behavior, An understanding of cultural values and their linkages to attitudes and behavior is thus critical to the design of more effective policies. </jats:p>",

The method is based on Lagrangian relaxation, decomposition technique and successive solution of dual and primal problems. The dual and primal problems are decomposed and solved using appropriate optimization methods, while Lagrangian multipliers are corrected using subgradient method. Dual hydro subproblems are solved using linearization and network flow method. Special modification of the algorithm is made so as to enable commitment of hydro power plants, taking into account bilogical constraints on minimal flow of water downstream of the hydro power plant.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The concept of the ‘relief‐to‐development continuum’ has been the subject of renewed interest in recent years. Concerned by the rise in relief budgets over the past decade and the absolute fall in development aid resources, support has been growing for the concept of developmental relief. In the context of complex political emergencies, it has been argued further that as effective development aid can reduce vulnerability to the impact of natural hazards, so it might also be used to contribute to a process of conflict prevention. In this way, the concept of the relief‐development continuum has become entwined with broader discussions about the contribution of official development assistance to conflict management.</jats:p><jats:p>Drawing on a Review of Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), this paper cautions against uncritical application of the concept of the continuum in complex political emergencies, and of rehabilitation in particular, in the current Sudanese context. It argues that in order to move legitimately from relief aid programming to development aid programming, three fundamental conditions must be in place: first, a minimum level of security, respect for human rights and humanitarian access. Second, empirical evidence from the field needs to demonstrate that the emergency is over. Finally, moving from relief to development aid programming is contingent on donor governments accepting the legitimacy of national governmental structures and of the rebel movements. In other words, for donor governments, moving along the continuum is in significant part determined by foreign policy considerations, not only technical ones. Consideration needs to be given to the actual and perceived legitimation of the different movements that a move to rehabilitation might be seen to imply.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper argues that none of these conditions had been satisfied in Sudan by mid‐1997. Instead of a process of normalisation paving the way to long‐term development, the current situation in Sudan is better described as a chronic political emergency. In such a context, uncritical pursuit of developmental strategies may negatively affect the welfare of conflict‐affected populations.</jats:p>",

In part 2, an empirical study is reported in which aggregate versions of those functions are calibrated for the supply of labour from mothers with young children and for the supply of childminding services. Special attention has been given to creating a meaningful measure of accessible childminding services. The results indicate that urban labour-market participation among mothers with young children is very responsive to the level of accessible childminders, ceteris paribus. Further, there is evidence that, at current levels of childminding activity in the cities studied, the elasticity of labour supply with respect to service supply is approximately unity, implying that child-care supply is a binding constraint on labour-force participation. Evidence is also found to support the view that childminder supply is quite insensitive to demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information theory analysis suggests that observed frequency distributions and intercorrelations of risk—benefit behaviors as determined from administrative data sets and surveys should characterize the internal structure of community-scale social networks, particularly in the context of social disintegration. This perspective further suggests that a ‘code’ is created using behaviors and correlated sequences of behaviors to overcome the noise generated by the oppressive externalities and consequent internal feedbacks causing community disorganization. The often-observed and highly destructive clustering of violence, substance abuse, and unsafe sexual activity appears as a consequence of a fundamental canonical mechanism (described by the Shannon—McMillan theorem) which favors intercorrelated meaningful sequences of behavioral or other signals to maximize the rate of transmission of information under noisy conditions. Such intercorrelation, in addition to accelerating the spread of infection carried by risk behaviors within marginalized communities, may cause their fragmented networks to become highly efficient compound channels, acting as bridges for the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other pathogens or behavioral pathologies from inner core groups to embedding majority populations. Individually oriented prevention programs addressing risk behaviors in ghettoized populations will thus have limited impact—particularly as strategies for the containment of infection—without a parallel address of the external marginalizing stressors which structure and enhance the value of such behaviors as useful symbols for communication. Without the introduction of new, politically based behaviors as alternative symbols within ‘core group’ communities, control of HIV and other pathogens seems unlikely in the United States. </jats:p>",
