Teaching in most paramedic training programs remains grounded in technical rationality. This does not adequately prepare practitioners for current day practice. Medical conditions often present as ill-defined problems. To deal with these situations, practitioners need problem solving and reflective-thinking skills. Methodologies incorporating the use of these skills in a contextual situation similar to actual practice may help paramedics develop these skills.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec id=\"S1049023X00037638_sec02\"><jats:title><jats:bold>Hypothesis:</jats:bold></jats:title><jats:p>This study sought to determine the impact of written scenario exercises in the context of clinical problems as a means of learning in order to foster higher level thinking skills and self-directed tendencies.

Chronic sublethal exposure to low pH reduced protein synthesis and degradation in both the gill and liver with little apparent impact on white muscle. As a result, protein was increased in the affected tissues. This suggested that both liver and gill have some capacity to compensate for the effects of acid exposure. The 2°C elevation in the normal temperature profile resulted in a slight increase in protein turnover in both gills and liver. However, during the period of peak water temperature, the 2°C elevation in temperature triggered a dramatic reduction in the protein turnover rates in these tissues. The exact mechanism by which these modifications in protein turnover occurred could not be clearly established. Overall, environmental acidification in combination with a summer global warming scenario would decrease fish growth and survival, most notably during periods of peak temperatures.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the CDAW 9C substorms is investigated in this paper using the database reported by Hones et al. and supplemented with magnetogram inversion technique (MIT) 2 data. These latter have provided information about the dynamics of the open tail magnetic flux, current systems in the ionosphere, and the size and dynamics of the current wedge. We have identified the growth, expansion, and recovery phases of this substorm, with characteristics expected from a generally accepted scenario. However, specific signatures were observed in the interval (0919‐0935) UT, i.e., between the growth and expansion phases, indicating the concurrent development of the substorm onset and corresponding instabilities in the innermost current sheet, and small‐scale cross‐tail current disruptions without the open tail reconnection. In addition to signatures of small‐scale dipolarization, an increase of the open tail magnetic flux, and a current system of the type close to <jats:italic>DP</jats:italic> 2 were observed at (0919‐0935) UT, which is more likely to suggest predominance of the tail‐stretching process than magnetic collapse. This fact was interpreted in terms of a relevant simple model as a signature of the growth of the energy input from the solar wind which ensures the observable disturbance power. Hence the disturbance at (0919‐0935) UT was more likely a driven one than an unloading one. The aforementioned signatures make it possible to identify the interval (0919‐0935) UT as the “phase of multiple onsets” or (equivalently) the “first active phase,” which was previously defined by <jats:italic>Mishin</jats:italic> [1991, and references therein] as one of the four standard phases of a typical substorm (in addition to the expansion phase). Thus the case study supports the substorm scenario with two active phases and, accordingly, with two different kinds of physics. This case study illustrates also the informativity of MIT 2 data and their ability to effectively complement the database traditionally used in substorm studies.</jats:p>",
