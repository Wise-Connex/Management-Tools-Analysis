      "abstract": "<jats:p> Theories of urban and regional planning have been deficient, neglecting to account sufficientlyfor its use as a tool of social control and oppression. The article argues that planning's well-documented progressive potential should be understood as being structurally accompanied by a more sinister dark side. It develops a conceptual framework within which the 'planning as control' can be theorized and studied, and by linking the public production of space to recent social science and Foucauldian debates on stateand nation-building. The framework delineates four principal dimensions: territorial, procedural, socioeconomic, and cultural, each with a capacity to influence intergroup relations. These dimensions should be understood as double-edged, with the influence of each potentially stretching between emancipatory reform and oppressive control. This article concludes by offering some explanations for the neglect of the dark side by most theorists, and by sketching a future agenda for a revised critical theory of planning. </jats:p>",

This article surveys a wide range of planning-related periodical literature and analyzes the history, rise, and geographic distribution of the use of the terms vision and visioning. Vision has evolved from a product, a pronouncement about the ftiture made by special people, into a visioning process in which whole communities participate. Vision has also come to have a metaphorical as well as a literal meaning. Pitfalls and cautionary points for planners are discussed because little critical thought has accompanied the profession's adoption cf vision and visioning. </jats:p>",

LCA methodology comprises: goal and scope definition, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation including options/proposals for the decision-making process. Energy and raw materials consumption as well as any emission into air, water, soil will be subject for the impact assessment and the subsequent interpretation. For the purpose of comparing the different options on decommissioning (e.g. disposal at sea/recycling and re-use onshore) of offshore installations, selected life stages (e.g. raw materials' sourcing, processing, manufacturing of the installation and decommissioning options) will be evaluated. The results of this LCA-based assessment can be used for those categories of offshore installations which are still subject for case-by-case decisions for a possible disposal at sea or alternative onshore treatment, including the recycling and/or re-use. Furthermore, LCA could assist in the development planning of offshore installations by indicating those life stages and processes where possible improvement/optimization with respect to energy/raw material consumption, installation/ de-installation processes and reduction of emissions can be achieved.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation activities are meanwhile well-established technologies all over the globe. There are estimations(1,3) about 6,000.6,500offshore installations. They are distributed in:–Gulf of Mexico (4,000)–Asia (950)–Middle East (750) and–North Sea (600).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The construction, installation and performance of these oil and gas exploitation platforms was developed during the last 30 years to a hightechnology sector. The large majority of stationary platforms (&amp;gt; 80%) are frame-shaped steel platforms, so called jacket platforms. They are used in different water depths (some 10 to 200 m) and their weights range from about 400 t (e.g. 150 t superstructure, 250 t substructure) up to 77,000 t (e.g. 31,000 t superstructure, 46,000 t substructure). Other types of platforms include the gravity base platforms which have a flat foundation. Their stability is created through high volumes of concrete and other filling materials (e.g. sand/gravel) used in substructures. These large platforms are used at water depths between 70 and 200 m, their superstructures have weights between 11,000 and 54,000 t and their substructures between 130,000 t and 800,000 t. These figures also illustrate the efforts which are necessary to be taken when decommissioning these installations after their average life-time of use, i.e. after about 20 to 30 years. There are different solutions which might be taken and which were taken in the past:–Leaving the platform fully in place: no further use, but maintenance/surveillance required and equipped with sea markings; utilization for a different purpose, e.g. monitoring station.–Partial removal down to a specified water depth (55 m, IMO): partial removal and dumping/emplacement at site; transport to and treatment on land (re-use/recycling disposal).–Complete removal: dumping/emplacement on site; transport and dumping at deep sea locations; transport to and treatment on land (re-use/recycling disposal).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The complete removal and transportltreatment onshore would be the most appropriate option under the aspects of:controlled waste treatment including re-use and recycling;–proper waste management according to mostly adopted and practiced procedures as</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The redevelopment of the existing Ekofisk Center comprising ten platforms with two new platforms, 2/4X and 2/45, brought about the challenge to drastically reduce the operating costs to support the extension of the economic life well into the next century. The new Ekofisk II facilities including pipelines have a design life to year 2028, extending the field life from the original production license end date of year 2011. The design accommodates 20 meters of total subsidence. The new platforms are based on the best available proven technology. The design is based on life cycle cost effectiveness. Equipment supplier involvement and functional specifications have been implemented. Operations and maintenance expertise have been an integral part of the project team to ensure that the design is geared toward cost effective maintenance. Planning for low operating costs through lifetime have included measures from the very start of the project through all phases of the project. At the heart of these measures has been a systematic approach to through lifetime cost considerations as well as extensive involvement of operations personnel from day one. The new fit for purpose facilities with reduced staffing requirements have provided the basis for achieving a cost effective operation of Ekofisk.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Ekofisk Area fields (Production License 018) comprise eight fields in the southern part of the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea, Figure 1. The Ekofisk Field development has since the discovery in 1969 followed by a pilot production start in 1971, progressed through several phases the last being the implementation of full field waterflood. Figure 2 shows the historic and forecasted Ekofisk Field BOE production profile. The first Ekofisk Field permanent development installations which became operational in 1974, consisted of three drilling and production platforms (2/4A, 2/4B and 2/4C), a field terminal platform (2/4FTP), a concrete gravity base crude oil storage tank (2/4T) and quarters platform (2/4Q). Crude oil export was through offshore buoy loading and gas was either injected or flared. A subsequent phase included the installation of export pipelines for oil and gas and further facilities for processing (2/4T), export of crude oil (2/4P) and export of gas (2/4R). Export of crude oil commenced in 1975 and gas in 1977. Parallel activities included the development of most other fields in the Production License 018 area all which were tied into the central processing and transportation facilities at the Ekofisk Field. The West Ekofisk and Cod Fields came on stream in 1997, the Tor Field in 1978, the Albuskjell, Eldfisk and Edda Fields in 1979 and the Embla Field in 1993. Several third party fields have also been tied into the central facilities at Ekofisk for processing and/or transportation. This includes the Ula and Gyda Fields operated by BP, the Tommeliten Field operated by Statoil, the Valhall and Hod Fields operated by Amoco and Norsk Hydro's Mime Field (now shut down).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Western nations have learned hard lessons about the consequences of not considering ecological process and structures when undertaking land use planning, development, and when harvesting resources. As a result, modern concepts of conservation biology and landscape level planning have developed and are beginning to be implemented in North America, Europe, Australia and portions of South America. An approach to ecological based landscape planning, as developed through several applications in Canada, is discussed. The approach incorporates principles of conservation biology and relies heavily on abiotic landscape components for mapping and interpretation. Landscape planning is defined and discussed according to three key components: (1) the planning framework; (2) ecological analysis; and (3) implementation of the whole. The planning framework includes the goals and objectives of the plan which is based on prevailing socio‐cultural values. The analysis attempts to determine full landscale representivity then maximize ecological integrity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A substantial literature has developed regarding the relationship between migration and housing tenure in Britain. It has been argued that, although those moving into council (public sector) housing are more likely to move than those moving into owner-occupied housing, administrative controls restrict potential population movement into council housing over long distances. Others have criticised this argument suggesting that council residents are typically individuals who are less likely to migrate over long distances regardless of the administrative restrictions imposed upon them. Accordingly, it is important to control for individual characteristics before the independent effect of tenure on mobility can be determined. This paper is a report of an investigation of this relationship in the South East of England, in which the Sample of Anonymised Records, a unique individual-level British data source for this type of study, were used. The study continues with a consideration of the influence of housing on migration into the South East from the North of Britain for those in manual and nonmanual occupations. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a discharge planning protocol in identifying elderly patients' home care needs. The sample in this quasiexperimental study consisted of 507 hospitalized patients age 65 years or older. The control group received the usual hospital discharge planning protocol. In the experimental group, nurse/social worker teams coordinated the discharge planning process, using an adapted form of the Discharge Planning Questionnaire (DPQ) to identify the home care needs of elderly patients. Thirty days after hospital discharge, both patient groups participated in a telephone survey to obtain information about health care problems they experienced during home recovery and their use of health care resources.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The findings indicated that the majority of the elderly patients had functional dependencies, which required the help of another person to carry out daily household duties and provide assistance with basic needs, especially ambulation. These functionally dependent patients only received home care referrals about 50% of the time. These findings raise questions about current reimbursable services. Logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with increased functional dependency and patient problems during home recovery had a greater likelihood of rehospitalization and emergency department usage. This information about the home care of elderly patients after hospitalization supports the need for comprehensive functional assessment as part of discharge planning. This study also suggests that the nurse/social worker team can provide effective screening and discharge planning coordination of home care. Physician involvement and effective communication networks must be in place.</jats:p>",

As such MRI has great potential in the radiotherapy (RT) planning of brain tumours. However MRI has rarely been used alone as the basis for treatment planning primarily due to concern over potential geometric distortions. Treatment planning using MRI has therefore usually been carried out in conjunction with CT images. This work demonstrates that geometric distortions can be minimized by using a relatively small field-of-view, an increased receiver bandwidth, and a fast spin echo acquisition sequence, and that it is thus possible to perform RT planning using MRI.</jats:p>",

This surplus is called the ‘inefficiency of regional labour markets’—the degree to which potential labour-force resources among the nonparticipants could be further mobilised given the actual unemployment rate. Starting with 130 regions across eight member states of the European Union, two nonemployment frontier models are estimated, one for men and one for women, with annual data derived from Eurostat, 1983–89. It turns out that, on average, 1.9% of the male and 4.8% of the female working-age population could be further mobilised, and that, consequently, the actual unemployment rate is underestimated by 2.8% overall. In addition, a test has been performed as to whether the inefficiency estimates are related to participation, employment, or unemployment figures. It appears that unemployment figures in particular are extremely bad predictors. </jats:p>",

It highlights five considerations that may help reduce student anxiety and improve both the experience of writing and the product: selecting topics, making the writing task as authentic and communicative as possible, providing the language supports necessary for success in a second language context, choosing forms with an appropriate amount of text, and choosing forms governed by an appropriate number of rules.

A range of census variables are examined in three ‘SAR districts’ (local authority districts with populations of 120 000 or more, or combinations of contiguous districts with smaller populations) in England. Results of comparable analyses from the 1986 Australian census are also given. The ecological fallacy arises when results from an analysis based on area-level aggregate statistics are incorrectly assumed to apply at the individual level. In general the results are different because individuals in the same area tend to have similar characteristics: a phenomenon known as within-area homogeneity. A statistical model is presented which allows for within-area homogeneity. This model may be used to explain the effects of aggregation on variances, covariances, and correlations. A methodology is introduced which allows aggregate-level statistics to be adjusted by using individual-level information on those variables that explain much of the within-area homogeneity. This methodology appears to be effective in adjusting census data analyses, and the results suggest that the SAR is a valuable source of adjustment information for aggregate data analyses from census and other sources. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> British ethnic minority unemployment rates are considerably higher than those of the white population. In 1991 the ethnic minority unemployment rate was more than double that of the white majority. One possible explanation is that Britain's ethnic minorities are concentrated in areas of economic disadvantage. The authors use the 2% Individual Sample of Anonymised Records (SAR) in conjunction with area-based census data for pseudo travel-to-work areas, to explore the relative importance of individual characteristics and area characteristics on ethnic minority unemployment rates. Multilevel modelling techniques are employed to estimate simultaneously variations between individuals and between areas after allowing for variables measured at both levels of analysis. The most important differences in the propensity to unemployment are shown to be between individuals, and, compared with whites, ethnic minority groups are shown to be disadvantaged wherever they live. In general, there is also evidence of greater variation in ethnic minority unemployment between areas than there is for whites. However, there is the same underlying geography of unemployment for the black and white populations, but a slightly different pattern for Asian ethnic groups. These differences can be explained only partially by area-level characteristics. In all, it is argued that at the spatial scale which is identifiable in the Individual SAR, ethnic minority unemployment cannot be attributed to geographical distribution, though data at a finer geographical scale are needed to test this hypothesis more fully. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a critical examination is made of the alleged change in the branch-plant economy. It is claimed that a new type of branch plant is emerging, with more progressive implications for local economic development. This argument is reviewed with reference to in situ restructuring in existing brownfield plants in the automobile industry. Empirical evidence is examined from ‘Motor Co.’ and ‘Car Co.’ (pseudonyms) in Riverside, across several dimensions of change: role and autonomy; labour process; labour-management relations; labour-market strategies; supplier linkages; and local economic development implications. It is argued that changes in branch plants and their implications for local economies can be understood by addressing the interrelations between structure, agency, and contingency. Evidence of change from Motor Co. and Car Co. in Riverside suggest some heightening of plant responsibility, the limited upgrading of functions, and the introduction of new techniques. The changes are partial, revealing the overlap of new and old practices, and the benefits for local economic development appear limited. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it is shown how corporate culture can concurrently be advantageous and burdensome within the same firm. Indeed, it is argued that the strength of Sainsbury's corporate culture prevented it from reacting to competitive changes rocking its ‘home’ market in the early 1990s. However, the very corporate culture that was becoming increasingly inappropriate within the UK food retailing market was being successfully employed ‘abroad’ by Sainsbury. In the paper it is demonstrated that the ‘Sainsburyisation’ of its US subsidiary, Shaw's Supermarkets, released Shaw's from its limited trajectory of growth. It is suggested that this move will allow Shaw's to become an increasingly important source of capital accumulation for the Sainsbury Group once opportunities within the ‘home’ market decline further. </jats:p>",

Thus, increases in incidence had a larger impact for women than for men on resulting life-years with visual disability, reducing the proportion of remaining disability-free life by 2.1%. When mortality continued to decrease but incidence increased and recovery decreased, there was an increase in life expectancy, although for women this was offset by an even greater increase in years spent with visual disability.

Although the experiences gained by these schools in curriculum design and planning have not been recorded in the literature they are likely to be of interest to other medical schools still contemplating course revision. The medical school at the University of Liverpool recently launched an integrated problem‐based course differing radically from its predecessor. The General Medical Council considered integration of contributing disciplines one of the most important aims of reform, yet courses that integrate independent component disciplines may be perceived by staff as threatening due to the loss of structure and disciplinary autonomy. Strategies for early course development must take account of these concerns as well as dealing with the identification of course content. A multidisciplinary consensus group process, designed to combat some of these problems, was employed to identify the learning objectives and core content for the new course. The purpose of this paper is to describe, first, the processes employed to identify the core palliative care component for a new PBL curriculum and secondly, how these objectives were integrated horizontally and vertically throughout all course elements.</jats:p>",

This problem, in fact, corre sponds to a special case of the weighted region problem, in which the environment is partitioned into a set of regions, with some regions (obstacles) having an associated weight of oo and other regions (free space) having a weight of 1. For the general weighted region problem, the environment consists of regions, each of which is as sociated with a certain weight factor. A path through the weighted region incurs a cost that is determined by the geometric distance of the path in that region times that region's weight factor. The weighted region problem can be used to model path planning for autonomous vehicles over different environmental terrains. This paper studies the problem of computing a shortest path between two distinct locations through a 2D or 3D environment consisting of weighted regions. The authors propose a novel cell decomposi tion approach based on new framed-subspace data structures: the weighted framed-quadtree and the weighted framed-octree. </jats:p>",

By combining the use of a clinically verified barium‐coated template and interactive computed tomography (SIM/Plant, Columbia Scientific, Inc., Columbia, Maryland), the implant team can determine and address the relevant issues affecting treatment outcomes. Those issues include: implant‐prosthesis incompatibility, recognition of anatomic limitations and anomalies, the need for presurgical bone augmentation, implant diameter and distribution, abutment type and angle, bone density, soft tissue augmentation requirements, accurate fee determination, and medicolegal protection. The data collection methodology and format for the Mecall and Rosenfeld prosthesis prediction analysis are discussed as part of case presentation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Census data can be represented both as lists and as tabulations of household/individual attributes. List representation of Census data offers greater flexibility, as the exploration of interrelationships between population characteristics is limited only by the quality and scope of the data collected. Unfortunately, the released lists of household/individual attributes (Samples of Anonymised Records, SARs) are spatially referenced only to areas (single or merged districts) with populations of 120 000 or more, whereas released tabulations are available for units as small as single enumeration districts (Small Area Statistics, SAS). Intuitively, it should be possible to derive list-based estimates of enumeration district populations by combining information contained in the SAR and the SAS. In this paper we explore the range of solutions that could be adapted to this problem which, ultimately, is presented as a complex combinatorial optimisation problem. Various techniques of combinatorial optimisation are tested, and preliminary results from the best performing algorithm are evaluated. Through this process, the lack of suitable test statistics for the comparison of observed and expected tabulations of population data is highlighted. </jats:p>",

METHODS: A consecutive series of 200 women attending an abortion clinic in Yerevan, Armenia, were queried by a physician about their reproductive histories. RESULTS: Women younger than 20 years of age reported a median of 1 and women older than 40 years reported a median of 8 induced abortions in their lifetimes (overall median = 3). Lack of contraceptive information was the major reason cited for not using contraception. CONCLUSIONS: Induced abortion is the major form of birth control among parous Armenian women. Concerted public health campaigns are needed to inform women and their physicians in Armenia and other Eastern European countries about alternative contraceptive methods. </jats:p>",
