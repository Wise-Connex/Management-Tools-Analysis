      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of new group process techniques in the review of projects and in developing plans and policies can result in meetings that are more civil, more efficient, more satisfying to participants, and more useful in terms of the information that is generated. However, planners need to be aware that facilitated processes can be used to deflect discussion of value issues, to control difficult participants, and to manipulate participative processes. While the techniques of improved facilitation practices are much discussed and new checklists for improved facilitation tactics are being developed, larger issues about deliberative politics, about the relationships between facilitated meetings and agency agendas, and about the criteria for appraising the outcomes of facilitated processes are not yet getting the attention they deserve. This essay describes the extensive use of group processes for planning in a variety of substantive settings in Hawaii. Based on this experience, we offer some norms of good practice that indicate how we might be more attentive to the micro-politics of group processes and their use in planning processes. </jats:p>",

They also provide an analysis of the advice on housing land provision in the Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) series, picking out similarities and differences in the approach taken by the Secretary of State for the Environment in each region. They conclude with some thoughts on the appropriateness of current mechanisms for the allocation of future housing requirements at the strategic or regional level. </jats:p>",

We argue that it is the impacts of urban development on outputs, not on inputs, that are of fundamental concern. Moreover, we provide evidence that inputs are often a poor proxy for outputs, and so we call upon the planning profession to rethink its approach to fiscal impact analysis. To this end we outline a conceptual framework for fiscal impacts and articulate a strategy by which it can be applied across a range of diverse services provided by local governments. </jats:p>",

Each repair option for eliminating the infiltration or inflow has a unique cost and efficiency. A general Benders decomposition model was developed to optimize the repair and replacement strategy for a sewer network. The model determines the least cost solution by minimizing the combined wastewater treatment and repair costs. The results of a detailed analysis of an existing sewer are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To date, guidelines and strategies for the siting process, including planner intervention, have arisen from conflict surrounding locally unwanted land uses (LULUs). The task of changing an existing unwanted land use has not received equal attention, and this task poses special problems for parties involved in the decision-making process. The issues, the space of alternative solutions, and some consequences of limited planner involvement are illustrated with a case: the closing down of the GSX Chemical Services of Ohio hazardous waste processing facility in Cleveland. The unpredictability and poor quality of outcomes, as well as the costs of conflict to the host community, illustrated by this case suggest the need for proactive planner participation in such changes. We use the GSX case to examine specific aspects of change in existing unwanted land uses and the potential benefits of using planners' skills and their position as active negotiators on behalf of the public interest. We explore some ways in which planner intervention could enable a transparent decision-making process that is inclusive of all concerns, whether represented or not, and that is based on accurate and shared information. </jats:p>",

It is found that a few councillors with agricultural or rural connections were able to overturn policies and the recommendations of planning officers. The authors conclude with a discussion of the implications of the findings for the British planning system, which still treats each application for development on its own merits rather than in the more mechanistic zoning system practised elsewhere. </jats:p>",

In order to meet delivery contracts, this invariably requires the addition of relatively expensive compression facilities that boost production by lowering the bottom-hole pressure and improving the drawdown across the sandface.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper analyzes the compressor installation costs and operating strategy required to meet the production goals over the life of a gasfield, and proposes a simulation solution based on optimizing overall profitability. Key elements of the objective function to be optimized include a time-dependent revenue stream based on the projected price of gas, capital costs associated with adding incremental compression at periodic intervals, and compressor fuel consumption costs that are typically a near-linear function of the operating horsepower.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The optimization model proposed is applied to an example gasfield for a fifteen-year operating strategy.

There is usually significant hydraulic interaction between the wells, with back-pressures at separation and treatment facilities controlling the overall rate of production. Increased production from a well results in a correspondingly higher back-pressures on adjacent wells that share a common flowline. This in turn causes a reduction in their rates of production. Single-well nodal analysis-based methods for evaluating productivity must therefore be eliminated in favor of a network model of the overall gathering system.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>As reservoir pressure declines, existing production from a field can only be maintained by adding compression. Long-term delivery contracts can require the operator to add compression several times over the life of the field.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In this paper, we develop a time-dependent network model of a gas field. The model includes the interaction between wells, flowlines, surface facilities, and the reservoir. The interactions with the latter are accomplished by incorporating simple relationships between pressure decline and reservoir inflow. An economic model is then generated from the field model. This is accomplished by defining a profit function that measures the difference between gas revenues and the compression costs that drive the production of gas. Lastly, we maximize the profit function by considering variations in compressor operational strategies that are consistent with a long-term contract for the field.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The optimization algorithm used is based on the Successive Quadratic Programming (SQP) technique, a nonlinear approach that has been applied successfully to problems with multiple decisions variables in the process simulation industry.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The field-wide, time-dependent network model, coupled with the economic model of the compressor operation strategy, and integrated with the SQP optimization algorithm, has been developed with NETOPTTM, a commercial field-planning and optimization tool for single-phase and multiphase production systems.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>II.

At the city level, our objective was to utilize the findings of the studies to identify interventions that would improve the economics of the trade and the safety of the food the vendors sold. These interventions were to recognize and support the critical role women, as well as men, play in each city’s trade. At the international level, our objective was to influence the organizations and debates that shape food policies. Chapter 9 illustrates how these twin goals played out in the food arena. At the local level, training programs in food handling replaced sporadic enforcement of unrealistic health standards in many cities. At the macro policy level, the EPOC studies helped reorient public health experts, particularly at the Food and Agricultural Organization, away from the support of stringent laws restricting the sale of food on the streets, toward a recognition of the value of the trade.</jats:p>",

Some 40 wells could be drilled with through tubing technology in the next 5 years. Typical candidates are wells targeted at reserves that would otherwise be marginal if drilled conventionally (0.5 – 1.0 MMstb), and water injector sidetracks to back produce the aquifer during depressurisation.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To establish whether the concept was viable for Brent, a well was sidetracked from the Delta platform during Q3 '95. The well, BD38, was drilled to TD and completed, despite the challenges presented by the complex well trajectory. The success of this well can largely be attributed to meticulous planning and co-ordination by the multi-disciplinary team which comprised Well Engineers, PEs, the selected contractor and alliance Partners.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Background</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>A significant proportion of the remaining reserves of the Brent field, the so called Locate The Remaining Oil (LTRO) portfolio, possibly some 10 MMstb, is unlikely to be recoverable economically with conventional wells. These smaller prospects, with reserves typically between 0.5 and 1.0 MMstb, will be sacrificed unless a viable alternative to conventional drilling and completion technology can be developed, and within a relatively short time frame. Currently, coiled tubing drilling appears to offer that alternative; a number of wells having already been drilled successfully utilising this technology, both by the Shell Group and within the industry at large. In addition to the LTRO wells, a further application would be mechanical sidetracks, and sidetracks of the former water injectors, the (BPW) wells that will be used to back produce the aquifer during the latter stages of Brent de-pressurisation. In the base case, up to some 30 of these wells are anticipated to require sidetracking from 1998, both for mechanical reasons, to by pass selective completion components over the reservoir section, (Multi Straddle Assemblies) and to install sand control to protect the ESPs and facilities. If coiled tubing technology can be utilised for this application, not only would substantial CAPEX savings be realised, but all operations could be carried out underbalance.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The time remaining to develop the oil reserves associated with the LTRO prospects is limited due to the imminent depressurisation and consequential lift loss. These prospects should be drilled by end 1998 or reserves could be sacrificed.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In view of the perceived long term strategic benefits of coiled tubing drilling, and the limited time frame, a well was selected from the LTRO inventory to trial the technology. The objectives of this well were twofold. The first was economic, to access and safeguard reserves. The second was strategic, i.e. to prove that the application of coiled drilling technology is viable in the Brent field. More specifically: Reserves. To provide a Statfjord (sandstone,) reservoir offtake point in an area of sub-optimal well spacing.; developing reserves anticipated to be in the order of 0.8 MMstb.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Strategic. To establish:the real economic benefit of drilling, logging and completing a well with coiled tubing.the practicality of running and cementing long, small diameter liners on CTthe practicalities of logging (open/cased hole) coiled tubing drilled wells.the (life cycle) practicalities of maintaining and surveying a slim hole horizontal well.that (heavy) Coiled Tubing equipment can be located on the Brent platforms.the feasibility of undertaking CTD concurrently with main rig activity.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>If the concept was to be proven for Brent, all of these strategic questions had to be answered. A stepped development approach was considered but it was felt that, if correctly managed and risk assessed, all of the strategic questions could be addressed simultaneously. In any event, the tight depressurisation time frame precluded protracted development schedules.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>CANDIDATE SELECTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Candidate selection was both time consuming and involved.

Although they are intended to simplify the planning process, some of these tables may lead to misallocation of family resources. The tables generally purport to show how much money parents must save monthly tofund four years of college at a specifiedfuture date. We demonstrate that these tables often employflawed methodology. Upon correction (and given reasonable assumptions about investor behavior, growth rates in tuition costs, and investment yields), the monthly savings necessary tofund a given level of college expenses can be substantially less than those reported. Additionally, published tables typically provide the planner with a limited range of investment yield assumptions, suggesting a narrow range of porrfolio possibilities. We provide a series of tables which allow the financial planner to estimate required savings for various combinations of investment yields and tuition growth rates.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Over 140 horizontal wells have been drilled targeting the complex Gharif, Al Khlata and Haima clastic reservoirs. In the early horizontal drilling campaign, vertical and deviated pilot holes were required prior to horizontal drilling in the unpredictable Al Khlata glacial reservoirs. The success ratio was initially low but has greatly improved with the application of high resolution 3D seismic and reservoir modelling techniques which have improved understanding of the 3D geological model. These tools have permitted the prediction of reservoir geometry, sand development and hydrocarbon distribution and reduced structural uncertainties. Initial productivity and ultimate recoveries of successful horizontal wells have been improved by a factor of 3 and 1.5 respectively over that of vertical wells. Well costs have been reduced by improving the completion design and applying recently developed drilling technologies and practices. The subsurface geology model is constantly updated with new well data thus continuing the trend of better prediction and planning of horizontal wells.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Nimr Field, one of the largest oil field in South Oman, was discovered in 1980 and brought onto production in 1985 (Fig. 1). The field is a northeast-southwest trending, elongated anticline bound by major faults to the southwest and northwest. It extends over an area of approximately 200 km2 with a relatively thin oil column (20-85 m). To date 340 wells have been drilled, of which 140 are horizontal. The field is currently producing at an average daily rate of 15,600 m3/day oil with 80% water cut. The main reservoirs are Haima, Al Khlata and Gharif sandstones containing some 430 million m3 of STOIIP with an Ultimate Recovery of 46 million m3. The oil is heavy (density 927 kg/m3, 210 API) and viscous (400 mPa.s). More than 80% of the STOIIP is in the relatively thin oil columns of the Haima and Al Khlata reservoirs which directly overlie a massive Haima aquifer while the Gharif produces under moderate edge water drive.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Initially the field was developed with a production rate of 5,000 m3/d and an Ultimate Recovery of 7% by vertical wells on 600 m spacing. A comparison of actual performance of vertical and horizontal wells was undertaken after the drilling of 22 horizontal wells during 1990–92. These wells were drilled in areas of different geology and column length. The results were encouraging: the initial oil production potential of the horizontal wells was on average a factor of 4.3 higher than for the nearby vertical producers. The cumulative oil produced at water breakthrough (20% water cut) is on average a factor of 2.1 more than for vertical wells. At present, the field is developed with horizontal wells on 172 m spacing with an average recovery factor of 18%. Over 140 horizontal wells have been drilled so far with an initial productivity estimated to be 3 times that of vertical wells and the Ultimate Recovery 1.5 times greater.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper focuses on how the enhanced 3D reservoir characterization and multi-disciplinary approaches in well planning, targeting and monitoring have improved productivity and oil recoveries. It will also demonstrate how the implementation of recently developed technologies together with improved drilling practices have had a direct impact on cost reduction. Three case histories of wells drilled in different geological settings will be demonstrated, which highlight the impact of these technologies and techniques on the planning of optimal horizontal wells.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Reservoir Characterisation:</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Hi-Resolution 3D Seismic</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The first 3D seismic survey in the Nimr Field was acquired in 1989 and revealed a complex structural framework of the dissected field culminations separated by Al Khlata glacial valleys with heterogeneous fill.

Deriving long-range plans from a portfolio of reserves to satisfy a nominated crude and gas liquid market is a complex endeavour; ensuring that the physical constraints (reservoir production capacity, surface facility handling capacity, crude quality specifications) and strategic objectives (management overrides) are satisfied whilst achieving an economic optima is rarely contemplated without the support of advanced mathematical programming tools.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Initial pioneering efforts to apply mathematical programming to KOC's planning problems some 30 odd years ago produced useful results, but failed to have a major impact on KOC's investment strategies. Technological limitations caused this stunted benefit - the available mathematical programming software yielded an unwieldy and inflexible model whose solution on the most advanced computers of that day required extended calculation times on computers located far offshore Kuwait. These complications prevented KOC's planning staff from gaining full understanding of the planning tool's capabilities and from establishing a responsive dialogue with the decision makers for whom the tool was intended. The present model overcomes these drawbacks via use of new advanced mathematical programming software and a modern computer platform. As a result, solutions are obtained in-house quickly by KOC's planners.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Current Evaluation Process</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>At present, multidisciplinary teams promote long-range production forecasts and development plans for their geographical areas of responsibility. These areas encompass several fields (consisting of one or more overlying reservoirs) producing to surface facilities consisting of Gathering Centers (GC) and gas Booster Stations (BS). Some teams take an integrated reservoir management approach, whilst others prefer a functional approach, relying on prior studies conducted by external consulting groups. In some instances the surface handling facilities are integrated with the reservoir studies, in other instances the problem is analysed in a segmented manner according to functional responsibility; one group handling oil, the other gas, another evaluating water treatment facilities requirements; the economic analyses are conducted by yet another group. Area plans are promoted, consisting of several preferred alternatives designed to satisfy each area's specific objectives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The inclusion of planning time in semi-direct oral interaction tests adds consider ably to the overall length of the test, and it is important to be clear that the increase in length is justified by the language outcome. Previous research has shown that the effect of planning time in second language can differentially influence the resultant discourse with planned discourse eliciting more complex language on a range of measures. However, where planning time has been provided it has gener ally been a substantial amount of time (ten minutes or more), and in a second language classroom situation, rather than a testing situation. Where planning time is provided in an oral interaction test it is generally limited to one or two minutes. In this study planning time was manipulated as a variable in a trial administration of a semi-direct test. Discourse analytic techniques were then used to determine the nature and/or significance of differences in the elicited discourse across the two conditions in terms of complexity and accuracy. In addition, candidates were divided into high-proficiency versus low-proficiency groups. The findings suggest that for the high-proficiency candidates, planning time may improve accuracy on some measures where the cognitive load of the task is high, but that this effect does not extend to the low-proficiency candidates. </jats:p>",

NEPA, however, incorporates the components of a quality public interdisciplinary planning process. The components that make NEPA a powerful planning process—recognition of the role of uncertainty, interpersonal collaboration, nonlinear processes, and decision making with administrative and political risk—tend to make NEPA discomforting, at best, to many managers and practitioners. NEPA is not about more “bullet‐proof” documents, more talented writers, more thorough data, more controllable public involvement processes, or even correct decisions. NEPA is about more participatory planning, incorporating the “messy” human components of values, politics, change, uncertainty, risk, strategy, emotions, and the diversity of personalities and life experiences that shape ourselves, our coping mechanisms, and our relationships. This article evaluates NEPA from the human standpoint and outlines six general techniques for effectively implementing the systematic interdisciplinary approach to planning required by NEPA.</jats:p>",

The stance adopted here is that questions are misguided because they focus on firm size as an independent variable to explain job generation or firm performance. Following a critical overview of data-related and analytical issues, I argue that problems as well as tactics conventionally associated with large firms may also characterize SMEs as they develop strategies to cope with new pressures in the global economy. Corporate culture, including the culture of both labor and management, as well as ability and willingness of labour and management to collaborate and implement new strategies, condition firm behavior and affect competitiveness, irrespective of firm size. Substantial variation in context (national as well as subnational) also affects firm behavior and prompts reevaluation and empirical substantiation of conventional assumptions about firm size that have governed the debate. Some SMEs may contribute to local economic development through a variety of processes. However, sanguine views about SME competitiveness must be tempered by the understanding that corporate welfare commonly occurs at the expense of worker welfare. This latter problem is considered inherent in the traditional Anglo-American Taylorist approach to production, irrespective of firm size. General policy guidelines are offered to integrate goals of production and consumption so that policies to develop corporate and worker welfare reinforce rather than counteract one another. </jats:p>",

The problem of multimodal function optimization is framed within a hypothesize-and-test paradigm using minimal representation size (minimal complexity) for species formation and a GA. A multiple-population GA is developed to identify different species. The number of populations, thus the number of different species, is determined by the minimal representation size criterion. Therefore, the proposed algorithm reveals the unknown structure of the multimodal function when a priori knowledge about the function is unknown. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of multimodal test functions. The proposed scheme results in a highly parallel algorithm for finding multiple local minima. In this paper, a path-planning algorithm is also developed based on the MRSC-GA algorithm. The algorithm utilizes MRSC_GA for planning paths for mobile robots, piano-mover problems, and N-link manipulators. The MRSC_GA is used for generating multipaths to provide alternative solutions to the path-planning problem. The generation of alternative solutions is especially important for planning paths in dynamic environments. A novel iterative multiresolution path representation is used as a basis for the GA coding. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated on a number of two-dimensional path-planning problems. </jats:p>",

Meanwhile, a stagnant labor market for low-skilled workers, and the rising cost of living in the locality, further stimulated caseload increases.

First, a brief outline is provided of the concept of the global city and the related interpretations of urban manufacturing change. We then examine the relevance of global-city hypotheses, focusing on three different empirical aspects of London's manufacturing in the 1980s—employment change, floorspace and land-use issues, and change in firm stock, output, and productivity. The conclusion is that the ‘crowding-out’ hypothesis of manufacturing change expressed in the literature on global cities is not demonstrated by the existing evidence, and that such an hypothesis is an oversimplified way of examining the complexities of manufacturing change across London over this period. </jats:p>",

This article explains the need to place land use planning at Department of Energy (DOE) sites into a larger regional planning context by drawing on the example of recent research conducted by the authors at the Savannah River Site.

The process of economic restructuring, together with a raft of centrally determined urban policy measures which have transformed the modus operandi of the local state, have made governing at the local level a more complex and more fragmented task. In this context of shifting relations between business, state, and urban policy, I examine the role of business in the regeneration of Sheffield and assess whether local business leaders have been able to establish a distinctive business-oriented agenda for regeneration. In the analysis I trace the evolution of business participation in the city's regeneration network, and reveal the struggles faced by the business community in the process of coalition building. A further aim in the paper is to examine the relevance of growth-coalition and urban-regime theories in interpreting the role of local business leaders in the changing landscape of urban governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Anecdotal evidence indicates that community opposition has become intensified and more focused on human service facilities over the past decade. The irrational, selfish, and exclusionary tendencies often associated with the NIMBY (not in my backyard) syndrome do not reflect the complexity inherent in local responses to controversial human services, such as mental health care facilities. In this paper I instead develop a framework incorporating the broader structure of social relations to explain local response to mental disability. In this framework I posit that marginalized representations of mental disability based in a continuum of stigma lead to rejecting attitudes and behavior.</jats:p><jats:p>The first national survey of attitudes toward controversial human services conducted in the USA ( N = 1326) provides the data for exploring the spatial dimensions of resident acceptance and rejection. Results of a multivariate analysis indicate that the spatial dimensions of community response are linked to both the structure of attitude dimensions and the spatial location of respondents. The national survey points to three principal attitude types concerning mental disability: social restrictiveness, liberal support, and a NIMBY-type response. The rejection types of attitudes (social restrictiveness and NIMBY) tend to be reflective of attitudes in the Midwest and South, whereas the acceptance attitude type (liberal support) is more reflective of the Pacific region. Regional variations are also important in describing behavioral differences (for example, whether respondents oppose facility siting or not). This analysis provides opportunities for understanding the stigmatization of mental disability, and provides clues about the possible levers which might be used in specific places to promote a more positive representation of mentally disabled individuals.</jats:p>",

The municipal and county levels are considered local government. In this paper the degree of central control of the lower two levels of Norwegian government are compared and the implications of national regulations for local democracy, particularly for county governments, are discussed. The counties are more heavily controlled by the central government than are the municipalities, measured both by reliance on central grants and by regulation of the service supply. Whereas the representatives of the municipal councils are ambiguous when it comes to expressing the extent of central government control, the county-level politicians are clearly dissatisfied with central governmental constraints. Central regulations appear not to weaken the attractiveness of positions on the local councils, and the desire for reelection appears higher at the county level than at the municipal level. Voters see the parliamentary elections as most important, the municipal elections as of secondary importance, and the county elections as least important. At the county elections, national policymakers are to some extent responsible for the performance of the county government. It is argued that the lack of voter interest and voter control increases the ability of lobbying organizations to influence county decisions, which is likely to strengthen the dominance of producer interests relative to that of citizens and consumers. Such developments may induce demand for further state legislation to protect consumer interests, which will challenge the overall legitimacy of intermediate democracy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:italic>The political ideology driving urban statutory planning in the United Kingdom has held a central place within planning literature during the 1980s and 1990s. The distinctiveness of leadership style and political ideology associated with the Thatcher governments have been widely recognized both in practice and academia. However, the distinctiveness of political ideology to determine the form and status of statutory urban planning since John Major acceded to the prime ministership in 1990 has not been assessed so markedly. Questions emerge on whether Thatcherite ideology is continuing in the 1990s within the realm of planning and environment, of whether a watered down version of New Right policies are being implemented, or whether central government policies towards planning over the last six years marked a change in ideological direction. This paper examines statutory planning during the Major years with reference to the ideological components of Thatcherism. From this assessment, a comparative analysis is undertaken of both political administrations. The paper concludes by finding that although elements of Thatcherite ideology are continuing, there have been initiatives that move away from the primacy of the market. However, these do not form any ‘big theory’: the differences between Thatcher and Major are more related to style than substance. Thatcherism is continuing but in a neo‐Thatcherite way.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Seen against the background of Italian administration and politics which has, for many decades, been characterised by the reluctance, even opposition, of local governments to the country's many territorial planning reforms, the very existence of this institution represents an innovation which merits explanation. The formation of the institution is examined through its process of legitimisation. This involves highlighting the collective representations and social codes activated, even created, by certain political figures with a view to legitimising this public action. The authors insist on the fact that the process of legitimisation can only be understood within the context of the political and social relationships which structure an urban area such as Bologna and which have evolved considerably in recent years, particularly as a result of social segmentation and differentiation, hitherto limited in a region where the Italian Communist Party has been the preponderant influence since 1946. </jats:p>",

The models are automated for use within PC‐based software systems and forecast seasonally disaggregated water requirements into 21 water‐use sectors. Water conservation analysis algorithms in IWRAPS© facilitate the analysis of water conservation efforts associated with various end uses to estimate overall program efficiency. Mobilization water requirements planning can also be accomplished with IWRAPS©. The models developed for the military service branches improve estimating water requirements from conventional per capita extrapolation to a statistical water use method for predicting past and future water needs.</jats:p>",

Each assessment is composed of revenues calculated for a discrete set of service blocks where the local unit costs of service provision are most often estimated by means of regression procedures that have been subject to regular scrutiny and review. Set against this context, in this paper the authors evaluate the performance of the regressions that contribute to the calculation of SSAs as equitable allocation devices. The general accounting framework for constructing SSAs is described and a statistical classification of the regression models is presented. In their analysis the authors examine a selection of models that are representative of each class and they include the regressions that comprise the Other District Services and Personal Social Services blocks. These appraisals follow a common sequence where a dummy variable is entered into the regression to test the consistency of the allocation made to a specified group of local authorities. When the dummy variable is statistically significant, revisions to the specification of the regression are either tested or suggested. Finally, the broader implications of these findings for the design of SSAs are examined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many of the most influential accounts of the growth in the numbers of new businesses being started and the general increase in the economic significance of the small-business sector draw upon flexible specialisation theory, which explains such trends in terms of the breakup of the mass market for standardised goods and services and the consequent emergence of a variety of smaller niche markets capable of exploitation by new or small businesses. In this paper our purpose is to suggest that the opportunities for new firm formation and growth arising from such changes may be more circumscribed than have hitherto been acknowledged. Drawing upon evidence from the UK brewing industry, which has seen the creation of many hundreds of new breweries during the past twenty years, we highlight the role of distribution channels as a significant barrier to the growth of the small-business sector. Changes to the regulatory environment (the Beer Orders) in an attempt by government to improve the competitiveness of the UK brewing industry have, paradoxically, had the opposite effect to that intended, and so have failed to increase market opportunities for microbrewers. Future research must give greater attention to the role of distribution in order to achieve a better understanding of the changing structure and spatial organisation of production. </jats:p>",

These signals are combined using a specific gain mechanism that enables the different coordinate frames of the various input signals to be combined into common, distributed spatial representations. These distributed representations can be used to convert the sensory locations of stimuli into the appropriate motor coordinates required for making directed movements. Within these spatial representations of the posterior parietal cortex are neural activities related to higher cognitive functions, including attention. We review recent studies showing that the encoding of intentions to make movements is also among the cognitive functions of this area.</jats:p>",

Instruments developed for use in hospital level implementation of the WHO/UNICEF baby friendly hospital initiative were used in five hospitals (two public and three private). No hospital was implementing all Ten Steps. A core hospital team on lactation management and a sufficient number of health personnel skillful in breastfeeding counselling and adequate delivery room conditions are required to implement the Ten Steps. It is very difficult to provide these conditions in public hospitals with an excessive patient load. On the other hand, the fee for service system and the policy of changing practices according to the wishes of the clients can also become barriers to successful breastfeeding, as may occur in some private hospitals.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In previous papers of this series we have shown how public policies of ‘planned shrinkage’ triggered contagious urban decay and massive destruction of low-income housing within poor minority communities of New York City. The resulting social disintegration exacerbated epidemics of infectious disease, including AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and TB (tuberculosis), and such behavioral pathologies as substance abuse and violence. We extend this work on the neighborhood-level ‘synergism of plagues’ to the metropolitan regional scale for eight US urban areas containing more than 54 million people. Several have central cities, which, like New York, suffer from what Skogan characterized as a relentless ‘hollowing out’ of poor communities. We find AIDS, TB, violent crime, and low birthweight near the worst affected cities to be markers of an accelerating regional synergism of plagues, a diffusing system of interacting and self-reinforcing pathology fueled by, but spreading far beyond, the worst affected inner-city areas. We uncover an apparent threshold condition for regional spread of this synergism, triggered through a stochastic resonance with public policies affecting the distribution of catastrophic events within central-city minority neighborhoods. Control of AIDS, violence, multiple-drug-resistant TB, and other pathologies in the United States will require regional reform and the sharing both of resources and of authority across presently ungovernable systems of fragmented administrative units: the urban centers of the late 19th-century USA, by the late 20th, are vast, tightly coupled urban and/or suburban complexes producing a regional ‘linear chain’ condition for both public health and public order in which the welfare of the whole is increasingly determined by the sickness of the least strong. </jats:p>",

Strong opposition from some factions within the region forestalled the action for two decades. An environmental impact statement, conducted in 1992–1994 with extensive public input, culminated in a proposal to reintroduce wolves designated as “non‐essential—experimental” under Section 10 (j) of the federal Endangered Species Act. This approach, approved by the Secretary of the Interior in 1994, provided for wolf restoration while allowing management flexibility to deal with concerns of the local public. A reintroduction plan was developed in the summer and fall of 1994. Acquiring, holding, transporting, and releasing suitable wolves for reintroduction presented a myriad of technical and logistical challenges that required effective planning and coordination by all participants. In January 1995, 29 wolves were captured in Alberta and transported to Yellowstone National Park (14) and central Idaho (15). Idaho wolves were freed immediately upon arrival; Yellowstone wolves (three family groups) were held in acclimation pens in the park until late March. Most Idaho wolves traveled extensively within the area intended for them, averaging 82 km net distance away from release sites after 5 months (range = 30–220 km), and three male‐female pairs formed by July. After 5 months in the wild, at least 13 of 15 Idaho‐released wolves were alive within the intended area, as were 13 of 14 Yellowstone wolves; one wolf was known to have been illegally killed in each area. No livestock were killed. Wolves released into Yellowstone Park continued to live as packs, stayed closer to their release sites (x = 22 km at end of June), and settled into home ranges; two packs produced a total of nine pups. The progress of the reintroduction program in its first year far exceeded expectations. Reintroductions of about 15 wolves to each area for 2–4 more years are scheduled, but the project may be shortened because of early successes. Future reintroduction planners can expect sociocultural issues to pervade the effort, but they can be optimistic that, from a biological standpoint, reintroduction of wolves has strong potential as a restoration technique.</jats:p>",

METHODS: Women who became pregnant while using natural family planning were identified in five centers worldwide: there were 373 unplanned and 367 planned pregnancies in this cohort. The subjects were followed up at 16 and 32 weeks' gestation and after delivery. The risks of spontaneous abortion, low birth-weight, and preterm birth were estimated after adjustment by logistic regression. RESULTS: The women with unplanned pregnancies were more likely to be at the extremes of age, to report more medical problems before and during the index pregnancy, and to seek antenatal care later in gestation than the women with planned pregnancies. However, women with planned pregnancies reported a higher rate of spontaneous abortion in previous pregnancies (28.8%) than did women with unplanned pregnancies (12.9%). There were no significant differences in the rates of spontaneous abortion, low birthweight, or preterm birth between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed among women who experienced an unplanned pregnancy while using natural family planning. </jats:p>",
