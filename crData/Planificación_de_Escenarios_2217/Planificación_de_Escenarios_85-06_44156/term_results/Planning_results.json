A new method of interviewing, computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI), makes it possible to reduce labour input and financial costs. Programs to carry out CATI on microcomputers were developed by the Department of Geography at Utrecht University. The technique was applied to collect data for research projects on retailing and commuting in a planning context. As an example, it is demonstrated how the collected data were used in a shopping model of spatial interaction type in order to make conditional forecasts of retail spending in the province of Utrecht, Holland. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to discuss the political significance of the alternatives for regional development in which community participation and the decentralization of decisionmaking power are proposed. Although their discourses are similar, they have different ideological motivations and content. These proposals, together with the crisis in regional theory and planning are associated with the contradictions inherent in the economic globalization of the contemporary world: the conflict between the corporation and the state; the crisis of the state and the region; and the intensification of protest movements organized on a territorial basis. The central question is the sharpening of the contradictions of the state, which ensures bourgeois domination but is also (in countries of peripheral capitalism) the only force capable of (a) ensuring social investments on the necessary scale and (b) confronting global capitalism. This question is denied both in proposals for decentralization and in the criticism made of them by political economists, which thus hampers identification of political priorities. In Brazil, which is a country of continental size and advanced industrialization, economic crisis is accompanied by a crisis of legitimization of the state. The solution of the crisis and the democratization of the country demand not its fragmentation but a national power legitimized by full participation of all segments of society at different levels. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper underlines the importance of the debate now being carried on in Brazil with reference to Amazonia and stresses the symbolical character with which it has been clothed. This debate is more than a clash between intellectual and political conceptions, the conflict-ridden encounter of the nation with its own destiny is dramatized within it. Seven theses stand out, representing the main prospects in question and their variants. In dismantling them one by one, the author proposes alternatives and above all suggests a kind of analysis epistemologically oriented by successive shiftings of viewpoint. This mobile approach makes it possible to reveal the partial truth of each thesis over the others. Theses (1) and (3) refer to the inexorable and all-encompassing character of capitalist expansion in rural areas, qualities which are regarded as likely to cause the reactive social movements themselves to succumb. It is shown that economic and political processes are often episodic, reversible, and subject to political interventions, especially to selective action on the part of the State. Theses (2), (4), and (5) affirm that the peasantry possesses its own conceptions of the land, that it is autonomous at productive level, and that it resists the advance of capitalism. It is demonstrated that these theses oversimplify, deny ambiguities, and are based on a logic that wrongly presupposes two homogenized social processes and blocs. Alternatively, the existence of multiple actors should be recognized, oriented by various strategies which are redefinable because they are not deterministically derived from socioeconomic conditions; the peasantry is not fighting to defend the essence of an idealized peasant being, but a particular series of ad hoc negotiable values, in the face of different concrete situations. In the discussions of theses (6) and (7), the author comes to grips, on the one hand, with the view that explains the apparent mobilizing success of the Roman Catholic Church through its ‘option on behalf of the poor’ and, on the other hand, the political criticisms usually directed at intellectuals who question traditional conceptions, when these supposedly favour the underprivileged. </jats:p>",

Expanded environmental quality objectives include maintenance of high quality aquatic habitat. Water resource systems must provide both physical and chemical conditions appropriate for the propagation and maintenance of healthy diverse aquatic communities. Managing water resources to provide high quality habitat involves planning to meet both water quality and water quantity objectives. Existing technology based water quality controls and stream based water quality criteria can now be supplemented by aquatic habitat management. An approach to aquatic habitat management is illustrated by use of the Incremental Methodology developed by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The Incremental Methodology uses measures of aquatic habitat to assess instream flows required for by aquatic life. Thus the range of environmental quality objectives in resources planning and management is expanded by application of these methods to include aquatic habitat as well as water quality management. Methods used to determine instream flow needs for rivers in Illinois are reviewed, and the use of this information in developing regulations limiting water extraction for off stream use are described. Aquatic habitat based management is shown to provide workable methods to meet expanded environmental quality objectives in water resources planning and management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem addressed is one of strategy and practice: how to promote agricultural and rural development in peasant societies in ways that will benefit the large majority of the people. In a number of earlier essays, the author had proposed what he called a strategy of agropolitan development which would stress the importance of linking a self-generated process of dynamic change from within agricultural communities to the larger processes of central guidance by the state. The strategy involved a substantial devolution of power to small territorial units within the overall system of societal guidance. In the present paper the desirability of such a devolution is considered in terms of political, ecological, and technical–administrative arguments. As a political strategy, agropolitan development requires a commitment on part of national elites, and this may be difficult to obtain. Alternative strategies, on the other hand, although possibly successful when measured in terms of production, are unlikely to involve more than a small proportion of the peasant population. The political choice, then, would seem to be between planning for equality and political self-determination at the lowest levels of territorial governance or planning for inequality and political autocracy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The object of this paper is an analysis of the possibilities of a politically oriented territorial transformation in the process of building a new state in Nicaragua. Three central questions are posed. How should the struggle of popular sectors be connected with the contradictions associated with territorial organization? Is there an autonomy of the spatial, that is, is spatial concentration simply a product of capitalism? Does the construction of socialism necessitate decentralization, or does spatial concentration remain in socialism because it is a universal tendency associated with the nature of technology? Not even neoclassical conceptions of territorial organization, nor those of the new Marxist school (which analyzes the society–space relationship in universal terms), are effective in orienting popular struggles. To advance the analysis of the relationship between the political and the territorial, we require an examination of concrete situations. In the paper are thus presented some basic concepts relating to the territorial or spatial and the social, the specific relationship between a society in transition and space; the present territorial transformations in Nicaragua and the problems and contradictions they have generated are then analyzed. It is argued that it is political orientation that should regulate the definition of new patterns of territorial organization. Spatial structures show a certain rigidity which retards transformation and they therefore cannot be part of the revolutionary project, but must rather be a consequence of the social transformations. Regionalization is an end-state and not a point of departure. If the politico-administrative structures do not coincide with those of production and reproduction, it will be difficult to establish a substantive democracy and decentralization. </jats:p>",

Empirical applications of public choice analysis are also fraught with problems.

First, the budget incidence of the entire public sector, including the social security system, is presented. The results indicate a substantial redistribution from upper-income to lower-income classes. The effect is largely due to public spending rather than to taxation. Second, the distributional impacts of public policy in selected policy areas—transportation, social security, agriculture, and health—are investigated. Redistribution is pro the poor for transportation and health, and pro the rich for agriculture. A mixed picture is found for social security. Within groups of the same marital status or sex, redistribution is pro the poor. Between these groups, it is pro the rich. Third, the distributional impacts of changes in selected macroeconomic variables are analyzed. The major conclusion is that macroeconomic growth policies, if successful, lead to a reduced equality of income distribution. </jats:p>",

Contemporaneously, established regional theories and planning doctrines have been seriously challenged and new approaches offered in their place. This paper is an examination of the recent development of regional political economy in four contexts: (1) the transformative retheorization of space and time currently taking place in social theory and philosophy, (2) the related reconceptualization of the nature and necessity of geographically uneven development, (3) the interpretation of uneven regional development within the historical geography of capitalism, and (4) the contemporary restructuring of spatial divisions of labor. These interrelated contexts form the basis for a reinterpretation of the regional question and an analysis of regional crisis and restructuring in the past and present. </jats:p>",

This normative rule is exemplary of a large class of models in economics in which it is assumed that individuals act as if they maximize rational expectations when making sequential decisions. The heuristic rule, in contrast, is exemplary of descriptive models in psychology in which it is assumed that such decisions are better characterized by a more simplified cognitive algebra. A comparison is made of the ability of the models to explain the behavior of subjects in an apartment search game. The results tend to favor the heuristic model: stopping appears best characterized by a set of individual-specific utility-difference thresholds. Implications of the results for the role of normative versus descriptive models in the development of residential search theory are discussed. </jats:p>",

In fact conflicts over race have had only an ad hoc impact on the polity. In this paper, this curious phenomenon is explained in terms of the structure of centre-periphery relations in England. The argument is that the race statecraft of the centre has exhibited a significant degree of continuity over four decades. The centre has always sought autonomy from white and black peripheral forces, yet at the same time has attempted to peripheralise the management of race policies and problems. On both counts it has been highly successful. Race management deserves to rank as one of the great political ‘jobs’ of the 20th century. </jats:p>",

The basic question is about the relationship between firm-size and employment-change, the central hypothesis being that smaller firms generate more new jobs faster than larger firms do. The findings are limited in their interpretation by data-base and methodological constraints. Within these constraints, they tend to confirm the higher job-generation performance of smaller firms. Further analysis, however, shows that it is not so much the size of a firm as its age which ‘makes’ a smaller firm grow. The paper also shows that there are substantial differences in job-generation behaviour between the four localities under study, differences which are not explained by the three factors of age, size, and sectoral affiliations of firms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The propensity of factories in the footwear industry of the East Midlands to survive as active units of production over the period 1957 to 1979 is shown to be associated with at least some of the attributes of size, location, type, and age of the premises occupied. A number of possible causes of establishment or ‘case’ loss are suggested but the analysis is hampered by the problem of unravelling a complex web of interrelationships between the attributes used. In the second part of the paper an attempt is made to simplify the complex web using methods from numerical taxonomy. The strategy adopted is to use an objective classification method to define types of factories on the basis of shared common attributes and then to determine which of the resulting types have suffered the greatest losses. It is shown that relative employment loss has been greatest in old multistorey premises of medium size, particularly when located in the inner city. It is also argued that the premises most unsuitable for the accommodation of modern technological developments in production have been most at risk. </jats:p>",
