      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a good deal of talk these days about the ways in which planning theoreticians have neglected practice and practitioners. Some of the talk comes from practitioners, some from theoreticians themselves. This essay reflects on this talk, discerning a coherent theme in the varied chorus of complaints The conventional image that planning theory deals with the interaction between planners and clients no longer seems compelling. In the place of this dyadic image, theoreticians have focused attention on the planning processes embedded in the design of institutions This institutional focus powerfully illuminates the work of practitioners but also looks past them to groups and issues that were barely touched when planning theory dealt with the familiar dyad of planner and client. In the eyes of practitioners and academic colleagues, the community is likely to continue to seem both fragmented and neglectful — riddled with great rifts of incommensurable purposes, language, and analytic models </jats:p>",

In sectoral terms, planners remain primarily government employees. The implications of these findings for planning research and education are briefly addressed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Why is development planning a central activity of city government? This paper confronts this question through the study of a small city in the Boston SMSA Development planning in this city turns out to be a contentious business. Not everyone supports it, and it is difficult to do Yet despite a number of competing planning agendas and, in particular, popular demand for human services, development planning — i e., planning for business — consistently remains the central concern of city government While there are a number of ways to account for this, the centrality of development planning seems not to be simply the result of scheming special interests, funding availability, or professional imperatives. These explanations may be correct, but each alone appears to be inadequate An examination of a variety of development projects and of the competition among alternative planning agendas suggests, rather, that development planning is the logical outcome of the particular ways in which diverse constituencies and interests within the city are linked to each other Furthermore, planning for business seems to be the only way to get certain things done Consequently, for nearly everyone, development planning becomes the only game in town </jats:p>",

Urban designers, planners, and architects play a crucial role in managing and creating the city image. Techniques are available to the designer for manipulating place images — from changes in physical form or symbolic communications to work on the mental conception. Imageability research has proved to be a rewarding area for investigation and has made substantial contributions to techniques for environmental analysis and citizen involvement in the planning process Ways of connecting the theory and techniques to actual design are now needed. One problem is how to create meaningful environments in a pluralistic, highly mobile society. Another promising area of application is in predicting the image impact of proposed developments </jats:p>",

It is argued in this paper that there is a serious need to re-think the nature of education for Third World designers who come to the West for advanced professional training In developing this argument, some of the typical concerns of Third World environmental design are discussed Preliminary ideas about how the design curriculum can be reoriented to be more responsive to the needs of foreign students are also presented </jats:p>",

There are two problems embedded in the presented approach: station loading and operation scheduling. A formulation of a station loading problem for a single machining period is presented. Some of the computational results are also discussed.</jats:p>",

The reason being that the high cost of reservoir for greater capacity is out weighing the benefit gain in supplying more water to meet the irrigation deficit.</jats:p>"

Le Town Planning Board (TPB) consultant municipal engagé en 1915 et le rapport de Vingénieur-urbaniste Noulan Cauchon de 1917 reflètent la coexistence de deux forces chez les partisans du développement de Hamilton. La période de Vaprès-guerre entraîne des changements dans la composition du TPB et le développement de politiques adéquates de zonage diminue l'influence politique du TPB et conduit à son abandon par les embellisseurs influents vers 1923. Tandis que l'inefficace TPB poursuit l'achèvement de son plan de zonage en 1928, les embellisseurs se sont dirigés vers les parcs administratifs et les comités routiers lesquels, dotés de pouvoirs et de budgets par la législation provinciale, constituent de bien meilleurs instruments de réalisation des plans à long terme réclamés dans le rapport Cauchon et poursuivit sans succès à travers le TPB. Vers 1930, l'efficacité des urbanistes est disparue tandis que les embellisseurs ont surmonté les défis politiques de leurs plans au profit de boulevards paysagers et d'une expansion majeure du système de parcs. </jats:p>",

Spectral analysis, supplemented by turning point analysis, is used to identify the main postwar cycles in each sector, and to measure their relative phasing and severity, distinguishing short 4–5–year ‘demand cycles’ associated with the business cycles from longer ‘supply cycles’ of up to 9-years duration. As the different sectors of building are aggregated, these shorter cycles tend to be smoothed out, revealing a dominant postwar long swing in building activity. This is then compared with previous long swings in the pre-1914 and interwar periods, each of which is associated with successive waves of urbanisation in Britain since the mid-19th century. </jats:p>",

The role of these resources in the energy economies of Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Thailand is outlined; problems associated with the sustained supply of these fuels are identified; and the broader developmental context of this resource use is discussed. Brief summaries of the position in each country are presented, and it is argued that the forms taken by problems associated with the ‘alternative energy crisis’ vary significantly both within and between the countries studied. The policy implications of this are identified, and it is concluded that policy formulation must take account of local patterns of resource production and utilisation if viable solutions are to be generated. </jats:p>",

The Educational Savings Plan, begun in 1971, provided financing for the secondary school education of children whose parents had limited family size to no more than three children. The Spacing Incentive Plan, begun in 1975, encouraged prolonging the interval between first and second births to at least three years by providing free birth delivery of the second child. Although both were less successful than anticipated, much was learned about the social, economic, and practical difficulties of program implementation. </jats:p>",

Sixty‐two schools responded, a response rate of 88 percent. The administrative and curricular structure of treatment planning depended primarily on the clinical and departmental organization of the school. The majority of respondents had an average of four full‐time faculty members, usually affiliated with a department of oral diagnosis, responsible for teaching treatment planning. Eighty‐one percent of the respondents offer preclinical treatment planning information and 85 percent develop clinical treatment plans, varying from identification of general treatment areas to comprehensive, sequential treatment plans with appropriate alternatives. The findings indicated that there is no definite distinction between oral diagnosis and treatment planning in many schools. Currently, there are no curricular guidelines focused exclusively on the principles of dental treatment planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nationalism: Past and Present by Focus Media is a fine example of computer-assisted learning. The package consists of five modules ( \"European Roots,\" \"Nation-Building,\" \"Graphing the Nation-Building Process,\" \"Destructive Nationalism,\" \"National- ism Today: The Soviet Union\") that can be used either as stand-alone lessons or as an integrated program. Each module incorporates personalization, role-playing, and review exercises that require imagination, a familiarity with the material presented in the lessons, and the application of both concepts and factual information. Simple but effective graphics and documentation assist in gaining a firm understanding of the concept of nationalism. </jats:p>",
