      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although The Gambia Family Planning Association (GFPA) has always been interested in promoting contraceptive use in the Greater Banjul Area (GBA), insufficient funds and the need to prioritize program expansion in rural areas hindered this. The GFPA operates two clinics in GBA, open to few workers. The government has three Family Planning and Maternal and Child Health clinics in Banjul, also used by few workers. Factory managers, trade union leaders, and the GFPA believe that a well-organized family planning (FP) education and service delivery program could benefit employees and employers. This operations research study tested the feasibility of a work-based FP and STD education program and experimented with the most effective service delivery approach. Three approaches were identified that could be used to provide workers in urban areas with FP services—take services to workers, establish a service delivery outlet at each workplace, rely on workers obtaining services outside their workplaces. As stated in this report, the first two approaches had never been tried in GBA, hence this study tested these two systems of service delivery in terms of cost-effectiveness, client satisfaction, and contraceptive knowledge and use.</jats:p>"

Time trends are given for some indicators, and data are arranged for comparative analysis across countries. Where available, time trends go back to the mid-1980s. This volume’s predecessor, published in 1992, should be consulted for earlier demographic and socioeconomic data, and for tables on maternal and child health indicators that are not repeated here. The data on FP programs come from a series of three questionnaires sent since 1987 to 100 developing countries, which have generally been kept consistent in their subject matter and wording. The latest questionnaire round reflects information accessible to each country as of early 1993. Questionnaire forms were sent out in late 1992 and returned through spring 1993. Each questionnaire displayed the data previously published for that country in each table concerning the FP program. This let respondents enter corrections in the past time series, as well as provide the updates that were the primary objective of the inquiry.</jats:p>"

An analysis of two recent Connecticut cases suggests a promising alternative: explicit intermunicipal negotiation over \"fair share\" compacts. These negotiations took place under new enabling legislation and with strong support of state housing officials and were facilitated by outside mediators. In spite of the subsequent economic downturn, participating communities are ahead of schedule in producing promised affordable housing units. Notwithstanding these results, however, difficult questions remain about the political accountability of private mediators, inclusion of stakeholders, and the potentially diminished role of existing regional planning agencies. </jats:p>",

This program was designed to be an alternative to the frequently used Mortgage Revenue Bond (MRB) program. Examination of recent use of MCCs finds that the program is administratively easier to operate than the MRB program and is less costly to the federal government. However, it provides few advantages to the needy home buyer. The MCC program does not reduce the household's monthly loan payments; rather, it grants a rebate through reduced federal income taxes often realized only at the end of the year. Further, if the program sponsor charges large fees to participants, then the MCC program can actually make housing affordability more difficult to attain, rendering the program of little value except to those households who could already afford to purchase a home without assistance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Health service executives are striving to implement the best managerial practices amid the major turbulence and restructuring which is prevalent in many health care systems today. All too often, guidance about what the best practices are needs to be sought from studies contained within the general management literature. It is problematical whether this literature is applicable to health service organizations. This article reports the results of a study which examined the views of 93 executives in 14 hospitals in Britain. Canada and the United States about what constitutes managerial excellence. The hospitals were selected on the basis of their reputed success in health service management. Using grounded theory methodology, eight factors of excellence were derived from the interview data which were supplemented by data made available from hospital documentation supplied by participants. The results of this study are compared with those of Peters and Waterman (1982). This is the most frequently cited study of managerial excellence in the general management literature. The main conclusions drawn are that a current definition of health service management excellence has been identified; there was a high degree of unanimity among participant executives about the constituents of success and excellence in health service management; and, that there are some marked differences between this definition of excellence and that propounded by Peters and Waterman (1982). The implications of this definition of excellence for health service executives are discussed.</jats:p>",

As part of a wider evaluation of performance in primary level health units, retrospective data from patient registers and prospective data from observations of consultation practice were assessed using indicators proposed by the International Network of Rational Use of Drugs. Tanzanian prescribing practices compared favourably with other countries where studies using the same indicators have been undertaken. However, relatively high proportions of incorrect prescriptions were identified, with particular problems of under‐prescribing. Church units were also found to perform less well than government units against the indicators used; differences between the dispensary and health centre level were few. Actions to address the problems highlighted by this study include more careful monitoring and regulation of non‐government health care and identification of the root causes of under‐prescribing in government units. Review of prescribing practice using appropriate indicators is important in both cases, although also requiring wider regulatory action, health provider and patient education, and action to tackle the low morale of health workers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This book presents a selection of empirical conclusions, or findings, from the body of family planning research that has accumulated over the last two decades. Twelve topics of current interest are reviewed, as a sequel to three similar publications issued in 1971, 1972, and 1974. A findings document compresses what has been learned into straightforward declarative statements, giving summary evidence to support each statement. In cases where a conclusion is well founded, with extensive supporting evidence, only illustrative or summary references are needed. In other cases, citations are required for individual studies. Generalizations that are unsupported or too ambiguous to permit a definite statement do not qualify for inclusion. Methodology and theory are not the primary concern; rather, the focus is on research results that merit particular attention. Thus, solid conclusions are included, along with important evidence. It is important to establish a record outlining evidence that underlies each finding, with identification of which country or region it comes from. With time, this record should evolve, and then the current compilation will serve as a point of departure for restatement.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A common scenario for a mine ventilation engineer is the inheritance of a ventilation system with multiple working and development areas that are at the geographical extremities of the orebody. The mine is traversed by numerous access levels which in turn are\nintersected by raises. In such a situation controlling leakage becomes one of the engineer's primary concerns as it reduces the available air to dilute contaminants and the speed at which they are removed. Leakage is an expensive loss, as it has consumed fan power and possibly heating.\nAlthough leakage is known to exist in ventilation systems, it can be difficult to locate and quantify. This especially true when it occurs mid-shaft and through caved areas. Therefore, to some extent leakage has been left unchecked as bulkheading every conceivable leakage route is not an economic\nsolution.\nCANMET has developed a tracer gas based simple test that has already shown the extent of inter-shaft leakage in a multi-level mine. The first test indicated a 22% loss of fresh air to just one of the mine's exhaust routes within the first 570 m, that was prior to the first production area. The\ntest also indicated the general location of the leakage, and further iterative use of the test will pin-point the exact leakage route and its associated volume. Such tests allow the ventilation engineer to design remedial action selectively correcting the leakage in his system (i.e., through the\nconstruction or improvement of bulkheads) in the most cost effective manner. The in-mine element of this test can be executed by mine personnel, once trained, with CANMET performing sample analysis and data interpretation.\nThis method of interrogating a mine ventilation system has been applied at an Ontario gold mine. Here the first tracer gas tests indicated a 22% loss of intake air via three primary routes to one of the mine's exhaust shafts. This leakage costs the mine $50k p.a. in main fan power, when compared\nto $4k to construct a bulkhead, the potential cost benefits of isolating and limiting leakage can be quickly realised.</jats:p>"

In addition to their commonly recognized abilities to process numerical information, they can also provide assistance in interpreting it. They can highlight problems that require attention, suggest possible reasons why problems occur and suggest appropriate managerial responses. Computer programs which perform these more advanced functions are often known as knowledge‐based systems (KBSs) since they incorporate the knowledge of experts in the area addressed by the system. Such systems are increasingly being used to support decision making in commerce and public administration and offer great potential to the health sector. This article presents preliminary results of work to develop a KBS to help mid‐level managers monitor and evaluate health service provision in Papua New Guinea. It considers issues in the design and development of KBSs and discusses their future potential.</jats:p>",

D’après cette critique, le système planifié obligerait les agents à répondre aux indicateurs administratifs, plutôt qu’aux signaux économiques. Dans cet article nous montrons que d’un point de vue théorique il n’y a aucune raison de croire que le fonctionnement de l’économie planifiée produise un résultat irrationnel au niveau macroéconomique. L’étude du système à planification centralisée dans son cadre historique, social et économique, montre que ce système a, en effet, respecté les règles de la rationalité économique.</jats:p>"

From 1947 to 1962 new ground was broken by some pioneers — the ideologists of \"equilibrium\" or \"harmony\" and new \"Girondists\" of decentralisation. Between 1963 and 1973, the decade of the technocrats, as planning became institutionalised, concentration of the means of production and decision in the hands of large firms and of the State apparatus imposed the pursuit of economic efficiency while contributing to widening the gap between planning realities and the planners' discourse. From about 1973 onwards, with previous dogmas being increasingly called into question, the new discourse on \"ecology\" and the \"lived experience\", the crisis of management and the management of the crisis have all forced planners to enter a new territory — that of uncertainty.</jats:p>"

Particularly since the last war, the two logics have come up against each other in a long series of agricultural planning operations under different climates. The paper shows that, behind the problems and failures, the strategies of rural actors are both defensive (through their rejection of what may jeopardise social identity and free decision-making) and offensive (diverting modern methods from the objectives officially advertised). In front of this, the obduracy of planners proves to be to a large extent unrealistic.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Auseinandersetzung mit der Stellungnahme des Wissenschaftlichen Beirats beim Bundesverkehrsminister zu Transrapid und mit der grundsätzlichen Ablehnung durch Landschafts- und Umweltschutz wird herausgestellt, daß entscheidende Vorteile des Systems bisher in der öffentlichen Diskussion wenig zur Geltung gekommen sind. So ist auch bei der Beurteilung der technisch-wirtschaftlichen Einsatzreife durch den Wissenschaftlichen Beirat unverkennbar, daß Vorteile des Transrapid-Systems nicht mit dem gleichen Gewicht vertreten werden wie die des Rad/Schiene-Systems. Mit erstaunlicher Nachsicht werden Rad/Schiene Entwicklungsmöglichkeiten eingeräumt, die Transrapid nicht zugebilligt werden. Es zeigt sich aber, daß Transrapid bei gleichem Beurteilungsmaßstab erheblich mehr Vorteile eingeräumt werden müßten.Der von Landschafts- und Umweltschutz grundsätzlich verfochtenen Ablehnung werden die zumeist verschwiegenen Vorteile gegenübergestellt. Flächenbeanspruchung und Naturverträglichkeit sind nämlich im Vergleich zu herkömmlichen Verkehrssystemen erheblich günstiger. Von Verkehrswissenschaftlern wird auf lange Sicht der Magnetbahn durchaus die Chance eingeräumt, in Europa als Trägersystem des spurgeführten Verkehrs auf großen Achsen zu verkehren. Hieran anknüpfend werden aus raumordnerischer Sicht Anregungen für Netzentwicklungen gegeben, ausgehend von einer ersten Anwenderstrecke Berlin-Hamburg. Solche anscheinend sehr zeitfernen Ausblicke schmelzen hinsichtlich der Planungszeiten so zusammen, daß als Schlußfolgerung die Aufforderung an Politik, Verwaltung und Wirtschaftsunternehmen ergeht, keine weiteren Verzögerungen mehr für die Realisierung einer ersten Strecke zu dulden.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUM\n\t\tEl trilinguisme a Luxemburg\n\t\tL'article lr de la Llei del 24 de febrer de 1984 sobre el règim de llengiïes diu que \"la llengua nacional dels luxemburguesos es el luxemburguès\". En realitat, perô, el luxemburguès, dialecte germànic oficialitzat com a \"llengua\" malgrat la manca de consciència lingiiîstica diferencial dels seus parlants, compleix purament una funciô simbôlica: com que Luxemburg es una naciô té la seva prôpia llengua. De fet, les funcions socialment importants son realitzades per les llengues alemanya i francesa, que son les prôpies de l'educaciô escolar, dels mitjans de comu-nicaciô, l'administraciô municipal i estatal, etc., mentre que la llengua luxemburguesa ocupa Tàmbit d'us mes popular: la conversa informai en famflia o al carrer i l'educaciô pre-escolar. Amb tot, els anys darrers el luxemburguès ha accedit, encara que en molt petita proporciô, a diversos àmbits formais: els débats parlamentaris, els tribunals, la radio i la televisiô, la premsa escrita... Es pot parlar, doncs, d'una triglôssia luxemburguesa, on la \"llengua nacional\" es una modalitat B condicionada per dues modalitats A. ^Quin es, aixi, el futur de la llengua luxemburguesa? Si es innegable que ha fet un cert avanç en el cami de la normalitzaciô, no ho es menys que n'es encara molt lluny i que, contraposada a llengues d'un pes molt fort internacionalment (el francès i l'alemany sobretot, perô també 1'angles, omnipresent als mitjans de comunicaci ó) o cada vegada mes presents al Gran Ducat per mor de la immigració (portuguès, italià, serbo-croat...), s'enfronta a un esdevenidor incert i insegur.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tTrilingvismo en Luksemburgo\n\t\tLau la 1-a artikolo de la Lego pro Lingva Regimo (24 februaro 1984) \"la nacia lingvo de la luksemburganoj estas la luksemburga\". Tamen, la luksemburga lingvo - germana dialekto oficialigita kiel \"lingvo\" malgraû manko de memdiferenciga konscio inter giaj geparolantoj -plenumas precipe simbolan rolon.

Fakte, la cefaj sociaj funkcioj - ekzemple la lerneja edukado, la amaskomunikiloj kaj la stata kaj komunuma administracioj - efektivigas en la franca kaj germana lingvoj, dum la luksemburga restas limigita al popularaj, neformalaj spacoj, t.e. la familio, la strato kaj la vartejo. Cetere, dum ci-lastaj jaroj la luksemburga ekokupis, ec se tre malgrandskale, diversajn formalajn spacojn - kiaj parlamentaj debatoj, tribunaloj, radio, televido, jurnaloj... Oni do povas paroli pri luksemburga trilingveco, la nacia lingvo rolanta kiel modalo B kvankam kondicita de du modaloj A. Kia do montrigas la luksemburga lingva estonto? Malgrau senduba progreso la Grandduklando staras tre malproksime de plena normaligo, fronte al lingvoj kun granda internacia pezo (krom la franca kaj la germana, la angla sencese entrudigas en la amaskomunikilojn); aliflanke, la lingvoj de enmigrantoj (portugaloj, italoj, serboj, kroatoj ktp.) farigas ankaù pli kaj pli influaj.</jats:p>",

L'auteur se penche sur la distinction entre droits linguistiques individuels et droits linguistiques collectifs, soulignant la validité de ces derniers. Il tente ensuite de démontrer que les revendications linguistiques d'envergure sont tout à fait fondées et ont leur juste place au sein du discours sur les droits. La question des conflits entre droits linguistiques est abordée en guise de conclusion.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingvaj rajtoj, individuaj kaj komunumaj\n\t\tLa artikolo diskutas teorian kadron por koncepti diversajn tipojn de lingvaj rajtoj kaj por pli bone kompreni la specon de la konfliktoj inter ili. Ĝi studas la diferencon inter individuaj kaj komunumaj lingvaj rajtoj emfazante la moralan pravigon de ci-lastaj. La autoro tezas, ke ekzistas bonaj kauzoj por postuli la protekton de lingvo kaj ke tiuj postuloj meritas sian lokon en la diskuto pri rajtoj.

Dies ist eine irrefuhrende Auffassung, da die hebräische Sprache nie tot war. Sie hat in der gesamten Diaspora als Sprache der Religionsausubung und in vielen Diasporagemeinden auch als Schriftsprache uberlebt. Das Korpus mittelalterlicher hebräischer Texte kommt im Umfang den Korpora des mittelalterlichen Latein und Arabischen gleich. Die Vorstellung, Hebräisch sei tot gewesen, beruht auf einer bisweilen antisemitischen Neigung, nichtbiblische hebràische Texte zu ignorieren.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tKonsideroj pri la revivigo de la hebrea\n\t\tMultaj aùtoroj priskribas la revivigon de la hebrea lingvo en la moderna periodo kvazaii miraklon. Tio estas miskoncepto, car la hebrea neniam mortis. Gi travivis en la tuta diasporo kiel lingvo de religio kaj en multaj diasporaj komunumoj krome kiel skriba lingvo. La teksto-provizo en la mezepoka hebrea estas simile ampleksa kiel tiuj en la mezepokaj latina au araba.

The performance of the developed software can only be realized if and only if, there is a database to interact with. Surprisingly, this slips the attention of system developers! The challenge of converting the existing manual system, of all, the database maintained in paper volumes to that of computerized version, is not well accounted for. However, mundane this task,\n            <jats:bold>Database Conversion Planning (DBCP)</jats:bold>\n            , has a definite and dominant role to play in systems development. While handling several complex turnkey computerization projects, we are compelled to realize the criticality of DBCP. A careful consideration of these issues in the early stages of systems development has shown a multitude of benefits. As a result, we were able to deploy projects amidst several constraining and conflicting factors. The projects have won the appreciation of customers, of all, end-users.

To support the fleets daily energy requirements, the Postal Service also operates one of the largest networks of underground storage tanks nearly 7,500 nationwide. A program to apply risk assessment to planning, budget development and other management actions was implemented during September, 1989. Working closely with a consultant, the postal service developed regulatory and environmental risk criteria and weighting factors for a ranking model. The primary objective was to identify relative risks for each underground tank at individual facilities. Relative risks at each facility were determined central to prioritizing scheduled improvements to the tank network. The survey was conducted on 302 underground tanks in the Northeast Region of the United States. An environmental and regulatory risk score was computed for each UST. By ranking the tanks according to their risk score, tanks were classified into management action categories including, but not limited to, underground tank testing, retrofit, repair, replacement and closure.</jats:p>",

This article argues that the new discourse continues to either overlook or misinterpret the facts and cannot extricate itself from the simplistic and polarizing dichotomy according to which Francophonie is either a \"gain in humanity\" or a \"loss of identity\". This author suggests that Francophonie is neither and that the time has come to accept the linguistic realities of Francophone Africa for what they are and, at the same time, to realize that Francophonie partakes of the natural process of human evolution.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tFranclingvismo: Ĉu gajno de humaneco aŭ perdo de identeco?\n\t\tPost la unua kunveno de ŝtatestroj de landoj uzantaj la francan lingvon en 1986 en Parizo estiĝis nova debato pri la franclingvismo. La nova debato ne ĉesas pretervidi aŭ misinterpreti la faktojn kaj ne sukcesas liberiĝi de la trosimpliga kaj dispartiiga distingo laŭ kiu franclingvismo estas aŭ \"gajno de humaneco\" aŭ \"perdo de identeco\". La aŭtoro tezas, ke franclingvismo estas nek nek, kaj ke estas tempo agnoski la lingvan realecon de franclingva Afriko kaj samtempe konsciiĝi pri tio, ke la franclingvismo estas ero de la natura procezo de homa evoluo.</jats:p>",

In 1962 the linguistic frontier was fixed between these two villages. Teuven then became officially Dutch-speaking, Sippenaken remained officially French-speaking.\n\t\tThe research project in question aimed at measuring the impact that the fixation of the linguistic frontier between these two villages had on the language behaviour and attitudes of the local population. In order to achieve this goal a standardized interview questionnaire was designed with questions about the dialect command and frequency of dialect and standard language use by parents and children. In addition, questions were asked about the appropriateness of using these language varieties in the home. Information about the existing attitudes towards the local dialect was elicited by investigating the convergence of the results gained in the interviews.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa pluvivivo de la dialekto dekstre kaj maldekstre de la belga lingvolimo\n\t\tLa artikolo raportas pri socilingvistika esploro en du apudaj belgaj vilaĝoj kies loĝantoj parolas malaltfrankan dialekton: Teuven (unu el la ses komunumoj de Voer/Fouron) kaj Sippenaken. En 1962 oni fiksis la lingvolimon inter tiuj du vilagoj. Teuven per tio farigis oficiale nederlandlingva, dum Sippenaken restis oficiale franclingva.\n\t\tLa priraportata esplorprojekto celis mezuri la efikon de la establo de la lingvolimo inter la du vilaĝoj al la lingvaj konduto kaj sinteno de la vilaĝanoj. Tiucele estis kompilita norma intervjuenketilo kun demandoj pri la grado de rego de la dialekto kaj la uzofteco de la dialekto kaj la norma lingvo fare de gepatroj kaj infanoj. Krome estis demandite ĉu estas konvene uzi tiujn lingvaĵojn en la familio. Informoj pri la sintenoj rilate al la loka dialekto estis kolektitaj per studo de la konvergo de la rezultoj de la intervjuoj.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tErstsprachverlust in der Gemeinschaft: Zwischenstadium\n\t\tDie Studie befaßt sich mit dem Erstsprachverlust bei deutschsprachigen Einwanderern in Australien. Die Feldforschung konzentrierte sich darauf, wie sich Bevolkerungsgruppen assimilieren und integrieren. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, daB die Versuchspersonen nach durch-schnittlich 16 Jahren in Australien die Zweitsprache bevorzugen. Das AusmaB an Sprachverlust war so groB, daB keine Versuchsperson das halbstundige Interview ohne Zuhilfenahme der Zweitsprache beenden konnte. Alle hatten Satzstellungsschwierigkeiten in der Erstsprache. Das Vermischen beider Sprachen wurde abschatzig beurteilt. Der Sprachbeherrschungsgrad hatte sich zugunsten der Zweitsprache verschoben. Demzufolge wurde English haufiger zur Beant-wortung des Fragebogens gewahlt.\n\t\tEin wichtiges Ergebnis der Vorstudie war, daß die Versuchspersonen die Fragen nach einem bestimmten Schema beantworteten und sich vier Gruppenzugehorigkeitsunterschiede heraus-kristallisierten: Versuchspersonen, die in Australien Verbindungen mit anderen Auslands-deutschsprachigen aufrechterhielten, und diejenigen, die dies nicht wunschten; weiter diejenigen, die ihren standigen Wohnsitz in Australien haben und diejenigen, die australische Staatsburger geworden sind.\n\t\tQuantitativ ermittelte Ergebnisse des Riegel/Zivian-Tests, der sich auf die Sprachleistung konzentriert, ergaben eine statistisch geringfugige Tendenz zum Englischen. Die Diskrepanz zwischen den hier erhaltenen Ergebnissen und einer amerikanischen Studie sowie die geringe Anzahl der Versuchspersonen muB jedoch die Validitat der Ergebnisse in Frage stellen.\n\t\tDie Untersuchung des natiirlichen Erstsprachverlustes erbrachte in der Vorstudie interessante Resultate. Es ergaben sich aufschluBreiche Ansatzpunkte, von denen erwartet werden kann, daß sie sich in der Hauptstudie bestatigen.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tPerdo de scipovo de la unua lingvo en komunumo: intera stadio\n\t\tLa studo temas pri la perdo de scipovo de la unua lingvo ĉe germanlingvaj enmigrintoj en Aǔstralio. La enterena esplorado koncentriĝis al la integrigo kaj asimiliĝo de loĝantogrupoj. La rezultoj montras ke post mezume 16 jaroj en Aǔstralio la esploratoj preferas la duan lingvon. La lingvoperdo estis tiel granda, ke neniu el la esploratoj sukcesis tralabori la tutan duonhoran intervjuon sen helpo de la dua lingvo. Ĉiuj baraktis kun la sintakso de la unua lingvo. Lingvomiksado estis juĝata negativa. La grado de lingvorego ŝoviĝis al la flanko de la dua lingvo. Sekve oni pli ofte elektis la anglan por respondi la enketilon.\n\t\tGrava rezulto de la prepara studo estis, ke la esploratoj respondis la demandojn laǔ rekonebla skemo, el kio kristaliĝis kvar grupapartenoj: tiuj esploratoj, kiuj en Aǔstralio havis kontaktojn kun aliaj elmigrintaj germanlingvanoj, kaj tiuj, kiuj tion ne deziris; krome la konstantaj loĝantoj kaj la akirintoj de la aǔstralia ŝtataneco.\n\t\tKvantaj rezultoj trovitaj per la testo de Riegel kaj Zivian, kiu fokusas al la lingvouzado, montras statistike nesignifan tendencon al la angla. La malkoincido de la rezultoj de ĉi tiu studo kaj usona studo kaj la malalta nombro de esploratoj tamen igas la trovitajn rezultojn dubindaj.\n\t\tLa esploro pri la natura perdo de la unua lingvo en la prepara studo donis interesajn rezultojn. Estis establitaj intersaj tezoj, kies konflrmon en la ĉefa studo oni povas atendi.</jats:p>",

Cet article analyse les conséquences de cette évolution sur ce qu'il est convenu d'appeler les langues moins répandues en Europe. En se basant sur un modèle de commerce international avec coûts de transaction, ainsi que sur un modèle d'allocation du temps, on montre que l'intensification du commerce intra-communautaire et l'accroissement du revenu auront des effets différents selon la langue minoritaire considérée. Appliquées à douze langues minoritaires européennes, ces prévisions indiquent que cinq d'entre elles se retrouveront en meilleure posture, que quatre risquent de pâtir du processus, et qu'il n'est pas possible, en l'état, de risquer des pronostics pour les trois dernières. Ces résultats peuvent servir à orienter, en direction des langues qui en auront le plus besoin, les ressources nécessaires à leur survie et à leur développement dans une Europe plus intégrée.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tEuropa ekonomia integrigo kaj la sorto de malpli uzataj lingvoj\n\t\tLa europa ekonomia integrigo jam havas efikon ce gravaj medioj de la publika kaj privata vivo, kaj la multe disanoncita programo de la \"interna merkato\" povas nur pli-fortigi tiun tendencon. La artikolo ekzamenas la konsekvencojn de ekonomia integrigo je la malpli uzataj lingvoj de Eüropo. La rezultoj de internacikomerca modelo kaj tempo-disdona modelo montras, ke la intensigo de komerco ene de la EK kaj la antaüvidata kresko de enspezoj malsame efikos ce la diversaj minoritataj lingvoj. Aplikante tiujn teoriajn antaǔdirojn al grupo de dek du eǔropaj minoritataj lingvoj, la artikolo montras, ke kvin el ili verŝajne trovos sin en pli favora situacio, kvar verŝajne perdos forton pro ekonomia integrigo, kaj mankas antautaksebla efiko ce la restantaj tri. Tiuj rezultoj povas helpi taksi, kiuj minoritataj lingvoj bezonos apartajn zorgojn kaj atenton per konservaj kaj disvastigaj programoj por teni ilin florantaj en pli integrita Eüropo.</jats:p>",

Er zeigt, daß in der kausalen Beziehung Identität nicht nur mögliche Ursache, sondern auch Folge von räumlichen Entwicklungen und ihren Raumbildern ist, und weist daraufhin, daß Identität keineswegs nur positiv zu bewerten ist.

The refining system consists of a number of subsystems including a filter, heating sulphitor and clarifier, each having series and parallel elements. The mathematical modelling of the failures and repairs of the subsystems is based on the birth and death process and the use of Chapman‐Kolmogorov equations. During the analysis of an actual sugar plant, it has been found that the clarifier unit of the refining system is the most critical component and requires immediate corrective action. Other critical components included are: filter and sulphonation units.</jats:p>",

Con contacto con otro idioma y cultura, hay posibilidades de escoger, dentro de varias limitaciones. Objetivos personates, relaciones económicas y políticas, y las circonstancias socioculturales influen el resultado de contacto y las estrategias disponibles. En la negociación de contacto, el resultado puede ser solamente el conocimiento de la gramática, varios grados del poder comunicar, asimilación al nuevo grupo, o la abilidad de utilizar el idioma para hacer público el posición social de uno, sea para declarar que uno está de acuerdo de desacuerdo con la sociedad dominante. Aquí surgirimos que, una vez se entienda el contexto de contacto, se podrá predecir el resultado.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa negocado kaj rezulto de lingva kaj kultura kontakto\n\t\tEn la vive familiara praktiko de la propra unua lingvo kaj kulturo, oni povas antaŭvidi mastradon ene de la propra socia niĉo kaj, krom se ekzistas malebligoj, tio rezultos. Kontakto kun dua lingvo kaj kulturo kondukas al la ebleco de individua elekto ene de socia kunteksto kun pli aŭ malpli grandaj limigoj. Personaj celoj, politikaj kaj ekonomiaj rilatoj, kaj socikulturaj cirkonstancoj plejparte fiksos la rezulton de kontakto kaj la disponeblajn lingvajn strategiojn. Kiam oni negocas kontakton, la rezulto povas esti nura mastrado de la gramatika strukturo, variaj niveloj de komunika kapablo, integriĝo en la novan grupon, aŭ la kapablo uzi la lingvon kiel ilon por fari socian sinesprimon, ĉu kiel signon de aniĝo al alia grupo, ĉu kiel klopodon kapti prestiĝon aŭ distancigi sin rilate al la reganta socia ordo de la propra medio. En la nuna studo oni sugestas ke la rezulto de lingva kaj kultura kontakto estas antaŭkalkulebla nur kiam oni atingis komprenon de la kunteksto.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tNuestra gente no hablan el Quiché: la etnicidad Quiché, el movimiento étnico ki-che, y el nacionalismo k'iche'\n\t\tLos alfabetos representan, literalmente y figurativamente, la identidad linguistica y étnica de un grupo. El proceso de cambio de identidad étnica del grupo Quiché en Guatemala, América Central, puede ser detallado a través de las representaciones ortográficas que han sido utilizadas o propuestas durante los últimos cincuenta afios. Usando el marco teôrico de Paulston (1987), se ve que la poblaciôn maya de Guatemala esta en un proceso de cambio pasando de ser una colecciôn de étnias a ser una nacionalidad maya unificada. La ortograffa aprobada por el Insti-tuto Indigenista Nacional, la del lider Ki-che, Adrian Chavez, y las llamadas ortografias refor-madas, aprobadas en 1987, representan cada una, una reconfiguraciôn de la identidad étnica del grupo Quiché. Las decisiones que han sido tomadas en cuanto a los alfabetos demuestran estos cambios de perspectiva. En el periodo del indigenismo fue adoptada una politica de promover el \"bienestar\" del indfgena por medio de la asimilaciôn a la cultura mayoritaria. Estas perspectiva filosôfica ha demostrado una gran influencia en las decisiones que se tomaron en el diseño de los primeros alfabetos modernos para los idiomas mayas. La configuratión social de \"etnicidad\", según Paulston permite la asimilaciôn y la pérdida del idioma vernáculo dada una situation en la cual hay acceso al idioma dominante. El indigenismo fomenté este acceso y abriô una época de cambio de idiomas. A la vez, en el caso del Quiché, concediô las oportunidades para que esta etnicidad pasiva se convirtiera en un movimiento étnico. El sistema ortográfico propuesto por Adrian Chavez simboliza este cambio de configuration y los primeros pasos en la resistencia a la pérdida cultural y lingiiistica. Finalmente, los cambios ortográficos autorizados en 1987 simbolizan el ca mbio a una filosofia de disinflation del espanol y la unification de los grupos mayas. Estas y otras son las caracterfsticas del nacionalismo étnico.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tKicea lingvo, etneco Quiché, etna movado Ki-che, naciismo K'iche'\n\t\tAlfabetoj reprezentas, litere kaj figure, la ling van kaj etnan identecojn de difinita homgrupo. Oni povas sekvi la sangoprocedon de etna identeco de la kicea popolo en Gvatemalo ekza-menante la proponitajn au akceptitajn ortografiajn konvenciojn ekde la fruaj 1940aj jaroj, tra la proponitaj alfabetoj de Adrian Chávez, gis la plej lastaj alfabetoj aprobitaj per prezidenta dekreto en 1987. Tiuj sangoj koincidas iom proksime kun la diversaj tipoj de etna organizigo notitaj de Paulston (1987). La observeblaj faktoj sugestas, ke la majaaj grupoj générale, kaj la kiceanoj specife, transformigis el etneco, tra etna movado, gis tio, kion Paulston nomas etna nacieco. La pasiva karaktero de etneco montrigas en la pasiva akcepto de la integrismaj alfabetoj proponitaj en 1940. La karisma gvidado de homo kiel Adrian Chávez kaj lia propono de kontraùasimila alfabeto reprezentas la karakterizojn de etna movado. La alfabeta reformo de 1987, kaj ties forta emfazo je unue6cigo kaj komunaj majaaj distingajoj monstras multajn karakterizojn de etna naciismo.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper trends and varying types of industrial restructuring in Taiwan are examined as the island continues to lose comparative advantage in international markets. Based on some official statistics, triggers of industrial restructuring are explored and the corporate strategies of industries are identified. There is evidence of specific triggers of industrial restructuring which include shortage of labor, rising domestic real wages, appreciation of currency value, increasing raw-material costs, and labor productivity changes. The author addresses corporate strategies both at home and abroad, with emphases upon the issues of hiring illegal foreign workers and the operating of outward investment. The government has played a major role in policy responses as reflected in efforts to expand domestic demand, diversify export markets, and revise mercantilist trade regulations. Additional national efforts include further liberalization of imports and foreign exchange controls and financial system reforms, as well as expansion of technology transfer. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tIl est interdit d'interdire! Il n'est pas interdit d'imposer! Il est recommandé de promouvoir\n\t\tReflecting on the situation in Quebec, this paper attempts to offer a fair solution to the problem of the language(s) of signage. It takes as self-evident that individuals and groups have the right to show their (linguistic) identity as well as to express themselves in the language(s) of their choice, provided that the rights of the (potential) addressees are also met. One way of reconciling the demands of the \"sender\" and those of the \"receiver\" is the use of a common language. An official language has as one of its functions that of being an intended common language. On the one hand, it is proposed that any language can be used on non-official public signs. This ensures that no linguistic identity is hidden, and allows for freedom of expression. On the other hand, a three-rule system is specified which requires that a sign in the official language will be present in every visual field that contains a public message in another language, and that the contents of the non-official message will never be more complete than the corresponding one in the official language. This guarantees, visually and linguistically, that a reading knowledge of the official language is sufficient to understand all there is to understand in the public signs. This guarantees, additionally, the ubiquitous presence of the official language, as well as its global preponderance. It does not guarantee that it is preponderant everywhere. The systems which aim at this latter kind of preponderance (universal preponderance) are doomed to failure, unless they prohibit the use of non-official languages in public signage (an unfair policy, in the view of the author). Too much emphasis on the preponderance question is, at any rate, misguided, and can even lead to counterproductive policies.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tEstas malpermesite malpermesi...\n\t\tRigardante la situacion en Kebekio, la atitoro celas proponi justan solvon a0 l la problemo de la lingvo(j) de afisado. Oni akceptas kiel memevidente, ke individuoj kaj homgrupoj rajtas montri sian (lingvan) identecon kaj sin esprimi en la lingvo(j) de la propra elekto, kondice ke oni ankaù observas la rajtojn de la (potencialaj) adresatoj. Unu vojo por kongruigi la postulojn de la \"sendanto\" kun tiuj de la \"ricevanto\" estas utiligo de komuna lingvo. Oficiala lingvo havas kiel unu el siaj funkcioj la celon roli kiel komuna lingvo. Unuflanke, la atitoro proponas, ke iu ajn lingvo estu uzebla sur neoficialaj publikaj afisoj kaj sildoj. Tio certigas, ke neniu lingva identeco restas kasita, kaj permesas liberecon de esprimigo. Aliflanke, li specifigas triregulan sistemon, kiu postulas, ke afiso en la oficiala lingvo ceestu en ciu vida kampo, kiu enhavas publikan mesagon en alia lingvo, kaj ke la enhavo de la neoficiala mesago neniam estu pli kompleta ol la enhavo de tiu en la oficiala lingvo. Tio garantias, vide kaj lingve, ke lega scipovo de la oficiala lingvo suficas por kompreni cion kompreneblan en la publikaj afisoj kaj sildoj. Krome tio garantias la ciean ceeston de la oficiala lingvo kaj gian generalan superregon. Sed gi ne garantias gian ciean superregon. La sistemoj, kiuj celas ci-lastan specon de superrego (universalan superregon) estas kondamnitaj al malsukceso, krom se ili malpermesas la utiligon de neoficialaj lingvoj en publika afisado (maljusta politiko lau la opinio de la atitoro). Troa emfazo je la demando de superrego estas ciuokaze erara, kaj povas ec konduki al kontraù-produktivaj politikoj.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Asian newly industrializing economies (NIEs) are currently experiencing a shortage of unskilled labor, which makes it difficult for them to remain competitive in low-technology, labor-intensive industries. They are also under pressure from the industrialized economies to open up domestic markets and to readjust the value of their currencies. The lower cost economies of Southeast Asia and China are rapidly catching up with these NIEs in manufactured products, posing challenges for the NIEs to readjust their export strategy. Because of their heavy reliance on exports, the NIEs are vulnerable to exogenous shocks such as price and exchange-rate fluctuations. All these pressures require difficult structural adjustment of industries in the NIEs. Against this backdrop, this author surveys the process of industrial restructuring and its aggregate consequences in the NIEs. Also discussed are macro-level adjustment strategies including offshore investment, upgrading the technological level of industries, expanding the hinterland, and labor importation. More specific questions concerned with labor market and employment are addressed, given the trend of enterprises' adopting a more flexible labor strategy. Finally, the need to look into local variations in enterprise adjustment strategy is discussed, in particular, with a focus on the local context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper makes a number of contributions to our understanding of industrial restructuring and regional adjustment. A distinction is made between restructuring and economic growth and development, with the author arguing that restructuring is more than autonomous economic change; it is a process of deliberate or planned structural reconfiguration. An analytical framework is used to understand the logic of restructuring from the vantage point of the competitive strategies of firms; how firms plan their market strategies given the nature and costs of production, market prices, and the temporal pattern of economic events. The author is also very much concerned with understanding the role of regions in restructuring, moving from the spatial impacts of restructuring through to an understanding of why regions have a significant role in shaping the design and implementation of restructuring, and then to an appreciation of the increasing status of regions in the competitive strategies of corporations. Throughout, reference is made to the experience of North America. In conclusion, however, some observations are made about the relevance of this framework to other countries. </jats:p>",

Le développement de l'agglomération et la diffusion de nouvelles formules de vente (libre-service ; grandes surfaces) ont entraîné une nouvelle répartition des activités commerciales au profit des quartiers périphériques de la capitale portugaise. L'avenir du vieux centre commerçant de la Baixa, reconstruit après le séisme de 1755 et touché par l'incendie du quartier du Chiado en 1988, est au cœur des préoccupations des autorités municipales. La comparaison des différentes formes de centralité commerciale aboutit à la mise en évidence d'une inégale commercialité des lieux.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper is a discussion of the industrial restructuring process associated with changes in the labor-market condition in rapidly developed countries. The author deals with the case of Pusan, Korea, for the empirical verification. Slow growth in the labour supply and quickly rising wages in rapidly developed economies puts pressure on the existing industries and individual firms to restructure. Like other Asian newly industrialized economies, Korea has been experiencing a shortage of labor and rising wages since 1987. Because most of the industries are export oriented, rising wage levels mean declining competitiveness in the world market. Furthermore, a condition of less elastically changing labor supply makes wage levels even higher in every sector in the economy. Industrial restructuring in this sense means finding a way for survival rather than a simple transformation of industries and firms. </jats:p><jats:p> In terms of a region, restructuring means the regional relocation of industrial activities, the exit of firms from existing industries, or the internal and external transformation of firms by the changed economic conditions, especially in the labor market. Changing labor-market conditions and subsequent changes in industrial structure in Pusan are discussed in this paper. The causes and consequences of industrial restructuring are discussed on the basis of individual industries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tDas Gleichgewicht zwischen der makro- und der mikrosoziolinguistischen Perspektive in der Sprachplanung am Beispiel Singapurs\n\t\tDer Artikel zeigt, dafi zur Erklàïung der nationalen Sprachplanung sowohl die makro- als auch die mikrosoziolinguistische Perspektive erforderlich ist. Sprachplanung auf der Makro-ebene ergibt sich aus der Zielsetzung der Konsolidierung des Staates, im Falle Singapurs ins-besondere den Zielen der ethnisch-sozialen Integration und der Wirtschaftsentwicklung. Sprachplanung auf der Mikroebene âuBert sich in der Anpassung der Interaktionssprache der Menschen einschlieBlich des individuellen Spracherwerbs und der Sprachverwendung in der Folge von Verànderungen, die bei Behörden und anderen Institutionen durch die Sprachplanung auf der Makroebene hervorgerufen werden.\n\t\tIn Singapur verfolgt der Staat eine Politik der pragmatischen Sprachenvielfalt und greift zur Erreichung auBersprachlicher Ziele pràventiv in die sprachliche Kommunikation ein. Die Sprachenpolitik in Bildungswesen und Massenkommunikation macht dies deutlich. Diese Makrosprachplanung geht zudem mit einer Unterstutzung externer Normen einher, wodurch die Regierung die Schwierigkeiten der Beurteilung bestimmter Merkmale der sprachlichen Interak-tion vermeidet. Diese Vermeidungstaktik er laubt es der Regierung, die Aufmerksamkeit der Burger auf das langfristige Ziel der Verwendung international gangbarer Normen fur Englisch und Chinesisch (Mandarin) zu lenken. Gleichzeitig werden dialektubergreifende Normen als Mittel zur sozialen Mobilität gefordert, während die Sprachgemeinschaften individueller Var-ianz gegeniiber sehr tolerant sind.\n\t\tDie beiden Sprachplanungsansätze ergänzen einander. Da die Sprachplanung in Singapur auf der Makroebene weiter entwickelt ist, besteht Bedarf an Linguisten und Soziolinguisten sowie auch an Sprachplanern zur Erforschung der Problème der Mikroebene, insbesondere der sprach-lichen Interaktion. Eine ausgewogene Kombination beider Ansätze kann zur Schaffung und Planung der sprachlichen Instrumente Singapurs beitragen. Sie wird langfristig sowohl dem individuellen Fortkommen wie auch den Zielen der Nationalstaatsbildung dienen.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tTeni ekvilihron inter makro- kaj mikro-socilingvistikaj perspektivoj en lingvomastrumado: la kazo de Singapuro\n\t\tLa artikolo montras kiel kaj makro- kaj mikro-socilingvistikaj perspektivoj estas necesaj por klarigi nacian lingvan mastrumadon. Makro-nivela lingvoplanado estas motivata de taskoj de nacia solidarigo fare de la stato, notinde en la kazo de Singapuro taskoj de societna integrigo kaj ekonomia evoluigo. Mikro-nivela lingva mastrumado rilatas al la algustigo fare de la individuo de ties diskursa lingvajo, inkluzive individuan lingvoakiron kaj utiligon responde al instituciaj kaj aliaj sangoj, kiuj fontas el la makronivela planado.\n\t\tSekvante politikon de pragmata multlingvismo, en Singapuro la stato intervenas anticipe en lingva komunikado por subteni nelingvajn celojn. Tion ilustras la lingva politiko en klerigo kaj amaskomunikado. Krome, tiu makronivela lingva mastrumado okazas ene de apogo al eksteraj normoj, tiel fortenante la registaron for de la komplikajoj de taksado de difinitaj aspektoj de dis-kurso. Tiu distanco ebligas la registaron teni la atenton de la publiko je la longperspektiva celo apliki internacie adekvatajn normojn anglalingvajn kaj cinlingvajn. Dume, oni disvastigas eksterdialektajn normojn kiel gardostarajn ilojn por individua socia moveblo, dum grandega individua variado estas tolerata inter parolantoj.\n\t\tLa du aliroj al lingva mastrumo komplementas unu la alian. Pro tio, ke, en Singapuro, oni pli multe progresis ce la makronivelo en lingva mastrumado, oni bezonas pli multajn lingvistojn kaj socilingvistojn, kaj ankau lingvoplanantojn, por esplori pli mikronivelajn demandojn, kun emfazo je diskurso kaj interagado. Ekvilibra apliko de la du aliroj kontribuos al kreado kaj mastrumado de la lingvaj rimedoj de Singapuro, kaj, longperspektive, helpos kaj individuan kreskon kaj la celojn de naciokonstruado.</jats:p>",

We found that a review of routine case records did not yield sufficient information for planning palliative care services in the hospital environment, and therefore decided to conduct a cross-sectional survey involving random patients attending the outpatient division of the Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India. Three hundred and twelve patients were interviewed, and pain and weight loss were found to be the most prominent symptoms (&gt;90%). This study indicates that symptomatology has to be addressed in detail while planning palliative care services in a hospital setting. Even with its selection bias, the study provides valuable clues for the adequate organization and continuation of palliative care services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using content analysis, the core planning elements common to six standard marketing planning models are identified. These have been grouped into an acronym MOSAIC which stands for marketing audit (M), marketing objective (O), strategy (S), action programme (A), implementation (I), and control (C). In addition, four supporting planning elements have also been found and these are mission statement (m), assumption (a), contingency plan (c) and marketing budget (b); represented by the acronym mac-b. MOSAIC mac-b presents a comprehensive framework for a formal marketing planning system. It distinguishes between the core and supporting planning elements and helps the planner to focus on the basic requirements in the marketing planning process. Preliminary feedback from the industry indicates that MOSAIC mac-b can be a valuable tool for appraising the marketing planning process currently being used by a company. The comprehensive framework, encapsulated in a simple acronym, provides easy reference to a complex process and permits its users to challenge the completeness of the existing planning system. The acronym may also serve as a useful teaching aid in business education. </jats:p>",

Innovative approaches to the use of governmental power which thrived in the Progressive era were carried forward into the Age of Normalcy, and new dimensions were added, sometimes with quite interesting results. Moreover, the ideas and institutions tested in the 1920s were then at hand for expanded use and further modification in the next cycle of major reform, in the 1930s.</jats:p>"

The major focus, therefore, will of necessity center on the structural decisions concerning the procurement, allocation, and organization of the \"men, money, and material\" that are intended to sustain Nigeria's strategic policy in the African region. </jats:p>",

The tools, techniques, etc. chosen for this study were those that have been part of the academic marketing literature for well over 15 – 20 years. It was hypothesised that given this long period of time for the theory to perculate into practice, evidence of significant usage of such tools, techniques, etc. should be found in industry, especially in a highly competitive industry. In such an industry, it was expected that firms would be applying the conventional wisdom of marketing theory to focus on both strategy and tactics in order to gain a competitive advantage. </jats:p><jats:p> The findings of the study are that marketers are taking a tactical focus based on the short-term, rather than a longer-term strategic focus; and that even in a highly competitive industry, marketing executives place more importance on the planning aids, performance evaluation techniques and control measures developed in managerial accounting, than those developed in the mainstream of marketing theory. </jats:p>",

Therapy planning is based on a combination of transcutaneous and invasively determined blood gas measurements and clinical observations. After the selection and validation of appropriate parameters, these data are transformed into qualitative values. These are used in our model of neonatal respiration for recommending therapeutic actions according to heuristic clinical rules of artificial ventilation. For the weaning process we implemented three possible strategies, which allow adapting different dynamics of weaning (conservative, normal, aggressive).</jats:p>"

Forty-seven percent of respondents were 60 to 69 years of age. Only 12% were female. Ninety-one percent were white, with 86% of respondents married. Only 24% of the sample (66 of 274) were retired at the time of the survey. Although engaged in more than one area of professional activity, 71% were involved in private practice, with 51% practicing in a private office. The major reasons for retiring were “a full life and ready to change pace” (52%) and “retired to pursue other interests” (25%). Twenty percent retired because of physical illness. A mixed financial package formed their retirement package, which included social security (80%), personal savings (73%), Keogh (64%), and state/US government monies (39%). Retired psychiatrists were interested in receiving additional information on successful patterns of retirement (21%), maintaining emotional and physical health (17%), and material on the problems and trials of retirement (15%). Leisure-time activities were varied, and most psychiatrists reported two to four activities. According to 39% of the sample, retirement should be discussed during medical school, 46% indicated that it should be discussed during residency training, and 80% selected Continuing Medical Education courses.

Although very little evidence supports the fear of notification causing grave psychological problems, more subtle disruptions in quality of life may result. In addition, psychological reactions to notification, such as anxiety or denial, may impede or enhance workers' abilities to process, remember, or act upon the information presented. Measuring how different notification strategies affect quality of life is crucial; this process can enable us to design and select effective strategies that improve, rather than disrupt, the lives of workers and their families. Two preliminary efforts to include consideration of quality of life in planning and evaluating notification programs are described. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains a study of the response of shifting agriculture to several social and environmental changes in circumstances in which farmers form in a relatively sophisticated manner their expectations of the future values of key economic variables. Farmers are ‘given’ a model of expectations formation in which the expected future value of variables interact in the same manner as in the current period. With this structure of expectations, the responses of the length of fallow period (the inverse of the percentage of available land cultivated in the initial period), the total area of land under cultivation and lying fallow in the initial period of a rotational cycle, and the initial-period wage rate and spatial structure of land rent to changes in several social and environmental parameters are examined. Several salient characteristics commonly attributed to shifting, or rotational, agriculture are replicated. Higher crop prices and increased population shorten fallow periods. Those same changes also increase the total area of land under shifting agriculture. Higher interest rates also shorten fallow periods. Fallows are longer at locations farther from central markets. Less commonly recognized is that social feedbacks operate to reduce pressure on more fragile land, although this does not imply that, other things being equal, fragile tropical land will not be ‘overused’ in an ecological sense. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tLa encrucijada lingüística de una colonia norteamericana:\n\t\tLa decisión que convirtió el español en el idioma oficial de Puerto Rico\n\t\tEn abril de 1991 el gobierno de Puerto Rico proclamé el espanol como su único idioma oficial. Este nuevo estatuto sustituyó la ley del 1902 que había hecho del español y el inglés los idiomas del gobierno de este territorio no-incorporado de los Estados Unidos. Aunque la postura oficial del gobierno ha sido justificar la nueva ley como un gesto noble y valiente en defensa de la cultura e idioma islenos frente a la doble amenaza de la americanización y el empobrec-imiento lingüístico, el hecho es que la misma es sumamente controversial y no cuenta actual-mente con el apoyo de la mayoría de los puertorriquenos.\n\t\tEste trabajo presenta el debate emotivo que precedió a la aprobación de la legislación, haciendo énfasis en los argumentos típicamente favorecidos por defensores y detractores de la nueva política. Nuestro análisis sugiere que la verdadera razón por la cual se aprobó la ley era hacer que la estadidad fuese menos viable como opción de status politico para Puerto Rico. La oposición a la ley se concentré en dos planteamientos: que la nueva política fuera percibida por los norteamericanos como un rechazo a los Estados Unidos, o como una expresión del deseo puertorriqueno de separarse de los Estados Unidos; y/o que la nueva ley era indicio de falta de compromiso por parte del gobierno de proveerle acceso al inglés a la población de la isla.\n\t\tNuestra evaluación del proceso decisional señala que un numero pequeño de intelectuales suscritos a una ideología hispanicista, la mayoria de ellos independentistas, fueron los que lograron que se aprobara la nueva ley. A pesar de la oposición mayoritaria, entendemos que esta nueva política contribuirá positivamente a la resolución eventual del status politico de Puerto Rico.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tUsona kolonio ce lingva vojkrucigo:\n\t\tla decido igi la hispanan la oficiala lingvo de Portoriko\n\t\tEn aprilo 1991, la registaro de Portoriko proklamis la hispanan sia sola oficiala lingvo. La nova statuto anstataüis legon de 1902, kiu deklaris la hispanan kaj la anglan la registaraj lingvoj en tiu al Usono neenkadrigita teritorio. Dum la norma registara linio celas pravigi tiun novan legon kiel noblan kaj kuragan geston defende al la kulturo kaj lingvo de la insulo kontraü la duoblaj minacoj de usonigo kaj lingva malricigo, verdire temas pri tre disputiga lego, kiu momente ne havas la subtenon de la majoritato de la portorikanoj. La artikolo konsideras la emocian debaton, kiu antaüis la akcepton de la lego, fokusante je la argumentoj tipe prezentitaj de defendantoj kaj malaprobantoj de la nova politiko. Tiuj analizoj implicas, ke la vera kialo de akcepto de la lego estis igi statecon malpli praktika kiel ebleco por la politika statuso de Porto-riko. Kontraüado al la lego centrigis je du argumentoj: timo, ke la nova politiko povus esti rigardata de usonanoj kiel malakcepto de Usono, au kiel esprimo de la deziro de Portoriko apartigi de Usono; kaj/au suspekto, ke la lego montras malpliigon de la sindedico de la registaro al liverado de aliro al la angla lingvo por la generala enlogantaro. La pritakso fare de la autoroj koncerne la decidan procedon montras, ke malgranda nombro da intelektuloj, kiuj subtenas potencan hispanfavoran ideologion, kaj kiuj plejparte favoras sendependecon por Portoriko, konsistigis la motoron malantaü la subskribo de la lego. Malgrau majoritata kontraüado, oni vidas ke la nova politiko pozitive kontribuas al la fina solvo de la demando de la politika statuso de Portoriko.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is an attempt to probe the interactions of economic restructuring and labour-market development in the process of industrial development in contemporary Hong Kong. The discussion is mainly divided into two parts. First is an examination of the development of the Hong Kong economy in the context of the changing world economy and, in particular, the effects of the structuring of the global division of labour on changes in the economic structure of Hong Kong in the 1980s. The growth of the tertiary sector and the concomitant process of deindustrialisation stand out as the two most important features of the Hong Kong economy in the 1980s and the years to come. Second the kinds of labour-market strategy developed in response to changes in the economic structure are examined. The recent debate on the importation of labour and the growing concern of industrial relocation reflect the developing pattern of labour-market adjustment. It is contended that in order to grasp the dynamics of the structuring of labour-market strategies, the interactions among the international economic environment, state policy, the formation of industrial capital, and the bargaining power of labour must be probed. The case of Hong Kong is one characterised by the dominance of small local manufacturing establishments, a noninterventionist state, underdeveloped shop-floor or labour organisations, and an industrial economy heavily dependent on exports. All these factors contribute to the constitution of the ‘Hong Kong way’ of continuing labour-intensive production and making adjustments in labour-market strategies to cope with the process of economic restructuring. </jats:p>",

Inverse transformation then provides maps of disease dynamics in ‘real’ geographic and social spaces. </jats:p><jats:p> Techniques are sketched for determining the sociogeographic structure of a large, geographically centered social network, providing a possible empirical basis for predicting forms and rates of spread of the initial, rapid, stages of an HIV outbreak for networks not yet infected, and perhaps greatly expanding the utility of routinely collected small-area administrative data sets in the design of mutually reinforcing, multifactorial disease-control strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The production potential of rainfed kenaf in the Northern Territory (NT) (latitude 12-15�S.) has been assessed using a growth simulation model for the cultivar Guatemala 4. However, this raises the important question of how well-suited is this cultivar, and what are the likely yield gains which might be obtained by breeding or selecting a different cultivar. Answering these questions with conventional experimentation would be expensive, given the variable yield response among seasons associated with rainfall variability in the NT. Accordingly, the kenaf growth simulation model NTKENAF was used in conjunction with long-term climatic data for two sites in the NT to assess the value of different plant traits relative to Guatemala 4, that are potential selection criteria in plant breeding. Extending the duration from sowing to flowering resulted in relatively small gains in stem yield over Guatemala 4, but substantial yield losses were predicted by using an earlier flowering cultivar. Increasing the efficiency of water use (higher transpiration efficiency) greatly increased yield, and was the most risk-efficient crop improvement strategy. Unfortunately, the prospects for improving transpiration efficiency of kenaf by plant breeding remain uncertain. Increasing the amount of water available for crop growth by greater extent of soil water extraction had little effect on yield in this water-limited environment. Changing the yield potential of kenaf by altering the photosynthetic capacity (higher radiation use efficiency) was risk-efficient in some situations, but the mean yield change was relatively small. It is concluded from the simulation analysis, that the standard cultivar Guatemala 4 is well-suited to the NT environment. </jats:p>"

The model is based on the coupling of two low cost and powerful project management (Artemis 2000) and computer aided design systems (AutoCAD 10) through an intermediary package (dBase IV). The main aim of this model is automate the planning process of in‐situ concrete structures, particularly the generation of network plans, using data generated by CAD systems. The model functional specifications (i.e., modeling, drafting, quantities and materials scheduling, time analysis, cost analysis, and reporting) were established after a thorough review of current planning models, a detailed questionnaire survey conducted amongst the main UK and USA contractors on the current status of planning techniques and information technology applications, and a detailed study of the various problems facing CAD‐based models.</jats:p><jats:p>This model consists of three individual sub‐systems: modelling, data transfer and planning. The integration of these individual sub‐systems has been achieved on an IBM PS/2 MODEL 70. This enables the generation of network plans in the AutoCAD package (modelling subsystem) which are then automatically transferred (data transfer sub‐system) to the Artemis system for time and cost analyses (planning sub‐system). This paper outlines the work done so far and illustrates the proposed concept with a simplified case study.</jats:p>",

Hohe Grundstückspreise, knappes Angebot und kommunalpolitische Willensbildungen hatten ihre Weiterentwicklung lange Zeit stärker eingeschränkt.Das zugängliche Datenmaterial ist insbesondere bezüglich Umsatz und Planungsabsichten wenig ergiebig. Ausreichend verläßliche Informationsquellen mußten aufgespürt werden, um einen Sektor des Einzelhandels auf einem regional bedeutsamen Markt transparent zu machen, der von sich eher bedeckt haltenden Entscheidungsträgern beherrscht wird.Die bestehenden 34 Fachmärkte mit insgesamt rd. 115 000 m2 Verkaufsfläche sollen an neun Standorten um ca. 36 000 m2 vermehrt werden. Dieses Wachstum stellt nicht nur eine Herausforderung an den kleinteiligen Fachhandel, sondern auch an den Großhandel und an kleine Baumärkte dar. Die Dynamik in diesem Bereich zeigt sich auch in der Verringerung der Vertriebsschienen, in Konzentrationsbewegungen bei den Eigentümerverhältnissen und in der Sortimentsausweitung.Die Entwicklungsmuster dieser großflächigen Einzelhandelsformen werden auf siedlungsstrukturelle Zusammenhänge hinterfragt. Fast alle Einzelhandelsgroßprojekte durchlaufen zweistufige Planungsverfahren. Welche Ansprüche stellen Landes‑, Regional- und Bauleitplanung an diese Projekte im Rahmen von Raumordnungsverfahren und Bebauungsplänen?Es wird dargelegt, welche Hilfestllung die Landes- und Regionalplanung bei diesen Prozessen mit raumbedeutsamen Auswirkungen auf die Versorgungslandschaften und das zentralörtliche System geben (können).</jats:p>"

In such a situation, a plan for expansion of the system capacity must be made robust against the aforementioned uncertainties. Large‐scale power plants require a long time for construction so that the decision of construction must be made under much uncertainty in the future. On the other hand, small‐scale plants require less time for construction, i.e., the decision can be made under less uncertainty in spite of their relatively higher costs.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper is concerned with an optimal combination of the large‐scale and the small‐scale plants having the aforementioned characteristics under uncertainty of future demand. First, the demand growth in the future is described by scenarios of demand growth branching like a tree. Then the optimization problem of the system expansion is formulated into a stochastic linear‐programming problem. An optimal solution of the problem is obtained by using the scenario‐aggregation algorithm proposed by Rockafellar and Wets. The simulation results, yielded by using a parallel computation on transputers, show that there is a possibility of constructing small‐scale power plants to cope with the uncertainty even if they are more expensive than the large‐scale plants.</jats:p>",

The spatial division of labor that appeared in the 1970s was related mainly to the Korean government's promotion of the rise of large enterprises to institutionalize heavy and chemical industrial development. Since the 1980s, in addition to the role of the state, corporate strategy and regional characteristics have been regarded as important factors for understanding the undergoing industrial restructuring. Concentration and development of high-tech industries in the Seoul metropolitan region during the 1980s have progressed with evolving intensified spatial division of labor beyond the spatial separation of headquarters and production units. The evolution of intensified spatial division of labor is the result of corporate strategy which regionally separates technical workers from production workers on the one hand, and corporate strategy in utilizing regional characteristics from the government's decentralization policy on the other hand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The establishment of a pulp and paper industry based on kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) in semi-arid northern Australia requires clear demonstration of the long-term production potential of kenaf in this region. Owing to the high rainfall variability both within and among seasons, it would be difficult to assess the potential of a new dryland industry from traditional experimentation. Accordingly, this study was undertaken to assess the climatic risks to dryland kenaf production in the Northern Territory (NT) using the kenaf simulation model NTKENAF, which has been developed and validated for this climatic zone. The kenaf model was run, using long-term historical weather data, to determine optimal sowing strategies and expected yields at four representative sites in the NT. In the NT, a codict existed between sowing early, with resulting long duration and high yield potential, but high probability of plant mortality, and sowing later, with more reliable plant population, but shorter duration and lower yields. A general recommendation over all sites was for a sowing window extending from the start of November to mid-December each year; lower yields were simulated for earlier sowing dates due to problems with crop establishment, and for later sowing dates due to crop growth extending past the end of the wet season in most years. However, in circumstances of high rainfall prior to November, there was a yield advantage at several sites from sowing early. Over the 100 years of climatic data for Katherine (14� 28'S.) and sowing when 30 mm rainfall occurred in a 5-day period after 1 November, simulated stem yields for kenaf ranged from 800 to 17200 kg ha-1, with a mean stem yield of 8673 kg ha-1 and coefficient of variation of 42%. At the higher rainfall site of Douglas Daly (13� 48'S.), over 21 seasons and using the same sowing criterion, stem yields ranged from 4490 to 19 200 kg ha-1, with a mean stem yield of 12 509 kg ha-1 and coefficient of variation of 27%. Simulated stem yields were higher at the wettest site of Adelaide River (13� 06'S.) and lowest at the driest site of Larrimah (15� 36'S.). In the planning of a potential kenaf industry in the northern Australia, this research study has provided the essential information of yield probability distributions for kenaf crops grown at selected sites in the NT.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Under the mandate of a Species Survival Plan (SSP), reproductive status was assessed in 128 cheetahs maintained in 18 different institutions in North America. A mobile laboratory research team evaluated cheetahs using anesthesia, serial blood sampling, electroejaculation (males), and laparoscopy (females). Biomaterials were also collected for parallel studies of genetics, nutrition, and health. There was no mortality, and cheetahs were capable of reproducing naturally after these intense manipulatory examinations. No marked differences were observed in reproductive or endocrine characteristics between proven and unproven breeders. However, males consistently produced teratospermic ejaculates, and cheetah sperm were compromised in conspecific or heterologous in vitro fertilization systems. Structurally abnormal sperm were found to be filtered by the oocyte's zona pellucida. More than 80% of the females were anatomically sound, but morphological and endocrine evidence suggested that ∼50% or more of the population may have had inactive ovaries at the time of the examination. Males ranging in age from 15 to 182 months produced spermic ejaculates, but motile sperm numbers/ejaculate and circulating testosterone concentrations were highest in males 60 to 120 months old. Parovarian cysts were observed in 51.5% of female cheetahs, but comparisons between proven and unproven subpopulations revealed that this abnormality likely had no influence on fertility. Fresh luteal tissue was not observed in any nonpregnant or nonlactating female, strongly suggesting that the cheetah is an induced ovulator. Overall survey results were discussed in the context of the etiology of reproductive inefficiency, especially with respect to the potential importance of biological versus management factors. Four high priority research areas in cheetah reproductive biology were identified: 1) continuous monitoring of ejaculate quality in the extant population, while studying the impact of pleiomorphisms on fertility; 2) determining the potential relationship between libido and androgen production (excretion) in males; 3) confirming the extent of cyclic, or acyclic, ovarian activity in females; and 4) continued development of assisted reproductive techniques for enhancing man‐agement. In summary, a multidisciplinary, multi‐institutional survey coordinated through the SSP is both possible and useful for generating a physiological and health database beneficial to driving further research and management initiatives. © 1993 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
