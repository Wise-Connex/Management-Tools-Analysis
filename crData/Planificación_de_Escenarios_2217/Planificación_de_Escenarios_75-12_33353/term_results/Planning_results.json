E. Lambert and his associates. The study synthesizes the findings, resolving apparent contradictions by means of certain intervening social‐psychological variables. This synthesis is applied to a model constructed from Fishman's summary of world‐wide policy responses to bilingualism and bi‐dialectal education. This socio‐linguistic synthesis is related to political alternatives available for the implementation of the planning. From this, the study demonstrates possible alternative responses to <jats:italic>Lau vs. Nichols.</jats:italic> The study defines and evaluates each response and concludes in favor of a pluralistic response with its‘bargaining’ consequence.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Decisionmaking in the industrialized nations of the western world increasingly can be characterized by its scale and speed of implementation. Another facet of decisionmaking is the narrowness with which problems are defined and the equally narrow range of alternatives sought for solution. This paper documents these elements of decisions and also sketches out a number of scenarios where such an approach has led to unexpected, and often undesirable, consequences. </jats:p><jats:p> An alternative view of complex decisions, based on these scenarios, is developed. It relies heavily not on optimization as its pivotal criterion but rather upon the persistence of the decisionmaking unit, which is ultimately our society. Examples are presented which illustrate the counterproductive nature of many optimizing solutions. The argument is made that in an uncertain world, such as the one in which we live, optimizing approaches to decisions cannot succeed in the longer run because their assumptions about the constancy of our world do not hold up. Accordingly, a more flexible framework is suggested which values the complexity and uncertainty of the socioecological systems within which we must operate. The stability of these systems is seen to be a critical consideration of decisions, and several aspects of stability are presented which have been overlooked in the past. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper is concluded with a number of points which it is argued should be explicitly accounted for in future decisionmaking frameworks. Among the points stressed are: the desirability of making small scale decisions and implementing them slowly; the need to acknowledge the limits of what is knowable and thus the role of uncertainty; the virtues of maintaining a diversity of components in our socioecological systems; and finally the need to keep decision options open. </jats:p>",

Many economists in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have advocated reform of the planning mechanism from the perspective of promoting a more efficient use of resources through the increased use of techniques such as linear programming. It is argued that linear programming techniques may improve upon rule of thumb approaches to plan formulation and execution in some local situations. How ever, the extension of such techniques to an entire economy in an integrated fashion, often called optimal planning, obscures one of the fundamental problems of socialist political economy — the relationship between the planning mechanism and the construction of socialism. </jats:p>",

The relative marginal values reflecting quality and accessibility of various sources can aid in planning future water resource development. The supply curves derived from the model are useful for pricing policies. The relative locational advantages of water and waste water treatment plants enter importantly into capacity expansion decisions. The least cost solution indicates the necessity of a facility to recycle waste water for municipal use under increased demand conditions.</jats:p>",

The present paper examines methods by which distributed-lag, transfer-function models can be used for forecasting regional economic structure. The methods are based upon assumptions of both static and dynamic parameter behaviour in the future, and derive from an extension of the Wiener-Kalman filter to spatio—temporal problems, yielding minimum mean-square error forecasts. On the basis of the methods developed, a set of forecasts is prepared for the future levels of population and employment in sixty-nine employment exchange areas in the North-west region up to 1975 on the basis of data available in 1970. These forecasts are then compared with those obtained from other studies, especially the recently published Strategic Plan for the North-west. This comparison shows similar results for most areas, but divergences in other instances. It is noted that the forecasts achieved by the present methods are considerably cheaper and easier to obtain than those derived from the methods usually adopted in regional strategies. </jats:p>",

The historical evolution of that struggle finds a common denominator in the structural similarities of the national economies of the region. Assessment of Brazil's experience in the post-1929 period should therefore yield insights into the problems that Latin America as a whole faced during the international upheaval spawned by the financial collapse of 1929. Such an appraisal may also provide empirical assistance for the elaboration of future comparative studies. The specific analytical focus of this article is the attitude of Getúlio Vargas' government toward industrialization and planning, a theme whose re-evaluation serves, furthermore, to do justice to the enigmatic and reluctant revolutionary who governed Brazil during critical years and depression and war.</jats:p>",

Interpretations have revealed two robust factors of ‘high-income expatriate workers’ and ‘low-income blue- and white-collar workers’ in 1961. By 1971 a more diversified socioeconomic stratification of the Chinese and high-income expatriate workers had emerged. A new ‘public-housing residents’ dimension also appeared. The spatial patterns of the social areas of Hong Kong over a decade, obtained by a numerical procedure of cluster analysis, have also been compared, and the massive involuntary redistribution of population that resulted in the creation of a peripheral, government public-housing area in the previously rural—urban fringe area has been noted. These lead to some theoretical considerations of the validity of Western urban theories and concepts since the Hong Kong spatial pattern tends towards a greater degree of regularity. It is also recommended that the orthogonal and oblique rotations can complement each other to give the macro and micro variations of the urban dimensions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is directed at the following question: How far is the national accounting system as developed in the industrially advanced countries and recommended by the United Nations applicable and useful to countries at an early stage of development? In order to examine the suitability of this tool, the nature of economic policy decisions and their dependence on macro‐statistical constructs are analysed, the emphasis being on planning as actually undertaken in the field or going to be undertaken in the near future and not on planning activities as possibly ought to be attempted. The conclusion reached, based upon personal experience in Africa, the Caribbean area, Brazil and Venezuela, both as “producer” and “user” of data, is that planning is mainly limited to the public sector. Comprehensive plans, prepared with the assistance of foreign consultants, were generally forgotten soon after publication, the driving force behind those plans being external pressure by bilateral donors and international agencies and propaganda‐prestige motives. Real over‐all economic management or consistent medium term planning of the whole economy never appeared to be an important factor in the decision‐making process, possibly because those concepts are far too abstract and do not have short‐term impact.</jats:p><jats:p>The role of national accounting should therefore be limited to the provision of a general framework and factual support for public sector planning activities. In practice the United Nations system has been found far too complicated and ambitious, not sufficiently development planning oriented, and not suitable to the limited statistical resources available in the developing countries.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper recommends the publication of several detailed “case studies” in national accounting, hoping that those studies might help to identify types of accounting systems appropriate to different existing constellations. In the meantime a drastic scaling down of the United Nations system should be undertaken; we should try to equate demand and supply of relevant information.</jats:p><jats:p>In the final part, the paper considers planning requirements (timetable and flexibility, information required for a general assessment of the economy, crucial role of the publicsector, relative precision), statistical requirements (resources, data available, priorities, international reporting) and decision‐makers’requirements (compactness, simplicity, background information, wishes of external aid donors) and recommends, as an interim measure, a simplified system of national accounts consisting of eight main tables.</jats:p>",
