The best operating policies for such a system were also derived. The approach of this paper extends the previous approach by recognizing the value of water carried over from one season to the next. A modified version of the previous approach is used to generate reservoir level transition probabilities and expected benefits. A dynamic programing model is then used to estimate the expected benefits from allocating water optimally between seasons. These expected benefits are a function of acreage developed for irrigation and beginning‚Äêseason reservoir levels. Such a function allows a decision maker at any decision point within an irrigation season to equate the expected net benefits from allocating water to the rest of the current season with the expected net benefits from saving such water for the following season. This decision‚Äêmaking process is simulated for a number of seasons. The results of an application of the models indicate that such interseasonal transfer can considerably increase the present value of expected benefits from the project.</jats:p>",

The techniques discussed are an input‚Äêoutput‚Äêbased demand projection model and a mathematical programing supply model. The impacts discussed relate to the coordination and control of the planning process, the consideration of multiple objectives, the assessment of uncertainty, the efficiency of planning, the scope for the exercise of judgment, and the opportunity for a planning process continued beyond the final report. The writer concludes that the impact of systems techniques has been positive and recommends that no major water resource planning efforts be undertaken in the future without a commitment to the use of systems techniques.</jats:p>",

In recent years widespread attention has been given the time-wise interdependencies involved, but the focus has been conceptual and not directed to yield an implementable model. In the present paper a workable, multi-stage planning model is developed by combining these developments in corporate finance with techniques from optimal systems control. The firm is viewed as attempting to optimize a multiple-objective criterion of time-dated variables involving both short-and long-term financial goals. Random elements are considered to be part of the process by which decisions affect the firm's financial state and an optimal decision strategy developed for an important first-approximation model. The paper concentrates on the general model structure and specific means for implementation; rigorous mathematical analysis is suppressed. An illustrative application is presented and potential uses discussed. </jats:p>",

They are characterized by a low intrinsic value, a high bulk, and a delivered price which is very sensitive to the transportation cost associated with moving them from the quarries to their points of demand, It is ironic that the cities which create the demands for mineral aggregates are, at the same time, preventing their extraction by being built over them or by legally limiting their use through zoning restrictions. </jats:p><jats:p> The simulation model which has been developed enables the planner to investigate the effects of various zoning strategies. It allows him to investigate the results of limiting individual operations and to force the removal of material from a site before it is covered by urban development.

The planning region is assumed to consist of geographically defined subareas or census blocks, of known location. The population is stratified in such a way that each stratum exhibits relatively homogeneous patterns of health-care utilization. The model characterizes the effects of center locations upon aggregate utilization and utilization of individual centers, and gives optimal locations of centers with respect to several alternative criteria.

If housing demand is elastic, then this dependence is shown to be exponential, a conclusion which agrees with a familiar result obtained by maximising the entropy of a population system subject to a cost constraint.

A procedure for deriving best statistics based on the principle of maximum-likelihood is then developed from the work of Hyman and Evans, and the methodology is illustrated using the example of a retail gravity model. Five methods for solving the maximum-likelihood equations are outlined: procedures based on a simple first-order iterative process, the Newton‚ÄîRaphson method for several variables, multivariate Fibonacci search, search using the Simplex method, and search based on quadratic convergence, are all tested and compared. It appears that the Newton‚ÄîRaphson method is the most efficient, and this is further tested in the calibration of disaggregated residential location models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The setting of air quality standards for classes of air pollution in a region is one approach to the protection of public health and welfare by defining limits on levels of pollution in the air. </jats:p><jats:p> We present methods to determine regional emission regulations that are (1) feasible in the sense that they lead to compliance with air quality standards and (2) optimal in the sense that the total economic impact due to implementation is minimized. Under goal (1) we set forth a procedure more sophisticated than heuristic procedures such as those guaranteeing compliance on a fixed rectangular set of grid receptor points in a region. We discuss various modifications responding to issues of regulatory policy, thereby obtaining a more accurate picture of the total impact of implementation of control strategies. </jats:p><jats:p> We also indicate how damage functions may be incorporated, where now the standard (or the set of multiple standards) is a variable to be determined, together with emission rate reductions, so as to minimize the joint sum of individual control costs for the region and the total of damage costs, while keeping pollutant emissions below standards (to be determined) at all point coordinates in the region. </jats:p><jats:p> In this way control strategies and emission standards may be derived jointly in a framework that automatically balances decrements of damage due to improved air quality with increased control costs associated with tighter standards. Furthermore the model determines the location of the maximum concentration intensities, which may not necessarily be on grid points, and hence indicates where to place sampling stations in order to guarantee compliance at all coordinates in the region over the prescribed period of time. </jats:p>",

This paper, which is intended to be complementary to those papers, presents an analytical method for planning a range of centrifugal pumps based on a cost analysis of the models in the range. The method, which seeks to determine the number, size and spacing of the models to cover the specified, continuous range of duties, is based on adequate performance of each of the models in the range at minimum production cost for the total number of units to be produced. </jats:p><jats:p> To show that meaningful results can be obtained by using this method, a numerical example is presented. The method is applied to the planning of a range of centrifugal pumps in which each model operates at constant rotational speed with constant impeller diameter. The Fortran IV digital computer programme used in the solution of this example is included. </jats:p>",
