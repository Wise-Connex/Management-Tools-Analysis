The article states that the most important consideration in planning a major expansion of a water system is to allow time for completion of the project. The article discusses Sacramento's experience with allowing for sufficient time for making a comprehensive study of the existing system, developing a master plan of improvements, and financing and construction. The various phases should be carefully worked out and executed, making use of consulting firms and competent construction engineers. By planning ahead and planning carefully, the growth, health, and prosperity of the community will not be jeopardized by an inadequate water supply.</jats:p>",
