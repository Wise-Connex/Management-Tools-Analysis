Generalized drift velocities are obtained by using the generalized first invariant which has been shown to be useful in such current sheet configurations. Particles whose generalized invariant is preserved gain energy entirely in the field‐aligned direction. The form of the accelerated particle velocity distribution is obtained and self‐consistency conditions are derived.</jats:p>",
