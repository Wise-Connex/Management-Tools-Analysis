The article is largely concerned with problems for transport planning arising from the book and the official transport and planning documents of 1968 and 1969. The latter's land use and transport model is criticised for its neglect of the economic implications of its ‘suppression’ of trips where networks are overloaded. The model parameters should be required to conform to observed distributions of journey lengths, especially those to work, based on workplace data and recognising the influences, inter alia, of variations in income and levels of skill. A key question in making present models better reflect the long-run interaction between transport and land use is predicting journey-to-work lengths. A model to explain their past change is proposed, based on Census data, measuring the effect of changes in job opportunities, housing demands, and population shifts. </jats:p>",

Some examples of the limitations of current planning are given, and the need for a more comprehensive approach is suggested. P.P.B.S. is defined and the current role of physical planners is examined in relation to it. A wider view of planning and different types of plans are stated, and the probable impact of P.P.B.S. on future planning through objectives, analysis, programming and information systems is discussed. Increasing emphasis is likely to be placed on full interdisciplinary collaboration if the potential of P.P.B.S. is to be realised. </jats:p>",

The foreman may have regarded it as an usurpation of a management prerogative to accept suggestions for changes in plans from his workers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes an application of a Lowry type model in a comparative study of the urbanisation effects, on an outer metropolitan sub-region, of locating the third London airport on two of the sites proposed by the Roskill Commission. The sites are at Cublington in Buckinghamshire and Thurleigh in Bedfordshire. No detailed attempt is made to explain the formal structure of the model. Attention is focussed instead on a description of the impact, in terms of activity change and inter-urban journeys, on the spatial structure of the Bedfordshire sub-region. The model is used first in a one-shot conditional prediction of the growth of the sub-region without an airport, and then including the airport in each of the proposed locations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author takes a fresh look at the introduction of rent controls and their justification. She examines the tenants' need for ‘security of tenure’ and considers some of the undesirable social consequences which stem from tenancies ‘at will’. Alternative methods of granting security of tenure are examined to assess their economic consequences, and it is shown that these do not differ very significantly from those which rent controls produce. A general question is posed on the difference between an ‘individual contract’ approach to the legal difficulties of insuring security of tenure over time, as opposed to a statutory contract which covers whole groups in the population. The author makes a plea for bringing together the best of these two legal possibilities and criticises certain aspects of present British rent control machinery. </jats:p>",

Proposed solutions by Merriam and Sneath (1966) and Haggett (1967) are revised in the light of the indicated instability of coefficients under shifts in the grid systems for such maps. A number of stable classifications of city structures can be built up which are invariant under orthogonal grid rotations but most of these break down under non-orthogonal rotations. Variances accounted for by successive terms (linear, quadratic, cubic) appeared stable and are recommended for preliminary analysis. The fundamental problems of pattern analysis remain unresolved by trend-surface coefficients. The argument in the paper is largely empirical and is illustrated from simulated urban patterns and by fifteen sample metropolitan areas from the United States. </jats:p>",
