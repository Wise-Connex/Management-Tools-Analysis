Business strategies, objectives, and constraints set the overall business environment. All aspects of investment and expenditures should be put in the context of business priorities. The core business investment in wells or facilities and support activities in research, IT, human resources, etc., should be aligned with and prioritized within the broader business objectives. The key deliverables from the integrated planning process are the business plans and the budgets.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>IT can be defined as any technology which enables the acquisition, modification, use, and deletion of data or information. In the broadest sense, IT includes non-computer-related data or information like library records that increasingly are available in electronic form. The Information Planning process (exercise) sets the direction and efforts for IT as they relate to business requirements. The total effort from the information planning process is documented in an Information Plan.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The planning process should establish key principles and directions for IT, i.e., set the technical strategies. These principles should define the direction and guidelines for applying IT in the business and how it will migrate or change over the planning cycle.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Alignment of the Business and IT</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Initial efforts in the information planning process should identify the business strategies and the enabling IT. This can be a relatively complex task but the final check on the quality of an information plan is whether the correct investment is being made to meet corporate objectives. For example, some new E&amp;P technologies, like 3D petrophysics (interwell logging), will increase the volume of data handled, processed, and stored by several orders of magnitude. Tables 2 and 3 give further examples.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban development within the developing world was, until just over a decade ago, seen primarily as the responsibility of government. A shift has taken place from the traditional approach of centralised, top-down decision-making to one in which government's role involves the creation of an environment which enables urban residents to solve many of their own problems. This shift not only involves new responsibilities for urban residents, but for government, particularly local authorities, as well. Four problems are singled out for detailed consideration. The first of these is shelter. Although it is increasingly recognised that governments should not be in the business of providing houses for people, misdirected policies of imposing unaffordable standards and inappropriate approaches have the effect of preventing the urban poor in developing nations from solving their own problem. A consideration of urban service provision in such cities underlines the need to involve the community itself in the planning and supply of such services. A crucial constraint on meeting the financial demands for the provision of shelter and services is found in the official discouragement that is frequently directed toward informal-sector employment which comprises a significant proportion of all employment opportunity. Tolerance of this sector is a prerequisite for sustainability. Finally, the case is made for deriving local solutions to local urban problems within both the areas of urban physical planning and urban development projects. The paper concludes that appropriate policies must be adopted by governments which involve local communities in the planning process. As each sector interacts with others, comprehensiveness is required for any feasible and sustainable solution. </jats:p>",

Structural changes in the economy and political institutions threaten the social rights of citizenship and the standing of individuals in the polity.

Interviews with residents of Pueblo, CO, are used to evaluate the ways in which citizens respond to restructuring. I argue that residents of Pueblo may be successful in the short term in using their activism to respond to the new opportunities and needs created by restructuring. However, the inability of residents to create linkages among members of social groups may ultimately limit their ability to forge a new progressive politics out of restructuring. </jats:p>",

The growth and consolidation of office districts over the last twenty years have revived interest in developing coherent and efficient pedestrian networks, which can be coordinated with other transportation needs within the downtown. Ambitious plans for expansion of the downtown for offices, the retail and service industries as well as for housing and entertainment have been adopted in many North American cities during the 1980s. The successful integration of these large central areas depends to a considerable extent on the implementation of expanded pedestrian networks. This paper discusses certain spatial characteristics of North American cities which call for specific network designs and research into the walking environments of central areas. More knowledge is needed of the relative contributions to pedestrian regeneration of land use combinations, the design of networks and of walking paths.</jats:p>",

Gisser and Sanchez (1980) show in a specific context that this qualitative distinction is quantitatively negligible. However, this result seems to defy the common consensus that in many aquifers, depletion will occur prematurely. Given these observations, serious questions arise concerning the role and scope of water management policy. We further explore this issue under alternative hydrologic/economic hypotheses and note scenarios under which divergence of competitive and socially optimal rates of water pumping is significant. We find that divergence increases with demand growth, declining well yields, and low social discount rates. The role and scope of policy are then inferred.</jats:p>",

Decisions made during this stage allow organizations to choose which products, services, or markets to abandon or pursue, how to allocate resources, how to design the organization to carry out a chosen strategy, and how to compete. For example, Morrison Restaurants, Inc., has developed and implemented an integrated strategic plan for the organization as a whole as well as strategic plans for each of its three divisions and multiple concepts. The overall plan addresses how an organization that operates different concepts in various markets will pursue its organizational goals and describes how each division and concept should contribute to achieving those goals. In effect, Morrison Restaurants has established a hierarchy of flexible plans linked to one another through supporting goals and objectives. It did so by developing a mission statement and a related set of goals, creating operational plans that could achieve those goals, and making action plans to show how to carry out the operational goals.

A research model is developed that links two major dimensions of IS planning—the quality of the planning process and planning effectiveness—with a set of eight organizational factors derived from contingency research in IS planning, strategic business planning, organizational studies, and technology innovation. The model is validated using data collected from a field survey of 249 senior IS executives.

It has been found that the use in the planning appeals system of what are termed ‘material considerations’ provides a clear indication of the effectiveness of local planning policies and, simultaneously, allows for assessments to be made of both the development control and the forward planning functions of local planning authorities (LPAs). An analysis of planning inspectors' decision letters has been used in this paper to identify the principal considerations in appeal determinations, indicating for the LPA how its development plan policies are operating in practice. </jats:p><jats:p> The analysis shows the degree to which local policies are ‘standing up’ at appeal against other material considerations, especially national policy guidance from the Secretary of State. It can be seen that the scope of the term ‘material considerations’ is problematic for LPAs, and the relationship between local policies and national advice as principal considerations in appeal cases has caused a great deal of uncertainty and ambiguity. Finally, suggestions are given as to how local planning procedures can be improved in development control decisionmaking in the future under the provisions of section 54A of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last few decades, technological advances in computer and telecommunications technologies have promised much to organisations. Yet it is clear that, in practice, the reality generally seems to have fallen well short of the ideal. Organisations seeking strategic advantage from their information systems frequently undertake a Strategic Information Systems Planning (SISP) exercise as an initial step. However, despite the substantial increase in SISP activity over the last decade, it would appear that most strategies have not been successfully implemented. In this paper, some important recent research in support of this contention is summarised, and key problems in SISP implementation are identified. It is argued that: (i) the objective of data and systems integration is a distinguishing characteristic of SISP work; (ii) such integration may cause major changes to the balance of organisational power; (iii) SISP implementation is unlikely to be successful unless political turbulence caused by potential power losses is adequately addressed; and (iv) political turbulence may well be the single most important issue facing SISP implementors. Strategy implementation problems are illustrated through reference to a recent, major (three-year) case study of a SISP implementation in one of Australia's largest organisations. We conclude by presenting some suggestions aimed at offering a way forward out of the current malaise. </jats:p>",

What is lacking, however, is the development of conceptual frameworks that are adequate to embrace the greater variation in conditions encountered in cross-national research, compared with conditions within a single country. Without such a framework, comparison remains an exercise in depicting unique and unrelated cases. Urban regime theory holds potential for explaining the variety of arrangements through which policymakers in cities have coped with change, because of its sensitivity to local conditions and local actors. Its essential contribution is to focus attention on the collective action problems that have to be overcome for effective urban governance to emerge. The nature of the collective action challenge varies according to the purpose, composition, and position of potential regime partners. Substantial differences in motivating factors must be taken into account in order to apply regime analysis cross-nationally. Drawing upon differences already identified in the regime literature, the authors propose a typology of organic, instrumental, and symbolic regimes. </jats:p>",

It is suggested that commentators on such phenomena have analysed an intended object based on a particular experience of heritage events. Rather, the author stresses that there are multiple ways of experiencing heritage. Throughout it is suggested that it is performance that creates heritage. Travel is used as a metaphor for this process as it stresses the issue of creative spatiotemporal practices. However, the organisation of heritage is reliant on the assumption that heritage is ontologically prior to its performance. The tension between these two perspectives is mobilised through the metaphors of Map and Journey. The reactionary tendency to reify heritage is seen less as a result of misleading versions of history than as a result of their organisation. This organisation freezes a certain experience of heritage into a virtual object. This object is like a map that is used to attempt to project its own selective order back onto heritage experiences. The author uses anecdotes, examples from the literature, and his own research to illustrate these points. </jats:p>",

First, local government is prevented from using deficits strategically to extract higher grants from central authorities.

Popular and academic narratives of the origins, spread, and role of the compound are traced, with particular attention to the scripts of marxists, social historians, and poststructuralists. I argue that underlying each is a set of spatial images which powerfully constrains what is admissible to the narrative. Recent attempts to resituate the compound as a fluid ensemble of power geometries are highlighted through a review of the interior spatiality and cultural life of the compound and its connections to its immediate surrounds and the distant countryside. The aim is an empowering narrative which centres migrant cultural resistance and helps to explain the dramatic reordering of the mine landscape since the mid-1980s.</jats:p>",

When there is an increasing divergence between the population as a whole and an increasingly unrepresented politically active subgroup, the legitimacy of the political system itself is in jeopardy.

In their analysis of postwar Taiwan, therefore, the authors reject the temptation to dichotomize ‘state versus market’, and instead argue strongly in favor of a ‘state and market’ approach. The ability to accommodate and manipulate economic market forces was central to Taiwan's economic miracle because the island's businesses became highly competitive on world markets and carved out a niche of comparative advantage in the global economy. Much of the credit for this, furthermore, rests with the flexible production of small private firms. However, the state also played a significant role in boosting the island's competitiveness by promoting several structural transformations of the economy, creating a good business environment for entrepreneurs, channeling foreign capital into a few vital sectors, and financing infrastructure and human capital development. A key factor in the state's positive role, in turn, appears to be regime autonomy. That is, until quite recently, the government has been rather autonomous from social forces and unconstrained by electoral politics and popular accountability.</jats:p>",

The limits of procedural justice have become apparent through the processes of restructuring, internationalization, and immigration, all of which are creating a new landscape for activists. Activists in California find that their rights are being contracted, because of deregulation and capital flight, and at the same time are expanding to include residents of Mexico. Given these global realities, procedural justice must also be accompanied by efforts to address both uneven development and a lack of democracy over private production decisions.</jats:p>",

There is no agreed territorial welfare function against which outcomes can be assessed. A politically based interpretation sees grant allocation as part of intergovernmental politics, in which conceptions of fiscal equalization are used largely for legitimation. Politics guides decisionmaking and the main test of policy applied by governments is political acceptability. The two cases of Britain and France do show important differences in intergovernmental politics. In France, change is incremental and negotiated. In Britain it is radical and unilateral, though outcomes often fall short of expectations as policy is modified in implementation. </jats:p>",

We describe a new planning approach to ensure stability of the lot sizing decisions over an initial interval of time or stability horizon in those (relatively rare) cases where no planning horizon is detected or where the stability horizon extends beyond the planning horizon. To this end, we develop a heuristic, but full horizon-based adaptation of the optimal lot sizing schedule, designed to minimize an upper bound for the worst-case optimality gap under the desired stability conditions. We also show how the basic horizon length n may be chosen to guarantee any prespecified positive optimality gap. </jats:p>",

Social and political restructurings in British Columbia concurrent with the AIDS crisis are traced to show how and why some people have come to exercise their politics through their work.

In this context, a project for a digitalised emergency planner is being launched with the support of the European Community. In this so‐called GIDS system, a dispersion module is indispensable. Because of the urgency of the needs of risk management, the meteorological input for it will have to he provided very rapidly, frequently and m great detail. To meet these specific needs the meteorological services may have to consider offering new kinds or new formats of ‘nowcast’ calculations.

This study examined the influence of gender, age, marital status, occupational status, educational attainment, income, perceived health, number of children, age of children, and number of dependent children on retirement planning behaviors and attitude toward retirement among 40- to 65-year-old university employees (N = 2,760). The study used regression analysis to determine the demographic variables that differentiated between individuals on four planning scales (financial , home equity, employment, and locational) and in their attitudes toward retirement. The relation ship between financial planning and total family income was the most significant finding. The discussion concludes with policy implications related to assisting midlife individuals in preparation for retirement. </jats:p>",

It is possible that, although the children can be guided to succeed on a training task, the failure to transfer is due to there being too great a mismatch between the task and their current unaided level of performance. This suggestion was tested by comparing the transfer of a forward search planning strategy acquired by groups of retarded childen when the mismatch between training and current competence was varied. In one comparison, two groups, matched on initial developmental level within the task domain, were trained on either the next or the next‐but‐one step in a developmental sequence. In a second comparison, two groups were trained at the same level in the developmental sequence. For one group this represented the next available step in the sequence, and for the other group it was the next‐but‐one step. In each comparison, although the pairs of groups required the same number of trials and hints to reach a learning criterion, only the group trained on the step adjacent to their current level of unaided performance showed transfer.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors argue that the nation is not the natural space for the circulation and reproduction of capital, and that this is vitally important in understanding the restructuring of economic activity since the mid-1970s. Rapidly increasing global integration of production, realisation of profit, and the circulation of financial capital have been recognised widely. Yet little consensus has developed about cither the theoretical or empirical impacts of globalisation on changing spatial divisions of labour within developed capitalist countries. The authors outline a model of globalisation in which an increasingly internationalised process of accumulation is expressed in, and reproduced through, the changing social relations of production which remain bounded territorially by nation-states. The model is built up from a synthesis of some apparently disparate theoretical positions on capitalist restructuring crises taken by researchers during the 1980s. These include theories of the internationalisation of capital and those dealing with restructuring within nation-states after the now much-debated transition out of the regime of accumulation which produced the long boom after 1950. Some of these theories have focused too narrowly on the circuit of production to the exclusion of the increasingly complex world trading links and with a severe underestimation of the importance of global financial capital during the 1980s. Methodological implications of the model are investigated and the role of the state in a globally integrated economy is illuminated. </jats:p>",

This paper argues that they are too often based on ad hoc notions of what the FL teacher requires in the way of extra training and are oriented towards the interests of the course organisers and/or the authorities rather than to those of the teachers themselves. In order to discover what teachers perceive their own requirements to be and to what degree their wishes, worries, demands, etc. can be accounted for adequately, it is necessary to have close, firsthand knowledge of the institutional framework within which the teachers work. This requires an ethnographic approach to teacher‐teacher discourse. These points are illustrated by looking at EFL teaching in Switzerland and by closely analysing the argument structure of two sections of teacher‐teacher discourse in a non‐native setting. The paper ends with a number of proposals on how, in this particular situation, teachers’perceptions become relevant to the organisation of in‐service training courses.</jats:p>",

The central result to emerge is that assistance in the form of discretionary project grants and rent relief to new factory tenants has significant employment effects in new and recently established small firms, but that assistance which is either in the form of an automatic capital grant or made to other types of establishment has a weak employment effect which is barely significant after three years. </jats:p>",

The ideologies of Thatcherism and Reaganism contributed to the reduction of the role of government and established conservative agendas, but left their postwar welfare state programs intact. This study of economic policymaking in the three countries since the mid-1980s confirms the ‘new institutionalist’ position in political science that institutions—government organizations, political parties, and electoral systems—do matter. Interest groups are also crucial, but they are not as determinative as previously argued. Ideology can be critical, but the influence of ideology is neither pervasive nor continuous. Strong, forceful, goal-directed leadership can also play a vital role. </jats:p>",

Seventy‐five adults with mild to moderate mental retardation were compared to a group of age peers drawn from the employee population of a regional centre in a Southern American state. It was found that a general satisfaction with life and feelings of preparedness for retirement were strongly related to attitudes toward retirement among both groups. Other common corelates that were significantly related among both groups included financial preparedness, health perceptions, orientation to work and commitment to work. Also observed was a high correlation between life satisfaction and orientation to work and commitment to work among both groups. The authors also found that pre‐retirement planning did prove to be a generally effective means of teaching older adults with mental retardation the options that are available during their retirement years, but did not seem to change their attitudes toward retirement or life satisfaction. The auhors conclude that retirement has positive connotations for most individuals with mental retardation, particularly if they feel that they are prepared for it.</jats:p>",

Against this background the Shearman Report is described in comparison with its British counterparts. There has however been much debate in the UK since 1989 with a redesign of the National Health Service. A sub committee of the House of Commons (Winterton) advocated major changes in maternity services and the Government responded with a detailed critique announcing the appointment of an Expert Maternity Group (Cumberlege) which has just published its recommendations for widespread consultation. The three Royal Colleges have published a joint report and in the next year Government policy will be published. Scotland however has developed an independent view and has progressed further in analysis and rational planning. The fate of the Shearman report will be awaited with interest.</jats:p>",

In this paper we take a first step in that direction, examining the relationship between air pollution and left party strength in seventeen OECD countries. Despite theoretical salience and political relevance, we know of no previous attempt of this sort. Three competing hypotheses exist. First, because of an historic agenda which emphasizes maximum employment and material welfare for the working class, left party strength might be associated with lower than normal environmental quality. Second, given the belief in government intervention to socialize the negative externalities of market capitalism, left party strength might motivate higher than normal environmental quality. Third, despite observed variations in agenda setting, policy formulation, and implementation, skeptics have often replied, “different styles, similar content”, suggesting no party relevance at all. Our analysis, controlling for quantitative energy consumption and qualitative economic structure, reveals a moderate but sustainable inverse relationship between left party strength and per capita levels of air pollution. In the conclusion we speculate how and why this result might occur.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The diversity of poor law policy and practice in Britain in the mid-19th century is examined. Primary sources consulted include contemporary literature and the minute books of five poor law unions in Scotland. The discussion is set in the context of the existing literature on the New English Poor Law and the debate about the nature of British state formation. It is argued that by broadening the geographical scope of analysis to include consideration of the Irish and Scottish Poor Laws a more nuanced account of the processes and patterns of state formation emerges. Analysis of the ‘poverty question’ and attempts at its resolution through poor law policy illustrates the contradiction between 19th-century economic and political discourses. Poverty in Britain in the mid-19th century was structural and consequent upon economic processes which were geographically extensive, and debates about its resolution emphasised individual responsibility and reinforced national identities. Practice within each national territory was diverse and the new poor law machinery offered existing local political and economic interests a novel vehicle through which to exercise power. </jats:p>",

By developing an innovative master's degree in public health nurse‐midwifery education program, Boston University School of Public Health revitalized a model first developed at Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health. The dearth of nurse‐midwifery education programs in the Northeast, coupled with the critical deficit of obstetric providers, had contributed to an alarmingly high infant mortality rate in Boston. This academic program is an exciting alternative for meeting the health care needs of mothers and children and achieving the year 2000 objectives for the nation. Such a program, coupled with a foundation in public health education, synthesizes the best in nursing, nurse‐midwifery, and public health. Graduate nurse‐midwives will have an enhanced understanding of the health care delivery system, the causal factors that contribute to disease, and the environmental, legal, and management dimensions surrounding the delivery of care.</jats:p>",

For policy purposes, it is preferable to predict the level of care dependence as efficiently as possible. This study of residents of institutions and group homes for people with mental handicap showed that profoundly mentally handicapped residents are almost all totally dependent upon care: additional information about the individual characteristics of this group is superfluous. The results of logistic regression analyses for residents with severe or mild mental handicap showed that age, gender and aetiological diagnosis (Down's syndrome or other) do not have significant predictive power. For the level of care dependence, adding the score on Activities of Daily Life (ADL) to the various models improved the predictive power. It depends on the level of mental handicap and on the level of care dependence which one wants to predict which other individual characteristics have to be included in order to improve predictive‐power.</jats:p>",
