      "abstract": "<jats:p>Direct numerical simulations of the transition process from laminar to chaotic flow in converging–diverging channels are presented. The chaotic flow regime is reached after a sequence of successive supercritical Hopf bifurcations to periodic, quasiperiodic, and chaotic self-sustained flow regimes. The numerical experiments reveal three distinct bifurcations as the Reynolds number is increased, each adding a new fundamental frequency to the velocity spectrum. In addition, frequency-locked periodic solutions with independent but synchronized periodic functions are obtained. A scenario similar to the Ruelle–Takens–Newhouse scenario of the onset of chaos is verified in this forced convective open system flow. The results are illustrated for different Reynolds numbers using time-velocity histories, Fourier power spectra, and phase space trajectories. The global structure of the self-sustained oscillatory flow for a periodic regime is also discussed.</jats:p>",
