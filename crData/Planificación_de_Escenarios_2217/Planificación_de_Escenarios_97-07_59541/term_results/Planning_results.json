At issue in the <jats:italic>Redmond</jats:italic> case was the unique question of whether or not knowledge of corporate strategy could be considered protectable proprietary information under the American incarnation of trade secret law.

Forty case studies were analysed by examining relevant documentation and conducting interviews with participants in the EA process. EA appears to have had a gradual rather than a revolutionary effect on decision-making. Its main benefits have been the enhanced provision of environmental information and, to a lesser extent, assistance in setting conditions and in modifying proposals. However, these benefits are not occurring in all cases, and changes are needed if the expected advantages of EA—better integration of environmental considerations into project planning and decision-making-are to be fully realised in the UK. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to learn about (a) adult physical rehabilitation patients’ perceptions of their involvement in the treatment planning process (goal setting, treatment planning, outcome evaluation), (b) their valuation of occupational therapy, and (c) how they would describe their interpersonal relationships with their occupational therapists.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Method.

Most of the subjects indicated that they had been involved in occupational therapy goal setting; treatment planning; and outcome evaluation, albeit this indication was weak. They also valued the occupational therapy services they received. Eight described positive interpersonal interactions with their therapists, and seven provided no information.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusion. Patients receiving occupational therapy services are involved in goal setting, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation; however, their involvement varies and can be difficult for them to identify and describe. Because of increasing societal emphasis on patient rights and participation (e.g., consumerism, health professions standards, health care accreditation criteria, health care legislation) and the likelihood that health care funding will be used for services linked to patient goals, occupational therapy practitioners could become more overt and systematic in involving patients in the planning process. Increasing patient involvement in planning may result in more individualized treatment and more effective use of health care dollars.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Concern about environmental issues and pressure on manufacturing firms to decrease their environmental impact have both intensified since the early 1980s. At present legislation is the most significant source of environmental pressure on firms, but it is the government's intention that voluntary nonlegislative measures will play a much greater role in the future. Pressure through the supply chain is one possible mechanism for achieving this objective, although relatively little is known about its environmental role or importance for manufacturing firms. The author outlines the supply-chain concept, and examines its current significance as a source of environmental pressure. The nature of any supply-chain pressure experienced by a cross section of manufacturing firms in Yorkshire and Humberside, and their actual responses to it, are considered. This investigation reveals that, because of their economic importance, environmental pressure from customers has the potential to be significant. However, in practice such pressure only tends to affect chemical firms and those firms in the consumer-goods sectors which have experienced green consumer pressure directly. Industrial customers, with the exception of a minority of large firms and multinational corporations, generally show little interest in the environmental implications of their sales and purchasing. Environmental legislation is confirmed as by far the most important pressure forcing firms to mitigate their environmental impact. The policy implications of these findings for any move away from reliance on environmental legislation towards voluntary controls are explored. </jats:p>",

I argue that gentrification studies have been conducted within a context framed by two basic models of urban development, namely the Burgess concentric-zone model and the Alonso bid-rent model. These two models lie at the heart of what are more usually seen as the parameters of the gentrification debate, namely the ‘supply-side’ rent-gap account of gentrification offered by Neil Smith and his followers and the ‘demand-side’ consumption-oriented explanations offered by David Ley and his followers. Both sets of explanations are, however, fatally compromised by seeking to answer the question ‘why does gentrification occur?’ before answering the question ‘how does gentrification occur?’. Starting with the question ‘how?’, rather than ‘why?’, draws attention to the hitherto almost completely neglected role of domestic technologies in permitting gentrification to occur, thereby helping break the theoretical logjam in which the gentrification debate currently finds itself. </jats:p>",

In fact, given the apparent decline in government funding of such areas of concern, it has been suggested that pension funds may be the only ‘new’ sources of finance in the near future. In this paper, I assess the current state of play in the pension fund investment management industry, noting the conservatism of many fund trustees with respect to alternative investment products (AIPs) as well as noting that standard models of asset allocation hardly ever allocate significant resources to such products. It is argued that the rate of adoption and the level of funding of AIPs depend upon solutions to two basic interrelated problems associated with AIPs: the high costs of imperfect information and the lack of adequate measures of product providers' veracity. A set of four institutional solutions to these problems are reviewed, with a focus put upon the design and implementation of AIPs in relation to conventional financial markets. This leads to a consideration of the proper role of government policy with respect to AIPs and the long-term potential of AIPs with respect to product innovation in financial markets in general. </jats:p>",

The competitive advantage of service multinationals in the United States and Western Europe is at the core of most discussion; however, the competitive strategies of the Japanese advertising firms vis-à-vis their Western counterparts are discussed to highlight interorganizational differences. This paper is organized into five sections: the definition of services and the determinants of growth in producer services in the industrially advanced nations; theoretical explanations of international investments in services; empirical research on the determinants of internationalization, entry mode, and business strategies of service firms; industry-specific examples of competitiveness in accounting and advertising; and implications for future research. </jats:p>",

An iterative algorithm is used that places one seed at a step. The volume dose of target is calculated at each step to determine the coldest spot where the next source is to be placed, so that the dose uniformity of target is best improved as source placement proceeds. At each step, the total activity required for the seed configuration as so established is calculated by normalizing the minimal dose to the prescribed dose. An optimized configuration is the one that takes the minimized total activity. Around its minimum the total activity has a very small variation with the number of seeds. Consequently multiple clinically acceptable seed configurations with similar total activity but different individual activities are generated simultaneously. In our computer generated treatment plans most of the seeds are distributed in the periphery of the target, similar to the Paterson–Parker pattern of a volume implant.</jats:p>",

In the course of proposing these solutions, strengths and weaknesses of organizational types are identified that must be considered before selecting a particular agentfor municipal planning services in large urban areas with numerous independent municipalities. The potential solutions that appear to make the most sense for the metropolitan Miami area may be appropriate for other urban areas with multiple municipalities. Finally, the issue of municipal planning as a public good for the entire urban community is raised in recognition of the political and financial disincentives associated with providing adequate municipal planning capability in the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The effectiveness of conformal radiotherapy can ultimately only be assessed by the use of clinical trials. As large multicentre clinical trials become more widespread, methods of transferring patient and plan data between radiotherapy treatment planning systems become increasingly important. In this paper, the general strategy for the transfer of data is discussed, and also illustrated with reference to two specific systems: TARGET 2 (GE Medical Systems) and VOXELPLAN (DKFZ-Heidelberg). The transfer method involves using a computer program to translate the data formats used by each of the two systems for CT scans, patient outlines, plan information and block descriptions. This paper does not address the question of transferring beam data between systems: beam data must first be entered separately into both machines. The physical concepts encountered when transferring plans are described, with specific reference to the two planning systems used. Differences in the strategies used by the two planning systems for definition of irregular field shapes are compared. The dose calculations used by the two systems are also briefly evaluated. Isodoses produced by VOXELPLAN around a circular target volume are found to be up to 3 mm different in location to those produced by TARGET 2, owing to the use of a smooth field shape contour as opposed to a stepped field shape which closely models the leaves of a multileaf collimator. In general, dose distributions generated by both systems are comparable, but some differences are found in the presence of large tissue inhomogeneities. It is concluded that the transfer of patient and plan data between two different treatment planning systems is feasible, provided that any differences in field shape definition methods or dose calculation methods between the two systems are understood.</jats:p>",

Encouraging their active participation as family planning method users of vasectomy, condoms, as well as their supportive partnership of contracepting women is the major goal of the national program. Evidence for national surveys indicates that male dominated decision making may not be the norm in Bangladesh. Rather, there is high agreement between couples about family size and family planning. Findings suggest that men know about family planning methods and many take an active role in the decision making process. Male attitudes were generally positive about contraceptive methods and also about having a small family. Women rarely mention their husband's disapproval as a reason for contraceptive discontinuation. Unfortunately neither men nor women seem to be sufficiently informed about the relative safety of menstrual regulation (MR) and often opt for traditional abortions. Men's knowledge of obstetric emergencies is minimal, consequently when they are called upon to make an emergency decision they often make an incorrect one. </jats:p>",

We make use of information on people over 65 years in Great Britain who have changed address in the previous year but are now part of a household some of whose members have not moved. This paper is confined to the limited range of information available from the 1991 census but it does allow us to estimate the number of older people making moves of this type, and to identify their age, sex, and marital status, and their relationship to the household they have joined. It is also possible to say something about the households which these people are joining, in terms of tenure and house type, and to describe the distribution of distances moved. Although the data do not allow direct inferences about whether these moves are related to the needs of the old people for care, the census question on limiting long-term illness provides data relevant to this issue. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Over the last three decades, contraceptive prevalence has risen from about 10% to nearly 60% in developing countries, but still about 1 in 4 births in developing countries (outside China) is unwanted. More than 120 million women in these countries who do not want to become pregnant do not use contraceptives. Nearly 600 000 women die each year from pregnancy‐related causes, between 67 000 and 204 000 of them from unsafe abortions. At the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, delegates endorsed the view long advocated by the Population Council: the primary purpose of family planning programs should be to help women avoid unwanted pregnancy and achieve their fertility goals safely. That means, at the very least, that programs should address those reproductive health issues that are directly related to fertility regulation. To meet the Cairo challenge, progress is needed simultaneously on several levels. We need more and better contraceptive technologies that meet the needs of different groups; higher‐quality family planning services; more outreach to underserved groups (such as men and adolescents); programs tailored to local cultures; and measures to address all the factors that prevent women who do not want to become pregnant from using contraceptives. The call for a client‐centered, reproductive health approach to family planning constitutes a critique of programs driven by demographic goals. The new family planning paradigm puts a premium on ‘quality of care’. Unfortunately, many family planning programs still fall substantially short of offering clients reproductive choice and supporting their reproductive health. The Population Council takes the view that contraceptive research and development is an essential component of a multilevel strategy to reduce unwanted fertility safely. New products, used ethically and provided with quality, would be of tremendous benefit to women and men throughout the world. The Population Council has developed, registered, and licensed seven products, including some of the most widely used contraceptives in the world. The Council is also one of the world centers for research on male reproductive physiology and male contraception. New contraceptive methods are only as good as the context in which they are offered. To accelerate the pace of overall fertility decline, governments must adopt policies that reduce the economic and social risks associated with having smaller families, and policies that promote later and planned childbearing.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Nearly every jurisdiction in Ontario has undergone systemwide hospital restructuring studies, and individual hospitals have increasingly turned to large scale re-engineering processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness. One example of planning for significant change was a hospital restructuring study undertaken by the Metropolitan Toronto District Health Council between 1993 and 1995. This article provides an overview of key insights gleaned from the project, including an analysis of the effectiveness and utility of some of the major planning strategies and tactics employed to realize project objectives. Given the organizational, process and communications issues faced by the study, many of the insights provided will be relevant to other groups engaged in planning for large-scale change processes, who face tough decision making in similarly complex environments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To assess how preference values that cataract surgery patients assign to their preoperative visual states relate to visual acuity and problems in specific aspects of daily life, the authors interviewed 47 patients scheduled to have cataract surgery. Using a rating-scale technique with a scale from 0 (death) to 1 (excellent health), the patients had a mean preference value of 0.68 for their preoperative vision. Patients' preference values for their preoperative vision were more closely related to problems in specific aspects of daily life (especially feelings of depression and problems interacting with people) than to visual acuity in the operative eye, better eye, or worse eye, or a weighted average of visual acuities in both eyes. These results provide a rationale for relying more on patients' views about the effects of visual impairment than on measures of visual acuity when assessing the need for cataract surgery. Key words: patient preference values; cataract surgery; visual impairment; rating scale. (Med Decis Mak ing 1997;17:324-330) </jats:p>",
