The time in the life of the vessel for which the calculations were made corresponds to attainment of the limiting nil-ductility transition reference temperature specified by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's pressurized thermal-shock-issue-related screening criteria.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The transients considered were characterized by a constant pressure and an exponential decay of the downcomer coolant temperature. The decay constant, the final temperature of the coolant, and the fluid-film heat-transfer coefficient were the variable parameters. A search was performed to determine the critical pressure corresponding to incipient crack initiation for a range of crack depths up to 20% of the wall thickness. Results indicate that the critical pressure is greater than the normal operating pressure, if the coolant final temperature is greater than 150°C.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The fracture mechanics model used in the study tends to be conservative in the sense that it ignores possible beneficial effects of warm prestressing and cladding.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A sequence of events is presented that may explain the reported decline of sugar maple trees in the Northeastern United States and Southeastern Canada. The primary factor, caused by defoliation, is a severe reduction in reserve carbohydrates, especially in roots, at the beginning of the leafless period. In this respect, la te defoliators - those that defoliate in late July and early August - are much more destructive than those that defoliate in J une because it appears that carbon is being utilised in July and August by one or more sinks about as fast as it is being assimilated photosynthetically. This, in conjunction with a loss of foliage for an extended period and limited refoliation, could result in severe carbohydrate dcpletion. Limited carbohydrate reserves may not be sufficient for normal respiratory activity during the Ieafless period, or for vernal outgrowth of embryonie shoots. Late defoliation and low carbohydrate reserves also appear to reduce the ability of the trees to acclimate to low winter temperatures; hence, cold winters could result in additional shoot die back and mortality. Other factors such as drought, atmospheric pollutants, and numerous pathogens mayaiso influence carbohydrate reserves, thus contributing to decline.</jats:p>"
