It uses only couples who say they want no more children, and these couples are further classified by current use of contraception and by whether or not they already had excess fertility. Couples who are successful fertility planners, i.e., those who have no unwanted children and are current users of contraception, are distinctive with regard to modern economic behavior as compared to couples who do not use contraception or have excess fertility. Successful planners are more likely to save and to have more modern durables; these differentials remain when adjustments are made for the effects of family income, wife’s age, wife’s education, and duration of marriage. It seems that the kind of planning behavior which enables a couple to successfully plan their family size also enables them to manage their economic affairs so that they can save and enjoy more modern consumption goods.</jats:p>",

The game simulates an environment in which the family planning administrator' must make his allocation decisions and from which he receives feedback in the form of demographic results. The game may be made to react to simulate a particular country if the game leader has access to the relevant data, thus providing preparation for decisions in the field. </jats:p>",

Individuals and organizations concerned with the expansion of the facilities of a river basin (such as a river basin authority) need to determine optimal strategies of operation and capital investment. They also need to examine the sensitivity of whatever planning decisions are contemplated. This paper extends the applicability of an algorithm that had been previously applied to the deterministic river‐basin expansion problem to include the feature of a sensitivity analysis. The algorithm, containing a partial enumeration search technique and a network analysis code, gave a construction sequence of reservoirs, canals, and treatment plants, and an operating policy that maximized the present value of net earnings consistent with certain underlying assumptions. A river basin was chosen that had an existing configuration of unregulated streams and rivers, reservoirs, canals and treatment plants, and sites for future additional facilities.</jats:p><jats:p>A series of representative synthetic flow sequences, future demand profiles, interest rates and reservoir costs that served as inputs to or parameters in the system were each perturbed by various factors (for a total of 24 cases). The sensitivity studies showed that the <jats:italic>immediate</jats:italic> planning decision of what facility to construct next was insensitive to variations in future demands and costs and independent of later decisions. Thus, decision‐making was <jats:italic>adaptive</jats:italic> in the sense that by always making the optimal proximate decision, the management of the river basin is optimized.</jats:p>",
