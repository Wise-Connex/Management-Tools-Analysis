      "abstract": "<jats:p>The growing confidence of Pakistan's planners in the nation's\n      economic future is indicated by the boldness of their successive plans\n      and by the lengthening of their time horizon. As far as the latter is\n      concerned, the First Five-Year Plan did not reflect any thinking on\n      economic and social development beyond a specific five-year period; the\n      Second Plan, however, contained some remarks on long-term growth; the\n      Third Plan is being prepared in close relation to the work being done on\n      the Perspective Plan. What fifteen years ago would have been regarded as\n      a waste of time is now considered to be of basic import¬ance for sound\n      planning. What nobody dared think about in the earlier days is now the\n      subject of serious analysis and policy-making. The need for a\n      Perspective Plan is there not only from an economic angle but there are\n      also sound political reasons for it. From the economic angle, we\n      realized that the five-year periods chosen for our plans are only\n      arbitrary periods in a process stretching over a much longer time. Our\n      decisions and policies during one plan influence the pattern of growth\n      in the next one, and influence also the effectiveness of established\n      policies. Therefore, any particular five-year plan has to be part of a\n      whole chain of plans, all fitting together and building further on the\n      work done in the preceding period.</jats:p>"

The demand\n      for a country's exports is beyond its control; but a central authority\n      may be able to influence its terms of trade by controlling the other\n      blade of the scissor. Through direct and indirect controls over the\n      allocation of domestic investment, the central authority may seek to\n      regulate the domestic production of export goods and also of import\n      substitutes, thereby influencing the supply of exports and hence terms\n      of trade of the country. To do this rationally is one of the crucial\n      planning problems faced by the majority of primary-producing\n      underdeveloped countries many of which do have some central authority,\n      planning and controlling in one way or the other the direction of\n      investible resources between different sectors of the\n      economy.</jats:p>"
