A small portion of one percent of all business units in the United States own more than half the assets and receive more than half the earnings on more than half the sales of the entire economy. The balance of asset ownership, profits, and sales is divided up among some twelve million smaller firms. According to Galbraith's theory, this divides U.S. business into the “planning system”—giant corporations that control prices and production, and the “market system”—the great mass of companies whose prices and production are controlled by the give and take described by classical economists since the days of Adam Smith.</jats:p>",

The anatomy of planning practice may be understood as a structure of communicative action involving claims regarding content and context, thus systematically presenting questions and demanding judgments in the face both of uncertainty and of ambiguity. Practical communicative claims are established in the planning process through the ongoing social reproduction of beliefs, consent, trust, and attention. If planners are to be sensitive to these processes of social reproduction, they must be attentive to four dimensions of the geography of their practice: a cognitive geography of knowledge production, a political-legal geography of power and consent, a ritual geography of social identity, and an economic-resource geography of attention. Recognizing this structure and field of practical action, planners may enhance social learning, resisting threats to democratizing movements, in part by distinguishing and protecting learning processes in two dimensions, the technical and the practical. Refusing to reduce issues of normative ambiguity to issues of technical uncertainty, planners may themselves continue to learn about the political and normative aspects of their practice and so foster, rather than render apolitical, democratic social-learning processes. </jats:p>",

Section 2 follows a brief introduction and contains a partial critique of ‘mainstream’ planning theory. The critique serves as a basis for developing and explicitly stating three presuppositions which underpin the rest of the paper. Section 3 discusses basic relationships between politics, professionalism, and the process of land occupancy. The attempt here is to conceptualize some salient features of the sociohistorical context of urban planning practice. Having sketched this context, I develop and discuss in section 4 a set of propositions regarding the nature and distinctiveness of urban planning as an occupation, the requisite competencies this distinctiveness calls for, and the role(s) of urban planning in contemporary North America. The paper concludes with a brief discussion, in section 5, of the preconditions for, and prospects of, developing a relevant and useful planning theory. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many ways TRW is the prototypical modern U.S. multinational. The exceptional difference is that in recent years it has wrestled with the problems of managing scale and complexity more energetically and perhaps more imaginatively than most conglomerates. Building on the bedrock of classic decentralized management—the same stuff that General Electric pioneered in the Fifties, now the standard operating structure of most U.S. multinationals—TRW has tried desperately to modify some of the increasingly apparent shortcomings of decentralization. While acknowledging that most key decisions bearing on a particular business must be made by autonomous managers using their best judgment, TRW has sought not to be a holding company operation, where management is essentially passive, but rather to bestow broad direction and strategic vision from headquarters. The architect of this program is TRW chairman Ruben Mettler. One of his key lieutenants in this effort is Edward M. Foley, vice president of planning and development. When ex‐accountant Ted Foley arrived at TRW's Cleveland headquarters in the early Seventies, after a succession of operating roles within TRW, company planning was 100 percent decentralized. His mission: to improve the “balance” (perhaps Mettler's favorite word) between divisional independence and top management's perceptions of where future challenges and opportunities lay. TRW was seeking evolutionary change without tampering with their basically decentralized corporate culture. It was an ambitious program with many pitfalls and inherent contradictions. And the struggle for “balance” isn't over yet, as Ted Foley candidly reveals in the following interview with Planning Review.</jats:p>",

Two types of formulation heuristics are identified—problem reduction and problem expansion. Because the latter type has received little empirical research, an initial study of a problem expansion heuristic (Problem-Purpose Expansion) was conducted. Experimentation showed that Problem-Purpose Expansion may have a positive effect on idea generation, particularly for individuals working on problems that fall outside their area of expertise. Exhorting the importance of problem formulation, a second treatment studied in these experiments, produced little measurable effect on idea generation. </jats:p>",

The subjects were asked to rank-order 27 different five-year financial policies. The two groups were compared using the preference function assessment technique of Srinivasan and Shocker. The policy preference changes by TRADES users were found to be significantly greater than the preference changes by nonusers. That is, the experience of using the TRADES model to assess budget policy altered the choice of preferred policy. </jats:p><jats:p> The implication of this experiment is that the preference functions evolve as better understanding is reached of trade-offs and constraints.

A case is made for an alternative approach, that is, to define retail blight as a deviant behavioural process which may eventually result in loss of retail activity; undesirable changes in retail structure are viewed as symptoms of this process. This alternative approach is explained in relation to blighted shopping precincts in England and Wales. </jats:p>",

Justification of the adoption of particular forms of classification in studies are rarely offered and are often passed over in favour of a discussion of the more tractable areas of empirical research. In this paper the practice of conceptual analysis adopted in one sphere of urban research, landlordism and property relations, is evaluated and criticised for its unreflective mechanistic approach. Invariably, the object (landlordism) is subjected to a form of analysis which treats it as if it were analogous to an onion, from which layers may be peeled off, one after another. It is argued that this mode of analysis does not reveal the economic and social properties that constitute different types of landlordism, which, in turn, may provide the basis for an understanding of the spatial variation in the structure of the market for privately rented housing in Britain. An alternative mode of conceptual analysis, based upon the principles of a realist philosophy of science, is proposed, which has the potential to explain the structural unevenness of the rental market and the roles adopted by different groups of landlords in this market. </jats:p>",

Regional or spatial aspects did not receive nearly as much attention. However, high unemployment rates tend to generate their own spatial dynamics. Thus a process of differentiation in the labor market takes place at two levels: First, via the spatial polarization of opportunies to earn income; second, via the incidence of high and persistent unemployment affecting particular groups, especially in ‘problem regions’, that is, in regions with high unemployment. As a consequence, ‘problem groups' of the unemployed face persistent and much higher levels of unemployment in those regions. </jats:p><jats:p> An employment policy which attempts to operate via the demand for labor should necessarily take note of the peculiarities of each region. Thus it must be selective and specific rather than global and general in nature. Therefrom results the need for a better consideration of structural factors, such as sectoral structure, industry mix, size of enterprise, and type of enterprise, all of which influence the regional employment situation. The paper attempts to explain persistent differences in regional unemployment in terms of the regional economic structure. </jats:p>",

The nature and source of the errors and the magnitude of their effect on the performance of spatial interaction models are established for different types of situations and for different degrees of complexity in the network along which distances are measured. Some suggestions are made on an approach to correcting these errors; a particular approximation including the self-distances in the calculation of interzonal distances is discussed, and it is shown that it reduces the magnitude of the errors to more acceptable levels. </jats:p>",

A sample of students in Sydney is used to estimate the model, and a separate sample drawn to assess its predictive ability. The model is estimated on student-specific data, and tested for the functional form of elements of the indirect utility-function. The empirical results support the ‘accessibility to academic institution’ hypothesis, and identify some neglected explanatory variables—especially access to finance, and support from parents. </jats:p>",

The example chosen is Leeds, and four services—education, fire protection, library provision, and swimming pool provision—are studied. Estimates of net fiscal incidence are presented for the period 1966–1975. The choice of appropriate geographical areas within the city is discussed and analysis zones are defined on the basis of a principal components analysis of characteristics likely to give rise to significant variations in expenditure participation and revenue contribution. A brief outline of service delivery in Leeds is then presented. Net fiscal residuals are estimated separately for each service. Service expenditure allocation is estimated by spatial interaction techniques and it is shown that there are significant variations in the distributions. However, the spatial pattern of net fiscal imbalances in the City turn out to have some overall similarities. Because of local government reorganisation and other factors, it is not possible to directly compare changes over the study period. Nevertheless, the methods by which local authority finances are raised, movement of client groups, and changes in service delivery are all important mechanisms contributing to change. Further possible explanations are also briefly discussed. </jats:p>",

The methodological solution to this problem, we suggest, lies in recognizing the levels of abstraction and corresponding degrees of historical specificity in theoretical concepts. Four levels of abstraction are identified: level I, universal theory; level II, theory of a mode of production in general; level III, theory of variants of a mode of production; and level IV, theoretically informed analysis of real concrete formations. It is at the more historically specific level III that a theory of transition within the capitalist mode of production is offered by identifying four variants of capitalist production: the transitional, competitive, monopoly, and global submodes of production. Finally, it is proposed that at level III a more satisfactory theory of uneven development is possible based on the articulation of submodes of production within given social formations. </jats:p>",

The index, which uses data from the National Dwelling and Housing Survey, is modeled on the points scheme used by the Tower Hamlets Council in assigning points to applicants on their housing waiting list. The characteristics of households with different levels of housing need are studied. The implications for different sections of the community of variations in the housing needs criteria and of changes in the points scoring system are examined. </jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the reception by the shipbuilding sector of the regional employment-premium program of 1967–1977. It notes how a minority of firms in an industry can be disadvantaged because of their spatial exclusion from regional-policy benefits. The need to explicitly recognize the possibility of regional policy conflicting with sectoral harmony is an obvious lesson from experiences of this kind. </jats:p>",

Policies and programmes conceived and enacted under the circumstances of prior decades no longer match the special needs and problems created by changed conditions, and are wholly inadequate to deal with the difficulties currently facing the space economy and which seem likely to persist well into the present decade. A major recasting of regional policy is urgently required, together with a refocusing of policy priorities and objectives. The detailed discussion of specific policy options is the subject of a subsequent paper. </jats:p>",

The models are used to report the casualties that could result from two attack scenarios; one is based on the 1980 Home Defence exercise codenamed ‘Square-Leg’, and the other is devised by the authors. A number of different sensitivity analyses are also performed. The results indicate that current official estimates about the numbers of casualties are highly optimistic. Current Home Defence policies involve a fraudulent attempt, in the authors' view, to lull the public into a false sense of safety. It is hoped that this paper will be the beginning of a more informed and open public and political debate about a subject which hitherto has escaped academic attention. </jats:p>",
