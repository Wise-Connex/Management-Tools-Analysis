This article aims primarily to inform planning academics and practitioners of the principal issues concerning tourism development in destination areas. Much of the material draws from a rich body of geographical literature that pays specific attention to tourism in less developed countries. The article addresses tourism's principal impacts on destination areas. It stresses that, to plan effectively for tourism development while lessening its negative effects, planners need to understand the sector's dynamics over time. Finally, the article puts forth a number of policies for making tourism a sustainable development option. </jats:p>",

Confidence is found in the merit-based nature of manuscript review processes. Problems are identified concerning limited methodological sophistication of submissions, insularity of the planning academy, and limited systematic growth of our discipline. </jats:p>",

Responsibility for oil and chemical spills control is assumed by the industry. According to the new regulations, every oil and chemical terminal must have contingency plans to deal with spills, proper equipment, and trained personnel. Vessels, Chilean or foreign flag, must have approved contingency plans in line with Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention on Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MARPOL 73/78. Even though Chile is not party to MARPOL 73/78, Annexes I, IV, and V of the convention were incorporated as national regulations by Decree No. 1, 1992. Maritime authorities will continue to have their own equipment and will act only if needed. Almost all oil terminals and refineries have implemented their contingency plans and are in the process of purchasing equipment and training personnel.</jats:p>",

This new relationship presents a particular challenge for the oil industry as well as an opportunity for emerging governments to benefit from western companies’ experience. In 1993, Texaco Offshore Bulgaria submitted the first western oil spill response plan for the Bulgarian Black Sea. This paper presents a case study based on Dames &amp; Moore's preparation of this plan. The plan was prepared in cooperation with the Bulgarian government, and included public discussions. It joined the country's existing response resources with Texaco's existing international response strategy. The result was a plan combining local knowledge and support and western capability and experience. This paper outlines the issues addressed in the plan. One critical point discussed below is that of protecting tourist beaches, which are an essential part of the Bulgarian economy. The paper concludes with a discussion of how cooperation between western industry and Eastern European government can result in successful oil spill response planning and help identify key factors for both attaining and maintaining preparedness in the face of the new challenges.</jats:p>",

First, construction of a problem‐oriented representation of the robot working space is explained. Then, the actual trajectory research carried out in our C‐space representation is described. The whole C‐space is not calculated; instead, a sequential strategy is used to determine the C‐space only for the first two links. Our approximation of the obstacles, which occupy fixed and known positions, greatly speeds the computation, allowing us to reduce the problem to planar geometric reasoning. The work is not limited to theoretical studies or simulations; experiments have been run very thoroughly, with various tests, on a PUMA robot to assess the real efficiency and usability of our software. The method applies to robots in a fixed and known environment. © 3995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has been assisting USEPA in developing guidelines, data structures, and maps for sensitive resource assessment using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. The recommended approach for developing sensitivity maps and databases include a shoreline-habitat mapping technique used for estuarine, lacustrine, and large river settings. Shoreline type is mapped and ranked on a scale of 1 to 10, from least to most sensitive to oil spill impacts. A watershed approach is used to differentiate among small rivers and streams. Stream reaches are mapped according to a system that relates oil behavior and effects to stream characteristics, such as gradient, discharge, and water turbulence. Data on sensitive biological and human-use resources include both spatial and temporal components. The focus is on water-associated species, riparian vegetation, and all wetland types, not just threatened and endangered species.

This paper develops and tests a decomposition methodology to generate cost-effective expansion plans, with performance guarantees, for one major component of the network hierarchy—the local access network. The model captures economies of scale in facility costs and tradeoffs between installing concentrators and expanding cables to accommodate demand growth. Our solution method exploits the special tree and routing structure of the expansion planning problem to incorporate valid inequalities, obtained by studying the problem’s polyhedral structure, in a dynamic program which solves an uncapacitated version of the problem. Computational results for three realistic test networks demonstrate that our enhanced dynamic programming algorithm, when embedded in a Lagrangian relaxation scheme (with problem preprocessing and local improvement), is very effective in generating good upper and lower bounds: Implemented on a personal computer, the method generates solutions within 1.2–7.0% of optimality. In addition to developing a successful solution methodology for a practical problem, this paper illustrates the possibility of effectively combining decomposition methods and polyhedral approaches. </jats:p>",

I contend that the concept of Orientalism needs to be unpacked further than most of its proponents have allowed. At no time has a united Europe had a common and singular ‘Other’. I further argue that imprecise understandings of Orientalism and Othering blind us to certain variations in interpretive and material practices that have had important implications for our so-called Others. This point is expanded in relation to forest policies in tribal ( adivasi) areas of India. I demonstrate that colonial forest (and ‘tribal’) policies were far from unitary, but were open to contestation and negotiation by sympathetic colonial officers and missionaries (such as Verrier Elwin). I also show that elements of what might be called the dominant discourse of scientific forest policy have been continued since Independence in 1947. An Indian elite has disciplined its ‘internal Others’ by means of this discourse (and others besides), although there are signs now that this discourse is being challenged by adivasi leaders and sympathetic government and nongovernment officers. </jats:p>",

Although the public sector accepts responsibility for satisfying low-income housing needs by supplying serviced plots, this bureaucratic supply is quantitatively inadequate and not affordable by many. The analysis reveals penetration of market forces into public housing areas through the large-scale provision of rooms for rent and limited exchange of houses. Even in the middle-income and high-income residential areas, where the market has been assigned responsibility for meeting demand for land and housing, extensive state intervention has helped to shape the pattern of urban development. Trends in property markets are shown to reflect broader political changes and their economic impacts; the pursuit of their interests by various social groups; land, planning, and rent-control policies; and programmes for the provision of serviced plots and housing finance. Explanations for trends in property development and prices, including the boom and slump which occurred around the turn of the decade, are sought. </jats:p>",

Restructuring of the air service network and the emergence of the postderegulation hub-and-spoke system are also discussed. It is argued that connectivity affects, and is simultaneously affected by, administrative and auxiliary employment levels. Empirical findings suggest that changes in connectivity have a greater influence on administrative and auxiliary employment levels than changes in administrative and auxiliary employment have on connectivity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author focuses on the issue of flexibility in production using a particular historical example: that of the poultry meat industry in Greece. The case study material is presented as an example of the advantages of theoretically informed empirical research and realist methodology for studying uneven capitalist development and the enormous range of contrasting configurations of capitalist production and its spatial distribution. The poultry meat industry in Greece, although showing the characteristics of an extreme flexibility in production (which is primarily the result of an extensive subcontracting system), shows developments that cannot be interpreted within the theoretical framework of the school of flexible specialization. This allows the author to suggest that the eagerness of flexible specialization theorists (Piore and Sabel, Freeman and Perez, et al) to prescribe new technoeconomic futures hinders their appreciation of sociospatial complexity in capitalist development and encourages them to persist with models of industrial transformation of limited relevance. The points that are raised must also be seen as a reply to those in Greece—researchers and politicians—who argue in favour of a flexible specialization strategy as a means of modernizing the structure of Greek industry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper recent considerations of the human subject and of the nature and uses of theory are convened around the work of Marxist theorist David Harvey. This is done to contest two prevailing views of his work and to explore critically two alternative readings. The first view suggests that Harvey is exclusively a theorist of the capitalist space economy; against this it is suggested that he offers one of the most ambitious readings of subjectivity within human geography. The second view suggests that Harvey is a ‘modern’ theorist, whose preoccupation with economy and class leads him into the perils of theoretical authoritarianism, exclusivity, and abstraction; against this it is suggested that Harvey's Marxism claims to be intrinsically reflexive. More particularly, the thesis that there is an essential, rather than contingent, relation between Harvey's theorisation of ‘the subject of capital’ and his own practices as a theorist is explored: given that Harvey claims ‘the subject of capital’ is but one subject-position, to what extent, it is asked, is he in practice aware of the limits of his own theoretical propositions? At the same time, an examination of the degree to which Harvey's reading of subjectivity is sufficiently cogent to contribute to an ecumenical, ‘post-modern’ project to make sense of subjection and agency within contemporary Western societies is presented. </jats:p>",

After an introduction to the issue of linkage formation in the automobile industry, a historical overview of the development of the Spanish production system since the 1950s is presented. This is followed by an analysis of recent changes in the production and procurement strategies of international producers, in particular the process of rationalisation and the implementation of just-in-time supply systems. It is concluded that the process of internationalisation has brought on a radical transformation of the local production system. This has had serious consequences for the position of certain parts of the production system, notably the indigenous suppliers; such negative effects, however, should be weighed against the fact that internationalisation has also produced rapid growth and modernisation of Spanish industry in the last two decades. </jats:p>",

This process is inevitably imprecise and is subject to a number of possible errors depending on the assumptions inherent in the methods used. Previous analysts have had only limited information with which to compare the results of interpolation and so assess the errors. In this paper a Monte Carlo simulation method based on modifiable areal units is employed. This allows multiple interpolations of population to be conducted from a single set of source zones to numerous sets of target zones. The properties of the full error distribution associated with a particular interpolation model can then be examined. The method based on dasymetric mapping consistently gave the highest accuracy of those tested, whereas the areal weighting method gave the lowest. More important than the results presented is the potential for future testing of other methods in increasingly complex situations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this article, a fast approach for robust trajectory planning, in the task space, of redundant robot manipulators is presented. The approach is based on combining an original method for obstacle avoidance by the manipulator configuration with the traditional potential field approach for the motion planning of the end‐effector. This novel method is based on formulating an inverse kinematics problem under an inexact context. This procedure permits dealing with the avoidance of obstacles with an appropriate and easy to compute null space vector; whereas the avoidance of singularities is attained by the proper pseudoinverse perturbation. Furthermore, it is also shown that this formulation allows one to deal effectively with the local minimum problem frequently associated with the potential field approaches. The computation of the inverse kinematics problem is accomplished by numerically solving a linear system, which includes the vector for obstacle avoidance and a scheme for the proper pseudoinverse perturbation to deal with the singularities and/or the potential function local minima. These properties make the proposed approach suitable for redundant robots operating in real time in a sensor‐based environment. The developed algorithm is tested on the simulation of a planar redundant manipulator. From the results obtained it is observed that the proposed approach compares favorably with the other approaches that have recently been proposed. © 1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Great Britain, the 1980s were marked by an increasing involvement of the independent sector in the provision of long-term institutional care resources for the elderly. In this paper, spatial and structural changes in the provision of all categories of residential and nursing beds in the South East region of England between 1987 and 1990 are investigated. The data were obtained from a variety of sources including directories of private institutional care facilities, the Department of Health, and the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys. Separate analyses of change were conducted for (a) the public and private residential care sectors, and (b) all categories of independent care (that is, residential and nursing) resources, at both regional and local scales. The results disclose that the 1987–90 period witnessed continued rapid growth of institutional care resources in the South East region, although public-sector involvement in the provision of residential care beds declined. An analysis of spatial shifts of independent residential and nursing beds at the county level of resolution does not reveal appreciable changes in their overall levels of geographical concentration in the region. However, the provision of independent care beds may be approaching saturation level in some coastal retirement communities, with part of the relatively rapid growth shifting locally to surrounding, mainly inland, areas that have recently experienced notable gains in their elderly population. Analysis of structural growth components indicates that disclosed changes in the spatial distribution of independent care beds are attributable to both the opening of new homes and the expansion of existing premises. </jats:p>",

Use of the Gill–Thomas–Cosman relocatable frame allows planning and surgery to be carried out at different hospitals on different days. Stereotactic computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans are performed and the images transferred to the planning computer. The head, tumour and frame fiducials are outlined on the relevant images, and a three-dimensional model generated. Structures which could interfere with the surgery or radiotherapy, such as major vessels, shunt tubing etc., can also be outlined and included in the display. Catheter target and entry points are set using a three-dimensional cursor controlled by a set of dials attached to the computer. The program calculates and displays the radiation dose distribution within the target volume for various catheter and seed arrangements. The CT co-ordinates of the fiducial rods are used to convert catheter co-ordinates from CT space to frame space and to calculate the catheter insertion angles and depths. The surgically implanted catheters are after-loaded the next day and the seeds left in place for between 4 and 6 days, giving a nominal dose of 50 Gy to the edge of the target volume. 25 patients have been treated so far.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although China produces 1.1 billion tons of coal per year, demand is projected at almost 1.6 billion tons in 2000. Transport bottlenecks, coal and electricity shortages, and worsening air pollution threaten the country's double-digit GNP growth. To address these problems, the World Bank and the Chinese State Planning Commission developed a decision support system consisting of a mixed-integer program, a geographic information system, and related submodels. The Coal Transport Study (CTS) model covers coal mining, washing, and transport; thermal, hydro, and nuclear power generation; electricity transmission; pollution levels; and scrubbers; which together will require at least $240 billion in new investments over a 15-year horizon. The analysis results influenced several government policies concerning GNP growth, coal imports, and various capital investments, with a potential benefit of about $6.4 billion from 1991 to 2005. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper discusses a parking motion planning and control of a car-like robot. Because of non-holonomic constraints of the system, motion planning and control is regarded as a difficult problem. In this paper, constraints of steering operation and obstacle avoidance with garage and walls are also considered. As one approach to this problem, extracting human control strategy can be considered, because many drivers can easily park their cars in garages. This paper proposes a motion planning and control method using a fuzzy neural network (FNN). The fuzzy neural network system for parking motion planning learns good parking motions by human operations to generate motion strategy of parking. The fuzzy neural network is then used for parking motion planning in a restricted area surrounded by walls. Computer simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the planning method. Furthermore, the method can be considered as a feedback control law for the parking of car-like robot. Therefore, an experiment of parking motion control using the fuzzy neural network is also tested.</jats:p>",
