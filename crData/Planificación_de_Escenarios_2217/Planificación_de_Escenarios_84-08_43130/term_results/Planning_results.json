Their exper iences may provide valuable lessons for more coventional planners, but their single-agency focus and limited technical abilities represent problems that must also be recognized For human service plan ning, advocating greater political sensi tivity and skill may be less useful than showing how political and technical skills can be combined in equal proportions. </jats:p>",

In section 1, the significance of private rental housing in Australia is outlined, and contemporary Australian issues are related to overseas developments and local concerns during the 1960s and 1970s. In section 2, some problems involved in defining the private rental sector are examined, the focus being on different types of landlords. In section 3, trends, issues, and problems are discussed, this involving a detailed examination both of the extent to which availability of dwellings has changed and of the growing problem of affordability which particularly affects poor tenants. In section 4, government policies during the 1970s are assessed, and it is argued that, in combination with market processes, these exacerbated the problems faced by poor tenants. In the concluding section, some of the issues are redefined, and it is argued that new policies in themselves are less important than a greater commitment to equity. </jats:p>",

That interpretation involved an understanding of population change associated with climate factors, and a restructuring of industry which favoured new sectors in new locations. To explore patterns in Australian population change, shares of national population in each state for the period 1971–1981 were analysed. That information showed the shift in population within the nation has been small, though a group of adjoining states have all lost population. To explore the extent to which that shift has been reflected in shifts in economic activity, data on private investment (especially construction expenditure on offices, factories, and other buildings), together with a measure of banking activity, were analysed for the same states over the same time period. Results show there have been only small shifts toward population growth areas. These results are interpreted in part as a consequence of nonlocal multipliers and linkages back to established areas, but also as a reflection of the unique features of the Australian urban and regional system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, I address the spatial patterns of Japanese transnational corporations (TNCs) in Australia over the last two decades. It is argued that—in the context of growing economic linkages between Australia, Japan, and the Western Pacific—an understanding of TNC behaviour is essential to make sense of the subnational spatial outcomes arising from economic integration between countries. Accordingly, after discussing the history and characteristics of Japanese TNCs in Australia, I consider the spatial distribution of three elements of Japanese TNC activity—mining, manufacturing, and corporate head offices. The analysis suggests that the stronger economic linkages with Japan have indeed been associated with distinctive urban and regional change within Australia and that this is also reflected in the spatial patterns of individual Japanese TNCs. I conclude that a combination of Japanese corporate characteristics, together with the peculiarities of the Australian space economy, has led to a hierarchy of spatial impacts. This in turn emphasises a more general link between economic integration, TNC world strategies, and regional change in host countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Australia has suffered in line with other nations from the recession of the 1970s. Behind the downturn lay a major structural change in the economies of Western Nations; a change which resulted from the movement from a system of monopoly capitalism to one of global capitalism. Much attention has been paid to the rise of multinational manufacturing corporations in this process; relatively little to the fundamental revision of the world's capital markets. </jats:p><jats:p> The process of change began with the shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system and the rise of the Eurocurrencies. A vast and undisciplined international capital market was created, the hallmarks of which were highly volatile exchange rates and a greatly expanded pool of capital which was very mobile. The power of individual governments to control the system was reduced, and the new system was organized through a group of key global cities which operated the market throughout the world on a twenty-four-hour basis. A fourfold hierarchy of centres evolved. In Australia there was an historic transition from the dominance of Melbourne to that of Sydney as a result of the changing world scene. </jats:p><jats:p> The growth of the international markets has produced a revolution in the distribution of wealth and activities throughout the world. The problems resulting from this have called for a regulatory body to control the new system. The prospects for creating such a body are clouded by the scale of the problem and by the lack of understanding of its causes. The result is an indecisive and probably wrongly directed approach to the question of regional development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on the determinants of housing expenditure in Australia is limited by inadequate treatment of the distinction between three types of households: home renters, homeowners in the process of purchase, and homeowners who own outright. In this paper the authors use published and unpublished cross-sectional data from 1966–1968 and 1975–1976 to demonstrate the importance of the various determinants of housing across the three household types and, for the first time, to compare the characteristics at two points in time almost a decade apart. It was found that the influence of sociodemographic variables such as age, employment status, and household size was statistically significant, and that their influence varied considerably across the three household types. Detailed analysis has shown that income elasticity estimates of demand for housing were all found to be invariant over time, to be substantially less than 1.0 and to differ markedly between tenure type, with home renters having the lowest values (0.46–0.49), outright homeowners the highest (0.69), and mortgaged homeowners in between (0.53–0.59). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Production and operations planning in organizations quite often is a multi‐level sequential process, involving aggregate planning, master production scheduling, and detailed operations planning and scheduling. To obtain good planning results, it is desirable to have a proper planning horizon for each level of planning. There have been a considerable number of studies dealing with planning horizons for aggregate planning or production smoothing problems. There are also many planning horizon studies for single‐item lot sizing problems. No study has addressed the issues associated with the planning horizons for master production schedules (which is a multi‐item lot sizing problem in nature), particularly with respect to the relationship to the aggregate plan.</jats:p><jats:p>This study addresses the issue of planning horizons for companies employing a make‐to‐stock competitive strategy facing a seasonal demand for their products. We formulate the aggregate planning problem and the master scheduling problem as two separate mathematical programs to approximate the two‐stage process that typically takes place in practice. Rolling planning horizons are used to approximate the periodic updates of the plans commonly done in practice. The models also incorporate resource requirements planning concepts to estimate loads on the critical work centers.</jats:p><jats:p>The planning process is simulated as a single pass procedure where the results of aggregate planning are passed to the master production scheduling model once per month and the results of the master scheduling model (i.e., the portion of the master schedule actually implemented) are passed back to the aggregate planning model for the next planning session.</jats:p><jats:p>The experimental results show that when the planner faces extreme cost structures such as high smoothing costs/high setup costs or low smoothing costs/low setup costs, the planning horizon effects are reduced to a minimum. Master schedule planning horizons need not be as long as aggregate planning horizons. Alternatively, non‐extreme cost structures such as high smoothing costs/low setup costs and low smoothing costs/high setup costs should be handled with equal planning horizons for both aggregate planning and master scheduling.</jats:p><jats:p>It is also found that the firm's cost structure has an impact on the appropriate planning horizon for both aggregate planning and master scheduling. Some cost conditions allow for smaller master schedule horizons. The best horizon choice seems to be equal planning horizons for both aggregate planning and master scheduling, even though the cost savings is slight in some cases.</jats:p><jats:p>Finally, the proper length of the planning horizon for master scheduling is affected by the planning horizon of the aggregate plans.</jats:p>",

Taking into account the pronatalist climate in Israel along with the good health status of the population served by this center, it was decided that the community-wide goal of the family planning program was to ensure the rights of couples to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children. Specific process and outcome objectives were developed based on helping couples define and clarify their family planning goals, and assisting them to achieve these goals. Preliminary evaluation of the intervention based on the objectives showed that 84.0 per cent of the cohort of women who gave birth in 1980 (n = 212) had specific postpartum planning goals as opposed to 69.0 per cent of women who gave birth in 1977 (n = 242). The percentage of women experiencing unplanned pregnancies during the two years after birth was reduced by 46 per cent in the 1980 cohort (6.1 per cent of the women) as compared with the 1977 cohort (11.2 per cent). </jats:p>",
