      "abstract": "<jats:p> The expansion of urban areas both changes and displaces rural communities along the urban fringe. This is not a new phenomenon and geographic research has paid considerable attention to understanding these urbanization pressures. Previous research, however, has paid less attention to the implications of these pressures and changes on the preexisting rural community and almost no attention to the opposition which local residents may raise in efforts to protect their community from the disruption of change. This paper is about resistance. The example of Columbia Valley, a small rural agricultural area about one hour's drive east of Vancouver, British Columbia, is utilized to explore the opposition this community has mounted against two recent large-scale development proposals. Both proposals would have significantly changed the nature of the area and the local community. In both cases, the resistance mounted by this community played a key role in preventing the proposals from proceeding. Also, in both cases, the resistance was founded to a considerable degree upon residents' desire to protect the lifestyles and livelihoods currently existing within their local community. This rural activism suggests that residents are concerned about urbanization pressures and that local ideas of community and lifestyle may have some force in operationalizing public opposition to radical change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The introduction of legislation in favour of ‘permanency planning’, in 1980, led to a marked decline in the number of North American children entering the public care system for much of that decade. In recent years, however, the number of children in care in the USA has been steadily rising. A major cause of this reversal is the country's drug epidemic, which has also had a significant affect on the type of child most likely to enter the system. Linda Katz highlights a failure to respond to these and other changes, outlined below, and argues for a radical upheaval of what she sees as a grossly outdated and underfunded child welfare system. On the basis of fifteen years' experience leading the Permanency Planning Programme at the Lutheran Social Services, she strongly advocates a commitment to concurrent planning — defined here as ‘the process of working toward family reunification while at the same time establishing an alternative plan’, usually in the form of permanency with a relative or secure foster/adoption placement. Such views are supported by increasing demands for information and training on concurrent planning, both in the USA and overseas. </jats:p>",

We propose and test a model based on agency theory and transaction-costs economics to account for these variations. As senior management's uncertainty with respect to the information systems function increases, we argue they will delegate more decision rights to the information systems manager. As a result of increased agency costs, senior management will demand more information systems planning to provide the basis for monitoring and bonding of the manager. In addition, because information systems plans may be used to resolve the distribution of gains and losses between senior management and the information systems manager in the event of unforeseen circumstances, both senior management and the information systems manager will seek to exercise control over the planning process and the form of the final plan. We argue that the relative specialization of human capital of senior management versus the information systems manager will dictate whose views dominate in the preparation of and form of the information systems plan. Our empirical results show moderate support for our model. </jats:p>",

Reports some of the findings of a recent study of the internal market effects of customer satisfaction measurement, and identifies a number of ways in which the use of customer satisfaction information may have negative effects within the organization, which may stand in the way of the implementation of market strategies of service and quality.

The authors of this study develop a model of union innovation and test it using data collected from many sources, including a 1990 survey of 275 officials and staff members from 111 American national unions. The results suggest that certain union characteristics, such as environmental monitoring (systematic monitoring by the union of developments that could affect it) and rationalization (good structuring and management of administrative activities), are positively associated with innovative behavior. In addition, there is a positive relationship between innovation and the heterogeneity of a union's members. </jats:p>",

In particular robotic manipulators have been modelled by using reference points on the kinematic chain and their Cartesian coordinates description. The path planning has been formulated as an optimization problem for the determination of adjacent configurations and the path among obstacles with minimum manipulator displacement. The fully Cartesian coordinates description has been useful for the economy of the numerical procedure and for the constraints formulation of link interference and obstacles avoidance constraints. Some examples are reported which prove the practical feasibility of the path planning procedure, and the numerical results have been tested as applicable to industrial robots through easy programming because of the concept of adjacent configurations.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, marketing literature is unable to provide meaningful guidance because scant research attention has hampered a fuller understanding of why people help. The authors integrate relevant research in marketing, economics, sociology, and social psychology to advance theoretical understanding of helping behavior.

Estimated reduced-form W&amp;D rent functions suggest that the influence of these predictors varies across small and large W&amp;D facilities, presumably differing in the geographic scope of their operations. Small W&amp;D facility rents are seen to be determined by the multiplicity of location factors already mentioned; in contrast, large W&amp;D facility rents, seemingly unaffected by local market access and local zoning controls, are found to be mostly driven by surface and air-transportation access advantages. Overall, these findings suggest a role for a public policy aiming at facilitating the functioning of the W&amp;D sector within contemporary metropolises. </jats:p>",

At an international geographic scale, these processes have produced strong financial centers and new outposts for capital transactions. They have also resulted in the reworking of domestic capital markets with significant consequences for the location of economic activities and access to financial services. In Mexico the financial infrastructure is ‘thin’ both with respect to the variety of institutions and in space. As a consequence of privatization and state innovation, a financial infrastructure is developing with important implications for access to capital by different segments of the economy and regions. This new financial infrastructure has a distinctly bimodal character. We describe the development of the Mexican financial infrastructure after financial market restructuring and speculate on the consequences for economic development, including its spatial dimension. </jats:p>",

It is found that, after controlling for income, age of housing, housing value, and occupancy status, black applicants and applicants from predominantly black communities are less likely to have their loan applications approved than are white applicants or applicants from predominantly white areas. Although no disparities were associated with Latino applicants, those applicants from predominantly Latino communities were less likely to be approved than were others.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A changing regulatory environment, intensified competition, and the increasingly global and privatised nature of financial markets have taken a heavy toll on the US banking industry. In the 1980s over 1100 banks failed in the United States, more than in any decade since the 1930s. In this paper I examine the relationship between the eroding competitive position of the banking industry and an unfolding geography of financial exclusion affecting one low-income community in Los Angeles. First, I briefly outline the causes of banks' deteriorating competitive position, focusing on the mismatch between domestic financial regulation and the requirements of competition in retail markets through the 1980s. Second, I draw on research, using secondary sources and workplace-based interviews, to describe how some banks in Los Angeles are responding to these pressures by reorganising their production systems at an interregional, intermetropolitan, and intrametropolitan scale. Third, I concentrate on this intrametropolitan scale, documenting the rationalisation of branch networks and the rise of alternative financial institutions in part of South Central Los Angeles. To which communities are banks and their less regulated competitors to be held accountable? By way of conclusion, I argue that regulation needs to clarify this issue while also supporting the development of community-controlled financial institutions that can expand access to financial services in low-income neighbourhoods. </jats:p>",

Strategic planning employs event based planning to postulate critical events and choose associated transition criteria. The intent is to choose a set of criteria for each event such that, if the criteria are satisfied, each event will occur as expected. Empowerment supports tactical planning by authorizing others to satisfy strategically chosen transition criteria. This is done by an empowering authority who assigns both transition criteria and decision making boundaries to an individual or group. Contingency plans are determined via risk management methods that identify risk items associated with failing to satisfy transition criteria and creating plans to avert those risks. In this context, all three methods, event based planning, empowerment, and risk management are driven by strategically chosen events and their associated transition criteria.</jats:p>",

One is a public management model in which involvement in decision making is on a “need-to-know ” basis, and public participation and input are viewed as forces to be overcome. It echoes the private sector practice of flexible specialization in that it relies on quick decision making and noninclusive planning to reduce intraorganizational conflict. The other is a participatory planning model that invites many stakeholders to discuss and debate aspects of pending decisions. Emphasis is frequently placed on stakeholder concerns and equity issues. Current efforts to restructure local government service delivery through privatization and contracting-out potentially privilege the public management model over the participatory model. The City of Indianapolis recently contracted its wastewater treatment operations and management to a private consortium using the public management model. This article links several recent and unintended outcomes in the Indianapolis case to the planning model used. </jats:p>",

In this paper the way in which the rise of MBSs has reshaped access to credit across social and spatial divisions is examined, and the implications of battles to shape the MBS market and of the practices of the two principal agencies in that market for the geography of financial exclusion are explored. Although the reregulation of the government-sponsored secondary markets promises to help break down entrenched patterns of financial exclusion, the government-sponsored enterprises are placed in the complex position of mediating social demands for more inclusionary credit practices and investor demands for continued high returns and low risks. It is unclear whether reform efforts will be sustained in the new political and economic environment of the mid-1990s. </jats:p>",

First, we discuss some of the forces driving the college's educational reform efforts, especially those related to the use of TQM as the vehicle for change. Throughout the case study, we point out how (and why) certain Total Quality principles, including customer relationships, shared vision, assessment and continuous improvement, and sub‐systems alignment, became integral parts of the strategic planning process.</jats:p>",

It is argued that financial structures have profound effects on the pace and distributional consequences of urban growth, in large part because urban development is characterized by widespread spatial spillover effects. The contemporary era of financial transformation has widened gaps between urban communities and banking customer markets. Banking markets that were once segmented by regulation are now segmented by market dynamics. In consequence, a financial system which once facilitated wealth building for households and communities now deepens social inequality and spatial separation. In this paper the historical and contemporary experience of Los Angeles is used to both develop and illustrate the arguments made. </jats:p>",

The first tool, the prompted writing feature of FrEdWriter (Rogers, 1985), allowed students to answer story grammar questions, then type stories using those responses as the plan; the second tool, Once Upon a Time (Urban, Rushing, &amp; Star, 1990), allowed students to create graphic scenes, then type stories about those scenes. Nine students attended a series of afterschool writing labs twice weekly for 11 weeks, using each tool for half of the writing sessions. Group results did not clearly favor either tool; however, individual differences suggested that use of planning features should be linked to student needs. Students who had less internal organizational ability benefited from the computer-presented story grammar prompts and wrote less mature stories when using the graphics-based tool. Students with relatively strong organizational skills wrote more mature stories with the graphics-based tool. </jats:p>",

It is based on a set of adjustable modules that are applied to the study of the energy function of the chemical system of interest. The main elements are a set of routines for global optimization and local minimization, as well as algorithms for the investigation of the phase space structure near local minima of the potential energy, and the analysis and characterization of the structure candidates. The current implementation focuses on ionic compounds, for which empirical potentials are used for the evaluation of the energy function in the first stage, and a Hartree–Fock algorithm for refinements. The global optimization is performed with a stochastic simulated annealing algorithm, and the local minimization employs stochastic quenches and gradient methods. The neighborhoods of the local minima are studied with the threshold algorithm. The results of this approach are illustrated with a number of examples: compounds of binary noble gases, and binary and ternary ionic compounds. These include several substances that have not been synthesized yet, but should stand a fair chance of being kinetically stable, for example further alkali metal nitrides besides Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>N, as well as Ca<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>SiBr<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> or SrTi<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>5</jats:sub>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The United States 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments set aggressive goals for state-level compliance and mandates for the use of employer trip-reduction (ETR) programs for certain regions. San Diego County, California, has responded to this mandate with its own trip-reduction regulation. The direct effects of the trip-reduction regulation fall into three categories, as follows: changes in spending, changes in costs, and changes in consumer amenities. The total effects on the local economy due to each of these categories are estimated using a Regional Economic Models, Inc. (REMI) forecasting and simulation model for San Diego County. This study is the first to use such a comprehensive methodology for an analysis of an ETR program. The study results show that spending effects on employment were positive, as local transit use replaced automotive-related expenditures and employees received cash incentive payments. The net increase in costs on business were modest with respect to the overall size of San Diego's economy. Consequently, the negative effects on business location due to these direct effects were also modest. There were significant effects from the program due to consumer utility reductions because subsidies and charges distorted consumer choices. </jats:p>",

Offices in South East England are characterised by faster growth, higher productivity, wider markets, and greater export penetration than their counterparts in the other regions considered. The relative strengths, weaknesses, and constraints on raising productivity and competitiveness of peripherally located firms are examined. Special consideration is given to markets served, spatial structure of markets, locational constraints, and the adequacy of equipment and qualifications. An important factor influencing competitiveness is the ability of an office to provide high-quality specialist services, and alternative policies for achieving this aim are considered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new algorithm is presented for solving the three-dimensional shortest path planning (3DSP) problem for a point object moving among convex polyhedral obstacles. It is the first non-approximate three-dimensional path planing algorithm that can deal with more than two polyhedral obstacles. The algorithm extends the visibility graph concept from two dimensions to three dimensions. The two main problems with 3DSP are identifying the edge sequence the shortest path passes through and the turning points of the shortest path. A technique based on projective relationships is presented for identifying the set of visible boundary edges (VBE) corresponding to a given view point over which the shortest path, from the view point to the goal, will pass. VBE are used to construct an initial reduced visibility graph (RVG). Optimization is used to revise the position of the turning points and hence the three-dimensional RVG (3DRVG) and the global shortest path is then selected from the 3DRVG. The algorithm is of computational complexity O(n<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>v<jats:sup>k</jats:sup>), where n is the number of verticles, v is the maximum number of vertices on any one obstacle and k is the number of obstacles. The algorithm is applicable only with polyhedral obstacles, as the theorems developed for searching for the turning points of the three-dimensional shortest path are based on straight edges of the obstacles. It needs to be further developed for dealing with arbitrary-shaped obstacles and this would increase the computational complexity. The algorithm is tested using computer simulations and some results are presented. </jats:p>",
