      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent historiography on city planning has greatly expanded its scope. Although the modern profession often dates its origins as the turn of the century, events of the earlier nineteenth century were actually incipient forms of contemporary planning. Moreover, though city planners are nonelected public employees, the profession has been inextricably tied to both the private sector and the political process. Much planning in U.S. cities has not been done by planners. In addition, a tension between idealism and realism has been present since the beginning. Because of external constraints, the planning profession's greatest impacts may have been in its indirect influence on the urban agenda and in the vision it has provided for a better urban future. </jats:p>",

It is a guide giving directions and procedures required for handling any type of emergency, regardless of the nature. The emergency plan could be used in conjunction with blowout plans, hurricane or typhoon contingency planning, fire control operations or other similar disaster situations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A blowout contingency plan should contain directives for handling most aspects of blowout management, personnel assignments and responsibilities, and specialists for specific assignments, It may contain specialized equipment requirements and include equipment stockpiling in some areas.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Blowout contingency plans are dependent on the operator's personnel and management structures. Since these differ among companies, it is not common to find identical plans for several companies. It should be customized to utilize specific personnel and management but also must be designed to handle the most likely disasters and the surrounding conditions.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The contingency should be used as planning described here in a guide. Each company must weigh alternatives and make selections to form their unique contingency plan. Consultation with blowout specialists during contingency lan development is recommended.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This discussion identifies topics found in contingency plans including the following:Management structureDisaster Early ResponsDisaster ContainmentDisaster ControlBlowout data and information requirementsBlowout control equipmentSpecialist third party personnelKill technique selection</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The format for the contingency plan will vary among operators. Also, it may be prepared as a written document and/or computerized,</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Relief well contingency planning is a sub-set of blowout control contingency planning (Stage 3). Relief well plans can be large and are often prepared as a separate document. Most information is available on a preliminary basis to prepare the relief well plan. Capping operations can not be pre-planned to the same level of detail as relief wells since capping is dependent on blowout conditions and the resulting damage, Relief well contingency planning will be described briefly.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

By far and away the biggest contributor to profits is the productivity of the well. Reliability and costs certainly impact profits; however, they pale in comparison to productivity when a rigorous calculation of net present value is performed. The simplest and most effective way to improve productivity is to increase the quantity of net reservoir exposed to the wellbore. A horizontal trajectory is the ultimate way to maximize the length of formation exposed to the wellbore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Drilling and completion technology development over the last several years has made the use of horizontal wellbores in unconsolidated formations practical. Utilizing a unique mixture of new and existing technology, BP recently brought their first horizontal well in the Gulf of Mexico on line in record setting fashion. The planning, installation and results of this team effort are detailed in this operations oriented paper.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>GEOLOGY AND RESERVOIR</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The majority of the reserves in the Amberjack (Mississippi Canyon 109) field are contained in the \"Green or G-sand\", a very unconsolidated Pliocene reservoir. Permeability of the reservoir ranges from 300 to 1000 md with the pay zone varying from clean to laminated sand/silt/shale. The G-sand was targeted for this horizontal wellbore with a projected thickness of 40' tvd based on 3D seismic data and offset well logs.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The G-sand reservoir was deposited by a shelf-edge delta system which laid down the sediments as a series of shingled mouth bar sands separated by dipping silt beds. These depositional units are referred to as \"clinoforms\" (refer to Figure 1). Barriers to flow of reservoir fluids between these packages of sand and silt were predicted from 3D seismic data and well logs. The potential for reservoir compartmentalization in this type of stratigraphy was the major consideration for proposing the A-5 horizontal wellbore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Significant differences in oil properties and water contacts in several wells drilled to date indicated that isolation of some areas was likely. While not all clinoform boundaries are sealing, the challenge for field development has been to ensure effective recovery with a minimum number of wells. The A-5 well was oriented to use a single horizontal wellbore to drain three clinoforms in the western portion of the field and planned to take the place of two or three conventional wellbores. The wellbore was oriented perpendicularly to the clinoform depositional axes with the completion interval draining all three packages (Figure 2).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A secondary benefit of the A-5 was to reduce the tendency for bottom-water production by providing additional standoff from the oil-water contact in the relatively thin oil column in the target region. Previously drilled conventional wells have typically produced water within 6 months of completion through either water coning or overrunning mechanisms.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Reservoir simulation was carried out to evaluate potential benefits of the non-conventional well and to evaluate sensitivities to reservoir description uncertainties. A cross-sectional model was used to investigate reservoir description issues including kV/kh ratio, bedding plane orientation, and clinoform boundary transmissibilities.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Twenty-five years ago, 'UTQ' published my essay 'Inhumanities of Urban Planning.' The question probed was whether the contemporary planning of cities and regions focused on the humane goal of ensuring 'free, varied, and unwasteful life' for the individual citizen, or whether it largely flouted the values of that Western tradition described as 'the humanities.' The essay offered eleven perspectives along which it seemed actual plans— and their implementations—could only dubiously be said to be honouring humane values. Some of the matters examined along these perspectives, such as the lack of self-criticism from a humanities viewpoint and poverty of contact with the visual arts and literature, were seen as simply deficient. Others were seen as active agents of damage. The subversions included submitting to a narrow technological rationality and overemphasizing utility. Overall, there was felt to be an aggregation of dangerous tendencies leading to the 'destruction of humane values ... a serious absence ... of concern for the condition of the human individual as a unique person.' The present essay explores the effects of two revolutions that have occurred since the mid-1960s in the life of the society at large and in the theory and practice of urban planning. In retrospect, the planning atmosphere up to the mid-1960s appears now as a tranquil, but over-confident, certitude before two storms that were soon to come in quick succession: first, a rapid shift in thinking and feeling, particularly in the young; and secondly, the acquisition of a great deal of new knowledge about the planet and about ourselves as its most dangerously empowered tenants. </jats:p>",

No doubt amnesty between the lamb and the lion calls for a fundamental alteration of the lion's character. As for the lamb, what a long period of learning to trust will be required before it is comfortable with an amiable relationship. The prophet Isaiah, who foresaw this new regime, probably did not know that among the animals the lamb and the lion already had a sensible arrangement. The lion knew enough to dine on sick lambs and ancient rams and ewes, but not to destroy the strong breeding stock which provided his ongoing food supply. In a sense the sheep were beneficiaries too, even if the method seems heartless to us as we cope with too many people and too few lions. Whatever scenario you choose—the scriptural, which was clearly aimed at erring humans, or the ecological—the metaphor does not fit the relation of city to country. Though I may dream of an accommodation resulting in mutual benefits, the reality is otherwise. The city continues to eat up or despoil the country with little regard to long-term survival, while those who live out on the land, having lost the capacity of flight or defence, make their peace by admiring and emulating this powerful predator. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For over a decade, the use of zone logic, an operational approach consistent with modern manufacturing practices, has become more common in U.S. shipyards. Regarding naval ships, the most significant difference from traditional system-by-system orientation is the application of an implementation strategy even before basic design efforts begin for any combination of ship alterations (ShipAlts). This imposes a unique challenge to each of the approximately thirteen planning yards which are charged by the Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA) with assessing the costs of, and when authorized, developing designs for proposed ShipAlts. The challenge consists of grouping information during the various design stages in a way that makes planning yard design deliverables anticipate the needs of the implementing yards that will employ zone logic. Simultaneously, these deliverables must be suitable for use by eligible bidders who have not yet made the transformation to modern zone orientation. This paper provides guidance for planning yards. The need for them to act as production engineering surrogates until implementing yards are designated is addressed. Typical planning yard outputs are also described.</jats:p>",

Modernists call it urban planning; postmodernists call it urban design. The difference signifies a transition, from the twentieth-century modernist ideal of large-scale, technical, and efficient city plans, and the International Style of functionalist, no-frills architecture, guided by the 'less-is-more' and 'form follows function' aesthetic of Le Corbusier, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, to a late twentieth-century postmodernist conception of urban life as being highly resistant to this approach. Urban design is preoccupied instead with a collage or pastiche of past styles within a fragmented, ephemeral, diverse environment. Derrida, for example, sees collage/montage as the essential form of postmodern discourse. </jats:p>",

It is the authors' thesis that a central weakness in geography's response to environmental problems and to issues of sustainability is the lack of engagement with questions of ethics. An overall ethic of care, respect, and responsibility is proposed. Within this overarching framework, it is suggested that the society — environment relation may be a scale-dependent problem set, with a separate expression of environmental ethics associated with each scale. For example, an ethic appropriate at the planetary scale may differ from that which is pertinent at the local scale. This argument is advanced through examples from religious and secular interpretations of human — environment relations. In a preliminary way, both moral and technical issues associated with different ethical positions are raised and geographers are challenged to consider and debate their implications. It is concluded that without explicit environmental ethical premises, the sustainability debate is indeterminate. </jats:p>",

This was done at two levels. First, the views of Shell managers and planners were collected and analysed. Second, the state of the art outside the company was studied for its relevance to Shell. The conclusions reached have been the basis for the Shell approach to strategic planning since then. This paper offers a detailed look at the principles that have been guiding strategic management in Shell. It describes the group‐wide planning system designed at that time and the new orientation aimed for in its planning methodologies.</jats:p><jats:p>Although Shell is by no means a typical company, it can be viewed as an interesting limit case in the global management of uncertainty and complexity. Few industries have encountered in their raw materials the volatility exhibited by oil prices, nor do few entail lead times as long or assets as specialized as those in the oil and gas industry. Adding to this, the political complexities inherent in dealing with governments, plus the unusual complexity of Shell's organizational design, provides for a fascinating study and challenge in the management of change. The paper concludes with a commentary on the distinctive features of the Shell approach.</jats:p>",

The data used represent the time in which the Canadian Home Insulation Program (CHIP) and the Canadian Oil Substitution Program (COSP) were operating at their peak. A nested multinomial logit model is estimated, which predicts the likelihood that individual households will carry out different retrofitting measures. In the final model, socioeconomic variables have an impact that is less than anticipated, an indication that the government programs succeeded in reducing socioeconomic barriers to retrofitting. Dwelling characteristics and fuel-type variables are of more importance and provincial dummy variables are often significant. It is concluded that the likelihood of a dwelling retrofit had less to do with the simple socioeconomic surrogates of the occupants than with the nature and location of the dwelling itself. The data reveal further that CHIP and COSP were less effective since they operated separately, and that the hypothesized nested decision structure is an appropriate one. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The policy literature offers many valid criticisms of government housing programs, but does not adequately trace housing-agency failures to their causes in the broader political and economic contexts of peripheral capitalist countries. The literature especially lacks an understanding of the role of interests within the state which benefit from housing programs in their current distorted form. In response to these analytical shortcomings, the author of this paper adapts a geographically hierarchical and comparative framework from locality studies that is capable of revealing both structural commonalities and contextual particularities of housing-agency behavior. The research is an examination and comparison of the performance of the major housing agencies in Brazil, Ecuador, and Jamaica. The diversity of economic resources and political regimes in these countries during the last three decades provides a spectrum of regional experiences. The investigation unfolds with the setting of the context of dependent capitalism, without which it is not possible to understand either the prominence or the incapacity of Latin American housing agencies. Next, the research adopts an historical vantage point to reveal key actors and events in housing-agency institutionalization. Having set the structural and historical contexts, the author then examines motives related to the state and its agents that help to explain why working-class housing programs have become self-centered patronage bureaucracies, to the neglect of their socially progressive goals. The author then explains how housing agencies have primarily used rhetoric, plans, and images, not material investment, to legitimize themselves to the disenfranchised working class. The final section synthesizes the paper's main points thereby establishing a political economic context for understanding Latin American housing programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is a central contention of urban political economy that changes in the macroeconomy will have demonstrable effects on land and housing markets. However, in few empirical studies has this relationship been investigated, particularly in cities of developing economies. The structure of the land market in Mexico under the changing economic conditions heralded by the election of Carlos Salinas de Gortari as Mexican President for the six-year ( sexenio) period 1988–94 is studied in this paper. It is argued that the immediate policies of Salinas, especially the control of inflation, brought about a return to the favourable conditions of real-estate investment that had existed throughout most of the 1970s. But more recent policies and particularly those of economic liberalization may not bode quite so well for those wishing to place a large part of their investment portfolios in real estate. The paper concludes with some comments on the development of the land market and land prices as the Salinas sexenio progresses and some speculations about the type of legacy that will be left for his successor. </jats:p>",

In interpreting the demand and supply characteristics of these firms, emphasis is placed on their interactions with the internal labour market strategies of predominantly large client organisations. Generally, the sample firms offer consultancy and marketing expertise which such clients do not provide from their own skill resources. Their founders were also often originally employees of such organisations, especially outside London. Regional economic and social characteristics mould the activities of these firms, even though many engage in a significant degree of interregional trade. The markets served, types of specialisation, the originating process, and the ages of founders show marked differences between the two sectors and the three areas. </jats:p>",

Data were collected through an in–person interview regarding a self–selected project and a standardized color acuity test. Potential sources of variation in color acuity between the colorists and generalists were examined. No statistically significant differences were found between groups, but the total sample scored significantly better on hue discrimination when compared to the normative adult mean. </jats:p><jats:p> Primary findings showed that noted designers employed five categories of criteria in the design process: compositional to create unity or emphasis, or to manipulate space and form with color; symbolic to express design concepts with color; behavioral to address activity needs with color; preferential to consider individual color preferences or market trends; and pragmatic to support maintenance needs and preconditions with color. Over half of the sample (52 percent) used two or more color categories per project, and exploratory analyses revealed that colorists used compositional color criteria more frequently than generalists. The results provided a basis for formulating a framework of color planning. </jats:p>",

This paper describes research at the University of Bristol, in collaboration with Rolls-Royce plc, to develop automated inspection planning and computer aided inspection applications. The inspection planning system involves the representation of inspection features and the manufacturing process model, together with an automated planning mechanism driven by rule-based plan reasoning. The shop-floor computer aided inspection workstation uses hand-held instruments interfaced to a computer, and provides flexible, interactive assistance for the dimensional inspection task. Batch and component traceability and control, together with a range of quality information storage and reporting functions, are provided. </jats:p>",
