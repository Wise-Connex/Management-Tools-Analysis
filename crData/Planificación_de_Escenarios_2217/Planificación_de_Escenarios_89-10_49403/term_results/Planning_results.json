Case studies of plan ning situations and surveys of plan ners and planning agencies have been published for over twenty years. Further, studies appeared in the late 1960s and 1970s of how planning directors assess their roles and how public planning agencies work. However, interpretations of social interaction, organizational re lationships, and political behavior represent a new way of exploring planning practice. This article notes that the findings of the studies re viewed could be made more accessi ble to practitioners and synthesized into theories of practice. </jats:p>",

The two main exercises for practice are forecasting tasks: one extrapolation, the other cohort-component. Together with their associated exercises, the proj ects are employed as vehicles for learning the basics of population analysis more generally. The paper describes the projects and exercises in some detail and then follows with a description of the twenty major lessons that underlie the teaching/ learning approach. </jats:p>",

In 1986 the North Western Regional Health Authority (RHA) initiated the first large‐scale attempt to use QALYs as a practical aid to planning in the National Health Service. This paper draws on the experience of the North Western RHA in examining some methodological and practical issues relating to the future of QALYs as an aid to decision‐making in the Health Service.</jats:p>",

The literature, however, has yet to present a comprehensive source on the theory and practice of economic development, due in part to the diversity of small towns. Instead, the literature features a piecemeal collection of strategies, techniques, case studies, and most recently, methods for adapting to changing economic conditions. Industrial recruitment and reliance on outside funding are giving way to locally based finance and entrepreneurial activity. Fewer and larger farms and the popularity of regional shopping malls suggest that the traditional purpose of many small towns as a service and retail center is fading. The literature stresses a need to take advantage of unique local resources and leadership to compete successfully with other communities. </jats:p>",

To accomplish this objective in the most economical manner, requires a build design that will hit the target without numerous bottom hole assembly changes and a rig that can handle the torque and drag loads produced by the drillstring in the horizontal hole. This paper describes several methods for designing the build curve that offer improved methods for hitting a small horizontal target while using a single bottom hole assembly for the angle building portions of the hole. The paper also presents a novel method for estimating the torque and drag forces for typical drillstrings in a horizontal hole.</jats:p>",

Attention is paid to a complex series of matters which currently inhibit the effective management of both old and new coalfield areas and, especially, to the urgent need for national assessment and guidance. A number of emerging matters of concern are suggested as providing topics for future research. These include the identification of the environmental consequences of new coal production strategies, an examination of the effectiveness of new procedures for managing opencasting, an evaluation of the employment impacts of controls upon the burning of high sulphur coal, an estimation of the socioeconomic impact of productivity gains, the assessment of community problems in coalfield areas and the measurement of the effectiveness of the new EIA Directive. These topics are seen as likely to yield research evidence which is essential if environmental planning and management is to be more effective in the future evolution of coalfield areas. </jats:p>",

Others, moreover, feel we are in the dawn of a new epoch in which major economic transformations are to bring about, through new class alliances and conflict, decentralization of power and a better quality of life in communities. These assumptions and their theoretical pitfalls are discussed here following an historical overview of the centralization/decentralization issue in Canadian social policy. It is argued that recent proposals of decentralization are a continuation of reactionary tendencies to constrain social expenditures, but not a path to better quality of life.</jats:p>",

It identifies appropriate interventions for sustaining the membership of the programme.</jats:p><jats:p>The Health Card Programme in Chiang Mai is the pilot phase of a national health insurance system in Thailand. Possession of a health card entitles the holder(s) to free treatment for a specified number of illnesses per year. The card holder is promised quick services via a ‘green channel’ in referral centres. Funds from card sales are used for reimbursing service providers, for community development, and for soft loans to card holders.</jats:p><jats:p>The main incentives for households to buy the health card were the expectations of free treatment, reduced waiting time at referral centres, and subsidized drugs. Eligibility for soft loans was not a major incentive for households to buy the health card. The promise of reduced waiting time was often not kept, resulting in consumer dissatisfaction and a preference for private, fee‐charging hospitals by the wealthier households. The timing of health card sales was not planned to coincide with the peak‐income post‐harvest season. The low income card for the poor, which guarantees free access to medical care, was readily available to the wealthy, but its impact on membership of the Health Card Programme is unclear.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> AI automated plan synthesis programs (“planners”) typically represent plans as a partially ordered network whose nodes are instants in time and whose arcs are precedence constraints. Such representations are essentially PERT charts. This paper provides an introduction to AI planners and illustrates the fact that many such PERT chart representations are created by a planner as it attempts to find a suitable plan. A planner's search must be guided if it is to produce suitable plans in realistic problem domains. One form of guidance is the imposition of constraints which must be satisfied by a valid plan. This paper concentrates on representing and reasoning about such constraints. </jats:p><jats:p> Successful planning in some domains, e.g. job-shop scheduling, requires the recognition and satisfaction of constraints which prevent the simultaneous use of a shared resource by multiple agents. Such requirements can be expressed as disjunctive precedence constraints. In addition, the search for a valid plan is often structured so that rough plans are successively refined into plans with increased detail. In this refinement process, new constraints are often discovered. It should therefore be easy to add such new constraints. Finally, it is helpful to be able to express upper bound constraints on the elapsed time between two nodes in a PERT chart representation of a plan. Thus, this paper reports on knowledge representation and reasoning processes which facilitate: (1) disjunctive constraints, (2) the introduction of new constraints, and (3) upper bound constraints. </jats:p><jats:p> A planner must backtrack when it is evident that further refinement of its current skeletal plan would be fruitless. Such an inconsistent state can be recognized when a plan's PERT chart representation contains an illegal cycle of positive overall length. When backtracking is required, dependency-directed backtracking is facilitated by recording “Nogood sets” of arcs whose simultaneous presence would result in such an illegal cycle. By using dependency-directed backtracking, chronological backtracking can be avoided. </jats:p>",

Von Thünen's theory emphasized distance from farm to market as well as transport costs, yield, market prices, and production costs as rent determinants. Modern versions of the theory provided simple models which relate explicitly to transportation costs. The theory has been criticized mainly for its many limiting assumptions. </jats:p>",

This paper provides, for 1984, estimates of the effects this has on house prices, on residential densities and on access to owner occupation. In turn these generate estimates of the extent to which urban development would spread in the South East if the planning system were operated in a way which had no restrictive effect on the built-up area. We draw on the results of a wider study of the economic consequences of the planning system. Our estimates are derived from a detailed analysis of the land and property markets in two English cities, selected to be at the polar extremes of planning restrictiveness but as similar as possible in other respects. Household surveys were used to generate the data necessary to standardise for factors conventional urban economic theory suggests would lead to demand differences between them, to provide quantitative estimates of the effects of the supply restrictions produced by the operation of the planning system. </jats:p>",

The input to the planner is a model of the task geometry, a start region, and a goal region. To make the planning problem tractable, we reduce the task geometry to a finite state space, whose states are collections of vertices, edges, and faces from the configuration space of the robot. Strategy synthesis is complicated by uncertainty in the start ing configuration of the robot and in robot sensing and con trol. The planner synthesizes compliant motions that are guaranteed to perform state transitions despite uncertainty. Using best first search, compliant motions are synthesized until a strategy is found from the start state to a goal state. A strategy may require that the robot stop in an intermediate state, using sensors to determine the next commanded motion. </jats:p>",

The effect of the time concat enation of the steer angle with two or more gaussian enve lopes shows that a range of activities relevant to the functional needs of a robot-vehicle are possible.

The Mapping Phase employs a closed-form relationship to map from object space to C-Space for a manipulator with revolute joints. The Path Planning Phase consists of develop ing a potential field around each object in C-Space and using the resulting field to choose an appropriate path. To accom plish this, a trial path is chosen and then modified under the influence of the potential field. Considering the entire path greatly reduces the probability of becoming trapped in a local minimum, making the method effective for global planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contains a consideration of the recent arguments in favour of adopting ‘anticipate and prevent’ or ‘proactive’ energy — environment policy strategies, in place of the ‘reactive’ strategies that are a feature of many current approaches to policymaking in this area. The roles that energy — environment modelling might play in investigating alternative scenarios and proactive policy strategies are then examined. The focus is on the advantages and disadvantages of using Input — Output analysis and related mathematical programming techniques to provide information for the policymaking process. Of course, Input — Output analysis is neither the only nor the ideal approach to energy — environment modelbuilding. However, despite acknowledged conceptual and practical limitations of applying Input — Output analysis in this area, it is suggested there is a case for considering its further application, particularly in the context of the United Kingdom, not least because it enables a general equilibrium approach to be implemented. </jats:p>",

The tax-structuring problem is characterized by many often conflicting objectives, such as maintaining adequate revenue levels, reducing property taxes, and minimizing the burden placed upon low income taxpayers. Using an interactive multiobjective linear programming (MOLP) methodology we were able to provide the city manager of Peoria, Illinois with insights necessary to restructure the city's tax system. After six iterations of the model, the results of our analysis indicated that tax revenues could be maintained and city residents' taxes reduced by shifting some of the burden to noncity residents, many of whom consume the public goods the city offers. To do so, our solution called for increasing the sales taxes on general and durable goods, instituting a gasoline tax, and reducing both property taxes and sales taxes on food and drugs. A major benefit of the MOLP model according to the city manager was its ability to illustrate the trade-offs between the different tax structuring objectives. </jats:p>",

This has been paralleled by rising expectations of public involvement in major policy decisions with significant environmental impacts. However, existing mechanisms for incorporating these concerns in policy formulation and decisionmaking are widely recognised as unsatisfactory. In order to identify the nature of the debate on issues of energy and environment, which any alternative mechanisms must address, the publications of twelve organisations on energy policy were analysed. The analysis indicated that energy policy formulation and decisionmaking is characterised by the existence of multiple objectives, subjectivity, and uncertainty. Decision analysis may be used to address problems of this type. The application of decision analysis to energy policy decisionmaking is discussed, and the potential of the technique is assessed. </jats:p>",

It is noted that practice of pollution control very rarely involves price incentives. It is argued that the question of why practice ignores the recommendation of economists is interesting and important. Some suggestions are made as to where the answer to the question might lie. It is shown that a price incentive system (the taxation of inputs to production which gives rise to polluting discharges) in which economists have shown rather little interest, retains some of the attractive properties of emissions taxation and avoids the need of the latter for the continuous monitoring of emissions, which need may be a factor working against the adoption of conventional price incentive systems for pollution control. </jats:p>",
