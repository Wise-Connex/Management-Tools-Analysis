Soil‐water‐plant growth relations which affect yields under different levels of management were evaluated at Akron, Colo. Under 46 years of uniform management, wheat production levels varied from 73 to 120 among eight soil types identified in a 25‐acre test field formerly mapped as one soil type. Soil differences induced wider variations under uniform treatment than did different treatments on a single soil type. When the detail of delineation and characterization of soils is comparable to the detail of the research plot layout, existing research fields and plot data may be used to associate soil qualities with response to treatment. The reliability of application of research findings to other areas will depend on adequate characterization and evaluation of the soil in each plot.</jats:p>",
