It was planned for an estimated work load of approximately 67,000 examinations by 1968, with an expected 10% increase per annum for the decade following. This total was reached in 1970 and is now approaching 90,000 examinations which includes approximately 15,000 from general practitioners.</jats:p><jats:p>The department has been able to deal satisfactorily with this work load and could take many more if not limited by a shortage of staff. There has been some shortage of space for typing services which has been temporarily overcome by some reorganisation. Further space for this and three more diagnostic X‐ray rooms have been allowed for in the future Stage III building.</jats:p><jats:p>The need for generous provision of facilities for viewing and reporting X‐rays and for conferences has been emphasised.</jats:p><jats:p>The basic concept of a good work flow with minimal cross‐traffic between staff and patients has been more than fulfilled, and according to the charge radiographer the department works better than expected.</jats:p>",

Six instructional objectives involving the acquisition and application of knowledge as well as the modification of attitudes were specified and a board game was devised as the instructional technique. Evaluation instruments were constructed and the simu lation game was revised in a pilot study. A field project was then carried out in the East Kootenay area of British Columbia where 40 rural people residing on land holdings of 50 or more acres par ticipated in the simulation game. Post-test mean scores were com pared to pre-test means and three of the eight objective and sub total scores showed statistically significant gains while the remain ing changes were non-significant but in the hypothesized direction. Test scores correlated significantly with some characteristics of the participants and with some factors related to success in playing the simulation game. The study discusses factors that may have influenced the results obtained and concludes that simulation gaming is potentially a useful technique for educating rural adults about land use planning. </jats:p>",

Roughly corresponding orthogonal dimensions were found. They were interpreted as segregation (racial-ethnic dimension), social rank, familism, mobility, and wives' employment, respectively, with a weak additional maleness dimension emerging in the metropolitan area. The strength of the dimensions shifted from city to metropolitan area. Segregation was the most important one in the city, with social rank and familism next. The metropolitan area had social rank first and familism next. Urban-suburban mean differences were strong but could not account for the dimensional differences in strength. Suburban differentiation appeared somewhat better caught by the dimensions than its city counterpart. Three dimensions may be seen as belonging to the familism type, but they did not refer to different stages of the family cycle in the first place, as in some Scandinavian studies. All dimensions showed some zonal variation in the metropolitan area. Social rank (and maleness) also varied sectorially, and segregation had a clustered spatial pattern. </jats:p>",

Since there is no close relationship between diagnosis and need of care, the latter should be estimated separately in health planning studies. There is reason to include mental vulnerability (30% of a stratified normal population) in the health planning program, mainly as a factor requiring secondary prevention (e.g. crisis intervention) or tertiary prevention (e.g. prophylaxis against recurrences) and preferably also for primary prevention. Figures on the discrepancy between demand and need are given. This discrepancy is quantitatively small (6% in a mental out-patient material) but qualitatively important. The effect of health care availability on the later demand for care is demonstrated in a series of emergency patients, 68% of the cases being recidivists. The view is favoured that the need for hospital care should be measured stepwise: first among the outpatients in the same specialty, then if possible among the clientèle of the GP and in other specialties. There is considerable overlapping between mental and physical symptoms among psychiatric patients. The after care could in many cases be given by GPs. The number of these must, though, be increased and their training in minor psychiatry supplemented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the complex chain of interrelationships in the retail patterns of urban areas, with particular reference to the examination of low-order goods and the patterns derived therefrom in terms of both space and price. In the search for endogenous factors it is suggested that use of multivariate linear regression models might be of limited value in this particular context and that it is both conceptually appealing, and possibly more rewarding, to utilize curvilinear regression analysis on a single variable. The family chosen here is that of the generalised gamma curves and this is related to empirical evidence from Bedford and Durham to give a predictive model for the price structure/distribution in the urban system. </jats:p>",
