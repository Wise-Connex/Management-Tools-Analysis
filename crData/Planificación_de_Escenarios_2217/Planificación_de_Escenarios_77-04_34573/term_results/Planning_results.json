The main use of this approach has been to analyze alternatives in the decision‐making process. However, it can be valuable in long‐range‐planning. The advantage of the incremental approach is that it uses a step‐by‐step process, rather than developing one figure for the total change. This technique is easily combined with more traditional budgeting techniques. An incremental decision model can be developed in conjunction with the existing information system to provide such information as rate of return, cash flows, expenses, and revenues, on an incremental basis. The model can be used to simulate any anticipated changes for detailed analysis.</jats:p>",

To assist hospital planners without specialized knowledge of simulation techniques, a tutorial account presents how to utilize recently developed modular modeling techniques in terms of model development. A step-by-step discussion details how modular modeling can pinpoint design-induced bottlenecks in planned facilities prior to implementation. Specific attributes modeled are:• Patient arrivals, by classification.• Patient waiting line, due to registration procedures.• Registration procedures (delays).• Patient waiting line, prior to treatment.• Treatment service times.• Total patient transit times.</jats:p>",

Furthermore it is shown that when the degree of uncertainty changes, the optimal decision depends upon the behaviour of the marginal utilities of the outcomes. These general propositions are demonstrated and the optimal solution is presented for the specific case in which the outcome is environmental quality. Environmental quality is introduced explicitly into the social utility function and implicitly into the utility-from-profits function via a tax on the firm's contribution to environmental quality. </jats:p>",

The paper also develops appropriate multivariate analogues of the information measures.

The model is a component of the Integrated Transportation and Land Use Package—ITLUP. As a part of ongoing work with DRAM, it has been calibrated for several US cities by use of conventional late twentieth-century data sets. Because of the work of the Philadelphia Social History Project a nineteenth-century data set for Philadelphia became available for use. This provided a unique opportunity to try calibrations of DRAM on this century-old data and thus attempt to validate the general structure of the model. The results of these calibrations suggest a rather high degree of descriptive validity and consistency with macro-behavioral theories of spatial allocation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A procedure is described for interpolating surface features on a map based on a two-dimensional time-space configuration of points. Initially an objective procedure is used to give a best fit of a previously obtained time-space configuration of points to the physical configuration of the same points. The resultant set of vectors, each of which shows the residual displacement between a point in time space and physical space, is used as the basis of a fast, objective procedure for interpolating any other points or lines in the time space. This enables such things to be shown as the time-space distortion of an urban street network or of a square graticule from physical space. The process can also be reversed so that, for example, the solution points of a facility location problem solved in time space can be converted to their equivalent locations in physical space. </jats:p>",

The outputs of the simulation models are subject to random error, and this error is transmitted to these indices. Random error is a consequence of inaccuracies in calibration and input data, and simplified model theory. The error in the indices can often be estimated prior to model execution, thus allowing the analyst to determine whether the complexity of the model is appropriate for his particular needs. Examples of how noise pollution, air pollution, vehicle-miles-traveled, and vehicle-hours-traveled indices are affected by changing the zone size of an assignment model illustrate how knowledge of index error may be used to design a transportation simulation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An important problem of general interest concerns the aggregate response of a system to increasing density (or decreasing effective distance between units). An analysis is made for a system in which the individual responses to changing density are smooth. The analysis is presented in terms of the ‘overbanked’ situation of the USA in the 1920s. Models are derived from micro-economic principles concerning the interaction of two banks in competition for deposits as road transportation decreases in relative cost. The conclusion drawn from analysis of the models is that aggregate deposits may increase in a smooth or in a discontinuous (jump) fashion, the jump depending on the nature of an individual banker's response function and occurring despite smooth individual responses. In the case where the system is always in equilibrium, the jump may be a catastrophe in the sense described by Thorn. The analysis indicates that improvements in road transportation may have significantly reduced the stability of the banking system to a point of catastrophic collapse (as well as, for example, overzealous chartering by the authorities). The analysis should have application to many other situations in which decreasing effective distance is an important fact. </jats:p>",

Such a system is presented. It consists of measuring and rating four lakeshore land use characteristics (type of sewage disposal system, lot size, road proximity, and intensity of public use areas), and three upland watershed land use characteristics (intensity of development, forest cover, and agriculture and open space). These seven characteristics are measured, rated, and then combined to provide a two‐digit index number. This number, when compared with the indexes of other lakes in the region and interpreted with assistance from officials of the State Health and Water Resources Department, indicates on a relative basis the degree to which various land uses are contributing to accelerated, cultural eutrophication. Interpretation of the index suggests land use controls necessary to improve lake water. It supplements, and should be used with, an index of lake vulnerability to accelerated eutrophication and a comparative measure of present water quality.</jats:p>",
