      "abstract": "<jats:p>Every year, new development projects are recommended to be undertaken by various divisional management to corporate management in different multi‐divisional companies. The corporate managements in such companies face a challenging task of understanding and approving these projects. Moreover, divisions’ performance in a particular year may depend upon the short‐term outcome of such projects. Divisional managers may avoid undertaking new projects, especially those with low probabilities of success, but with extremely high rewards, if successful. Thus, risk‐taking attitudes among divisional managers may be affected in such companies. This paper examines these issues. The results were compiled after surveying 30 multidivisional companies in various industries. Results highlight the various strategic decisions found being conducted at the head office level vs divisional level of such companies. Most of the companies were found to place moderate to fairly strong emphasis on a division’s past performance while evaluating the division’s current year performance. The results highlight project failure allowance, type of reward systems used, and corresponding risk‐taking attitude among divisional managers in such companies. </jats:p>",

It describes how a workshop for manufacturing strategic planning was selected and developed by taking a market‐oriented approach to reflect customer needs. The interactive, collaborative design process among stakeholders was practiced, and a continuous needs assessment was employed to explore and exploit customer needs throughout the design cycle. The workshop covered both the conceptual and the experiential, and learning‐by‐doing was a key instructional strategy adopted. The article concludes by discussing key learnings acquired. </jats:p>",

Der Beitrag basiert auf umfangreichen Erhebungen in drei deutschen Regionen und resümiert zugleich die zentralen Erkenntnisse dieses Schwerpunktheftes. Er konzentriert sich auf die Rolle, die die räumliche Nähe von Kooperationspartnern für die Entwicklung von innovativen Verflechtungen zwischen Unternehmen des Verarbeitenden Gewerbes und anderen Partnertypen wie Forschungseinrichtungen oder Zulieferern spielt. Die Ergebnisse bestätigen im wesentlichen die Hypothese einer starken und zunehmenden Bedeutung intraregionaler Verflechtungen zwischen den Innovationsakteuren.  </jats:p>"

Er verfolgt zwei Ziele. Erstens wird der aktuelle Forschungsstand zur Beziehung zwischen regionalem Innovationspotential und innovativen Netzwerken unter Berücksichtigung der theoretischen Basis und der empirischen Evidenz dargestellt. Zweitens beschreibt der Beitrag die Datengrundlagen und das methodische Vorgehen des Gemeinschaftsprojektes.</jats:p>"

Für die Fallbeispiele Baden und Elsaß soll geklärt werden, ob das Ausmaß der bislang praktizierten grenzüberschreitenden Zusammenarbeit die Annahme der gegenseitigen Nutzung regionaler Innovationsressourcen rechtfertigt. Die Analysen zeigen, daß sowohl deutliche Unterschiede im Innovationsverhalten von Industrie- und Dienstleistungsbetrieben als auch eine nur geringe Intensität grenzüberschreitender Verflectungsheziehungen festzustellen sind. Anhand einer regionalen Distanzanalyse wird deutlich, daß beide Regionen jeweils einzelne, klar abgrenzbare Innovationssysteme darstellen, für die der Rhein nach wie vor eine markante Trennungslinie bildet.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A questionnaire survey is used to verify our argument. It is found that most of Hong Kong’s manufacturing investments are labor‐intensive and export‐oriented. The most important determinants of Hong Kong’s manufacturing investment in China are cheap labor and land, stable political environment, government incentive policies and high investment return. The most important location‐specific advantages are geographical proximity to Hong Kong, better preferential treatment, good infrastructure, and absence of language barrier. It is also found that export‐oriented FDI tends to be efficiency‐seeking while market‐oriented FDI appears to be resource‐seeking.</jats:p>",

The initial hypothesis is that mobility barriers between the groups mean that their members have a relative advantage over other participants in the sector as far as expenses regarding imitation are concerned. Therefore, differences in profits tend to be maintained on a medium‐ and long‐term basis. However, the majority of empirical studies do not show the differences in the perfomance in a clear way. The methodology used consists of different multivariant statistical techniques.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Innovative Unternehmen des Verarbeitenden Gewerbes und öffentliche Forschungseinrichtungen zählen zu den wichtigsten Akteuren im regionalen Innovationssystem, wobei die Zusammenarbeit zwischen den beteiligten Partnern eine besondere Rolle bei der Nutzung regionaler Innovationspotentiale spielt. Wir gehen davon aus, daß die unterschiedlichen Kooperationsreichweiten und damit die Einbindung der Akteure in verschiedene regionale und überregionale Netzwerke in direktem Wirkungszusammenhang zur Ausschöpfung der vorhandenen Potentiale steht. Aus Sicht der universitären Forschungseinrichtungen wird deutlich, daß die räumliche Nähe für die Kooperation mit Unternehmen vorteilhaft ist, aber nicht entscheidend, da die überregionale Zusammenarbeit mit Unternehmen überwiegt. Neben der Ausstattung mit Personal- und Drittmitteln dürften die persönlichen Kontakte einen relevanten Einfluß auf die Kooperationsbeziehungen und-reichweite haben. Für die befragten Industriebetriebe zeigt sich, daß bei der Auswahl der Kooperationspartner unterschiedliche Maßstäbe herangezogen werden. Bei vertikalen Verflechtungsformen entscheiden die überregionalen Märkte, geht es aber um die Kooperation mit Forschungseinrichtungen, so wird das regionale Umfeld verstärkt gesucht.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is set in the context of the increased prevalence of environmental direct action in the United Kingdom. After delimiting ‘radical’ enviromentalism, and briefly describing the impetus for this turn to direct action, I focus on the radical environmental movement's use of different media. Thus parallel to the increase in direct action has been the emergence of a variety of radical environmental news texts (in both video and print form). These texts carry different representations and cultural–political mappings of the rural and rurality. Three themes of such a depiction are described: the rural as ‘nature's refuge’, as a local space but potentially global in its consequence, and a space of a radical history of Englishness. In the second half of the paper I draw insight from actor–network theory to argue for a relational–materialist approach to the production and consumption of these texts. By taking this approach I describe a ‘moment’ wherein it becomes difficult and problematic to separate these two processes. The notion of chains of production–consumption is suggested in order to overcome this difficulty. </jats:p>",

Derartige Kooperationsbeziehungen sind stark auf die Wirtschaft in der betreffenden Region konzentriert, was auf eine wesentliche Bedeutung von räumlicher Nähe hindeutet. Offensichtlich leisten öffentliche Forschungseinrichtungen im Rahmen von Kooperationsbeziehungen einen wesentlichen Beitrag zu den Innovationsaktivitäten der jeweiligen Regionalwirtschaft. Betrachtet man die Kooperationsbeziehungen, die öffentliche Forschungseinrichtungen zu anderen Forschungseinrichtungen unterhalten, so zeigt sich, daß dieses Netzwerk weniger stark auf die jeweilige Region konzentriert, sondern räumlich deutlich weiter gespannt ist. Unsere Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, daß öffentliche Forschungseinrichtungen eine Art „Antennenfunktion” wahrnehmen, indem sie regionsextern vorhandenes akademisches und unternehmerisches Wissen absorbieren und für die regionale Wirtschaft nutzbar machen.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

However, there are cases when the composition and execution of an action converge in time so that, in the limit, they occur simultaneously. The authors define such a convergence as improvisation and develop hypotheses to investigate the conditions in which improvisation is likely to occur and be effective. The authors test these hypotheses in a longitudinal study of new product development activities. Results show that organizational improvisation occurs moderately in organizations and that organizational memory level decreases and environmental turbulence level increases the incidence of improvisation. Results support traditional concerns that improvisation can reduce new product effectiveness but also indicate that environmental and organizational factors can reduce negative effects and sometimes create a positive effect for improvisation. These results suggest that, in some contexts, improvisation may be not only what organizations actually practice but also what they should practice to flourish. </jats:p>",

Meta-analyses are particularly useful to clinicians because they summarize findings from a large number of outcome studies in a rigorous, comprehensive, and concise format. The quantitative presentation of meta-analyses may be daunting to those who are not familiar with meta-analytic procedures and statistics. Therefore, this article describes a simple method for making clinically relevant interpretations of meta-analytic results. Furthermore, specific examples that are based on actual meta-analyses are given as models for communicating with clients and their family members about treatment outcomes in order to facilitate collaboration during treatment planning.</jats:p>",

To give the analysis structure, I begin with the framing logic of Kahneman and Tversky and introduce three different frames structuring decisionmaking, starting with the ‘weapons of influence’, the ‘strategies of justification’, and, finally, the ‘emotions of relationships’. The focus of the paper is on how and why corruption occurs in trustee decisionmaking, especially concerning community development projects. Implications are drawn from the model of corruption for current debate over the proper scope of regulation. It is argued that the current system of trust law and case-by-case adjudication is inadequate in the face of the systematic nature of corruption and the potential harm occasioned by corrupt trustee decisionmaking. It is also argued that the model of corruption sketched in this paper can be applied to a wide range of investment decisions, not just community development projects (the initial reference point for the paper). </jats:p>",

It consists of selecting avoidance maneuvers to avoid static and moving obstacles in the velocity space, based on the cur rent positions and velocities of the robot and obstacles. It is a first- order method, since it does not integrate velocities to yield positions as functions of time. </jats:p><jats:p> The avoidance maneuvers are generated by selecting robot ve locities outside of the velocity obstacles, which represent the set of robot velocities that would result in a collision with a given obstacle that moves at a given velocity, at some future time. To ensure that the avoidance maneuver is dynamically feasible, the set of avoidance velocities is intersected with the set of admissible velocities, defined by the robot's acceleration constraints. Computing new avoidance maneuvers at regular time intervals accounts for general obstacle trajectories. </jats:p><jats:p> The trajectory from start to goal is computed by searching a tree of feasible avoidance maneuvers, computed at discrete time intervals. An exhaustive search of the tree yields near-optimal trajectories that either minimize distance or motion time. A heuristic search of the tree is applicable to on-line planning. The method is demonstrated for point and disk robots among static and moving obstacles, and for an automated vehicle in an intelligent vehicle highway system scenario. </jats:p>",

The interconnectedness, nonlinearity, discontinuity, feed back loops and human interventions make manufacturing a complex adaptive system. Inherent complexity and random perturbations cause unpredictable fluctuations in manufacturing at all levels. The learning heuristics of adaptive system can effectively tackle situations in manufacturing where the underlying cause structure is unknowable or difficult to isolate. The basic understanding of the tenets of chaos and complexity helps respond to manufacturing reality. The appreciation of real-time learning as a useful complement to planning will bridge the growing divide between implementors and planners in manufacturing. </jats:p>",

This approach is evidently shared by policymakers, who tend to formulate regional development policies without taking account of existing socioeconomic differences within the regions. Development policy for Israel's national peripheries is a salient example of a homogeneous development policy. The findings of the present study point to the need to reconsider regional development by placing the main emphasis on the fashioning of a differential regional development policy, together with or in preference to a homogeneous or uniform policy. The findings are obtained through application of a relatively new method of multivariate analysis: ‘multicriteria decision aid’ (MCDA). The study suggests theoretical and methodological considerations in the larger context of regional development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An emerging paradigm in solving the classical motion- planning problem (among static obstacles) is to capture the connectivity of the configuration space using a finite (but pos sibly large) set of landmarks (or nodes) in it. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to manipulation-planning problem, where the goal is to plan the motion of a robot so that it can move a given object from an initial configuration to a final configuration while avoiding collisions with the static obstacles and other movable objects in the environment. Our specific approach adapts Adriadne's clew algorithm, which has been shown effective for classical motion-planning prob lems (Mazer et al. 1994; Ahuactzin 1994). In our approach, landmarks are placed in lower dimensional submanifolds of the composite configuration space. These landmarks repre sent stable grasps that are reachable from the initial con figuration. From each new landmark, the planner attempts to reach the goal configuration by executing a local plan ner, again in a lower (but different) dimensional submani fold of the composite configuration space. The approach is probabilistically resolution complete, does not assume that a closed-form inverse-kinematics solution for the manipulator is available, and is particularly suitable for redundant manip ulators. We also demonstrate that our approach is practical for realistic problems in three-dimensional environments with manipulator arms having fairly large numbers of degrees of freedom. We have experimented with this approach for a 7- DOF manipulator in 3-D environments with one movable ob ject, and computation times range between a few minutes and a few tens of minutes-in our experiments, between 3 min to 15 min, depending on the task difficulty. </jats:p>",

The dwelling service years provided by dwellings serve as a proxy for benefits of rents or imputed rents (excluding rent for land). The cost to construct one dwelling and fractions thereof serve as a proxy for costs of maintenance, rehabilitation, replacement, and new construction. Optimum timing of rehabilitation can increase the quantity of benefits provided by the housing stock per unit total cost but a reduction in the growth rate of new dwellings has a greater impact in achieving the same objective. A stationary and stable housing stock can provide 45% more dwelling services per unit total cost than a housing stock which doubles in size every 35 years. </jats:p>",

The evidence on the effects of this policy is reviewed. There appears to have been increased use of taxis and commercial vehicles, as a substitute for cars. In addition, in the early years of the policy, when the restrictions only operated in the morning, there was a transfer of some car trips to the afternoon. The speed of traffic crossing the centre increased because there was less congestion. Survey evidence indicated that the closure was viewed favourably by residents, particularly those living in the centre (who were allowed to use their cars in the closed area); this was confirmed by the fact that properties in the centre appeared to have increased in value relative to those outside the centre. In 1996 the policy was changed to one of preventing private motor vehicles crossing the centre although entry to the centre was allowed.

Core area is defined as the area of old forest, free of edge effects, where the edge effect is a function of the state of the surrounding habitat. The core area measure is evaluated by solving a long-range planning problem for a landscape consisting of 200 stands, where the net present value of forest management is maximized under the constraint of a certain amount of core area in the landscape over a time horizon of 100 years. Simulated annealing is used as the solution technique. The results indicate that the degree to which stands are clustered depends on the amount of core area demanded and the extent of the edge width. The amount of new core area that is allocated adjacent to existing core area, indicating a continuity of core area formation, is increased with core area demand, the minimum age of old forest, and the existence of a U-shaped initial age structure. The cost of attaining the spatial patterns appears to be low compared with the cost of retaining the old forest. </jats:p>",

The paper follows recent thinking in rural geography in attending to the discourses and agency of activists. Such an approach enables a reading of Australian agricultural women's environmental activism. Initially it is shown how the ‘women in agriculture’ movement engages with the range of discourses that contextualise the agri-environmental arena. This is then followed by a critical reading of the gendered subjectivities the movement employed. No specific environmental issues galvanised the movement. Instead, it is argued, particular constructions of nature and women's place in rural space are assembled as activists canvassed their broad environmental concerns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I focus on the interactions between technological transformation of agrofood systems and the construction of discursive linkages between rurality and nature. I draw on Giddens's notion of time–space distanciation to show how the spatial configuration of modern agrofood systems creates possibilities but also imposes limits on discourses about agriculture and nature. Using some observations from the bovine somatotropin (BST) experience, I demonstrate that prospective technological transformations significantly influence the struggle for ‘control of the natural’ among the diversity of actors in the dairy-products commodity chain. Proponents and opponents of BST aimed to occupy the discursive high ground of ‘the natural’ in making their appeals to farmers, consumers, and policymakers. As it became clearer in the late 1980s that BST would not prove to be the revolutionary biotechnology product that proponents had originally claimed, both proponents and opponents significantly altered the substance of their discursive claims about what constitutes the natural. This suggests that vocabularies of nature are a flexible modality for contesting the course of social change in agrofood systems. Actors in the BST controversy not only contested the natural status of artifacts and practices such as the use of BST technology, they did so with respect to the social institutions of agricultural research and agricultural policy as well. Some legacies of the struggle for control of the natural in US dairying and in agrofood systems in general are discussed. </jats:p>",

In doing so, we emphasize the primacy of learning and learning capability in the post-Fordist world of international competition, with a focus on analyzing Fordist and post-Fordist forms of learning at various levels and their differing impact on the learning capability of firms in a regional context. First, we examine the organizational arrangements that promote individual and organizational learning within the firm, with special reference to the Japanese practices of lean and flexible production. Second, we introduce the concept of transactional learning to delineate various forms of Fordist and post-Fordist learning that occur in the marketplace. After reinterpreting Porter's (1990) diamond model as a market structure for transactional learning, we extend his work by emphasizing the role of interfirm networks in facilitating learning and learning capability. The focus of this analysis is on the importance of trust and reciprocity in maintaining effective information flow and cooperation within these networks. In doing so, we discuss differences in the social construction of trust and networks and their corresponding impact on dominant forms of learning and learning capability. We further introduce the concept of spatial learning for analyzing the role of industrial districts as learning agents. We conclude the paper with an examination of the concept of learning infrastructure as a general construct for policymaking regarding regional development and international competition in the post-Fordist age. </jats:p>",
