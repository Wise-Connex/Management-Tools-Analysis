Feminist approaches to ethics share several commonalities, including an emphasis on care and empathy rather than rights and justice, and a balance between freedom and responsibility. Six approaches tofeminist ethics are critically analyzed here. The common themes are then applied to those areas of planning most amenable to ethical analysis: normative planning theory, planning techniques, administrative role definition, plan making, and professional ethics in everyday decision-making. </jats:p>",

Urban theorists have addressed the cyclical land-usetransportation relationship for many decades and economists have modeled it extensively. Field studies demonstrate what the economists have predicted and what many theorists have feared: that, in many ways, highways shape urban areas. Yet little of that knowledge has found its way into planning practice, and land-use planning and transportation planning remain separate decision-making processes. Now that Congress has mandated that transportation planners consider both land-use plans and the land-use impacts of their decisions, the literature of planning practice should draw on the theoretical and research literature and provide guidance to planners on how to manage the transportation-land-use cycle. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Automated Planning has been an active research topic for more than thirty years, but only recently has it started to move in the direction of combining planning and execution to achieve what is sometimes called Intelligent Reactive Planning. We propose Simutation-Based planning as a new way to perform intelligent reactive planning. Simulation-Based planning—unlike most other planning systems—integrates simulation into the planning process. Once a set of plans is generated, simulations are used to test and evaluate the plans to choose the most applicable plan for that current situation. In most planning systems, plan evaluation depends on rules alone, and because rules must be designed general enough to cover all possible cases, the evaluation is not specific enough for some individual cases. However, when the plan evaluation is done through simulations, the evaluation can be more fine-tuned to individual cases and can allow better plans to be chosen for that individual case. From the military planning perspective, the simulation-based planner is also quite useful due to its ability to perform adversarial and multi-agent planning. This is a natural consequence of using simulation in the planning process. By allowing other entities such as the enemy to simulate in parallel with the planner's forces, the planner is able to observe, prior to the actual execution, the effects of adversarial and multi-agent actions against its own plans. </jats:p>",

Nachdem Zahl und Größe der fiskalischen Einheiten der EU exogen gegeben sind, verkörpern die Parameter Finanzkraft, Finanzbedarf und Ausgleichsintensität sowie die horizontalen und vertikalen Ausgleichsgrade die entscheidenden Determinanten eines europäischen Ausgleichssystems. Um mit einem Finanzausgleich im engsten Sinn die finanzschwachen EU-Länder auf ein durchschnittliches Niveau an Finanzkraft zu heben, wären beispielsweise für das Jahr 1991 etwa 435 Mrd. DM an (Finanz‑)Ausgleichsmasse erforderlich gewesen, also ein deutlich höherer Betrag als die rund 100 Mrd. DM, die durch das EU-Budget zur Verfügung standen.

Although they can easily be discovered in the United States, confining attention to Japan omits new regional forms brought about by economic integration in Pacific Asia. After examining the driving forces behind regional economic integration—rival firms, rival states, and supranational organisations—interest is focused on the ‘Japan Corridor’ and emerging zones of economic cooperation in the Yellow Sea and South China Sea as the building blocks of an East Asian development corridor. The rudiments of a Southeast Asian corridor are also examined by centring attention on the ‘Growth Triangle’ (Singapore-Johor-Riau), the ‘Northern Triangle’ (northern Malaysia-southern Thailand-northern Sumatra), and other manifestations of regional economic cooperation. More speculative discussion considers how a Pacific Asian corridor could emerge from further zones of economic cooperation in both Indochina and the Japan Sea. Its pivot could be the Hong Kong-Shanghai-Taipei triangle—a reflection of the likely emergence of a greater Chinese economic grouping. </jats:p>",

A systematic approach for modeling and base; motion control of a mobile vehicle is presented. A nonlinear coordinate transformation that takes into account the complete dynamics with nonholonomic constraints is used in order to obtain a linear system in space coordinates. An input-output feedback linearization inner loop is subsequently designed to transform this system into a linear-point mass system in the coordinates corresponding to the control objectives. A rigorous yet simple approach to motion planning through optimization techniques is presented for these mobile vehicles. The resulting Cartesian trajectory generated from the motion planning algorithm is employed as the reference trajectory in the outer loop, which is designed based on a Lyapunov function candidate. The net result is a base motion controller that gives capabilities to these mobile vehicles not only for tracking a Cartesian trajectory but also to achieve a desired final orientation (docking angle).</jats:p>",

Specifically, there is a short period in which decisions with respect both to family changes and to house purchase occur. In this paper the authors extend that work and elaborate the findings by directly incorporating a measure of family composition change and analyzing its ‘triggering effect’ on the tenure change, and by enlarging the temporal and regional context analysis. Shifts from couples to families and increases in income trigger moves to ownership. Also, there are interaction effects between the regional contexts and time periods. A notable finding is that the economic climate affects some groups of households more than others. From the 1980s on, low-income households and one-earner families have been seriously affected in their ability to enter the homeowner housing market. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been the subject of much controversy during the twenty or so years since its establishment—much more controversy than other agencies created at around the same time. Descriptions of the EPA's failures often focus upon the inherent faults in its structure and on the statutes it was asked to administer. One point almost completely ignored is the fact that, unlike other agencies of the ‘rights revolution’, the EPA has been asked to protect an entity not yet truly recognized as a right. Although the EPA was a product of the ‘rights revolution’, it was not a rights-based agency, and was probably never intended to be so. This helps to explain why it has failed to meet its statutory mandates-all three branches of government have been able to minimize the effects of environmental regulation without ever having to consider fully the environmental rights of the citizenry. The National Environmental Policy Act provided the citizenry with the assurance that environmental interests would be considered within the governmental and bureaucratic decisionmaking process, but this was no guarantee of rights. In this paper it is suggested that without any recognition of true environmental rights it will always be possible for pro-development interests to reduce the obligations and effects of environmental protection legislation upon industry. </jats:p>",

Angiographic, CT and MRI images are generated and the target coordinates calculated in 3 dimensions. For CT scanning, cross sections of perpendicular and oblique fiducial markers are seen. For follow-up CT scans done without the frame, a virtual frame is generated by means of a computer program that places fiducial markers on each CT scan cut, as if the patient had been wearing the OBT frame and the scan produced with the gantry parallel to the base of the frame. The position of the oblique marker may be calculated by knowing the thickness and position of each CT cut. Various natural fiducial markers (bony landmarks) are identified by coordinates in the scan with the patient wearing the real frame and in the scan with the virtual frame applied. A transformation matrix is utilized to establish the equivalence between the original CT scan with the real frame applied and subsequent scans without the real frame but with the virtual frame applied. In effect, the virtual frame is re-applied in exactly the same position as the real frame. Lesion measurements may then be duplicated and growth or regression accurately established. The uncertainty in this system of re-application resides in possible patient movement, CT scan slice thickness and inter-observer error in the identification of natural fiducial markers.</jats:p>",

However, the number of skilled workers is declining rapidly and in recent years this has become a serious problem in shipyards. To solve the problem, the authors in an earlier report proposed a method to make the decisions based on theoretical analyses focused on inherent strain. The potential usefulness of the method was demonstrated through example problems dealing with mathematical ideal geometry. In the present report, a comparison is made between theoretical predictions and actual shipyard practice in forming curved members of a ship hull, and an attempt is made to visualize the knowledge of skilled workers, which heretofore was invisible, using computer graphic images showing inherent strain. Further, it is demonstrated that the same idea can be applied not only to make decisions on the line heating process but also to design the total plate bending process, including decisions on using the bending roller and the press machine.</jats:p>",
