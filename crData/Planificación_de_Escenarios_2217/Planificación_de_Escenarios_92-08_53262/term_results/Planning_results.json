The problem with this disparity is that organic spatial theory appears so flexible as to be meaningless. This in turn undermines its authority as a basis for setting reliable planning standards and its usefulness as a basis for practical action. This article describes the major concepts of organic philosophy and organic planning theory. It then investigates, compares, and contrasts eleven American theorists in order to find the causes of the wide variety. It concludes with a summary interpretation of these causes and introduces options for changing the situation. </jats:p>",

It is a growing problem, spreadingfrom our urban centers to ourexurban landscape. It is also a complex problem, both in origin and solution. Since the late 1970s there has been a surge of media coverage, research, legislation, and litigation regarding homelessness. Much of the research has been done by planners and planning academics. The planning literature on homelessnessfrom the 1980s has set the stage for the research, literature, and public policy concerning homelessness in the 1990s. This artide reviews the major early planning reports and the planning literature in terms of the definition of homelessness, its causes, and the short- and long-term solutions to it. Included are discussions about the politicization of the homeless count and the 1990 census. Undeveloped areas of planning research on homelessness are also presented. </jats:p>",

Then various structural piece-parts are described to the system and the system identifies the required production processes for each described part. The inference process underlying the identification of these processes is described for each of these parts.

In this paper, we address the problem of deciding where, when and how much transmission capacity should be installed, over a multiperiod horizon, to meet increasing traffic requirements at minimum total discounted cost, while maintaining acceptable performance levels. The model allows traffic among existing nodes to increase, new nodes to be added to the network, and its topology to change, over time. It is formulated as an integer programming problem, and a Lagrangian relaxation based solution method is proposed. Capacity and routing decisions are made jointly over time in our multiperiod model. Furthermore, our method automatically provides numerical verification of solution quality through the Lagrangian lower bound. Computational experiments with several networks show that the method yields verifiably good solutions to this combinatorially explosive problem. </jats:p>",

These contrasting patterns of organization reflect the hybrid structure of the local economy, and political conflicts in the region highlight divergent understandings of the proper forms of governance for a flexible regional economy.

The combination of these factors then influences the choice of discharge option. The present study attempted to validate and extend the model using actual cases in a retrospective chart review. The four variables of the original model correctly classified 68% of patients by discharge type and accounted for 29% of the variance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of policing have been dominated by two types of approach: those that are focused on the minutiae of routine police work and those that are concerned with the sociolegal contexts of policing. In this paper an attempt is made to connect these two approaches by the development of a contextual understanding of police work. The author's own and other ethnographic police research in the United Kingdom are woven together to examine the time-space sequences and settings of local, routine police action. In the first part of the paper, Hägerstrand's time geography is used to explore the time-space sequences of policing, highlighting the impacts of capability, coupling, and steering ‘constraints’. These constraints indicate the importance of the organisation of police work, the role of the community, and the impact of the law on the practice of policing. An important limitation of time geography, however, is its failure to scrutinise the settings of social interaction. In the second part of the paper this weakness is addressed by employing the concepts of locale and place in order to examine the time-space settings of policing, with examples to show the subtle but important differences between these concepts. </jats:p>",

In this paper the historical contexts within which home and homelessness have been defined in the United States are traced, and the degree to which they are conceptually and functionally connected is shown, It is argued that we must examine the basic premises embedded in the home ideal, because this ideal is used as the standard against which homelessness is observed and treated. At root, the home ideal is found to be exclusive, arbitrary, ambiguous, and open to manipulation. Hence, contemporary homelessness must be understood within the culturally guided and historically contingent contexts that home and homelessness have been defined in the United States. </jats:p>",

This examined a range of options for the rail network and rail links including light rail.

The successful consortium (GEC-Alsthom, Mowlem, AMEC) were selected to design and build the system and to operate and maintain it for 15 years. Private funding for the operating rights for 15 years. This came in the form of a payment they made process required further extensive evaluation work and at the final stages a change in the criteria for government grant required yet another appraisal to be carried out before the public sector funding was finally agreed. </jats:p>",

Few attempts, however, have been made to analyse, within a theoretical framework, the geographically uneven development of privatisation policies both within, and between, regions and nation-states. This paper is an examination of the uneven growth between regional hospital authorities in the private contracting of public hospital ancillary services in New Zealand. A significant, if somewhat surprising, finding is that, after a surge in privatisation in the early 1980s, the process has virtually stagnated in the last few years. Possible reasons for this, and the more general spatial uneven development of this form of privatisation, are advanced and, on the basis of this study, some avenues for further research are indicated.</jats:p>",

A comparison is made between the ‘popular’ definition and one which was arrived at during the research project. This latter mode of conceptualisation follows a broadly critical-realist approach, and we draw out the causal powers which are associated with the definition. This enables a different form of policy-evaluation from the usual empirical assessment of ‘outcomes’. The discussion of this particular case also allows a number of other reflections on the debate around the realist approach to research. </jats:p>",

By distinguishing travel-time costs or distances it is shown that both supply and demand within local markets strongly influence admissions in a way which cannot be observed on aggregated levels: the tension between supply and demand is cushioned by a strong redistribution of patients.

Since the implementation of HASPP is inherently application-specific due to dependence on heuristics, the application of HASPP to an eight degree of freedom Pipe Manipulator is presented as an illustrative example. This development and simulation was implemented on a Silicon Graphics Personal IRIS with the aid of WALKTHRU, a 3-D simulation and animation tool, and software developed in C. HASPP uses extensive knowledge of the manipulator’s workspace and makes certain assumptions about the environment in finding trajectories. The algorithm also makes use of the manipulator’s redundant degrees of freedom to avoid obstacles and joint limits during the trajectory while obtaining a heuristic near-optimal solution. The algorithm is rule-based, governed by heuristics and well-defined geometric tests, providing extremely fast results. It finds “good” trajectories that are optimal within the defined heuristics. When a trajectory is not feasible for the given geometry, the algorithm offers a diagnosis of the limiting constraints.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Pipe Manipulator HASPP implementation has been tested thoroughly with the computer graphics model and it has demonstrated the ability to reliably determine near-optimal collision-free erection trajectories completely automatically.

The use of HASPP with simulation offers many application opportunities including plant design constructability studies, assembly and maintenance planning, pre-planning and pre-programming of equipment tasks, and equipment operator assistance.

The example used is the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu's Disaster Guideline, which was mitten without direct external input. An examination of the history of Vanuatu and the Presbyterian Church of Vanuatu points to the cultural significance of symbols. It is argued that rather than promoting self-reliance, disaster planning has fostered a dependency relationship between donors and recipients in the Pacific Islands, albeit in a different form than during the period of colonial domination. The tendency to impose first World disaster planning strategies without significant regard for indigenous cultures has led to counter-disaster products, such as disaster plans, being regarded more as symbols than as practical tools. It is argued that in order for disaster planning to become more than just symbolic, donors and their disaster managers must be prepared to adapt their programs to local conditions. involve the indigenous people in all steps of disaster planning and commit themselves to long term programs. </jats:p>",

The measured concentrations were compared with those calculated by a simulation model. This modeling was based on the processes that control the transport and fate of pesticide within the soil. The usefulness of such a tool was demonstrated by the good approximation obtained for pesticide concentrations and arrival times. Moreover, the significant spatial variability of concentrations observed justifies the use of a stochastic approach in modeling that takes into account the spatial variability of soil parameters.

The task is achieved through an integrated CAD-CAPP-CAFP# environment. The system consists of three major modules, namely, Feature Analyzer, Process Planner and Fixture Planner. The manufacturing information of a part required for process and fixture planning is extracted from the 3-D geometric model and the 2-D engineering drawing, thereby both geometric and non-geometric attributes of a part can be obtained. An integrated approach to process and fixture planning is adopted to ensure that the process plan for a part is generated on the basis of a workable fixture plan. The approaches to feature analysis and to integrating process and fixture planning are introduced.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Rapid change, reduced funding, ‘value for money’, a need to justify and re-examine functions, market orientation, and revenue generation are factors affecting most libraries today. Strategic planning tackles them as a whole. National libraries, as well as exhibiting much more variety than other types of library, differ from them in that they are more directly subject to government, have no clearly defined clientele, and have international as well as national responsibilities and therefore cannot act alone. These factors make planning more difficult but no less necessary. Audiences for a strategic plan are the government, other libraries, and the staff, who should be thoroughly involved in the process of planning, since much of the benefit is in developing strategic management attitudes and skills throughout the library. Business and marketing plans can form useful appendices. Annual operational plans are necessary to ensure that action follows. The help of an external ‘facilitator’ is often desirable. The experience of the National Library of Ireland, which has recently published a strategic plan, is used to illustrate the process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we propose a method for solving visibility-based terrain path planning problems for groups of vehicles using data parallel machines. The discussion focuses on path planning for two groups of vehicles so that they move in a bounding overwatch manner. Furthermore, the planned paths for the vehicles themselves are subject to intervisibility constraints, configuration constraints, and different terrain traversabilities due to variations in terrain type and slope. A spatial-temporal sampling approach is adopted to discretize the solution space and facilitate fast computation on a data parallel machine. One of the key computations in the planning is the region-to-region visibility analysis, which is computationally expensive but essential to the choice of subgoals to carry out reconnaissance activities. A parallel algorithm for this analysis is developed. By reducing the communication complexity, our algorithm achieves much faster running time than traditional methods. The algorithms are implemented on a Connection Machine CM-2, and the experimental results show that the planning system effectively generates good paths. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this, the last of three papers devoted to urban restructuring and its impact upon the built environment of an Australian city, the spatial focus narrows from the metropolitan region to an inner zone of Adelaide. This is the part of Adelaide that has gained most from the processes of residential reinvestment and gentrification over the last two decades. </jats:p><jats:p> The interest in the circulation of capital that has been maintained throughout the previous papers is explored more fully by measuring and evaluating investment activity in the renovation and redevelopment submarkets. The evidence presented on the organizational structure, levels of investment, and returns to investment within the two submarkets makes for a better-informed characterization of ‘property capital’. It also serves to make the accompanying role of public finance in the revitalization process much clearer. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, the interpretation of capital formation in the renovation and redevelopment submarkets suggests that all three tiers of government in Australia have been thoroughly implicated in the residential transformation of Inner Adelaide during the last two decades. Changes to the Commonwealth States Housing Agreement in 1973 released public funds for rehabilitating terrace housing in the City and inner suburbs, and the Hawke Government restructured taxation policy and the financial markets affecting investment in the home unit and town house submarket in the 1980s. Meanwhile the Dunstan administration in South Australia axed the freeway and high-rise-housing plans of the previous state government, and pressured City Hall to abandon its grandiose plans for commercializing the City's ‘square mile’. The residential development policies conceived in the mid-1970s as part of the replacement City of Adelaide Plan were emulated by other local government bodies in the nearby suburbs. Somewhat uncharacteristically, the state's public-housing agency gave a lead to project developers in the private sector by demonstrating what could be achieved in the submarket of inner-city-home units and town houses. </jats:p>",

Accessibility costs for HGVs by road are measured for 1980s Britain with special reference to the M25 London Orbital Motorway. Specific calculations are made for accessibility which include and exclude the road and are dependent on an exogenously derived route minimisation procedure. These are assumed to represent the postroad and preroad situations, respectively. The findings point to significant differences in the results depending on the method chosen.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Process planning is the function that converts an engineering design into a manufacturing plan. One of the problems in feature-based process planning is the sequencing of features. Features must be given an order for removal. This order, or sequence, is partially dependent on the geometric relationships between the features. If the geometric relationships between features are such that they dictate a particular sequence, the features are said to have an interaction. Identifying these interactions is an important first step in creating the process plan. An approach to solve this problem using constructive solid geometry operations and the Episodal Associative Memory (EAM) is demonstrated. The EAM is an associative memory that integrates dynamic memory organization and neural computing techniques. The geometric feature relationships can be represented by a pattern. This pattern captures very qualitative information about the geometric positions fo the features. The EAM can organize these patterns into groups of similar geometric relationships. A method for dealing with exceptions, and for retrieving and storing general machining problems associated with interacting features will be described. The system implemented is shown to correctly sequence several types of feature interactions.</jats:p>",
