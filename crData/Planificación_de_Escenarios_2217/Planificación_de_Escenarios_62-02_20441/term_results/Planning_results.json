The configuration, termed a decision box (db) network, is a generalization of the PERT network and allows alternative procedures for accomplishing research tasks to be considered. The probability of following each alternative is estimated, leading to a ranking, in terms of probability of occurrence, of the possible outcomes of the research program. The entropy of the process is calculated using classical information theory concepts Standard PERT techniques for time estimating and scheduling, superimposed upon the db network structure, complete the description of this research management tool. </jats:p>",
