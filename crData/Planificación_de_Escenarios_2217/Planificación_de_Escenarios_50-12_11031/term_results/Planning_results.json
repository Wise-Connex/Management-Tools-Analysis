Many departures from the commonly accepted type of design will be necessary if new baths are to conform with all the latest recognized standards. </jats:p><jats:p> Costs of several existing swimming-baths are listed and a study of these indicates that large sums of public money will be required for the erection of future baths. Such expense can only be justified if the result fully satisfies the needs of the community it is intended to serve. </jats:p><jats:p> The various aspects that must be considered in the design of a swimming-bath are dealt with, and particular attention is drawn to details, which, whilst seldom affecting initial cost, add greatly to the usefulness of the building. </jats:p><jats:p> Suitable lay-outs for future swimming-baths are shown in detail. </jats:p><jats:p> The installation of wave-making machinery is discussed, and mention is made of the performances of existing plant. Special features that must be incorporated in the construction of a wave-bath are listed. </jats:p><jats:p> The Paper concludes with a review of foreign swimming-baths, and attention is drawn to these establishments which have unusual features incorporated in their design. </jats:p>",
