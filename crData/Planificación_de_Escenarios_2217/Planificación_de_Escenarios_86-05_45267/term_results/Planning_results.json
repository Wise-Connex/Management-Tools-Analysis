Its aim is to expose the market situation, explain it and suggest courses of action which will lead to desired changes. It is a way of looking at a problem rather than a collection of specialist techniques and is strictly practical. Hence it can be used alongside other market research tools for the solution of marketing problems and can be applied to a wide range of business activities. Much of its development has been in the advertising field but it can also help in the formulation of production policy, solving packaging problems and marketing operations. It is examined here in all these contexts. The idea of motivation research, the reasons for its use and the techniques by which to apply it are discussed, as well as the pitfalls that are likely to occur. New and imaginary case studies are used throughout to illustrate points. A review of the subject literature is included.</jats:p>",

To obtain some data on the characteristics of the seabed on or in which the deposits occur, samples of seabed materials from the area of high cobalt manganese crust deposits in the Hawaiian EEZ were examined. The characteristics determined included, where appropriate, bathymetry, microtopography, and engineering properties of the deposit material, and substrate. These data were used to derive general ranges for thickness, roughness, and strength of the strata and from these ranges to determine feasible mining and processing scenarios. The results are still tentative, and insufficient for establishing a definite constitutive model. Nevertheless, there is an implication that these seabed materials are similar to cohesive soils or weak rocks. For the manganese crust tested in the laboratory, the derived cohesive strength was 2.9 MPa suggesting good ripability, and P wave velocity was 2.26 km/sec suggesting marginal ripability. Many more tests are required on additional samples to correlate the engineering properties measured in the laboratory with geophysical properties measured in situ by remote sensing, for which new tools are needed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Mining of hard-rock ore deposits beyond the shoreline has been generally limited to traditional underground mining systems developed from vertical or inclined shafts, collared on land or nearshore islands. In exceptional cases in shallow water, open pit mining methods have been used working from floating platforms with conventional tools (Fig. 1) or by isolating the deposits with coffer dams and working them dry. (Fig. 2) However, in the last 20 years, significant discoveries have been made of hard-rock deposits in the deep seabed for which no operating precedents are available. Those deposits which appear to have potential for exploration at this time are hydrothermal metalliferous sulfides and cobalt-rich manganese oxide crusts. The sulfide deposits of which over 30 have been discovered to date, occur at water depths between 2000 and 3500 meters in the form of surficial coalesced stacks, cemented breccia mounds or as stockwork veins which, if they are analogous to similar deposits found on land, may be expressions of deeper vein or massive sulfide ore bodies (Fig 3). Composition of the sulfides varies at each site and may include one or more of the metals Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Fe, Mo. Cr, Ba, Sr, Ag, or Au. Manganese crusts, which were first located on the Blake Plateau off the South Eastern United States, were more recently recognized in the Pacific Ocean where they appear to occur preferentially at depths between 800 and 2400 meters, coating the submerged slopes of islands and seamounts and the tops of guyots. The crusts form on rock substrate of basalt, hyaloclastite, carbonate or phosphoritic material as layers of predominantly iron-manganese oxides which vary in thickness from mere discolorations to as much as 30 centimeters, but usually between 3-5 cm (fig. 4).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the array of complex numbers is then computed. Only the 50 lowest frequency components of the DFT are retained. Each contour is then represented by these 50 complex numbers, known as Fourier descriptors. The original contour is restored by performing the inverse Fourier transform. All the frequency components higher than 50 are assumed to be zero during the inverse Fourier transform. The algorithm is described in detail.</jats:p>",

Analysis based on new methodology shows that the intercept and education effects vary as a function of national family planning program efforts and that none of the parameters of the equation depend on gross national product per capita.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Material requirements planning (MRP) is a planning and information system that has widespread application in discrete‐parts manufacturing. The purpose of this article is to introduce ideas that can improve the flow of material through complex manufacturing systems operating under MRP, and that can increase the applicability of MRP within diverse manufacturing environments.</jats:p><jats:p>MRP models the flow of material by assuming that items flow from work station to work station in the same batches that are used in production. That is, once work starts on a batch of a certain item at a certain work station, the entire batch will be produced before any part of the batch will be transported to the next work station on its routing plan. Clearly, efficiency can be increased if some parallelism can be introduced. The form of parallelism investigated here is overlapping operations.</jats:p><jats:p>Overlapping operations occurs when the transportation of partial batches to a downstream work station is allowed while work proceeds to complete the batch at the upstream work station. The potential efficiencies to be gained are the following:\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Reduced total lead time</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Reduced work‐in‐process inventory</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Reduced floor space requirements</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Reduced size of transfer vehicles</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>Additional costs may accrue through additional cost of transportation of partial batches and through additional costs of control.</jats:p><jats:p>Some MRP software vendors provide the data processing capability for overlapping operations. However, the user is given little or no guidance on overlapping percentages or amounts. It is our intent to provide a simple, robust technique to MRP users who would like to overlap operations and gain some or all of the above efficiencies.</jats:p><jats:p>An optimal lot‐sizing technique is derived by considering a generic two work station segment of a manufacturing system. Under the assumptions of constant demand and identical production rates, a cost function that considers setup costs, inventory holding costs and transportation costs is derived. This cost function is minimized subject to the constraint that the production batch is an integer multiple of the transfer batch. We solve for the optimal production batch, the optimal transfer batch, and the integer number relating them. Solutions are obtained as closed form, easy to‐evaluate formulas.</jats:p><jats:p>By introducing more parallelism, overlapping operations can reduce lead time. However, this will not happen without modification of MRP logic to accommodate such reduced lead time. We derive a formula that shows how a significant lead time compression can easily be obtained and implemented in MRP.</jats:p><jats:p>We consider an example to illustrate the application of the technique on typical data from the electronics industry. The outcome showed a cost savings of approximately 22.5% over the standard MRP approach.</jats:p><jats:p>Overlapping operations allows the applicability of MRP to an increasing number of situations that are not modeled faithfully by conventional MRP logic. Three such situations that occur often are the following:\n<jats:list list-type=\"bullet\">\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Limited floor space prohibits storage of production batches in work station output buffers.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Limited size of transfer vehicles dictate that several transfers should be planned.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Lead time requirements prohibit nonoverlapped operations.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>Our analysis suggests how to accommodate these difficult practical situations into MRP.</jats:p><jats:p>Overlapping operations in material requirements planning provides an enhancement that allows wider applicability, shortened lead times, and lower total costs. It may be applied selectively to any two work stations where it is deemed appropriate. Due to the structure of the cost function, it is possible to make the transfer lot‐sizing decisions independent of the production lot‐sizing decisions. Therefore, significant improvements can be made through overlapping with minimum disruption to the existing MRP system machinery. It is our conviction that overlapping operations is an important concept that can and will impact MRP. We suggest the approach presented here as a systematic way to implement overlapping.</jats:p>",

In this paper, one particular spatial model used for analysing impact on patient flows, catchment populations, and other key variables resulting from changes in supply, demand, or accessibility is examined in depth. Used in several countries for planning purposes, the model was originally developed in 1979 by the Operational Research Service of the Department of Health and Social Security in the United Kingdom, for the London Health Planning Consortium. It was later refined at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria. In the present study the robustness of prediction is tested on four versions of the basic model developed at the University of Newcastle, Australia, in 1984 and applied to data from the Sydney Metropolitan Region. Key outputs from the model are examined and the extent to which it correctly predicts changes in service levels over a three-year period in the case of five different acute clinical specialties is shown. To conclude the paper, the technical details of case-mix model are presented, which combines different acute service categories with the spatial dimension to provide a more comprehensive framework for predicting and analysing the behaviour of, and interactions between, supply and demand. </jats:p>",

It was found that satisfactory results for determining the relative output factor can be obtained from film data using a scanning densitometer.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Falling school rolls have necessitated the widespread revision öf school catchment areas. It is argued that an appropriate technique for solving this problem is weighted goal programming. A study of Reading has shown that this technique is feasible and can produce results that dominate those produced by the ad hoc methods of the local education authority. Since goal programming is a very flexible technique, various ways of developing this approach to designing catchment areas are considered. Among these developments are the inclusion of additional goals (such as safety, parental choice, and compactness), goal interaction, allowance for the effects of parental choice, multiperiod models incorporating school closures, and the allocation of entire primary schools. The effects of the redefinition of the decision variable to require the joint allocation of the boys and girls at the same primary school are investigated using data for Reading. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article proposes a reformulation of the aggregate planning problem which more closely agrees with situations frequently encountered in practice. The proposed reformulation assumes that a firm's production planners want to determine the expected service and inventory levels for a given production profile in the face of uncertain seasonal demand. By using several different production profiles that are each consistent with the firm's staffing, subcontracting, and overtime policies, it is possible to pick the profile that best meets the firm's preferences for service level and inventory turns. Actually, the trade‐offs between inventory and service levels are examined so that an informed choice can be made by all of those concerned.</jats:p><jats:p>One of the advantages of the proposed model is that communications can be established among production, marketing, and finance managers who often have conflicting goals. Also, levels for inventory turns, service, and production can be set that are consistent with each other. Furthermore, several alternative production profiles can be examined in a relatively short time through the use of the simulation model proposed.</jats:p><jats:p>An application of the model to the Wagner Spray Tech Company, a producer of painting equipment, is presented. In this particular case, where forecasting errors are quite high, some of the potential uses of the model are presented. Also, reasons are given why this particular reformulation of the aggregate planning problem was found to be useful.</jats:p>",

In this review article the development of that attitude is traced and linked to the reliance on survey data. Works on the 1983 General Election are reviewed to show how the influence of place is far from fully integrated with most explanatory accounts. It is necessary, it is argued, for British psephologists to become aware of recent developments in social theory and the attempts to produce a holistic social science in which place has a central position. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since 1979 the main housing policy aim of the Conservative Government in Britain has been to privatise the ownership of housing. The housing programme has included policies to increase the supply and demand for low-cost homeownership and to increase the supply of privated rented housing. The aim of this and three subsequent papers is to describe these programmes and to evaluate their impact. In this, the first paper, it is shown how the Government's attitude to housing differs markedly from that of its predecessors and a description is given of the way the low-cost ownership and private renting programmes fit into the Government's privatisation ideology. The paper continues with a description of each of the initiatives of the low-cost homeownership programme. The next two papers are an examination of the number of sales involved and they draw on published research to evaluate the impact of the sales. It is concluded that, with the exception of the sales of public rented housing, low-cost sales have been limited, but that those who have bought have reaped benefits during a period when other housing and economic policies militated against homeownership. Not all buyers receiving the extra subsidies involved in the programme were in priority social or housing need groups. There is doubt whether the houses involved will be permanently low cost. There is also doubt if the growth of homeownership amongst low-income groups can be unproblematic in relation to their housing and living standards, problems which need state support to be resolved. The fourth paper in the series is an examination of the initiatives in respect of private renting and it is concluded that these, too, had little impact because they were largely irrelevant to the fundamental difficulties facing landlords and tenants. The four papers in this series appear in sequence in successive issues of this journal. Together they show that privatisation policies cannot be achieved without continuing state support and intervention in the form of subsidies and regulation. </jats:p>",
