      "abstract": "<jats:p> A welfare-theory-based framework for the evaluation of urban transportation investments is described. An economic efficiency criterion is developed in terms of the community demand schedules for accessibility and for environmental quality. A procedure for modifying this efficiency criterion to reflect income distribution goals is presented. It is argued that the necessary empirical information for this evaluation framework must be derived from the application of some consistent theory of democratic group decisions. A number of models of the political process are then reviewed. Recent experience with several institutional frameworks for planning is discussed and some of the principles of the models are used to evaluate this experience. The contributions that available models of the political process might make to the extension of the welfare-based-evaluation framework are then explored. The elementary extensions presented in the paper provide a basis for studying the goal formulation and weighting processes in particular communities. Comparative studies in a number of urban communities should lead to the development of a meaningful institutional framework for urban transportation planning activities. </jats:p>",

But it is also pointed out that an initial sub-optimal solution can quickly be improved with a derivation on a direct line only, if the exact solution is not absolutely essential.

To illustrate this, equations are derived which give the number of different ways n counties may be grouped to form k regions, k ≤ n, in two limiting situations: the totally unconstrained case, in which each county may be grouped with any other county; and the maximally constrained case, when each county can only be grouped with its physically contiguous neighbours. A measure of the efficiency, co, of any regional grouping is given, and the problem of finding the regional grouping with the ‘best’ value of co in the set of alternative grouping patterns is discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A method to evaluate the estimated social benefits and costs of many urban transportation decisions is presented, based on the techniques of statistical hypothesis testing. After a slight critique of current practice in cost-benefit analyses, a general equilibrium model is formulated that includes many of the relevant variables and decisions which interact with an urban transportation system. The model is based on individual behavior assumptions (as opposed to macro-behavior) and uses the concept that commodities provide attributes. The significant omissions are mentioned and discussed. It is next shown that if the model is true, then hypotheses involving the Pareto-superiority (and Pareto-optimality) of various decisions with respect to transportation systems imply hypotheses restricting the values of parameters of a single linear equation. This allows the testing (i.e. falsification) of the original hypotheses by using the familiar T and F tests of regression analysis. These tests are based on a single-equation regression only using observations on the rates of use of, the attributes provided by, and the inputs to, the transportation system. </jats:p><jats:p> The simplicity of the tests seems to indicate that revisions of the model towards reality would be very productive. </jats:p>",
