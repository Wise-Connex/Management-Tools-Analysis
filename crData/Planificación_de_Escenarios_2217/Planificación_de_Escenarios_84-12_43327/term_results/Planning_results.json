      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many contemporary planning theories share a pragmatic conception of action which does not adequately account for questions of power After a brief illustration of this limitation, the historical and structural criticisms of recent Marxist theories are analyzed It is argued that since both Mainstream and Marxist theories of planning both use the consequences of action as the ultimate test of theoretical validity, they tend to overemphasize their different interpretation of power as mutually exclusive The paper examines the work of four contemporary theorists the author calls Radical Pragmatists whose writings undermine this antagonism by introducing critical insights that broaden the meaning of what counts as action The result is a concept of power that critically combines our experience of what it means to choose, our knowledge of what it means to communicate without distortion, and our expectation of what it means to govern ourselves democratically </jats:p>",

In contrast to what has been suggested by the literature, the elderly were just as likely to move in response to severe housing and neighborhood problems as were younger families There were, however, differences in the determinants of mobility between the two age groups Whereas age, suburban location, and living in an older home led to mobility among the elderly, the same factors promoted staying among the younger The policy implications of these differences are discussed </jats:p>",

A renovation project prepared in 1902 for the imperial capital, Istanbul, reflected this attitude in the field of urban design and architecture. Its author was a prominent Beaux-Arts-trained Parisian architect, Joseph Antoine Bouvard. Bouvard's five large-sized watercolor drawings, now in the Istanbul University Library, depict his proposals for the Hippodrome, Beyazit Square, Valide Square, and the Galata Bridge. The Hippodrome is made a geometrically landscaped park; Beyazit Square is converted into a civic center; the new Valide Square duplicates the Trocadero scheme of the 1878 Paris International Exposition; and the design features of the 1900 Pont Alexandre III in Paris are adopted for the Galata Bridge. Largely disregarding the architectural heritage as well as the geographical characteristics of the capital, the architect proposed a major facelifting operation with the intention of turning Istanbul into the Paris of the East. Although the abstract nature of this project made its application impossible, the image, transmitted through Bouvard's masterful drawings, enjoyed a great deal of praise from Sultan Abdülhamit II and his entourage. This article analyzes Bouvard's avant-projet against the background of early-20th-century Istanbul's urban fabric.</jats:p>",

These languages differ from ordinary programming lan guages and from existing simulation languages in that they are much more English-like, produce spread sheet output, and have built-in WHAT IF and other capabilities for sensitivity analysis.

It presents a framework for assessing how the law is mobilised by the legal customer. This mobilisation includes the entire social process, from problem identification in legal terms (termed ‘framing’) to the consultation of lawyers and the use of the courts. It is demonstrated that mobilisation in this sense is a much more common social process than litigation and that between the two extremes of litigation and ‘framing’ there exists a substantial ‘funneling’ process. An assessment of the social aspects of this process is given, and some comparative results for Germany, in the context of a theory of litigation, are presented. </jats:p>",

Analysis of specific events and the patterns of local inflation in these three components reveals that food shocks and, to a lesser extent, energy price shocks have had relatively even spatial repercussions. However, it is also apparent that housing price inflation has varied considerably over space and time. Even so, it is still plausible that national price inflation is a fair approximation for local inflation. </jats:p>",

I seek to argue that, although the short-term effects of these pressures upon legal aid structures may well be very harmful, in the long term a number of benefits may accrue. I argue that there are three distinct ways in which legal services schemes can reap positive benefit from attack. First, cutbacks in legal aid provide a real-life framework in which to test the validity of the theoretical and political critique of the philosophy of legal aid put forward by legal sociologists over the past decade; second, the need for a delivery system to be justified in terms of cost has led to surprising results that indicate the cost-effectiveness of more radical delivery models; third, economic restraint within the radical fringe of legal aid activity has itself stimulated a creativity of approach, and a forging of original and effective alliances, that would have been less likely in a more financially stable framework. </jats:p>",

General conditions historically at work in most migrations may continue to operate and even be prevalent. The question is whether the internationalization that characterizes the current period contains additional conditions promoting migrations. Direct foreign investment is used as an indicator for internationalization. The focus is on investment for export manufacturing because (a) the main countries sending the new immigration to the USA are key locations for this growing type of direct foreign investment, (b) export production is a central feature in the economies of these immigrant-sending countries, and (c) being labor intensive, this type of investment has created significant numbers of jobs in the countries where it is concentrated and therefore should act as a deterrent to emigration. The key finding is that intervening processes, such as the feminization of the new proletariat and the disruption of traditional work structures, can contribute to transform a situation of high growth into one promoting emigration. </jats:p>",

The relevance, and, in cases, the adequacy, is discussed of existing theory for ‘making sense’ of specific empirical data on one item, or segment, of the built environment, namely, the specialised dwelling form of the bungalow, which, in both name and single-storey form, as vacation house or suburban dwelling, has been introduced to many market economies around the world. After a brief consideration of the historical and cross-cultural approaches to the study of the built environment and its neglect in the new urban studies, a series of questions generated by the data and contextualised within specific theoretical spheres are addressed. These include: the relation of building form to economy, society, and culture; culture and the political economy of building form; the social production of specialised dwelling forms; the relationship between per capita income, tenure, and dwelling form, and between dwelling and settlement forms; urban and building form and the world system; counterurbanisation and the world economy; and the political economy of global urbanisation. It is concluded that, for the adequate conceptualisation of the built environment, the use of theory must be eclectic and prepared to draw on different disciplines. </jats:p>",

For the former, the issue has become increasingly politicized and a mood of restriction is in evidence. This mood, in turn, and the policies which it spawns, clashes with the interests of individuals and of state actors among the less-developed countries who seek to expand access to ‘desirable’ destinations among advanced industrial societies—in spite of mounting evidence that emigration, in its current forms, has only marginally positive developmental effects. </jats:p><jats:p> Also in this paper, international migration is placed in a theoretical context through a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of two major competing schools: The classical-liberal one and the Marxist-neo-Marxist one. It is concluded that for labor importers, resort to international migration has been a tentative economic success, though, increasingly, a social and political liability. Results are equally mixed for labor senders. Policy recommendations focus mostly on avenues through which the costs of the migration process can be contained while the benefits are enhanced. </jats:p>",

In particular, the arguments both for and against a proposal to locate the city's third general hospital at Freeman Road, in northeast Newcastle, are focused upon. Attention is drawn to divisions and divergences of opinion and strategy both within and between various branches of the state, and it is argued that any interpretation of state practice must be sensitive to such divisions and to the specific local circumstances in which state policies are articulated.

The relationship between the concept of ethnicity and Census questions on place of birth is traced. The country-of-birth statistics for Small Areas from the 1971 and 1981 Censuses are employed in an attempt to ascertain the influence of technical specifications on the measurement of the residential segregation of ethnic groups in order to distinguish real differences from apparent ones. The attempt is not fully successful, but it does provide clear pointers on how to proceed further in research on the ethnic spatial mosaics that our cities now are. </jats:p>",

In addition, the results support the view that multiplicative models perform slightly better than additive models in terms of capturing the way in which subjects integrate part-worth utilities into some overall measure of utility or evaluation. </jats:p>",

Though this recruitment discontinued in 1973, the immigration of family members has been allowed to continue ever since. Thus a large group of migrant workers and their families now live in the Federal Republic. As migrant workers they occupy a low rank in the social hierarchy of the German population. In the first part of this paper, the development is briefly sketched of official government policy concerning aliens at the federal and Länder (state) levels since 1973, with reference to the guidelines of the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union, the Free Democratic Party, and the Social Democratic Party. Then a short description is given of the current research on migrant workers in the FRG: What the expectations of politicians and administrators are with respect to such research; the main problem areas on which the research focuses; how experts view the demand for and the current state of the research; and, finally, in which areas the most important formulations of theory have been made in migration research. </jats:p>",

Development is represented as the diffusion of demographic transition, employment opportunities, and formal and communication channels, which in turn affect informal communications and the overall economic base. The simulation falls within the genre of neoclassical development models, but, unlike many, explicitly explores the long-run aspects of landscape evolution. Our outcomes generally conform with expectations hypothesized in earlier research, including phenomena such as polarization reversal, converging regional disparities, and low-level equilibrium traps at small remote places where continual resource drain thwarts the agglomeration economies necessary for sustained growth. We also find that the initial urban system configuration has little effect on the final configuration, and that only urban size diseconomies are likely to alter significantly the size, spatial distribution, and spatial characteristics of the urban system. </jats:p>",

Despite important political differences between these countries and between the political parties operating inside them, a broad consensus about the aims and, to a lesser extent, the delivery of legal services has emerged, which is closely allied to the political assumptions of the welfare state. The authors contend that the parameters of current political debates in relation to legal services have been narrowly circumscribed, with the result that fundamental policy choices existing beyond the legal aid consensus have rarely been confronted by policymakers. To understand future developments it is important to consider not only current policy agendas but also the wider environment within which policymakers must operate. The authors conclude by identifying those forces underlying the political and policy processes which may cause the legal aid consensus to collapse and so pave the way for new, not necessarily ideal, policies. In this context, the authors pay particular attention to the commitment to the welfare state, the market for legal services, the revolution in information technology, and legal research and education. </jats:p>",

The discussion has been exclusively devoted to what may be termed trip-end calibration procedures. This was largely the result of the available data sets and the focus on multivariate multiparametric attractiveness functions. Most other authors dealt with what may be called trip-interchange calibration. This article presents a comparison of the two calibration approaches. With the use of artificial data sets to avoid obfuscation of the results, a series of calibrations were done by both techniques on thirty randomly perturbed versions of the same data set. The results show that both calibration approaches yield the same parameter values but the variances of the estimates are greater for trip-end calibration than for trip-interchange calibration. Some implications for practical application are discussed, with particular reference to the problem of consistency of trip-end and trip-interchange data. </jats:p>",

Land‐use decisions are most often made upon water‐well yield data alone, but these data do not address the inventory question. A method utilizing local geology, stream lowflow characteristics, and pumping test data permitted outlining portions of Wake County, North Carolina, which are more favorable and those which are less favorable for ground water supply development. Information from state‐required 24‐hour pumping tests on 232 wells was supplemented by information from an additional 100 wells whose initial yields were determined by shorter pumping tests.</jats:p><jats:p>Comparison of the ground water inventory values on a per acre or per square mile basis with average water use at various residential densities provides information useful to the responsible political body as it decides about population density distribution and the need for surface water supplies. For Wake Country an average density of one residential unit per acre appears generally permissible before overdraft of the ground water supplies becomes a significant risk. By utilizing the ground water inventory and patterns of ground water yields from various rock types, county officials can maximize the effectiveness of public facilities funds.
