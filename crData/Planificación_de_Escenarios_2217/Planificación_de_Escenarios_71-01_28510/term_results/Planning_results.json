Planning is only now beginning to emerge from the status of being an art and to develop into some kind of science. We at the Institute have been in the corporate planning research business for some seven or eight years now, and the approach we take is constantly being modified and improved on. Our format is flexible. It is in reality a philosophy, a basis of logic, that underlies the physical tasks in the planning process, and these tasks vary with the individual company. A rigorous basis of logic is not a mechanical stifler of creativity; rather it is a means of capitalizing on it.</jats:p>",

Dr Taylor divides his book into three main sections: the first identifies the background and evolution of instructional simulation, the second examines urban development gaming's emerging importance and justification and the third reviews some of the issues that must be contemplated if the potential of gaming simulation techniques are to be fully realised. This was the first book to provide a comprehensive and authoritative review of the state of knowledge on instructional simulations relevant to urban problems. As such it will be of great interest and practical value to all those involved in urban studies and environmental planning.</jats:p>",

However, the rules of the game are changing, and the opportunities will be seized by those who can adjust rapidly.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In a world of mushrooming energy needs, this country and its petroleum industry are in crucial times. The international balance of supply and demand and our country's energy shortage call for critical decisions on a national level that will in turn guide the future actions of companies and individuals. This paper examines the guideposts of long-range planning 20 years ahead, and in doing so, injects large elements of judgment and conclusion. The complex future is viewed from a worldwide perspective and from that of the U. S., the petroleum industry, and an average oil company.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Worldwide</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Energy consumption is rapidly growing. The present rate will double by 1985, but fortunately the petroleum needed through that period and for years beyond petroleum needed through that period and for years beyond is either on hand or reasonably certain of discovery. Studies of geologically favorable areas around the world and their high potential confirm this conclusion. Those areas of greatest promise are Africa and the Far East, both unexplored relative to their onshore and offshore potential. Discoveries in Nigeria and Indonesia provide samplings of the larger areas that await exploration. Next in future importance is the Middle East, which already holds two-thirds of the known world oil reserve, and where the hydrocarbon potential remains high. Large concessions have yet to potential remains high. Large concessions have yet to be explored by new and improved seismic methods.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>North and South America will also contribute significantly. In summary, the world petroleum future is one of large and rising consumption with adequate supply.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The world's large petroleum reserve areas are widely separated from the points of maximum consumption and this dislocation will increase as newer reserves are found in more and more remote places. The North Sea discoveries are welcome exceptions to this worldwide trend. In the future, countries that are large consumers and that are net importers will become even more dependent upon those with excess supply, and will increasingly rely upon large-volume, low-cost, long-distance transportation to bring the petroleum to market. Countries with excess supply, petroleum to market. Countries with excess supply, which even now have a political weapon against energy-short nations such as the U. S. and most countries of Europe, will find that their bargaining positions will improve. However, their influence will positions will improve. However, their influence will be limited by the over-all ample supply, since each country with petroleum to sell will be competing in a worldwide buyer's market. Of great interest on the international scene will be the strategies used by energy-short nations to insure that their future supplies are in friendly hands and available when needed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 13</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Correctional research can be classified into five categories: (1) research describing the personal characteristics of offenders; (2) records-keeping and information systems; (3) controlled experimentation; (4) organi zational research; and (5) research aimed at effecting planned change . After reviewing the relationships between each type of research and actual correctional practices, the paper concludes that none has been successful in changing the underlying struc ture of correction and that correctional research has had the latent function of perpetuating the existing system. Nevertheless, research aimed at effecting planned change is providing admin istrators and researchers with valuable experience and thus , of the various types of research, offers the best hope of bringing about needed change. </jats:p>",

The planning model is a key element in an integrated computer‐based planning system which includes a forecast of economic, monetary, and loan market conditions, an analysis of internal relationships, and a system of reports which provide management with access to historical data and planning summaries.</jats:p><jats:p>The planning model at the heart of the system, contains an imbedded linear programming algorithm to optimize “balance sheet management” decisions within liquidity and capital adequacy constraints. The model recognizes the interaction between assets and liabilities, it recognizes the time value of money, and it accommodates the difference between the net marginal yield for decision making, and the gross average yield used for determining revenue. Finally, the model recognizes the crucial role of liquidity with an important treatment of gross cash flows from normal asset turnover as a major source of liquidity, and the liquidity aspects of liabilities, as well as the more traditional concept of asset marketability.</jats:p>",

Successful planning is thus heavily dependent on the reliability of prediction which lea &amp; inevitably to the domain of probability theory and its application to planning models. In spite of the considerable attention given to the application of mathematical models in farm management research work in recent times<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup> to<jats:sup>(9)</jats:sup> and <jats:sup>(15)</jats:sup> there is stilla paucity of applied work with respect to evaluating the nature of risk associated with planning projects at the individual farm level. In addition, very little published data is available on either a regional or production‐type basis that gives a clear understanding of the nature of probability distributions for planning variables. This paper formulates a simple model which can be used in practical planning exercises and also demonstrates that with a new generation of statistically‐processed planning data the application of the classical concepts of probability to routine economic planning is both practicable and worthwhile.</jats:p>",

After 22 years of the National Health Service in Britain, there has been little change in the old inequalities in the distribution of health resources, hospital beds, manpower, and the budget to finance these. A critical examination of these failures suggests the complex difficulties in trying to implement theoretical planning. The changes in medicine from being a professional art to a technical science have been too big and too fast. The very successes of these new advances often lead to survival on maintenance therapy or to an even more critical and expensive relapse to a larger geriatric burden. With little pay-off or benefit in chronic disease, the limited resources are over-strained in even the most affluent countries, but neither the profession nor the public is willing to face the decision of which age sector of the population to neglect. At the same time, most clinical decisions involve the use of a limited resource so every clinician is a manager. Rather than be disappointed in the lack of implementation of the planning process, it has a useful purpose as a declaration of intent and in creating a forum for discussion. For most countries this is the beginning of the beginning in the effective administration of medical care. </jats:p>",
