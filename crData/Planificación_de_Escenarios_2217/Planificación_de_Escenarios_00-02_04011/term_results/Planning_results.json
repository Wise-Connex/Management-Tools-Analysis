      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article reviews the literature on urban planning in China. The literature has traditionally viewed urban planning in terms of changing styles over time. It was found wanting both methodologically and theoretically. Methodologically, it has failed to situate the various styles of governmental practices. Theoretically, the socialist state has been uniformly conceptualized as homogeneous and monolithic. This has led to the adoption of a technorational concept of urban planning, which, in turn, has privileged the instrumental nature of urban planning knowledge. Finally, the literature has conveyed the myth that urban planing is a distinctive profession. In conclusion, the article suggests that all the above problems of the literature can be improved by adopting Foucault’s concept of governmentality, which means that urban planning in China must be situated in political rationality and understood as a technology of government.</jats:p>",

This article presents an overview of the dilemma from a city and regional planning perspective. It begins with a brief summary of basic planning theory, followed by a more detailed description of specific theories of revitalization, as well as a discussion of four of the most important forces of structural racism that confront inner cities. The article closes with a discussion of those approaches that have shown some promise and with suggestions for potential new approaches that will promote successful inner-city revitalization and reduce the isolation and deprivation of racial minorities inhabiting America’s cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Heuristic concentration (HC) is a metaheuristic for the solution of certain combinatorial problems. In stage one, a concentration set (CS), consisting of nodes likely to be in the optimal solution, is developed by multiple runs of an interchange heuristic. In stage two, a good, usually optimal, solution is constructed by selecting the best nodes from the CS. The CS is effective when it is small but comprehensive. Both of these characteristics depend upon: (1) the robustness of the heuristic; (2) the number of times it is run, q; and (3) the number of “best” solutions used to create the CS, m. Stage two is thus totally dependent upon the efficiency of stage one for the improved, and at least potentially optimal, solution. Proper values for the parameters m and q increase the probability of selecting correct elements to construct the optimal solution in stage two and to decrease the work in its identification. After a consideration of the robustness of two alternative interchange heuristics I will concentrate on the appropriate values for the parameters m and q. This is an empirical examination and the p-median problem is used throughout. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this database is to support policymaking for the conservation of fossil fuels and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The fact that the VO data cover floor areas, activities, building construction, and building services—all of which are liable to affect the use of fuels in buildings—make them specially valuable for this application. Several tables and charts derived from the VO data are presented, containing statistics on the nondomestic building stock of England and Wales. A review is then given of the very considerable research potential of such a large administrative data source as the VO databases. Some of the problems that arise in the use of those data are examined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In most parts of Europe compact city policies have become a popular means of planning for sustainability. Dense compact cities were seen as solutions to reduce continually increasing mobility. They were also seen as a way to avoid urbanization of the countryside. Lately planners have been expressing serious doubts about the impact of these positive effects of the compact city concept. Planners in the Netherlands are instead shifting their attention more to environmental dilemmas which result, in part, from compact city policies. A number of these dilemmas are caused by frictions between environmentally sensitive and environmentally intrusive functions in a compact urban setting. Traditionally these dilemmas or conflicts were taken care of by using a functional rationality approach, that is one emphasizing direct causal relations between cause and effect. In the Netherlands this has resulted in a top-down policy, urging local authorities to keep enough distance between conflicting functions. Unfortunately the compact city concept adds an extra dimension to the problem, favouring mixed use and a dense urban area. Keeping distance can therefore no longer be the primary solution to environmental conflicts in urban areas. Environment conflicts have become, so to speak, more complex owing to spatial pressure and to a growing number of different interests that have to be taken into account. Functional rationality approaches may no longer be sufficient to solve these complex dilemmas or conflicts. Rather than keeping distance as the only possible solution to deal with conflicting functions, in the Netherlands local participation is also recognized as an effective approach towards some of the more complex conflicts. This communicative approach is gradually gaining acceptance in the Netherlands—and in other parts of the world as well—as a potential method for dealing with planning issues. In this paper functional and communicative rationality are seen as two extremes of the same spectrum, with complexity as the key word linking the two together. This has lead to the following thesis: the effectiveness and efficiency of a solution will depend on the assignment of the conflict's complexity. In this case, complexity is no longer seen as a metaphor, but instead as essential for examining planning issues, including environmental conflicts in compact cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Globalisation has become an almost ubiquitous term in academic debates, policy circles, and popular culture. In this paper we critically consider geography's characteristic form of engagement with the multifaceted features of globalisation discourses and realities. Globalisation provides an entry point for assertions of the conceptual and empirical importance of space, place, context, and locality. However, we argue that this form of engagement subordinates the central, and conceptually problematic, historicism of globalisation to a set of more manageable disciplinary concerns. We provide a critical discussion of the historicist dimensions of globalisation discourses, and indicate some of the ways in which critical accounts can reproduce this historicism. By raising this problem, we suggest that space and spatiality are not always or automatically the most significant entry point for conceptual critique and engagement. The case of globalisation therefore indicates some of the limits of established forms of interdisciplinary dialogue between critical human geography and related fields. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Marketing management presents challenging ground for the integrated use of intelligent agents. The design of a strategic marketing plan presents a natural division of four distinct yet independent decision problems. Concurrent execution of these four functions can yield a significant decrease in time‐to‐market for new products, and turnaround time for modified products. Electronic information is a two‐edged sword. On the one hand, it results in information overload, taxing the decision‐ making process. On the other hand, the electronic nature of these vast information flows makes them accessible to intelligent agents who can improve the decision‐making process. This paper presents the problem of information overload and decision‐making complexity in marketing management. In it, we present a blackboard‐based agent architecture that allows individual agents to proceed toward their given goals yet react opportunistically to developments reported by other marketing agents. We present the blackboard model of problem solving, and discuss why it is well suited to support multiple marketing agents. CMA, a multi‐agent model for concurrent marketing analysis, is discussed and the agent architecture required for creating a cooperating society of marketing agents is presented.</jats:p>",

First, I argue that the ‘real’ myth of the globalisation discourse is part of an intensifying ideological, political, socioeconomic, and cultural struggle over the organisation of society and the position of the citizen therein. Second, the ‘mythical’ resurrection of the ‘local’ or ‘regional’ scale—both in theory and in practice—is an integral part of the ‘myth’ of globalisation. Third, the preeminence of the ‘global’ in much of the literature and political rhetoric obfuscates, marginalises, and silences an intense and ongoing sociospatial struggle in which the reconfiguration of spatial scales of governance takes a central position. Fourth, the ‘rhetoric’ of globalisation is paralleled by and facilitates the emergence of more authoritarian or at least autocratic forms of governance. Fifth, the proliferation of new modes and forms of resistance to the restless process of deterritorialisation-reterritorialisation of capital requires greater attention to ‘spatial scale’ in order to assess how the emerging new ‘gestalt of scale’ could be turned into an emancipatory and empowering process. </jats:p>",

In this paper I try to bring Marx's insights on the “laws of motion” of modern capitalism to bear on prevailing global political-economic disorder. I discuss, more specifically, his theory of crisis and the dialectics of accumulation and circulation of “real” and “fictitious” capital as sketched out in the Grundrisse and Capital (volumes 1 and 3).

These data are used for shallow and intermediate exploration, analyses of seabed topography, geohazards assessments, understanding of complex structural and stratigraphic conditions, well planning, and field development.

Consumerism may extend service-user choice but can be tokenistic for dependent clients and claimants. Community planning forces elected representatives to consider the impact on the community of the actions of all local decisionmakers but can be negated by central controls. Leadership can mobilise community resources from the commercial and not-for-profit sectors but is incompatible with the proliferation of nonaccountable agencies.

Many studies discuss the social embeddedness, flexibility, efficiency, and competitive advantage of these networks, but there have been few systematic attempts to theorize their origins. A processual analysis of the changing spatial structure of Taiwan's industry, in its social, political, and historical contexts, reveals that Taiwan's concentrated industries of the 1950s did not disintegrate into smaller firms. Rather, there was a proliferation of new rural firms after the mid-1960s. The construction of a disintegrated, decentralized, and networked structure was driven by the contingent actions of rural household entrepreneurs, pursuing strategies of social reproduction, under circumstances resulting from, among other things, an extensive land-reform program and redistributive agricultural policies. Transactions costs and neo-Weberian authority approaches elucidate important factors, but fail to explain the creation of this new class of petty entrepreneurs, and how the conditions of their entrance shaped the networked form of organization they created. Furthermore, their actions did not result from state-led development policies as much as they were the unintended consequences of state policies, preceding by several years government efforts to support the growth of small firms and rural industry. Finally, urban-push explanations assume a passive countryside, thus ignoring the ways rural actors energetically created new structures of production out of the resources at hand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By means of case studies of Slovak cities, the author focuses on decentralisation processes at the local level, paying special attention to the role of local self-government during the transformation period in Central and Eastern Europe. Four main directions of sublocal decentralisation are considered: political decentralisation, managerial decentralisation, decentralisation to the so-called ‘third sector’, and decentralisation to the private or mixed sector. Cities have constituted ‘Councils in City Quarters’ as a tool for the improvement of local democracy and as an aid to more flexible local self-government. The previously state-controlled municipal sector has also been changed to a group of municipal, public – private, and private companies involved in delivery of local services, resulting in enhanced efficiency. A wide range of local functions took over the third sector—from delivery of particular services to the reconciling of many local interests. Sublocal decentralisation processes, although not yet complete, appear very promising and confirm the ability to cope with the transitional situation at the local level. An important feature is that the initial top-down control of the local level transformation has been replaced with an active and more autonomous role of local self-governments following the consolidation period. Slovak transition at the local level also documents the role of local self-government as hard to replace in the facilitation of local civil society building and highlights a need for a local democracy which is more complex in nature. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>New commercial Point Laser Triangulation (PLT) probes enable Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMMs) to take faster, noncontact, accurate measurements. In this paper, we address how to apply this technology to inspect helical gears. Traditionally, gears are inspected with slow, costly, and dedicated machines. The proposed flexible inspection system with a fast measuring probe can significantly reduce capital equipment costs and inspection times. Integrating PLT probes on CMMs has been limited partly because of the difficulty in generating optimal inspection paths, and partly because of the highly reflective gear surfaces. Complex sensor-to-surface orientation and obstacle-avoidance requirements of these unique probes are the main cause of the difficulty. This paper presents a geometrical approach for obtaining an optimal path plan for helical gear profile inspection with PLT probes. Models for the orientation parameters and the allowable operating regions for the PLT probe are developed. A collision avoidance strategy is also presented. Although this new method was developed and demonstrated while creating an optimal path plan for inspecting helical gears, the developed models and principles can also be applied to optimal inspection plan generation for other parts.</jats:p>",

The data show that actual reliance on keiretsu networks in Asia is relatively low, and keiretsu relationships are more likely to reflect a strong relationship at the global level, rather than relationships with suppliers within host countries.

The historical coincidence of their deployment is no accident; rather, they represent two gestures of a (re)figured late-modern hegemonic practice that feeds, ultimately, on hunger. By juxtaposing and critically interrogating these two discursive practices, it is apparent that a familiar binary opposition—thin/fat—was substituted for an unfamiliar pair—adjusted/unadjusted. This discursive swap drew upon a long history of filtering between bodies and economies, and acted to naturalize a new disciplinary phase in late modernity. This phase is unsurprisingly profoundly gendered. It is also spatialized via connection with another binary chain: First World/Third World, North/South, West/East, developed/underdeveloped, here/there. However, the relationship of these two binary chains is contradictory, and this has given rise to a contestation of power that coalesces, literally and figuratively, around borders. </jats:p>",

This form of ‘modern’ risk can be seen as deeply entrenched within and produced by broader social and economic developments, and runs counter to the critical version of risk developed by Beck.

As a result of the new system, productivity improved by more than 30 percent. The plant produced an “extra” 144,496 front axles between January 1997 and July 1998. The DSS was also instrumental in Visteon avoiding a $10 million modification on the line that would have been inefficient. Visteon used the DSS in designing a new line with higher productivity and $5.5 million cost savings. </jats:p>",

It allows tenderers to maximize on their experience and expertise to develop solutions in conjunction with their chosen designers.

Åsgard A is a floating production unit constructed for Statoil and was installed on the Åsgard Field during the winter 1999. Hot spot areas showing the shortest calculated fatigue lives have been selected for probabilistic analyses. This implies areas at doubling plates and transverse stiffeners in the deck structure and the connections between the side longitudinals and the transverse frames. In FPSOs, there are a number of details with similar geometry that also are fabricated in the same way. Some of the details like those in the deck structure are also subjected to the same magnitude of loading. Consequently, there will be correlation in fatigue life when several components are considered at the same time. The effect of this correlation has been investigated for components that have a welded surface and components that are ground. A number of analyses have been performed to investigate the effect of this correlation on required amount of in-service inspection. And it is shown how results from these analyses are transferred into an in-service inspection program for the Åsgard A FPSO. [S0892-7219(00)00302-2]</jats:p>",

Published accounts of national, multidisciplinary planning efforts and priority setting for avian conservation are not common. I describe the process and results of a broad‐based, grassroots‐oriented avian conservation planning workshop held in the Dominican Republic in which we designed a coordinated strategy for avian conservation in the country. The planning process sought to (1) increase communication and cooperation among conservationists; (2) familiarize participants with resources pertinent to avian conservation; (3) encourage the transfer of information between researchers and managers; (4) promote the concepts of long‐term avian monitoring, avian conservation plans, and species management plans; and (5) develop a common, multidisciplinary strategy to promote the conservation of birds in the Dominican Republic. The workshop highlighted group discussions among research biologists, managers, educators, and public policy specialists to assess avian conservation needs and priorities with respect to each discipline and has since galvanized a significant portion of the conservation community around several cooperative projects involving diverse segments of the community. Avian biologists can play a significant role in conservation efforts through a willingness to work with key players in diverse fields and to envision holistic, multidisciplinary approaches to conservation issues.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Results of the comparative study presented in this paper suggests that local government organization influences land-use planning, and local development strategies and disparities. Local government reforms can, therefore, serve to modify spatial patterns of development and disparities. Based on a review of studies made in the developed and the developing world, the author provides a comparative perspective on these influences. Five major dimensions of local government organization—territorial, functional, political autonomy, fiscal, and electoral—are used to define four extreme models of local government. The American self-government model leads to substantial inequalities and to considerable sprawl. The Western welfare-state model alleviates these problems somewhat, but at a cost to central government. Its positive impact is also dependent on norms of administration at the central level, whereas reduced competition over economic development has its negative sides. Developing-world-type centralism has no real advantages in terms of development or disparities. The developing-world decentralized model can be regarded as a transitional phase towards either the self-government or the welfare-state models. Its implementation has been partial; hence its impact has, so far, been rather small. </jats:p>",

Data on Japanese FDI are analyzed in this region at the aggregate, sectoral, and firm level. The paper commences with a review of the flying geese model, especially that version which interprets Japanese FDI as a catalyst for Asian development, and the billiard ball metaphor which suggests a mechanism for host countries to ‘catch up’ with Japan. The authors then turn to an analysis of Japanese FDI in Asia-Pacific together with employment data for fourteen major firms. This allows an evaluation of the two models in terms of recent geographical patterns of investment and employment growth by electronics MNCs. A special case study of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd (MEI) helps flesh out the evolving geography of Japanese electronics firms in Asia-Pacific. Although the results support the overall patterns suggested by the two models, the authors argue that metaphors and analogies such as flying geese and billiard balls should not be used casually and as a substitute for analysis. </jats:p>",

The authors address the construction of optimal-path maps for two-dimensional polygonal weighted-region terrain, terrain partitioned into polygonal areas such that the cost per unit of distance traveled is homogeneous and isotropic within each area. This is useful for overland route planning across varied ground surfaces and vegetation. The authors propose a new algorithm that recursively partitions terrain into regions of similar optimal-path behavior, and defines corresponding “path subspaces” for these regions. This process constructs a piecewise-smooth function of terrain position whose gradient direction is everywhere the optimal-path direction, permitting quick path finding. The algorithm used is more complicated than the current path-caching and wavefront-propagation algorithms, but it gives more accurate maps requiring less space to represent. Experiments with an implementation confirm the practicality of the authors’ algorithm. </jats:p>",

Its overall growth can be explained primarily by the intersection between two sets of political-economic processes: those operating at the global level of the industry in general and those specific to Indonesia itself. Within these general processes, we explore the particular organizational mechanisms through which this growth has occurred. Detailed field evidence shows how the Indonesian clothing industry is deeply embedded in production networks which connect domestic producers with international networks of production and distribution, notably those organized by Korean, Taiwanese, US, and European firms. Although such networks are generally consistent with Gereffi's concept of the buyer-driven global commodity chain, we show that the precise shape and the driver of the company-specific production networks in Indonesia are highly dependent on the specific market being served. Finally, brief attention is given to the potential impact of the current East Asian economic crisis on Indonesian clothing firms. </jats:p>",

The two frameworks are used to analyse policy change and stability in the UK industrial pollution sector over a period of more than twenty-five years. Innovations derived from policy-oriented learning generated in the 1970s were initially rejected before being implemented fourteen years later. The case study illustrates the limits of both theories. Change was not an open competition between advocates of different core policy beliefs. Nevertheless the ACF analysis of contrasting, broadly defined, beliefs can help explain some events beyond policy networks. Resource interdependencies in the policy network provide a good explanation for the stabilities exhibited in the case study. PNA can also explain why some actors were excluded from the policy process whereas others exercised decisionmaking and nondecisionmaking power. In combination, the more fundamental agency-oriented and structure-oriented emphases on beliefs and resources associated with the ACF and PNA, respectively, can enrich policy analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author aims to examine the nature and organisation of transnational business networks. From an empirical study of some 111 parent Hong Kong transnational corporations (TNCs) and 63 of their foreign affiliates in Southeast Asia, he argues that the role and functions of TNC affiliates are critically dependent on their embeddedness in transnational business networks. These transnational business networks can be organised either within TNCs (intrafirm) or with local firms (interfirm). This network embeddedness of TNC affiliates is socially organised and can be strategically deployed to facilitate the extension of network associations through time and space. Two detailed case studies of business networks of Hong Kong TNCs (HKTNCs) in Southeast Asia present several interesting illustrations. First, the strategic strength and spatial reach of intrafirm networks determine the competitive advantage of Hong Kong TNCs in the regional economy. Better integration and regional coverage are the winning strategies of Hong Kong firms in Southeast Asia. Second, the embeddedness of foreign affiliates in the business networks of HKTNCs are socially constructed. Personal relationships and business association among leading actors in HKTNC networks provide the underlying organising principles of such network formation. Third, the functions and contributions of local Southeast Asian affiliates to overall group performance are related to their access to local business and other forms of interfirm networks. Local affiliates with strong networking capabilities tend to receive more support and coordination from parent TNCs. In the concluding section the author offers some implications for recent developments in network theory in economic geography and geographies of Chinese business networks in Asia. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Property portfolios are traditionally constructed by diversifying across geographical areas, property types, or a combination of both. In the United Kingdom it is normal practice to use regions rather than towns or local market areas as the geographical divisions. The authors use cluster analysis to construct homogeneous groups from 157 UK local markets, by means of commercial property returns. The results show strong property-type dimensions and only very broad geographical dimensions in the clusters. These clusters are found, in general, to have temporal stability with changes in cluster membership being explained by the changing economic geography of the United Kingdom. The cluster-derived groupings are used to derive efficient investment frontiers and are compared with frontiers based on conventional heuristic groupings. It is shown that strategies based on parsimonious cluster-based groupings, appropriate for smaller investors, generate results that are comparable with those of conventional groupings and capture the main drivers of property performance. </jats:p>",

The recent literature is, however, marked by a lack of balance between theoretical development and empirical validation of the importance of agglomeration economies. Our aim in this paper is to redress the balance by assessing empirically the impact of various types of agglomeration economies on export performance. Our study is based on a unique data set including all Swedish export firms. We find that localisation economies are not as important as recent theoretical contributions on industrial districts, new industrial spaces, and innovative milieus have led us to believe. Instead, traditional scale economies, together with urbanisation economies, have a larger effect on export performance. </jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of ridge‐mapping callipers in determining bony ridge widths in the anterior maxilla prior to dental implant surgery. A modified surgical stent was designed to locate the beaks of ridge‐mapping callipers at the same points on the jaw before and after mucoperiosteal flap reflection. Eleven subjects were included in the study. Measurements (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>=100) were made at 25 implant sites, 50 “pre‐operative” and 50 “intra‐operative” at 3 mm and 6 mm distances from the crest of the ridge. There were statistically significant (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.0001) differences between pre‐ and intra‐operative measurements. Based on pre‐operative measurements, clinical judgements were made as to whether supplementary procedures such as guided bone regeneration would be required. Unanticipated supplementary procedures were required at 10 fixture sites. The findings indicate that ridge‐mapping alone is insufficient to accurately predict bone available for implantation in the anterior maxilla. It is suggested that ridge‐mapping may provide reliable information about bone levels when the labial aspect of the anterior ridge is not markedly concave.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In its prescription of how food security among rural households can be attained and how problems such as AIDS can be addressed, the neoclassical utiliarian view envisions individual house-holds making atomistic decisions in the use of their resources, goods, and services (entitlements). In exploring the effect of illness and death on household food security in rural Malawi amidst the AIDS epidemic, I find that the embeddedness view explains more convincingly how rural households secure their food supply and deal with illness and death. This view suggests that individual households' use of their entitlements indeed contributes to household food security and the fight against illness and death, but that such use is shaped by the entitlement system that embodies collective beliefs, rules, expectations, and obligations. Social and cultural relations between households, anchored in the entitlement system, enable households to share their entitlements through reciprocity and redistribution, thereby contributing to collective food security and diffusing the burden of illness and death across households. Rural Malawians are thus not isolated actors envisioned by the utilitarian view but social actors who constantly engage in negotiations with each other, sharing their entitlements, and thus collectively securing their food supply and diffusing burdens. Food security then gets compromised when burdens reach a threshold that fractures social and cultural ties thus disabling households from sharing entitlements. AIDS is a threat to food security in rural Malawi because of its potential to make the spread of illness and death burdens so extensive that households would be unable to share their entitlements. </jats:p>",

Among the factors possibly fostering such convergence, the following are highlighted in the paper: the internationalisation (‘globalisation’) of socioeconomic and political challenges and institutional responses to them. </jats:p>",

Difficulties in achieving comparability of variables and spatial bases can apply whether analysis is undertaken at the most macro level (that of entire nations) or at more micro spatial scales. In this paper we will discuss the methodological problems which can arise from comparative cross-border analysis by using small-area census data within Ireland (North and South) as illustration. As this analysis demonstrates, limited overlap between the specific variables in national data sets, different national contexts for socioeconomic indicators, and variations between data sets in the size of spatial units can all cause analytical problems at this spatial scale. In particular, scale mixing can potentially result in very misleading interpretations. Possible solutions to these problems are discussed, and policy recommendations are made in relation to microscale spatial data sets at the national, as well as at the pan-European, level. </jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to make a start with a micro‐level test of this hypothesis by studying individual governmental organization, i.e. eight municipalities in the Netherlands. The financial stress hypothesis has been operationalised by assuming a negative relationship between the financial position of a municipality and the existence of businesslike planning and control instruments. The research shows that there is no evidence for the existence of this relationship. However, a conclusive judgement about the financial stress hypothesis seems to be impossible due to the fact that non‐technical aspects of NPM were not taken into account, and also because of an – on average – upward bias in the financial position of the municipalities in the empirical investigation.</jats:p>",

Interviewees were asked to reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of policy implementation, including: changing priorities, planning arrangements, agency roles, central guidance and financial mechanisms, consumer participation, and the impact of more recent policy or structural developments. Despite recognition of the leadership of the Welsh Office, the shift in thinking achieved, the developments made in joint agency collaboration and in consumer participation in planning, and an increasing competence to plan effectively over time, the overriding perception was that more could have been made of the opportunity afforded by the clearest and best resourced central government policy within the UK in this area. At the heart of this judgement lay concerns about pragmatic rather than strategic planning, a failure to link annual service developments to a final comprehensive end point and a related failure to integrate planning to meet community needs with hospital resettlement.
