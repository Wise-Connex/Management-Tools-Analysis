Suggests that once such an appreciation becomes widespread, together with the worldwide publicity resulting from fires in hospitality environments, this may influence the demands made by travellers, and that hoteliers might be well advised to exceed the requirements placed upon them by statute, and advertise such personal safety guarantees alongside their usual facilities, as part of an overall strategy in the battle for competitive edge.</jats:p>",

Interestingly, the stability condition of the clouds against KHI determines the global properties of the protogalaxies. Especially, in this paper, the effect of the magnetic field against KHI is examined. The author hypothesizes the two-component mixture to be magnetized. It is known that when the relative speed between two contacting fluids is smaller than the Alfvén speed, it is possible for KHI to be suppressed due to the magnetic field. Obviously, the efficiency of stabilization against KHI by this effect is related to the global property of the two-component protogalaxies. Hence, we find that the two-component model of the protogalaxy is compatible with the scenario of galaxy formation via a magnetic field.</jats:p>",

To clarify the dynamics of <jats:italic>hobo</jats:italic> elements in natural \npopulations, and thus to provide further data for our understanding of the <jats:italic>hobo</jats:italic> invasion, TPE \ntandem repeats, observed in the polymorphic S region of the element, were used as molecular \nmarkers. The number of TPE repeats was studied in 101 current populations from around the \nworld, and in 63 strains collected in the past. This revealed a geographical distribution which \nseems to have been stable since the beginning of the 1960s. This distribution is compatible with a \nnumber of hypotheses for the dynamics of <jats:italic>hobo</jats:italic> elements. We propose a scenario based on an \ninvasion in two stages: first, a complete invasion by elements with three TPE repeats, followed by \nthe beginning of a new invasion involving <jats:italic>hobo</jats:italic> elements with five or seven repeats.</jats:p>",
