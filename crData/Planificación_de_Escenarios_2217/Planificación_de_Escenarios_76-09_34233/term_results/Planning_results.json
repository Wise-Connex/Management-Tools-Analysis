The properties of numerical convergence of the procedure are discussed. Some of the numerical results of a case study for a Canadian urban system are interpreted. Finally, some extensions to the procedures used in this study, as well as alternative approaches to the same problem, or similar problems, are suggested. </jats:p>",

The calibration procedure involves a hill-climbing algorithm, a criterion function, and the partial derivatives of the allocation function.

A consideration of journey structure appears to offer one potentially promising procedure for relating land use and transport plans in a way that yields more realistic insights and policy in urban areas.
