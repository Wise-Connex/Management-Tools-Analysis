NRB has made a number of innovative attempts for developing microfinance framework in the country. The article attempts to analyze the extent of the access provided, and the generation of employment opportunities, by the formal and semi-formal microfinance institutions/programs in addition to identifying the problems faced in attaining financial sustainability by them. In view of the increasing need for microfinance services in terms of both the amount and coverage, NRB needs to enhance its capabilities to regulate, supervise and monitor large number of MFIs and also come up with innovative and suitable credit policies/regulations that would create an enabling environment for MFIs to grow and attain sound financial health. Some of the desired roles for HMG are demonstrating firm commitment towards poverty alleviation through action, stopping direct involvement in running and managing MFIs, stopping owning MFIs, and handing over presently owned shares of such institutions to the private sector through appropriate and transparent mechanism.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the most significant implications of technological advances in the banking sector is the possibility of delivering banking services through electronic channels (e‐channels). E‐channels provide alternatives for faster delivery of banking services to a wider scope of customers. Nowadays, e‐channels have gained increasing popularity in delivering banking services. However, prior to the implementation of e‐channels, several factors and investment costs must be identified to ensure a more cost effective and efficient execution of e‐channel services. A survey is thus conducted to determine factors that are essential for the successful implementation of e‐channels by domestic commercial banks in Malaysia. Data were collected from primary sources and were analysed via frequency analysis and factor analysis. The results of the survey suggested that banks’ operation management is the main factor affecting the success of ATMs, PC and branch banking, while product innovation and knowledge development factors are found to have the most significant effect on the success of banking kiosks and phone banking respectively.</jats:p>",

One of the proposed scenarios includes cessation of vaccination with live oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) and the creation of an OPV stockpile for emergency response in case of the reintroduction of poliovirus into circulation. We describe here a retrospective analysis of the cessation of OPV usage in a region of the Byelorussian Republic of the former Soviet Union in 1963 to 1966. During this period, a widespread circulation and evolution of independent lineages of vaccine-derived polioviruses took place in the region. Some of these lineages appeared to originate from OPV given to 40 children in the community during this period of essentially no vaccinations. The data demonstrate very high risks associated with both the local cessation of OPV vaccination and the proposed use of OPV to control a possible reemergence of poliovirus in the postvaccination period. The high transmissibility of OPV-derived viruses in nonimmune population, documented here, and the known existence of long-term OPV excretors should be also considered in assessing risks of the synchronized global cessation of OPV usage.</jats:p>",
