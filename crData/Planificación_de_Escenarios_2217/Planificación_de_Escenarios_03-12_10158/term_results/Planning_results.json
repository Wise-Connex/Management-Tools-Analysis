      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article critically evaluates the Foucauldian perspective on power. Foucault’s arguments seem to take three steps: (1) the vocabulary of power is elevated to a privileged status, (2) the meaning of power is extended to cover all human social behavior, and (3) the argument equivocates between two different meanings of power. The result is that the external theory of power overwhelms internal understanding. All planning processes are seen as a sham, understandable only in terms of who wields power. In practice, an obsession with power is dangerous. A theoretical focus on power could blind us to other realities. Everything could be reinterpreted within a reductionistic framework (a metanarrative) of power. A practical focus on power could breed despair and suspicion, undermining trust. The authors argue that the vocabulary of power is more useful for legitimate conflict resolution, consensus building, and planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental concerns have been framed in the planning profession as manifestations of resource scarcity, and hence a contributing factor in community conflicts. While mismanaged environmental scarcity can certainly lead to conflict, there is also considerable potential to stimulate cooperation on the basis of environmental scarcity itself. In the language of game theory, the latter outcome can be obtained by converting “dilemmas of common competing interests” to “dilemmas of common aversion.” The cooperation which would result from the use of environmental concerns as a binding element in conflicts among parties, is likely to catalyze a more “sustainable consensus”—a robust contract between erstwhile adversaries.Planners are in a unique position to glean the positive attributes of environmental indicators since they can bridge technical knowledge of environmental impact with an understanding of sociopolitical context at community consultation forums. This paper attempts to provide the theoretical basis for this approach and develop examples of how such a strategy for conflict resolution may be implemented. </jats:p>",

It has three aims: to identify and describe the principal methodological research including conceptual frameworks, perspectives, and tools for measuring and improving quality; to describe the results from various intervention studies; and to assess what is known about the effect of such interventions. The review suggests that interventions that improve client‐provider interactions show the greatest promise. Good quality of care results in such positive outcomes as clients’ satisfaction, increased knowledge, and more effective and longer use of contraceptives. Rigorously documented evidence of the effects of interventions is sorely needed. The review indicates areas requiring additional research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Land-development scenarios as a means of representing the future have been in the planner's toolkit for several decades. In this paper we provide a systematic view of four basic issues that concern scenarists and scenario users—the concepts, functions, credentials, and efficacy of land-development scenarios. Drawing upon the wealthy and expanding pool of knowledge and experience as reported in the literature, we put forward the notion that a land-development scenario set is both a bridge that connects the process of modeling with that of planning and a cognitive apparatus that stretches people's thinking and broadens their views in planning. The dual function entitles a scenario set to be a favored member of a family of innate instruments that humans operate in making decisions. Under this overarching framework, we propose three credentials that are by no means exhaustive yet are claimed to be essential for a scenario set to perform best the dual function. These are plausible unexpectedness, informational vividness, and cognitively ergonomic design. After exploring the efficacy issue of a scenario set with respect to its impacts on communities at large, we suggest that basic research efforts be underway that aim at the development of unified theories of land-development scenarios, or even scenarios in general, under a possible name of scenariology—the study of scenarios. </jats:p>",

While technology can bridge the gap between the classroomand the remote learner, the distance learner may be denied the opportunity of face-to-face communication, collaboration and inter-action when the traditional classroom experience is abandoned. This may not be in the best interest of students nor the clients assisted in the planning process. This article investigates the concern that technology-enhanced distance learning will reduce student experiences in communicating with others, collaborating on projects, and interacting with students, faculty and clients—group processes typically experienced in the classroom setting. It concludes that the pursuit of distance learning may not be in the best interest of the profession if it cuts short essential student experiences. </jats:p>",

Business strategy must be accounted for to ensure that a firm’s market opportunities, brand opportunities, and core competencies are being fully exploited in all marketing activities.

Despite the physical distinctiveness of Birmingham's Edwardian fringe belt, decisionmaking about its development is largely site-by-site. Its survival as a concentric zone with a high incidence of green space partly reflects the fact that the character and occupation of the individual sites of which it is composed have become deeply rooted in the mental maps of those able to influence change. Awareness of the fringe belt as an entity is rare: few landowners, developers, or planners see individual sites as integrated parts of the historical and ecological development of the city as a whole. Initially, pressure to redevelop fringe-belt plots has come largely from landowners. The proposed changes are often at variance with the predilections of local planners. Planners have a sectional perception, strongly related to the land use of cities. For developers, an interest in sites other than the one to which their planning application relates is almost entirely limited to the effects that adjacent sites might have on the viability of their proposal. The integrative quality of the fringe-belt concept is an important aspect of its potential as a citywide planning construct. </jats:p>",

Scouting for cool is known as “coolhunting” and its pervasive influence has captivated brand owners and their agencies alike. Its claim to be able to predict future trends by researching cool individuals has been both an inspiration and an irritant to the account planning community. This paper argues that coolhunting is, in fact, self‐defeating. The real challenge for brand owners is not to observe cool people, but to create new cool products, services and experiences. Account planning, with its mix of analytical and creative thinking, is uniquely placed to offer a framework for doing this. One such framework, based on Aristotle’s ethical theory, is discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Account planning as a discipline has been somewhat obscured from academic view. In practice, it has played a significant role in the development of the marketing communications (especially, advertising) industry although it has been adopted in varying forms and with differing emphases. It has been misunderstood by many. This paper offers a summary of the insights gained from the papers contained in this special issue of <jats:italic>Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning</jats:italic>; papers that represent many years of experience in the field; papers that are a mix of academic and practitioner perspectives. Collectively, they describe this faintly mysterious discipline more completely than any other published source of which we know. What is clear from the papers is the absence of any agreed succinct description or definition of what account planning should be in the current and anticipated future marketing communications environment. This paper attempts to remedy this situation by proposing a definition of account planning derived from this collective work which others may wish to accept, develop, repudiate or (best of all) debate.</jats:p>",

In an exploratory study, six senior account planning directors were interviewed to gain insights into account planning in Australia. It appears that the scale and nature of the Australian advertising industry militates against full acceptance of the UK model. Indeed, the UK model has met resistance from several areas. It was further found that the expectations of the planners’ role probably exceed the individual’s capacity to deliver on that role. Hence, the outlook for planning other than for a small group of “true blues”, to use the Australian argot, may have limited success in Australia.</jats:p>",

These include a lack of universal application, a lack of policy guidance, and a lack of public participation in both the formulation of development plans and in development control. There are also weaknesses in the application of environmental impact assessment in the planning process. This article examines the two systems from a comparative standpoint. It is concluded that Malaysian law has not developed sufficiently in this field, a problem which is linked to deficiencies in the rule of law, lack of adequate local finance, and a narrow view of the role of lawyers in the planning process. </jats:p>",

The transformation of the marketing communications environment during the 1990s is discussed together with the evolution of marketing theory and practice. The main focus of the paper examines if and how account planning has responded to the challenges of the marketing environment during the 1990s and the increasing demand for integrated marketing communications. It questions the extent to which account planning is meeting marketing communications needs in the new millennium both in terms of its traditional internal agency functions and the much debated topic of media neutral planning. The term media neutral planning is analysed and the distinction is drawn between media neutral ideas and neutrality in channel choice. The paper concludes that planning is an inherently flexible discipline and that its prime function is to place the consumer at the heart of creative marketing and communications planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Space syntax research has had significant success over the years and has served to illustrate the importance of configurational measures, especially those that take into account all the spaces in a system. Here, assumptions of axial lines as elementary spatial units have been overwhelming. Although based on a theoretical construct of visibility, this postulation has rarely been extended to perception or cognition and this has given rise to questions about geometric and metric considerations. The research presented here was carried out in three large urban hospitals. In them, 128 volunteers performed ‘open searches’, where they attempted to become familiar with the hospital; ‘directed searches’, where they sought specific locations; and various cognitive mapping tasks such as pointing to locations that were not within sight and sketching the main corridors and routes of the hospital. The hospitals themselves were analyzed through conventional syntax measures of axial lines and a segmented version of those lines. Correlational and regression analyses revealed that, although use of space was best predicted by local measures (connectivity), distribution of people was better explained through integration-3. Performance comparisons between the environmental measures given by ‘whole’ and ‘segmented’ lines suggested that, at least in complex architectural settings, original syntax definitions of axial lines as uninterrupted visibility lines have more predictive power and better cognitive presence than ‘segmented’ lines. The results also support previous findings of intelligibility as a factor in predicting space use by extending it to the cognitive realm. Additionally, it has brought out the reverse role of intelligibility-3. It was also found that mean depth of an entry effects the way a building is explored; therefore, knowledge of this spatial property may provide a fair indication of the relative importance which each space will have on wayfinding. </jats:p>",

This article offers a preliminary assessment of the program, focusing on its effects on government efficiency, economic development, and political accountability. It finds that in some municipalities, with both strong grassroots organizations and nongovernmental organizations, a relatively democratic process of decentralization occurred although decentralization did not serve as an impetus for economic development. Inmanymunicipalities, however, the policy has resulted in the entrenchment of local elites, the strengthening of clientelistic relationships, and the “decentralization of corruption.” </jats:p>",

The question we pose in this article is whether this concern is warranted. Is the population community justified in limiting research on this population to early sexual activity and HIV risk? Even if the sexual behavior of young people can be considered problematic, are there perhaps other aspects of young peoples' lives to which more attention should be devoted? The literature on adolescent sexual behavior in Vietnam is reviewed and data on premarital sex and reproductive behavior are analyzed from a 1999 survey conducted in six provinces among nearly 1,500 adolescent boys and girls aged 15–22. Descriptive data on schooling and work are included in order to put the information on sexual activity in perspective. The data analysis reveals that, at least currently, the sexual behavior of unmarried adolescents in Vietnam is not what jeopardizes their health and well‐being.</jats:p>",

Confronted with the persistence of urban air quality problems in regions experiencing rapid population growth and decentralization, the Environmental Protection Agency recently developed a set of guidelines to permit metropolitan regions to receive air quality “credit” for the adoption of “smart growth” land use practices. Following an examination of the predominant emissions control philosophy that has guided federal air quality management for more than thirty years, the author outlines three stages in the existing air quality planning process through which metropolitan planning organizations may receive credit for land use– based control strategies and recommends a set of institutional changes needed to foster the development of an integrated land use, transportation, and air quality management framework. </jats:p>",

The individual data are linked to facility surveys conducted in the same communities so that the impact of Tanzania's family planning program can be examined. The focus of the study is an examination of the effect on method choice of the three major components of Tanzania's family planning program: logistical support, trained providers, and communications programs. The statistical methods employed correct for the potential endogeneity of family planning message recall. Simulations are used to quantify the impact of the important policy variables. All three components of the program are shown to have had an impact on modern method choice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors advance a new approach to transportation and land-use planning: the transportation impact statement (TIS). Current planning practice suffers from a lack of understanding of and adequate tools to evaluate the complex relationships that exist between land use and transportation. Consequently, land-use development frequently overloads the transportation system. A TIS exposes the complex interdependencies with a multimodal and regional assessment of the impact of land-use development on the transportation system. The authors offer a theoretical background for this new approach and an empirical illustration of its potential use through a case study based on the city of Haifa in Israel. The objective of the study is to investigate the local and regional transport-related impacts of proposed land developments, thus improving the planning decisionmaking process. The impact of the proposed land developments on the transportation system was studied utilizing several transportation scenarios, including travel-demand management (TDM) strategies, using the metropolitan database and travel-demand modeling systems. The results show that the total number of trips generated by the proposed land developments is by far inconsistent with the capacity of the transportation network to accommodate all the forecasted demands under all transport scenarios. These results have a number of implications. First, TIS clearly improves our understanding of the impact of land development on the transportation system, and thus it should be utilized in decisionmaking regarding land-development strategy. Second, TIS stresses the importance of transit and TDM strategies as mitigation measures in the planning process. Third, TIS illustrates the need for a wider (that is, not site-related) planning perspective—including setting overall metropolitan goals and objectives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper contributes to the demonstration that the self-similar city hierarchies with cascade structure can be modeled with a pair of scaling laws reflecting the recursive process of urban systems. First we transform the Beckmann's model on city hierarchies and generalize Davis's 2<jats:sup> n</jats:sup> -rule to an r<jats:sup>n</jats:sup>-rule on the size – number relationship of cities ( r &gt; 1), and then reduce both Beckmann's and Davis's models to a pair of scaling laws taking the form of exponentials. Then we derive an exact three-parameter Zipf-type model from the scaling laws to revise the commonly used two-parameter Zipf model. By doing so, we reveal the fractal essence of central place hierarchies and link the rank-size rule to central place model logically. The new mathematical frameworks are applied to the class counts of the 1950–70 world city hierarchy presented by Davis in 1978, and several alternative approaches are illustrated to estimate the fractal dimension. </jats:p>",

Comprehensive plans and policy statements are evolving instruments, undergoing continual revisions. This article examines the degree to which the quality of local plans changes over an eight-year period with respect to natural hazards mitigation. Jurisdictions in Florida and Washington were sampled in 1991 and in 1999 to determine the extent to which their plans’ hazard mitigation components changed and to identify factors driving communities to adopt stronger policies. Results indicate the plans of local jurisdictions improved and that legal reform, repetitive damage to property, and citizen participation can facilitate an adaptive learning process. This article discusses policy implications and provides recommendations for improving learning capabilities to prepare plans that prevent natural hazards. </jats:p>",

The floating catchment area (FCA) method defines the service area of physicians by a threshold travel time while accounting for the availability of physicians by their surrounded demands. The gravity-based method considers a nearby physician more accessible than a remote one and discounts a physician's availability by a gravity-based potential. The former is a special case of the latter. Based on the 2000 Census and primary care physician data, this research assesses the variation of spatial accessibility to primary care in the Chicago region, and analyzes the sensitivity of results by experimenting with ranges of threshold travel times in the FCA method and travel friction coefficients in the gravity model. The methods may be used to help the US Department of Health and Human Services and state health departments improve designation of Health Professional Shortage Areas. </jats:p>",

This study presents the findings of a survey undertaken to describe the availability and accessibility of abortion services in 1999, three years after the law was passed. All facilities that had been officially designated to perform these services were contacted by telephone to determine whether they were providing the services, their capacity, whether they were performing second‐trimester as well as first‐trimester terminations, and how long women had to wait for these services. Nationally, 292 facilities had been designated, but in 1999 only 32 percent were functioning. Of the functioning facilities, 27 percent were in the private sector. Mapping of available services indicated that substantial parts of the country were entirely without such services. Half of the country's induced abortions were being performed in Gauteng province, although only 19 percent of women of reproductive age were living there. This finding indicates that service provision in other provinces was inadequate or lacking. Although in the first years following the new legislation efforts were made to establish abortion services, this study reveals gross inequality in service availability. Strategies for improving coverage are suggested.</jats:p>",

In addition to describing the domains, the planners and the objectives of the competition, the paper includes analysis of the results. The results are analysed from several perspectives, in order to address the questions of comparative performance between planners, comparative difficulty of domains, the degree of agreement between planners about the relative difficulty of individual problem instances and the question of how well planners scale relative to one another over increasingly difficult problems. The paper addresses these questions through statistical analysis of the raw results of the competition, in order to determine which results can be considered to be adequately supported by the data. The paper concludes with a discussion of some challenges for the future of the competition series.</jats:p>"

The number of private gated developments continues to grow in Britain, in apparent contradiction to the government's urban policy aims of developing balanced, sustainable, mixed communities. There has been no official recognition of the trend towards gated communities, nor any national debate about their desirability as a built or social form. Contradictory guidance is given to local authorities about the design priorities for new housing developments. A case study tracks the planning process of a gated Community in Sheffield in order to illustrate the problems of regulating this new form of housing. Interviews with key players in this development inform discussion about the supply and demand for gated communities, which are found to be influenced by globalised marketing trends for ideal housing types, and a pervasive fear of crime. The issues which are highlighted by the growth of gated communities in Britain demand more attention than can be provided by the current policy vacuum.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Model Checking Integrated Planning System (MIPS) is a temporal least commitment heuristic search planner based on a flexible object-oriented workbench architecture. Its design clearly separates explicit and symbolic directed exploration algorithms from the set of on-line and off-line computed estimates and associated data structures.   MIPS has shown distinguished performance in the last two international planning competitions. In the last event the description language was extended from pure propositional planning to include numerical state variables, action durations, and plan quality objective functions. Plans were no longer sequences of actions but time-stamped schedules.   As a participant of the fully automated track of the competition, MIPS has proven to be a general system; in each track and every benchmark domain it efficiently computed plans of remarkable quality. This article introduces and analyzes the most important algorithmic novelties that were necessary to tackle the new layers of expressiveness in the benchmark problems and to achieve a high level of performance.   The extensions include critical path analysis of sequentially generated plans to generate corresponding optimal parallel plans.  The linear time algorithm to compute the parallel plan bypasses known NP hardness results for partial ordering by scheduling plans with respect to the set of actions and the imposed precedence relations. The efficiency of this algorithm also allows us to improve the exploration guidance: for each encountered planning state the corresponding approximate sequential plan is scheduled.   One major strength of MIPS is its static analysis phase that grounds and simplifies parameterized predicates, functions and operators, that infers knowledge to minimize the state description length, and that detects domain object symmetries.  The latter aspect is analyzed in detail.   MIPS has been developed to serve as a complete and optimal state space planner, with admissible estimates, exploration engines and branching cuts. In the competition version, however, certain performance compromises had to be made, including floating point arithmetic, weighted heuristic search exploration according to an inadmissible estimate and parameterized optimization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ‘Element method of Cost Control’ introduces a hierarchical set of functional building elements. There are two groups of elements in building construction. The space delimiting elements are the elements, which are able to define spaces such as roofs, walls, floors etc. The space equipping elements are those, which furnish the space such as sanitary, electrical or air-conditioning elements. The elements are then sub divided into sub elements such as ground floor, curtain wall, internal wall etc.  The first step of this method is to define each and every element as independently as possible. Late it it becomes feasible to select different solutions for sub elements without affecting the others. The main objective of this hierarchical system is to ‘create the possibility to obtain a large variety of solutions by combining parts’. The next step includes ‘Codification’. Each and every time in the element is codified for the regularization of the method and form the application in a computer model. The items can comprise its values from an authorized database of cost for example ‘schedule of rates’ can be used. The analysis is carried out beginning from the database. This database is used in the elaboration of the spreadsheets of each sub element. The spreadsheet for every individual sub element comprises detailed specification from the detailed drawings. As rates are linked with the database, a ‘Bill-of-Quantity’ is easily deducted from the spreadsheets. If, following this estimation, the project is within the budgetary constraints, the process can continue with phases like preparing specification, calling for tender etc. If not, the problematic part of revising major options of the project parts (macro elements, elements, sub-elements) is eased down by changing certain specifications. As they are all linked to he database with unit rates for construction costs, the whole process taken only minutes. The second important constraint other than budgetary, is the design constraint. The Architect’s job is to decide between different design alternatives for a particular project and select the one, which is the best. Always the best one is not the most economical one. The presence of the spreadsheet allows the architect to develop designs and simultaneously check the effect on the total cost. In certain circumstances, it helps the architect to decide the best cost-effective design solution. Another very important advantage of this element method is that it helps to make reliable predictions starting from the first phase of the design process and can be used when the project is being implemented. So cost - checking is not postponed for the time of completion of the project.  The advantage of making a model is that we can easily understand the links between other elements of construction such as time and production. The more all those aspects are integrated in one bigger model, the more specific the model becomes. As a consequence, the model will never be suited to another context. But it eventually serves two main purposes: to enhance the insights in all those cross-links and to stimulate the elaboration of integrated models appropriate for a given context.  Keywords: Element Method, Parametric models, Space delimiting elements, space equipping elements, codification, budgetary constraint, design constraint, schedule of rates.</jats:p>",

For example, interest in planning demonstrated by the space res earch community has inspired work in observation scheduling, planetary rover ex ploration and spacecraft control domains. Other temporal and resource-intensive domains including logistics planning, plant control and manufacturing have also helped to focus the community on the modelling and reasoning issues that must be confronted to make planning technology meet the challenges of application.   The International Planning Competitions have acted as an important motivating fo rce behind the progress that has been made in planning since 1998. The third com petition (held in 2002) set the planning community the challenge of handling tim e and numeric resources. This necessitated the development of a modelling langua ge capable of expressing temporal and numeric properties of planning domains. In this paper we describe the language, PDDL2.1, that was used in the competition.  We describe the syntax of the language, its formal semantics and the validation of concurrent plans. We observe that PDDL2.1 has considerable modelling power --- exceeding the capabilities of current planning technology --- and presents a number of important challenges to the research community.</jats:p>"

Currently one of the most popular and successful algorithmic techniques in STRIPS planning is to guide search by a heuristic function, where the heuristic is based on relaxing the planning task by ignoring the delete lists of the available actions.     We present a natural extension of ``ignoring delete lists'' to numeric state variables, preserving the relevant theoretical properties of the STRIPS relaxation under the condition that the numeric task at hand is ``monotonic''. We then identify a subset of the numeric IPC-3 competition language, ``linear tasks'', where monotonicity can be achieved by pre-processing. Based on that, we extend the algorithms used in the heuristic planning system FF to linear tasks. The resulting system Metric-FF is, according to the IPC-3 results which we discuss, one of the two currently most efficient numeric planners.</jats:p>"

These problems may be considered from the point of view of many criterions. It seems that two criterions are the most important: quality of terrain reflection in the terrain model and computational complexity of the on(off)-line path planning algorithm. The paper deals with two above indicated problems of route planning effectiveness. Comparison of approaches used in route planning is presented. The hybrid, terrain merging-based and partial path planning, approach for route planning in dynamically changed environment during simulation is described. It significantly increase effectiveness of route planning process. The computational complexity of the method is given and some discussion for using the method in the battlefield simulation is conducted. In order to estimate how many times faster we can compute problem for finding shortest path in network with n big squares (b-nodes) with relation to problem for finding shortest path in the network with V small squares (s-nodes) acceleration function is defined and optimized.</jats:p>"

These articulated systems are formed by supporting a workpiece, or end-effector, with a set of serial chains, each of which imposes a constraint on the end-effector. Our goal is to plan trajectories for systems that have workspaces ranging from two through five degrees-of-freedom. This is done by specifying a goal trajectory and finding the system trajectory that comes closest to it using a dual quaternion metric. We enumerate these parallel mechanisms and formulate a general numerical approach for their analysis and trajectory planning. Examples are provided to illustrate the results.</jats:p>",

The sea-faring nation has been a melting pot of great civilisations of the Orient, Africa, Arab and West. Along with Oman's topography, climate, and socio-religious-economic context, these exposure and associations influenced its built forms, giving rise to a type of architecture often distinguishable from its neighbours as being Omani. Oman also has a fast growing economy creating a more literate and prosperous population with changed demands and taste. This brought major infrastructure developments and rapid urbanisation in the last three decades, with inevitable effect on the local architecture. Despite calculated steps at the beginning, an alien form overtook the rich traditional architecture. This paper traces the architectural transformations of the last three decades in Oman from a rich traditional style. It highlights some of the reasons responsible for the change. In conclusion, the paper presents some recommendations aimed to positively define the direction the built-form of this emerging nation should take.</jats:p>",

In an interview survey, male and female clients (48 female clients and one male client) were interviewed. Main outcome measures were the client knowledge score, the client satisfaction score, and the clients’ general perception of family‐planning services. Client knowledge and client satisfaction scores were high (85/100 vs 78/100). Obstacles to program improvement as perceived by clients were resistance to family planning by male sexual partners and religious leaders as well as shortages in the supply of contraceptives. In conclusion, it can be said that female clients in Kabarole were satisfied with the services they received from both male and female community‐based distributors (CBDs). Satisfaction with and acceptance of male CBDs by female clients are important for the increased recruitment of male CBDs in family planning.</jats:p>",

LPG is an incremental, any time system  producing multi-criteria quality plans. The core of the system is  based on a stochastic local search method and on a graph-based  representation called 'Temporal Action Graphs' (TA-graphs).   This paper focuses on temporal planning, introducing TA-graphs and proposing some techniques to guide the search in LPG using this representation. The experimental results of the 3rd IPC, as well as further results presented in this paper, show that our techniques  can be very effective. Often LPG outperforms all other fully-automated  planners of the 3rd IPC in terms of speed to derive a solution, or  quality of the solutions that can be produced.</jats:p>"

Working with a major US semiconductor manufacturer on the configuration of their worldwide production facilities, we identify two unique characteristics of this problem as follows: (1) wafer demands and manufacturing capacity are both main sources of uncertainty, and (2) capacity planning must consider the distinct viewpoints from marketing and manufacturing. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic program with demand and capacity uncertainties. To reconcile the marketing and manufacturing perspectives, we consider a decomposition of the planning problem resembling decentralized decision-making. We develop recourse approximation schemes representing different decentralization schemes, which vary in information requirements and complexity. We show that it is possible to arrive at near optimal solutions (within 6.5%) with information decentralization while using a fraction (16.2%) of the computer time. </jats:p>",

This paper argues for a re‐examination of the suitability of current planning practices in light of the complexity of developing electronic business systems. In particular, the paper illustrates that planning and developing business‐to‐business electronic trading systems (ETS) is fraught with difficulties associated with the priorities and power of individual actors in participant organisations. The authors discuss triple loop learning (TLL), an approach that deals with diverse requirements and power issues, and argue that it may assist in overcoming some of the problems identified. The study aims to analyse the theoretical usefulness of the concepts of triple loop learning in the context of planning inter‐organisational ETS. Using the data gathered from case studies of three inter‐organisational networks, the authors argue that approaches associated with TLL can offer insight into managing inter‐organisational systems complexities, and can thereby enhance planning methods for ETS.</jats:p>",

Although technological systems can accomplish these kinds of data collection tasks easily, the implementation of such systems is itself problematic. In many ways, implementing new information and technology systems, when done effectively, mirrors the open‐ended, cross‐functional deliberative processes of strategic planning. This paper discusses how institutional leaders at community colleges have used the implementation of strategic planning processes to break down information silos, increase collaboration among units, streamline information and work processes, and provide greater access to both academic and operational information. While this process may be time‐consuming and disorderly, it is a promising tool for bringing about organizational change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In commercial applications the somewhat passive notion of marketing research is increasingly being superseded by the more active idea of consumer insight. In advertising this subtle change of emphasis is captured in the evolution of the account planning role and the associated “philosophy” of creative advertising development. The account planner is ostensibly responsible not only for commissioning and/or conducting advertising and consumer research, she or he is also responsible for integrating the resulting consumer insights into the creative advertising development process. Account planners deploy their consumer insights to act as “midwives” to creativity in the sense that they are responsible for persuading creative staff to take research‐derived consumer insights on board. This paper draws on recent depth interviews with advertising professionals and previously published research to explore the process of integrating research‐based insights into creative advertising development. The overall aim is to further elaborate the tasks and effectiveness of the account planner.</jats:p>",

Uses budget variances to measure a manager’s ability, for timely recognition of problems, and to improve the next period’s budget. While both the listed and non‐listed companies have reported many similar budget practices, the main differences were specific purposes served by budgets, degree of budget participation, periodicity of variance reporting, and purposes and authority to evaluate budget variance reports. In certain cases, firm size influences budgeting practices. Contributes toward filling a gap in the literature on the use of budgets as a planning and control tool in developing countries. Most prior studies were mainly confined to advanced countries. The study findings suggest the need for research on attitudes held by the budgetees towards the use of budget variances in the context of advanced management accounting techniques.</jats:p>",

Such an analysis is relevant, among others for port planning, since port expansion plans are based on forecasts. Inevitably, different opinions about the future development of (container) transport flows exist, and decisionmakers are confronted with uncertainty. This paper analyses the variables of container transport demand. Seven variables are identified, four related to the overall volume of trade and international transport flows (the GDP, export quote of economies, the direction of trade and the value density of trade) and three related to the containerised proportion of transport flows (the containerisable share of transport flows, the containerisation rate and the share of shipping in international trade). The rise of containerised transport flows from 1980 to 1995 is based on different 'underlying factors'. The future development of the variables is highly uncertain, and a 'extrapolation' of the high growth rates of the past, is not likely to lead to a good forecast for the future. Thus, decision-makers confronted with the uncertainty about future trade flows, should try to maximise flexibility in port planning.</jats:p>",

These optimal control problems can be solved numerically, e.g., by direct solvers. In practice, inaccuracies or perturbations in the underlying model can cause the robot to fail in following the calculated path. When deviations of the precalculated trajectory or system parameters are detected an update of the robot trajectory is required in real‐time. Therefore, a method based on the parametric sensitivity analysis of the optimal control problem is proposed to calculate admissible approximations for the solution of the perturbed robot trajectory problem in real‐time. A model of ABB's common robot IRB 6400 is used to reveal the capabilities of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>INTRODUCTION  Rapid urbanisation, which had become a problem for most parts of the developed world before the 1950's, still prevails in Turkey with a high rural to urban migration rate. With the rise in demand for work force by manufacturing and service sectors and the need for better quality of life, people migrate from rural to urban areas. Ankara, the capital city of Turkey, also underwent this rapid increase in population, which it was not yet ready to house. The central as well as local governments have not been able to tackle this problem. Thus, the immigrants-the newcomers to Ankara-have tried to solve their own shelter problem by using building methods derived from their own local traditional building characteristics. This low–income housing form, mentioned in the text as selfbuilt houses, is called “gecekondu” which literally means ‘to settle on by night’. This is a new form of house, built by using traditional layouts and elements in a new context. Immigrants moving from the same locality develop a collective consciousness. This consciousness embodies both collective production and a model for maintenance. During recent years a case study was initiated in the Şentepe district of Yenimahalle Municipality in Ankara by Gazi University and the municipality. Two settlements, namely Pamuklar and Barıştepe quarters were selected for study. The objectives were to identify causes and effects of the transformation that took place in these areas and to make ways for housing project with the participation of the local people. Surveys carried out in both of the quarters, demonstrated that the Figures of these self-built houses reflect the transformation of traditional architecture in Turkey. We term this transformation as the first generation in selfbuilt housing. By the time this study concluded, these quarters faced a new Plan lay out due to the emergence of city blocks and high rise buildings. This article, has two purposes. First, to study reasons and consequences of the transformation process, and secondly, to promote more humane and livable solutions in opposition to the tower blocks as the only apparent answer for self built housing problems whenever they may evolve.</jats:p>",

Such theatrical spaces, both actual and represented, present a somewhat unusual challenge to geographers interested in how meaning and identity are negotiated within and through the production of specific sites. I examine how gender and the performance of capitalist production are at once reinforced and subverted through the creation and consumption of the spaces of realist art. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Product design in concurrent engineering is a process that involves all the downstream product development activities. The interaction of these activities increases the complexity, the level of difficulty and the amount of iterations of product design. This work proposes a dynamic fuzzy decision support scheme that is able to provide a reasonable plan for an inherent iterative, complex product design. The plan serves as a guide for design tasks scheduling and can be adjusted dynamically according to the occurrence of some unexpected events. The proposed dynamic fuzzy decision support scheme is realized in a real-time manner. A heuristic priority algorithm based on the Fuzzy-AHP is embodied in it so as to deduce the priorities of design tasks to be executed under limited resources. Assigning design tasks to appropriate designers is based on the designer-job records stored in a database. The iteration inherently existing in product design is handled using a so-called iterative design analyzer developed by the authors. Besides, the dynamic fuzzy decision support scheme is capable of promptly capturing unexpected events or exceptions that are not uncommon in the process of new product design, as well as reacting to them with replanning. A case study on a burn-in system of a manufacturing company was used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic fuzzy decision support scheme. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Memory and nostalgia have attracted an increasing amount of critical interest in recent years. Whereas sites of memory often invoke, but also extend far beyond, spaces of home, nostalgia invokes home in its very meaning. And yet, whereas spatial narratives explore the sites and landscapes of memory, nostalgia is usually described in temporal terms rather than in spatial terms and is understood as a wider “desire for desire” [Stewart S, 1993 On Longing: Narratives of the Miniature, the Gigantic, the Souvenir, the Collection (Duke University Press, Durham, NC), page 23] rather than as a desire for home. In this paper I show how memory and nostalgia informed the establishment and promotion of an Anglo-Indian homeland called McCluskieganj in Bihar in the 1930s. Homemaking at McCluskieganj was enacted in gendered and racialized ways that inscribed and yet erased the collective memory of mixed descent shared by its Anglo-Indian residents. Whereas an imperial lineage was imagined through the figure of a British forefather, an Indian maternal ancestor was more usually refigured as Mother India. In this paper I examine Anglo-Indian homemaking at McCluskieganj in terms of productive nostalgia. First, rather than a nostalgic desire for home being apolitical or confining, settlement at McCluskieganj showed its liberatory potential for Anglo-Indians. Second, rather than focus on nostalgia solely in narrative or the imagination, I show that productive nostalgia implies its embodiment and enactment in practice. Third, rather than nostalgia being seen in terms of loss, mourning, and the impossibility of return, productive nostalgia is oriented towards the present and the future as well as towards the past. Fourth, rather than focus on the temporality of home as a site of origin and an unattainable past, I show how productive nostalgia refocuses on the desire for both proximate homes and more distant homes. Anglo-Indian homemaking at McCluskieganj enacted a productive nostalgia that was oriented towards the present and future as well as towards the past, and revealed an attachment to both India and Britain as home. </jats:p>",

The distributed generator (DG) is given attention against a large‐scale generator to correspond to uncertain demand growth. Optimization consists of minimizing the average cost and hedging risk over the scenario trees of demand growth. At first, based on the idea of a Real Option, Dynamic Programming using the utility function is applied to generation planning. Utility functions can model investor's risk‐return profile. The decisions in the first stage indicate that they are influenced by the type of utility functions and demand growth scenarios, and data of generators. Next, a Monte Carlo simulation is applied to a Brownian motion model of demand growth. This model can increase the possible number of demand levels. With this simulation, the case that the distributed generator has an advantage over the large‐scale generator is quantitatively discussed. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The goals of DOS include the development of pathways leading to the efficient (three‐ to five‐step) synthesis of collections of small molecules having skeletal and stereochemical diversity with defined coordinates in chemical space. Ideally, these pathways also yield compounds having the potential to attach appendages site‐ and stereoselectively to a variety of attachment sites during a post‐screening, maturation stage. The diverse skeletons and stereochemistries ensure that the appendages can be positioned in multiple orientations about the surface of the molecules. TOS as well as medicinal and combinatorial chemistries have been advanced by the development of retrosynthetic analysis. Although the distinct goals of DOS do not permit the application of retrosynthetic concepts and thinking, these foundations are being built on, by using parallel logic, to develop a complementary procedure known as forward‐synthetic analysis. This analysis facilitates synthetic planning, communication, and teaching in this evolving discipline.</jats:p>",

The KCM project figures strongly in the Thai state's long-term aim of transforming its water-poor northeast region through large-scale irrigation works and agroindustrial development. The project has also become a key element in interstate negotiations over coordinated development of the Lower Mekong Basin. The early stages of the project have met with resistance in the form of both national and local Thai social movements arguing against it on social justice and ecological grounds. Proponents of the project in the Thai government are employing different scalar narratives to justify and legitimate implementation of the scheme. Scale and power are intimately related within complex environmental conflicts, and tracing their linkages through an array of actors and across a variety of scales, the approach associated with actor-network methodologies, can reveal a great deal about how power and scale are co-created. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>Occupational therapists play a significant role in the discharge process and are often exposed to ethically challenging decision‐making. This paper examines the moral basis of discharge planning, relating it to the four fundamental bio‐ethical principles of respect for autonomy, beneficence, non‐maleficence and justice. Using a case study design, data was collected from 10 occupational therapists and two elder care patients using the critical incident approach, as part of a wider study to determine their perceptions of discharge planning and multidisciplinary teamwork. Direct observation of interaction within multidisciplinary teams was also undertaken. The findings from the research suggest that occupational therapists are unintentionally breaching these four principles and therefore their code of ethics and professional conduct. It is suggested that further research is needed to determine how occupational therapists overcome these challenges. Furthermore, this research has important implications for education establishments regarding the teaching of ethics to occupational therapists.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Small firms have been a particular focus of government support with IiP along with claims that the scheme will enhance the performance of these firms. However, it is argued in this paper that such benefits are unlikely to accrue to all types of small firm. In particular, only those businesses with a comparative advantage from investing in formalised human resource programmes are likely to experience enhanced performances. An econometric model is developed and applied to examine this issue empirically. The model incorporates the multistage decisionmaking processes that are entailed for firms involved with IiP In this manner we are able to control for selection bias in the performance (employment growth) estimates. The empirical results support the contention of comparative advantage. Businesses that choose IiP achieve enhanced growth as a result of their investments. In contrast, the impact for an ‘average’ small firm is neutral. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we offer a critical analysis of ethnic relations in an Israeli ‘mixed city’. Similar to other sites shaped by the logics of settling ethnonationalism and capitalism, the ‘mixed city’ is characterized by stark patterns of segregation between a dominant majority and a subordinate minority, as well as by ethnoclass fragmentation within each group. ‘Mixed’ spaces are both exceptional and involuntary, often resulting from the process of ethnicization prevalent in contested urban spaces. We theorize this setting as an ‘ urban ethnocracy’, where a dominant group appropriates the city apparatus to buttress its domination and expansion. In such settings, conspicuous tensions accompany the interaction between the city's economic and ethnoterritorial logics, producing sites of conflict and instability, and essentializing group identities and ethnic geographies. Empirically, the paper focuses on the city of Lod or Lydda, Israel, where the production of contested urban space has been linked to the construction of an exclusionary Israeli-Jewish national identity and to the establishment of hierarchical ethnic citizenship. Like other previously Arab cities, Lod has been the target of a concerted strategy of Judaization, which has formed the city's central planning goal since the late 1940s. We analyze in detail various aspects and sites of the Judaization process, and of the ensuing urban conflicts. We point to the chronic instability of urban ethnocracies, and to the need of planning to rise above narrow ethnocentric considerations in order for the ‘mixed city’ to prosper as the home for all communities. </jats:p>",

The examination uses data from a qualitative comparative case study of two watershed councils in western Oregon. The results tentatively support the proposition that geographic scale can significantly affect individual stakeholder ways of knowing. For small-scale places, stakeholder ways of knowing tend to be particularistic and rely on diverse personal experiences and specific place features; for large-scale places, stakeholder ways of knowing tend to be aesthetic and rely primarily on recreational experiences and scientific analyses. However, the results also indicate that geographic scale combines with at least three factors to affect the development of shared ways of knowing: (1) tensions between experts and laypersons; (2) primacy of organizational representation in stakeholder interactions; and (3) discovery of common group identity based on long-term communication and shared on-the-ground experiences, such as field trips. This examination suggests that geographic scale in ecosystem management is likely an important factor affecting working relationships in a collaborative stakeholder participation process. These relationships, in turn, can affect the perceived credibility and legitimacy of outcomes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports the development of empirical models to explain spatial price variation in an urban area. Models are constructed for petrol price data collected in 1995 and 1997 in Sheffield, England. The 1995 data are modelled by using only supply-side predictors following the collection of supply-side information from field surveys of the retail sites, a site questionnaire survey, and interviews with site managers. The 1997 data are modelled by using supply-side predictors and demand-side predictors that relate to the economic characteristics of the population of consumers. This modelling is based on field surveys of the sites, a new site questionnaire survey, and a household survey. The purpose of this work is to assess supply-side and demand-side factors in explaining spatial price variation. Supply-side predictors are classified into site characteristics, location characteristics, and measures of spatial competition. We examine the relative importance of these different groups of supply-side variables in explaining price variation, with a particular interest in location and competition effects as these relate directly to the spatial and geographical aspects of the problem. Another contribution of the paper is to observe the stability of findings by contrasting the best-fitting models obtained for the 1995 price data to the best-fitting models obtained for the 1997 price data. </jats:p><jats:p> We find that no demand-side factors are statistically significant. For 1995 a spatial competition variable and a location variable (whether a site is attached to a supermarket) are the consistently important supply-side variables. For 1997 all three categories of supply-side variables are important. </jats:p>",

They typically combine positioning technology, wireless technology and spatial analysis methods applied to detailed geographical, time based data to offer services in support of time critical, spatial, mobile decision making. A collection of research issues need to be addressed in the successful delivery of such services that extend beyond issues of sophisticated network algorithms. Specifically, careful attention needs to be given to: (1) people and user environments; (2) access to networks; (3) policy, privacy and liability; (4) standards and interoperability; and (5) data quality. Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) is the collective term for these interconnected issues and has been a traditional area of research associated with geographic information science. In this paper the particular SDI requirements for the successful delivery of Location Based Services (LBS) are explored through the development of a prototype LBS for journey planning. The initial implementation and testing of this prototype has revealed that the SDI context is well suited as a framework within which to examine the related LBS issues. From a more technical perspective, the testing has revealed that data structure and the means by which large data sets are mined (in order to gather information to present to users) is critical to the success of timely information delivery over limited bandwidth media.</jats:p>",

The key question underlying the paper is the extent to which small businesses located in rural areas have distinctive support needs, associated with the characteristics of rural businesses themselves or their owners, and/or the characteristics of the external operating environment for business in rural areas. A related question concerns the possible influence of enterprise characteristics and the characteristics of rural areas on how the business support needs of rural businesses are best addressed. The study comprised a desk-based review of existing literature relevant to the support needs of rural enterprises and/or the means of addressing them. It also included primary research on policy initiatives and programmes concerned with enterprise development in rural areas. Telephone interviews were conducted in 2001 with representatives of Business Links with catchments that included rural areas, as well as other key agencies (for example, the Countryside Agency). In addition, twenty-four case studies were completed of rural policy initiatives, based on face-to-face interviews. Following a brief review of key literature, an overview of the policies currently being operated by Business Link is described, based on the survey. This is followed by an identification of good-practice principles of rural business support, based on an analysis of the case-study support initiatives. The paper concludes by identifying the implications of the analysis for future enterprise support policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The increasing popularity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) in the West raises profound questions for social scientists, not least because it is as much about consumerism as it is about health care. Although the sociology of CAM is well developed, its geography remains almost wholly unexplored. In this paper we argue that one of the main reasons for this neglect is the fact that (post)medical geography has found it extremely difficult to come to terms with the disconcerting fusion of health care and consumer culture, and its dispersion across a vast array of materials and practices that are often far removed from the established concerns of the subdiscipline. Accordingly, in this paper we approach the dispersed geography of CAM through two key sources of consumer information: a range of ‘popular’ health-related magazines produced for the UK market, contextualized in relation to a sample of twenty-four British-based patient support groups. Specifically, we consider three critical issues that are shaping the mass mediation of CAM: the displacement of efficacy; the abrogation of authority; and the cultivation of anxiety. The paper concludes with a brief consideration of a profoundly geographical problem: the difficulty of constructing effective pathways through a profusion of disparate materials and practices in a context that is literally beyond belief. </jats:p>",

Initially we present the key findings from a significant global review of studies of incubators, conducted on behalf of UK Business Incubation (UKBI), and the UK Department of Trade and Industry. The review identifies key factors in determining the potential added value of incubators. We then present the key findings from a subsequent in-depth study of seven incubators across England and Scotland, commissioned by UKBI. The conclusions of the study highlight the dichotomies relating to the potential polarisation of incubator objectives (from property development focus to business development focus) and how these influence the implementation of effective incubation processes from the perspective of tenant and graduate firms. The policies and practices of operators highlight a blurring of the distinction between incubator management and incubation development. </jats:p>",

Approximately, 26.3% of all households are located within buildings with a High BV classification whereas 85% of all businesses are located within buildings with a High BV classification and 13.7% of the population is located within buildings with a High BV classification. In Selianitika, 28.8% of all buildings are classified with a High BV and 11% of all households are located within buildings with a High BV classification. Also 29.3% of all businesses and 33.4% of all services are located within buildings with a High BV classification and 6.7% of the population is located within buildings with a High BV classification. We estimate the minimum costs of a hypothetical tsunami with a wave run-up (H(m)max) of + 5 m. The results are considered significant because they have important implications for coastal risk assessment, resource allocation and disaster management planning.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been asserted that women's travel narratives are fundamentally different from those of men. The differential access of women to the dominant imperial position produced a gaze on the Orient that registered differences in less pejorative ways. However, the analysis of the intersection of gender, class, nation, and race discourses problematizes this view, and gives evidence that in women's narratives and life experiences one can find sites of resistance to colonialism as well as sites of complicity, depending on the individual women's positioning in this intersection. But even if women's narratives and life experiences do not necessarily deviate from the predominant Orientalist discourse, their texts are nevertheless specifically gendered. In this paper I study two women travelers, Isabelle Eberhardt (1877 – 1904) and Gertrude Bell (1868 – 1926). Eberhardt, born in Geneva (although with a Russian background), traveled to Tunisia and Algeria, wrote in French, and became a legendary figure in France. Gertrude Bell, born in County Durham (United Kingdom), spent most of her adult life in the Middle East and, at the service of the British Government, played a major role in the creation of its modern political map (in particular in Iraq). The study and comparison of these two women shed light on the complexity of attitudes towards colonialism that can result from a combined analysis of gender, class, nation, and race. Eberhardt was frequently torn between identifying with her race and class or with her gender, and among French colonial officers held a reputation of being an enemy of France as well as profoundly Algerianized; but, in the end, she gradually reached a compromised position in relation to France's colonial policies in the Sahara. In contrast, Bell was a traveler and a scholar who used her knowledge and her travels to promote the cause of the British Empire. But although she was unambiguously imperial in her outlook, she also managed to achieve a personal closeness with many Arabs and was a champion of their history and culture. </jats:p>",

My approach to gender and work makes use of Butler's theory of performativity in order to show how discourses and practices of work are not only implicated in the production of male and female gender identities but also provide a variety of routes through which different aspects of masculinity and femininity are performed. In my reading of the discussions and debates assembled by the focus-group texts, I try to show how work compels various performances, such as the ‘good woman’ or the ‘bad girl’ in Istanbul. Further, work not only calls forth different ways of being a woman in relation to the city but also produces differentiated female bodies. Finally, I argue that work is a spatial practice through which belonging, identity, and rights are staked in the urban environment. </jats:p>",

The accuracy of IPMs is not critical at the initial process planning stage but it becomes very important for the detailed process planning stage since inaccurate IPMs may result in costly mistakes. This paper proposes a procedure to generate accurate IPMs for the detailed process planning of a prismatic part. We transform the IPM generation problem into well-known 2D geometric problems, and use 2D geometric algorithms (2D curve offset, Voronoi diagram and polygonal chain intersection) instead of generalized 3D algorithms. Since highly optimized solutions are available for these 2D geometric problems, the proposed procedure achieves the efficiency and robustness by simply combining proven 2D geometric algorithms. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the development of an object‐oriented environment that enables both the graphical description and simulation of pedestrian traffic flows at the microscopic level is discussed. The simulation environment provides generation capabilities so that a terminal station model is directly formed on the basis of preconstructed component models. Essential experimentation capabilities, including graphical representation, are provided for pedestrian‐oriented and system‐oriented measures of interest with explicit emphasis on the level of service. A case study for a 4–level station in the new Athens subway system is also used to demonstrate the potential and functionality of the simulation environment.</jats:p>",

Findings suggested that several of the resiliency domains, on the Individual Protective Factors Index, as well as family support measured by the Family Support Scale, were associated with depression symptoms. Scores on the self-concept and positive outlook dimensions of the Personal Competence domain, the confidence and assertiveness dimensions of the Social Competence domain, and family support correlated with depression symptoms. The findings also suggested that 16.4% of the teens in this clinic would be classified as clinically depressed and as needing further evaluation. It seems reasonable to conclude that resilient adolescents may possess characteristics, beliefs, and supports which enable them to cope with life stressors more effectively and avoid depressive symptoms than those who are not as resilient. Given the prevalence and extent of depression among adolescents, it is important to develop interventions to foster attachment and enhance individual protective factors in primary prevention programs as such interventions may ameliorate the effects of high-risk environments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the late 1980s the European apparel sector has witnessed a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of ‘postcommunist’ Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence of these changes is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East–Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990s these processes were driven by outward processing trade arrangements between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey. Further liberalization of trade regimes during the 1990s removed these outward processing customs arrangements, but outward-processing forms of assembly production continue. The authors chart these transformations, and signal one part of the emerging architecture of trade relations between the EU and ECE after 1989. They explore the trade regulation changes that have provided a context for outsourcing and examine the different strategies of EU retailers and manufacturers in the governance of pan-European apparel production and trade. </jats:p>",

The planning of the solution alternatives for an individual patient is based on a top-down structure for dental decision-making, aiming at a standardization of the argumentation. From a theoretical point of view, decision support can be provided only for anticipated decisions (planning). Moreover, only parts of these anticipated decisions can be supported. Accordingly, a separation of these partial aspects has to take place before one is able to build decision support systems. For prosthetic dentistry, clinicians have been shown how to use individual patient findings to sketch the possible treatment alternatives and later derive guidelines for the treatment. The planning module for fixed prostheses has already been integrated into a software agent. Planning modules for other types of prostheses are currently specified, implemented, and verified. </jats:p>",

Such models have been developed and used successfully in Swedish research projects since the beginning of the 1990s, but the current situation is that such models are rarely requested for waste management planning in the country. Based on case studies (with the waste management models MIMES/Waste and ORWARE) in the Swedish municipality of Jönköping and a follow-up study, the paper discusses and draws conclusions on how to improve and increase the use of models to better correspond to the needs of decision makers involved in waste management planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As a consequence of the decline of central harbour sites and the relocation of port activities to the outskirts of cities, today waterfront redevelopment has become a key issue in the urban revitalisation policies of port cities. Although we are aware that city-port regeneration has strong links with the real estate market, our purpose here is very different. In particular, the contingent valuation method (CVM) has been applied in order to obtain the nonmarket benefits of the environmental and urban improvements derived from redeveloping some port-related areas for recreational and leisure purposes in the city of Castellón, Spain. To date, no previous study has attempted to apply this method to this policy issue. The result is that CVM provides useful information in this context, however, like any methodology, it has its limitations and it cannot provide a definitive answer to this policy issue. Finally, the estimated benefits are compared with the costs of the provision of such recreational and leisure facilities within a cost–benefit analysis framework, and the main finding is that benefits can plausibly exceed costs. </jats:p>",

The on-going deployment of the formal and technical tools and discourses of land-use planning have been instrumental in securing the visibility and legitimacy of Zimbabwe's new settlers. The speed and short cuts of the fast-track land reform process and vagueness of policies to date have in the short term opened up a certain amount of space for negotiation and a degree of leeway and flexibility in land-use planning and allocation. But the danger for the settlers is that, by deploying a discourse rooted in long-held and institutionally embedded Rhodesian traditions of planning and control, they have played into a process that – as so often in Zimbabwe's history – will re-impose coercive land-use regulations that are at odds with their livelihood strategies and seek to vet settlers and so undermine populist claims of redressing inequalities and providing land to the landless and poor.</jats:p>",

A method is proposed to generate a time‐optimal velocity profile for any spatial path in static environments or when mobile obstacles are present. The method generates a feasible trajectory to be tracked by fully exploiting velocity, acceleration and deceleration boundaries of the WMR, and by ensuring the continuity of the velocity and acceleration functions. As an additional benefit for the tracking process the jerk is also bounded. The algorithm is not time consuming, since it mostly uses closed mathematical expressions, nonetheless iteration strategies are presented to solve specific situations. However, such situations are not expected to occur when the spatial paths are planned as smooth curves. The success of the algorithm was tested by experimental and simulation results on the WMR “RAM.” © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

We explored the minimum spatial resolution requirements for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquisition when brain mapping is used in neurosurgical planning and navigation. Using a 1.5 Tesla clinical MRI scanner, eight patients with brain tumors underwent fMRI scans using spatial resolution of approximately 4 × 4 × 4 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> to map the eloquent motor and language areas during the performance of cognitive/sensorimotor tasks. The fMRI results were then used intra‐operatively in an open MRI system to delineate eloquent areas. Retrospectively, activation patterns were visually inspected by a neurosurgeon to determine qualitatively whether ambiguity with respect to the activation boundaries, due to low spatial resolution, could be of potential significance for surgical guidance. A significant degree of ambiguity in both the extent and shape of activation was judged to be present in data from six of the eight patients. Analysis of fMRI data at multiple resolutionsom sixl aia frogfica ger showed that at 3 mm isotropic resolution, eloquent areas were better localized within the gray matter although there was still some potential for ambiguity caused by activations appearing to cross a sulcus. The data acquired with 2‐mm isotropic voxels significantly enhanced the spatial localization of activation to within the gray matter. Thus, isotropic spatial resolution on the order of 2 × 2 × 2 mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, which is much higher than the resolutionsoused in typical fMRI examinations, may be needed for the unambiguous identification of cortical activation with respect to tumors and important anatomical landmarks.

Yet, the increasing dependence on species‐distribution models in identifying conservation priorities calls for a more critical evaluation of model robustness. We used 11 bird species of conservation concern in Brazil's highly fragmented Atlantic Forest and data on environmental conditions in the region to predict species distributions. These predictions were repeated for five different model types for each of the 11 bird species. We then combined these species distributions for each model separately and applied a reserve‐selection algorithm to identify priority sites. We compared the potential outcomes from the reserve selection among the models. Although similarity in identification of conservation reserve networks occurred among models, models differed markedly in geographic scope and flexibility of reserve networks. It is essential for planners to evaluate the conservation implications of false‐positive and false‐negative errors for their specific management scenario before beginning the modeling process. Reserve networks selected by models that minimized false‐positive errors provided a better match with priority areas identified by specialists. Thus, we urge caution in the use of models that overestimate species' occurrences because they may misdirect conservation action. Our approach further demonstrates the great potential value of museum records to biodiversity studies and the utility of species‐distribution models to conservation decision‐making. Our results also demonstrate, however, that these models must be applied critically and cautiously.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The high cost of cuttings drilled with inverts that must be shipped to shore for processing and disposal coupled with the potential shutdown of drilling operations in times of bad weather (when cuttings could not be transferred from the rig to supply vessels) led the operator to revisit the use of water-based drilling fluids, especially in the large-diameter hole section in which large amounts of cuttings are generated. However, many water-based systems have been used in the central Graben with little success. The need to develop a stable, shale-inhibiting, waterbased mud (WBM) system capable of performing well in extended-reach drilling (ERD) applications was identified. Extensive prewell modeling of wellbore stability in problematic shale zones and of hole cleaning in the large-diameter interval contributed to the success of this challenging project. This article discusses the planning, preparation, and successful drilling of the intermediate interval with a water-based drilling fluid.</jats:p>",

One factor that has not been fully considered is the role of children. Heterosexual couples may be more likely to migrate in favour of the male ‘breadwinner's’ career if the couple have children, or are planning to commence childrearing in the foreseeable future. However, little work seems to have examined this empirically. The authors focus on the influence of ‘motherhood’ in different national contexts, using comparable census microdata for Great Britain and the United States. They test whether apparent ‘tied migration’ effects may in fact be influenced by family decisions related to childbearing/childrearing, and two sets of modelling results are provided. First, they examine whether the effects of long-distance family migration on women's labour-market status is influenced by the presence or absence of children of different ages. Second, they conduct the same analysis for women who have a high-status occupation. The results demonstrate that women in families with young children are most likely to be out of employment after family migration. A smaller, but similar, tied-migration effect exists for families with older children and families with no children. The same pattern exists for women in high-status occupations. Tied migration appears to influence women's labour-market status equally in Great Britain and the United States, regardless of the presence or absence of children. </jats:p>",
