To be\n      effective, planning must cover all aspects of man's life; and all his\n      hopes and aspirations should be kept in view in deciding what can be\n      done with available resources in a given period.

Dr. M. N. Huda, in his Conference\n      Address, refers to this impressive record of Pakistan's progress in the\n      course of which many industries have grown from the state of infancy and\n      that of teething troubles to a state of viability and adult¬hood [2, Pp.\n      10-11]. Indeed, the rapid growth of the manufactured exports from\n      Pakistan in recent years may be considered as an indication of the\n      extent to which the industrial progress in Pakistan has been successful.\n      For the future, he rightly advocates an aggressive but selective\n      industrialization based on both the home and export markets. Moreover,\n      his observations do em¬phasize the need for increasing the productivity\n      of the existing industries as well as for a careful application of the\n      criterion of efficiency in the selection of the future pattern of\n      industrialization. This note seeks to indicate the inter¬relationship\n      between the industrial efficiency and the export performance; it draws\n      attention to a few neglected aspects of the recent studies on\n      indust¬rial efficiency in Pakistan such as the intra-firm differences in\n      efficiency. It explores the rationale and the implications of\n      'infant-industry\" protection for industrialization in\n      Pakistan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In his address delivered at the 15th Annual Conference of the\n      Pakistan Economic Association, Dr. M. N. Huda has reviewed the planning\n      experience in Pakistan. He is eminently suited to undertake this review\n      as he has been very intimately associated with the planning processes at\n      both the provincial and central government levels. The address, though\n      brief, raises a number of important issues in regard to the formulation\n      and implementation of the annual and five-year plans of the country,\n      issues which deserve serious consideration by the planning authorities.\n      The following discussion of his address is an attempt to supplement some\n      of the points raised' by him. With the quickening pace of economic\n      development, the need for more and accurate data is being increasingly\n      felt in the country. Lack of adequate and reliable data not only hampers\n      the use of sophisticated analytical tools for formulating comprehensive\n      national and regional plans but also adversely affects the measurement\n      of the performance of the economy from year to year. This is not the\n      occasion to go into the details of the merits and demerits of the\n      statistical series which are now being published by various sources.\n      Suffice it to say that there is a great need of improving the contents,\n      quality and regular¬ity of these data. The collection of statistics is\n      not keeping pace with the improvements in the economic activity. Even\n      such vital information as the size of population and its rate of growth\n      is not known with any reasonable accuracy. The results of the 1961\n      Census of Population are generally adjusted upward by 8.25 per cent for\n      underenumeration in the census. Similarly, the average rate of\n      inter-censal increase in 1961 Census was estimated to be 2.15 per cent\n      for Pakistan, 2.36 per cent for West and 1.91 per cent for East\n      Pakistan. The annual rate of growth of population is now assumed to be\n      2.6 per cent although there is evidence that it exceeds 3 per\n      cent.</jats:p>"

It involves the harmonization of a large number of independent\n      decisions taken by a great many agencies and groups often representing\n      conflicting interests in order to achieve certain targets which are\n      sometimes themselves in conflict with one another. Only by continuous\n      appraisal and critical analysis of the major strategies can it be\n      ensured that the main objectives are kept in mind while mak¬ing\n      individual decisions, and that individual policies do not conflict with\n      one another. It is, therefore, important to make detailed assessment of\n      the past experience to gain a general sense of the combination of\n      circumstances which, in the past, did or did not prove favourable to\n      growth. In his conference address [9], Dr. Huda makes an effort to\n      survey Pakis¬tan's planning strategy in the past and to reflect on the\n      appropriate policies for future. Admittedly, his purpose is to provoke\n      the economists \"to think, deli¬berate and advise\". Painting on such a\n      big canvas, Dr. Huda has necessarily adopted an impressionistic\n      technique. What we intend to do in these notes is to try to paint in\n      somewhat greater details a few of those parts of Dr. Huda's canvas which\n      have been left by him with relatively few brush strokes.</jats:p>"

We believe that in recent years large-scale public enterprise has moved well ahead of most private industry in developing effective systems for planning its activities. A major advance has been the development (and evolution) of the planning-programming-budgeting system (PPBS) - first in the Department of Defense and subsequently in other government departments and agencies. PPBS is by no means the whole answer to management's planning needs. And its history is checkered, but the shortfalls have been much more in application than in concept.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our experience has shown the basic elements of PPBS can be successfully applied by exploration and production managers to develop and control more effective strategies and programs leading to substantially improved short-and longer term performance.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A look at the exploration and production results achieved by major oil companies over recent years reveals an intriguing picture.

This experience is largely based on our work in developing exploration planning processes. However, exploration and processes. However, exploration and production activities are obviously closely production activities are obviously closely intertwined. And while the specific requirements (e. g., the type of quantitative analysis techniques needed) for effectively planning production operations are different, we believe the production operations are different, we believe the basic approach can be similar to that shown to be effective for exploration.

His approach\n      is extensive rather than intensive, i.e., he treats a wide variety of\n      issues none of which is subjected to a deep conclusive analysis. This\n      approach has merits particularly when the objective of the author is to\n      pose problems in a thought-provoking manner, \"without trying to find\n      answers\" [4, para 63].

Because of the restriction of space, I have selected for\n      discussion only three of the many issues raised in Dr. Huda's Address:\n      a) the \"overall\" Strategy of economic development in Pakistan, b)\n      Pakistan's agricultural policy, and c) Pakistan's industrial\n      policy.</jats:p>"

I shall confine my comments to two of the issues\n      only, viz., repayment of external debt, and the strategy of generating\n      higher income in the {private) capitalist sector.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dr. Huda has earned our gratitude by elaborating in lucid\n      terms the problems and experiences of planning in Pakistan [1]. As we\n      approach the Fourth Plan we need to have a fresh look at past\n      experiences so as to formulate the future plans in a much more realistic\n      fashion than has hitherto been done. Dr. Huda, in his Address, has\n      raised many issues in this respect. My comments will be limited to the\n      planning technique that has so far been pursued in Pakistan. My concern\n      is basically regarding the changes, that we would like to see, made in\n      the coming plan in this respect. At the technical level, the formulation\n      of a five-year plan has now be¬come synonymous with working out a\n      multisectoral econometric (consistency) model, which provides the basic\n      framework around which the plan is built. However, setting up a\n      macro-model is only a part of the plan formulation. A comprehensive\n      model which purports simply to develop and test the con¬sistency and\n      optimality of an economic strategy is, at best, partially relevent to\n      planning needs [5]. In fact, complete formulation of a five-year plan\n      involves the following six categories of interrelated studies — the\n      strength and realism of a plan depends on how satisfactorily these works\n      are accomplished while a plan is formulated:</jats:p>"

The adaptation of planning, programing and budgeting concepts initially programing and budgeting concepts initially developed within industry by the Federal government, and now being applied by state and local groups, is emphasized.

Our country has surmounted great crises in the past, not because of our wealth, not because of our rhetoric, not because we had longer cars and whiter iceboxes and bigger television screens than anyone else, but because our ideas were more compelling and more penetrating and wiser and more enduring. And perhaps more important, we encouraged all ideas— the unorthodox as well as the conventional, the radical as well as the traditional.\" John F. Kennedy</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Our society has been involved in a tidal wave of change during the past few decades. Each of us has been affected, and will be even more affected, by the impact of science and technology.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The late President laid heavy emphasis on stimulating creative thinking. During the course of this presentation, I shall attempt to underscore the ways in which the \"systems approach\" can provide assistance to management in industry and government.

All sectors of our Nation can benefit by using the powerful tools and techniques which have evolved.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The computer is used in the coordination of a large number of periodically recurring job functions to assemble, process and compile the various functions on the basis of priority, timing, accounting function, manpower and skill type requirements.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In the application described the computer is used to store, and retrieve pertinent information relative to the testing needs of several thousand gas wells. A properly designed computer system provides managers with ready accessability to tailored test schedules for each well. This allows periodic review of the demands on personnel and equipment with minimum effort. The ability to retrieve current information in several ways permits flexibility in analyzing changing situations. The application of the computer to this and similar problems also aids managers to satisfy work requirements in a timely manner.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>One of a managers primary functions is to efficiently coordinate manpower and equipment resources under his supervision. The problems associated with this management responsibility are compounded when the resources are spread over large geographical areas and engaged in a multitude of different activities.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper presents an application of the electronic computer as a management tool. The application discussed involves the coordination of well testing activities on sever thousand gas wells annually. The large number of wells, at various sages of depletion, and the resulting variations in testing needs create a multitude of activities which must be coordinated. To efficiently coordinate such a large number of activities manually is impossible. The computer, however, affords a tool with which a manager can rapidly assemble and compile the required job functions to aid him in discharging his responsibilities in a more prudent manner.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

This view is based on the belief that, in practice, the farmer finds himself involved with choice from a relatively narrow, and obvious, set of technically feasible, efficient farm plans. His main problem in the choice of a farm plan is seen as the estimation of the probability that the various possible financial outcomes will be achieved, since the possible effects of the latter on his future list of choices cannot be ignored. The type of data believed to be needed is described, and a line of theoretical analysis followed which is meant to underline the importance of this data, and to develop principles for use in its production.</jats:p>",
