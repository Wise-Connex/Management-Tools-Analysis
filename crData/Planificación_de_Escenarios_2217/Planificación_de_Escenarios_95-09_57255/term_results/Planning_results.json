      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the dynamic relations between the state, society, and metropolitan planning are explored. The changing role and function of the state in the context of rapid restructuring of economic and social relations in Australia during the past decade are discussed, along with the impact of processes such as globalisation, cyclic recessions, and the growing assertion of local communities on the state. The influence of these processes on metropolitan planning, as an arm of the state which mediates between development interests and local communities, is then assessed from a theoretical perspective. Given the identified processes and changes, it is argued that metropolitan planning has become increasingly constrained in its ability to influence the nature and location of urban development in 1990s Australia. </jats:p><jats:p> The validity of this argument is examined against the case of metropolitan planning in Perth during the past decade. Three key aspects of the changing nature of planning in Perth are studied in detail: A 1987 proposal for a new metropolitan strategy; a 1990 adopted metropolitan plan which derived from the 1987 proposal; and several redevelopment initiatives currently under consideration. It is concluded that the Western Australian state—and subsequently metropolitan planning—have experienced significant challenges to their ability to influence urban change. The constraints imposed on metropolitan planning are simultaneously due to economic pressures ‘from above’ and community pressures ‘from below’. Finally, it is observed that this process possesses a regresive potential, and that metropolitan planning should restructure in order to respond effectively and equitably to recent economic and social changes. </jats:p>",

The field development concept is to drill six wells and install a Not Normally Manned Installation ( NNMI ) with multiphase export of produced fluids to the Lomond platform 30 km away.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Appraisal drilling demonstrated that Erskine was a marginal field. A multi - discipline, integrated project team was organized to identify the best option for field development. Joint development with a host platform was adopted to improve development economics through reduced capital expenditure resulting from use of existing infrastructure. Several potential host platforms were considered. A fundamental technical objective, driven by commercial considerations, was to design a low cost development option which would allow export of produced fluids over a long distance. The increased \"capture radius\" opened up several competitive commercial opportunities for joint development by increasing the number of potential host platforms and export systems that could be accessed. The technical design and commercial negotiation process resulted in the Amoco operated Lomond platform being selected as the preferred host.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The cost of the NNMI was reduced by adopting cantilever jackup drilling and multiphase export. The cost of the multiphase pipeline was significantly reduced by qualifying carbon steel instead of corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) pipe. A high temperature insulation system was required for the multiphase pipeline to minimize problems with wax deposition and hydrate formation. Pipeline insulation costs were optimized with respect to operating costs for hydrate inhibition on a full field life basis.</jats:p>",

This approach allows us to reflect the required information for assembly planning efficiently. Our approach has also been successfully used for the mathematical presentation of technological knowledge. An algorithm for the automatic generation of feasible assembly sequences for a given product has been developed. Within the assembly process-planning, feasible sequences are determined depending on the sequential assembly stages of the product. This approach permits the use of different criteria for the selection of a rational assembly plan, and it also allows for the influence of technological system elements (equipment, tools and periphery) on the given part of the product during a interval of the operation. We have successfully applied our approach for assembly process-planning of a complex product, a worm gear box. It has allowed us to reduce computation time greatly and to arrive at the optimal solution to real automated assembly.</jats:p>",

Underwater inspection, repair and maintenance (DRM) of the platform jacket consumes a major proportion of the overall maintenance budget and consequently any reduction in this area is likely to have a significant impact on overall costs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>All offshore jackets are inspected regularly to ensure structural integrity and satisfy the strict statutory requirements. Technical advances have been achieved in recent years, particularly in ROV capability, which have led to a general reduction in highly expensive diver time. However, it is widely recognised within the industry that inspection costs could be further reduced by combining such advances with a much more rigorous planning philosophy, the aim being to reduce the total amount of inspection activity whilst maintaining or improving the effectiveness of the work carried out.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Quest Consulting Ltd and Aberdeen University are working jointly on a Teaching Company Scheme, part funded by the Government, to develop methods and tools for targeting the inspection of offshore structures at areas of greatest criticality on a sound scientific basis. This paper presents the results of ongoing research and proposes that planned inspection should include a refined risk assessment to rank components and define the most appropriate inspection methods and optimum inspection intervals for a given structure.

In that time the economic drive was supported by almost thirty years of high growth and was then maintained through the subsequent steady growth environment following the oil crisis in 1972. But now in 1995 the economy is struggling to restore its once well defined purpose and closely sustained vitality. </jats:p><jats:p> There is pressure at home for Japan to deregulate and withdraw its public planning in favour of entrepreneurial spirits that some see as the only force able to lead the economy to the next stage of expansion. Abroad, there are similar pressures aiming to penetrate Japan's affluent market by reducing the government's influence in economic planning. </jats:p><jats:p> With such conjectures I interviewed 71 selected senior officers from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) in Tokyo over the period from 1991 to 1993. I wanted to understand their own views on economic planning and reveal the intricacies of the ‘planning mind'. My analysis of the interviews is still in progress. However, I can report that the planning mind (at least in MITI) is still intact. It is searching for a new direction with the scope to make it effective in the changing policy environment. MITI officials are still searching for ways to maintain economic dynamism and growth, but MITI's traditional industry structure policy is being replaced with a new focus on restructuring norms across all aspects of life. The issues of the improvement of quality of life and creating wealth have become central to the well organised work process. </jats:p>",

The material build-up rate can be planned to achieve the desired distribution of the physical/material properties within the object volume. Examples of optimal motion planning for the generation of some basic solid objects and computer simulation of the effectiveness of the developed methodology are presented.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we describe a case study of a northern hardwood forest stand intended for timber production but showing crown dieback and mortality. Plans for a diameter-limit cut were confounded by the presence of diseased and poor quality trees (especially sugar maples), a history of high-grading, and fair to poor site characteristics for sugar maple growth over much of the area. After evaluating the site, we suggested a revised management plan including a shelterwood cut favoring regeneration of both yellow birch and sugar maple. Forest management decisions based on ecological and economic considerations can promote both the long-term health and productivity of forest stands. However, management for long-term health and productivity are not likely to be accomplished under current market conditions in much of New England. North. J. Appl. For. 12(3):121-126.</jats:p>",

In Corner Brook, Newfoundland, these interests were brought together in 1984 when the long-time owners of the local paper mill, the main employer in this single-industry town, put it up for sale. Restructuring was essential in order to secure the long-term future of the mill and the town, but its achievement in situ required difficult negotiations. The new forms of production needed to modernise the mill entailed greater structural rigidity in plant operations, matched by greater flexibility of the labour force. This goal was to be achieved through costabilisation of the various elements forming the local regime of accumulation, with the local state playing a key role as facilitator, guarantor, and promoter of restructuring. It culminated in the passage of two controversial acts by the provincial legislature to satisfy the demands of the potential corporate purchaser of the mill. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new approach to process modeling, task synthesis, and trajectory planning for robotic assembly is presented. Assembly is modeled as a discrete event dynamic system incorporating both discrete and continuous aspects of the process. The discrete event nature of assembly due to contact state transitions is modeled using Petri nets. The Petri net modeling enables a compact graphical description of causal contact state transitions and provides a coherent mathematical representation of both the discrete and continuous dynamics. In contrast to the traditional contact state network, the Petri net modeling also incorporates causality. Using discrete event modeling, an efficient assembly strategy is found. A discrete event trajectory is determined using dynamic programming to minimize the path length and the uncertainty during assembly. Lastly, an optimal event trajectory is calculated to demonstrate the method. This paper lays the foundation of discrete event modeling for robotic assembly. An new avenue for the analysis and synthesis of significant aspects of the assembly process is opened.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Models of migration between regions are often based on the assumption that individual moves can be modelled by a Poisson distribution whose parameter is a function of origin and destination characteristics, and generalized cost; this is true of Poisson regression models and spatial interaction models. The Poisson assumption is that each individual acts independently from others making the same move. In fact, migration is usually engaged in by household groups, not independent individuals, making the Poisson assumption invalid. It is possible instead to construct a model in which the probability of a household moving is given by a Poisson model and the number of individuals in a moving household is given by an observed household-size distribution. This generalized Poisson model is explained and fitted to a set of data on local-level migration within the English county of Hereford and Worcester. However, the sparse nature of the data set raises problems in assessing goodness of fit because the deviance value is unusually low. This is tackled here with a simulation methodology. </jats:p>",

How the new mixed economy is expected to work is less clear. In this paper we focus on two crucial aspects of the change with respect to care services—in emergent local mixed economies of care—with the help of case studies drawn from Buckinghamshire and Birmingham. We stress the need to recognise the role of local differences in the construction and interpretation of mixed economies of care, so that there is not just one, but may be many (locally distinctive) mixed economies. And we emphasise the need to take into account the rise of managerialism as a means of dealing with problems of coordination within local mixed economies, particularly because of the way in which it may undermine alternative forms of coordination and control. </jats:p>",

Using the Mazmanian and Sabatier policy implementation framework, this article examines U.S. family planning policies with a pooled time series analysis from 1982 to 1988. Of the four family planning statutes, only Title X, the categorical grant program, meets the criteria of a coherent statute. The data analysis reveals that a dollar spent through Title X has a much greater impact on birth rates, abortion rates, late prenatal care, and infant and neonatal mortality than does a dollar spent through other programs. The results are strong evidence in support of designing policies with coherent statutes.</jats:p>",

The model allows for experimentation in a variety of areas, including setting buffer sizes, buffer management techniques, input/output control, and capacity management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the paper we critically examine Jessop's regulationist theorisation of state restructuring, focusing on his claim that a transition is underway from the Keynesian welfare state of the Fordist era to a new, post-Fordist Schumpeterian workfare state (SWS). According to Jessop, the strategic orientations of the SWS are for the promotion of innovation and structural competitiveness in economic policy (hence Schumpeter), and for the enhancement of flexibility and competitiveness in social policy (hence workfare). We seek to interrogate Jessop's claims by way of a case study of ‘leading edge’ state restructuring in the United Kingdom, the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) initiative. The structure and discourses of TECs strongly echo Jessop's rendering of the neoliberal SWS: they are locally based, privatised and business-led bodies, contracted to central government to provide market-relevant training and enterprise services, to operate workfare-style programmes for the unemployed, and to restore through supply-side measures the dynamism and competitiveness of local economies. At the same time, however, as acting as potential exemplars of SWS institutional forms, TECs may also be illuminating incipient contradictions in (one of) its neoliberal variants. The TECs illustrate some of the problems associated with the geographical reconstitution of the state, which Jessop terms ‘hollowing out’, while also raising questions about the sustainability of the neoliberal SWS. Though the TECs may be pioneering new (local) ways of disciplining the unemployed, they are seen to be singularly ineffective in reproducing a flexible labour force. The TEC experience might be summarised as: workfare, yes; Schumpeter, no.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within a context of the restructuring of the welfare state, housing associations have become the main providers of social housing. Welfare pluralists, as well as the government, would see this as a positive change, since housing associations are perceived as voluntary, independent, and small scale, responding to a diversity of local needs. Using data obtained during interviews in four case-study areas, I argue, however, that the rhetoric is not underpinned by the reality. The very process of change has, in fact, led to increasing control by central, and to some extent local, governments, so that a more appropriate conceptualisation is that of housing associations as a ‘shadow state’. The results of this are changes in the type of housing being built, in the sort of tenants being housed, and in the compromises over the aims and ethos of housing associations themselves. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the nature, outcomes, and regional effects of conflicts over the municipal affiliation of industrial areas and large facilities in urban fringe and rural areas in Israel are examined, based on an analysis of sixty-seven conflicts that took place during the period 1961–93. It is demonstrated that the potential for conflicts has increased because of the growing dispersal of industry into rural space, the increasing reliance of local government on self-income, and unique Israeli circumstances. These conditions have encouraged two contradictory options for local government, both promoted by neoconservative free-market approaches. The first consists of a growing role for local government in economic development efforts, accompanied by intense competition among local authorities and by the establishment of voluntary modes of municipal cooperation in initiating and managing industrial areas. Cooperation is intended to achieve a just distribution of regional wealth and to promote the fiscal soundness of local government. The second option is to remove nodes of economic development from local government to local industrial councils and to free export processing zones, loosely controlled by the central government. These initiatives practically strip local government of its potential industrial base, with the intention of promoting national and regional economic growth. Reforms of the above types tend to originate in the periphery, where the flexibility to change existing structures is greater than in central regions. Despite this pioneering role of the periphery, the specific implications of these reforms for local autonomy and fiscal viability of local government in peripheral regions are, at best, mixed. </jats:p>",

Against these contexts, and through a chronological account which begins with the impacts of Portuguese colonialism and Mozambican nationalist responses, we analyse the contradictory impact of political and economic changes accompanying colonialism, independence, attempted socialist transformation, and the end of socialism in Mozambique as they are mediated through the built environment of the Mozambican capital city of Maputo. The combined political, social, and cultural facets within these transformations and continuities are evident throughout the account and we specify some of the ways in which these are intertwined with the political economy of urbanization. In the conclusion we reconsider what the changing trajectory of Maputo represents in global and comparative terms. We do so with reference to debates about the changing forms of international capitalist regulation and the reconfiguration of dependency. </jats:p>",

This paper describes a methodology developed to compile a treatment‐oriented land‐use planning scheme for a hilly watershed using a geographical information system (GIS). A remote sensing based physiographic soils map and a digital elevation model (DEM) are the sources of soil depth and slope steepness classes, respectively, and are the information databases for GIS analysis. The GIS was used to integrate these databases and provide tools for manipulation of the data. A set of knowledge‐based rules was formed from the classification scheme formulated by Sheng and Stennett (1975) for hilly watersheds, modified to allow for the local land‐use patterns. These rules were used to manipulate the databases and allow the establishment of a sustained land‐use system in the watershed with proper soil and water conservation measures. This biological engineering scheme would be a safeguard against soil erosion and other environmental threats. A priority sub‐watersheds delineation survey conducted in the watershed indicates significant variation in the silt yield index values, which calls for conservation planning in earnest in cases of high and very high priority sub‐watersheds.</jats:p>",

The problems of small size are exacerbated by the demand within these communities for high levels and a high quality of service provision. The existing local government network in these rural and rurban areas is unable to cope with the increased demand emanating from these new communities. This is particularly problematic in Israel, where the rural system of local government, the regional councils, have traditionally fulfilled the role of providing services to agricultural and cooperative communities. In this paper the nature of the service demands made by new exurban communities in Israel, the problems encountered by the regional councils in providing these same services, and the tensions which result from this lack of compatibility are discussed. Proposed functional solutions are presented and compared, ranging from minor modifications to the existing system of rural local government to those which require a change in the formal municipal status of the exurban communities. </jats:p>",

The primary focus of this literature has been on service users (or ‘consumers’) and the local taxpayer. In this paper, however, we attempt an analysis of these changes in terms of their impact on the nature of work within public sector services. Empirical evidence of geographical and sectoral variations in the degree of success of the private sector in winning contracts is considered, and explanations for these variations are offered. In particular, the discussion focuses on variations in the form of work in different sectors and the treatment of workers in different places and in different types of services, through a study of the labour processes involved and a consideration of the diverse potential for different fractions of capital to benefit from the introduction of CCT. Last, the concept of ‘hollowing out’ is reworked in order to further assist the theorisation of employment and other contemporary changes in the local state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Reassignment of local functions to state government and fiscal decentralisation seem to be contradictory. Whether these fiscal strategies are compatible policy packages is an empirical question. The crucial issue is as to how local governments respond to reassignment, a response which may be reflected in their willingness to spend on remaining functions. If reassignment stimulates local expenditure such that the extent of decline in fiscal decentralisation (the local share in total state–local expenditure) is less than the amount warranted, the two fiscal strategies can be taken to be compatible. To test this hypothesis, conditions for compatibility are postulated in terms of tax efforts of state and local governments. With use of Indian fiscal data, state and local tax efforts are computed and compared for selected states, as a first approximation. There is no conclusive evidence to show that reassignment has invariably exerted any dampening impact on local expenditure. </jats:p>",

A given landfill site is spatially decomposed into cells using a recursive spatial decomposition technique. The cell size is determined using a probabilistic model for waste generation. Variation in the amount of waste generated on a given day is handled by a further spatial decomposition of a cell into monominoes. The recursive spatial decomposition processes of a landfill site into cells and each cell into monominoes are accomplished by employing a variant of quadtree data structure. A three‐dimensional path plan for an autonomous compactor that considers a variable working gradient in the range of 3:1 to 2:1 is generated for a pair of monominoes. Automatic location of the working place for a compactor is accomplished by a recursive traversal of the quadtree structure. The algorithms have been implemented using a computer‐graphic functional interface standard with C‐program binding.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A method has been developed to measure a photon penumbra‐generating kernel using dosimetry equipment available in most radiation therapy departments. The kernel is used in a convolution‐adapted ratio‐TAR algorithm in our three‐dimensional treatment planning system. The kernel is assumed to be invariant with respect to off‐axis position, axially symmetric, and is divided into short‐ and long‐range components, with a different measurement technique for each. The data required to obtain the short‐range component are measured by scanning across a split‐field geometry incident on a water phantom. The derivative of the measured profile is proportional to one‐dimensional projections across the kernel. Because the kernel is axially symmetric, only one profile measurement is required for each depth. A CT reconstruction technique is used to extract the radial dependence of the kernel from the strip integrals. Electronic noise in the acquisition system yields significant uncertainties in the kernel shape for distances beyond 3 cm. The long‐range portion of the kernel is obtained by examining tissue–air ratios (TARs). The derivative of the TAR at the center of a circular field is proportional to the kernel value at the distance corresponding to the radius of the field. The kernel measurement method was tested by comparing measured and calculated square‐field profiles at a variety of depths. Agreement was within 1% within the field boundary and 3% outside the field boundary for all depths.</jats:p>",

The first section discusses a socio‐demographic trend analysis of Lebanese emigrants during the period 1975‐ 1994. In the second section, renewed brain influx policy implications and conditions are identified and evaluated through applying the Contingency Typology Simulation Heuristic approach to crisis networking and the Risk Path Analysis Model of creeping crisis multi‐level contingency schema in the context of the multinational intellectual emigration stages. Finally, the author identifies a work‐in‐progress research agenda, providing directions for future research, within the area of systems evolution, intellectual emigration and politics of multinational brain drain.</jats:p>",

For design, the DSPL language uses sponsor-selectors to select between alternate, fixed plans to determine the best approach for the design of an artifact. For diagnosis, the Peirce and TIPS system used sponsor-selectors as the overall control mechanism, determining which problem-solver, out of a group of problem-solving agents, to select under particular problem solving conditions. For navigation planning, the Router system used the sponsor-selector mechanism and the TIPS architecture to select between alternate problem-solving strategies. problem-solving approaches.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>In designing an assembly product, maintainability is a crucial issue that determines whether certain parts can be accessed for routine maintenance. In the past its study has been largely manual and labor intensive. Either by using physical mockup or computer animation with CAD models of a design, the task relies on human to provide an access path for the part. In this paper we present an automated system that replaces the traditional manual process. By applying results from and developing extensions to the motion planning research in robotics, we demonstrate that this automated system is an effective addition to CAD systems. We specifically describe the extension that accounts for special motion constraints imposed by designers. We also present experimental results from applying such a system to problems in industrial applications. The results show that such an system can not only reduce the turn-around time for checking maintainability of a product but also provide more accurate feedback to the designers on potential maintenance problems.</jats:p>",

The system allows the human designer to exploit inherent knowledge of assembly ordering, design parallelism, and other assembly factors to evaluate and visualize candidate assembly plans. The designer interacts with both geometric and abstract representations of the assembly using virtual environment peripherals such as a head-coupled display, six-degree-of-freedom trackers, and an instrumented glove. The system addresses several problems inherent in algorithmic assembly planning.</jats:p>",

High level process planning is a way to aid designers to improve their design with respect to the capabilities of potential partners. An automated high level process planning system for mechanical components has been developed which considers both global and partner-specific manufacturing capabilities so that cost, cycle time, and quality attributes can be derived for a given design. The system generates a set of manufacturing operations and candidate partner plants that can contribute to the manufacture of the candidate design. The most promising process plans resulting from this process may be used be used to select the most suitable partners for the virtual enterprise.</jats:p>",
