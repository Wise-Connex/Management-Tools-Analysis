Natural Gas demand has increased by 75% over the past twenty years and its share in the total energy consumption is globally expected to increase from 23% in 2002 to 28% by the end of 2005. Pakistan has proven reserves of 796.32 Bcm (28.10 Tcf) and net annual gas consumption of 34.09 Bcm (1.203 Tcf). At present Pakistan's energy mix comprises 50% of Natural Gas share and there is continuous rise in gas consumption with a target to extend it to about 55%. Paper discusses chronology of Pakistan's Natural Gas starting from first find in 1952 and development of most extensive transmission and distribution network over the years. Conclusively, the paper would focus to demonstrate the upcoming challenges in Pakistan to meet the growing demands in addition to the opportunities that such challenges bring along.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Natural Gas has already played a vital role in shaping the industry outlook and meeting energy demands in North America, Western and Eastern European countries, and industrialized Asia due to its availability and environmental acceptance. The availability of Natural Gas worldwide and specifically the abundance in Middle East, coupled with its environmental acceptability and various applications across all sectors, will continue to play an increasingly important role in meeting demand for energy in the World. Natural Gas is one of the cleanest, safest, and most useful of all energy sources. Natural gas is the most precious energy source which has extremely efficient BTU input to BTU use ratio. It is also a major feedstock for the production of ammonia for use in fertilizer production and a cleaner fuel choice for power plants.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>World Natural Gas Scenario</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The World gas scenario has changed rapidly in the last decade. Today Natural Gas is the fastest growing primary energy source. Presently world Natural Gas proven reserves are 6,337 Tcf. More than 75% of world gas reserves are held by ten countries, which represent 40% of the total natural gas exports through pipeline and/or LNG. Pakistan is ranked at number 30 and represents 0.4% of world gas reserves.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The RNA World hypothesis states that the present-day life, which is based on DNA genomes and protein enzymes, was preceded by a simpler life form based primarily on RNA. During this era, the genetic information resided in the sequence of RNA molecules and the phenotype derived from the catalytic properties of RNA. Though it is a widely accepted scenario, a number of problems remain unsolved. One of the biggest questions is how complex RNAs could evolve, survive and replicate under typically assumed ''warm and wet'' conditions, taking into account that the RNA phosphodiester backbone is chemically unstable under these conditions. We suggest that prebiotic conditions associated with freezing could have been of key importance in the early RNA World, and discuss the role of primitive catalytic RNA in the evolution of RNA size and complexity.\n                        </jats:p>"

With the help of a hydrodynamic model of the North Sea, these atmospheric future conditions are used to project storm surge heights for the Northwest European Shelf Sea. Four different projections are presented, all generated with the same Regional Climate Model, which itself is driven with two different Global Climate Model scenarios both exposed to two different emission scenarios. The analyses are carried out for a 30‐year time‐slice at the end of the 21st century. All four ensemble members point to a significant increase of storm surge elevations for the continental North Sea coast of between 15 and almost 25 cm. However, the different storm surge projections are not statistically distinguishable from each other but can provide a range of possible evolutions of surge extremes in a warmer climate.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents simulation of Lake Tana reservoir future water use under emerging scenario with and without climate change impacts.    Two different development and climate change scenarios were developed to simulate Lake Tana water level i.e., i) Base line scenario (1991-2000) ,ii) Future development scenario on short term periods(2031-2040) , and ii) Future development scenario on long term periods (2091-2100). River head flow estimated by Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used as an input to Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model to simulate the Lake level for each scenario.   Based on WEAP model simulation results, demand coverage and reliability of 100% was observed in all scenarios for Tana-Beles hydropower project. For scenarios without climate change impacts, there are longer periods of time when mean monthly lake levels are below 1785 masl (i.e., the minimum lake level required for shipping). Under natural conditions (lake level without project), they exceed this level in 100%.under current conditions (Base line scenario, BLS), they exceed this level in 89% of the months. In the full development scenario (FDSCÊ¹), this will decrease to 83%. For all scenarios with climate change impacts, Lake water Level will not significantly be affected by climate change impacts.</jats:p>"
