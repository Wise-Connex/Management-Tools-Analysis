      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that an inadvertent side effect of the current preoccupation with planning from below has been a lack of attention to public sector planning at the top, which remains a critical institutional mechanism for development. To be effective, however, public sector planners must anticipate institutional resistance to their efforts, particularly from within the state structure, and incorporate this understanding into the formulation and sequencing of planning tasks in unorthodox and counterintuitive ways. Drawing on examples of planning for the provision of housing and employment for the urban poor in newly industrializing nations, the article demonstrates that in effective practice, substantive and procedural theories of planning are not separated, because planning procedures are largely influenced by the particular substantive nature of problems to be addressed. Hence, planning theorists need to better understand the substantive nature of problems in order to provide practicing planners with institutional insights about the type of resistance they are likely to encounter when a problem is formulated in a particular way. This awareness of resistance to planning was absent in development planning's formative years; but the last 50 years of planning experience have generated rich tacit knowledge which, if formalized, can contribute to more effective public sector planning. </jats:p>",

From the positive aspect they need to know their institutional environment: institutionalization theory can help. Three 'schools' of institutionalization theory are presented: 'Historical', 'Rational Choice' and 'Sociological Institutionalism'. The normative aspect of institutional transformation is institutional design: planning often demands this. Institutional design is defined and described: what is it, where is it done, and who does it. The article identifies the institutional-agent interactions that are the media and tools of institutional design, and reviews some of the knowledge base for institutional design practice under the headings of governance, coordination, and agency. </jats:p>",

East St. Louis provides a useful context to trace the history of planning because it is a city that has been mired in the very social, economic, and environmental problems that compel new planning approaches. At the same time, the inability to resolve the city's problems reveals the limitations and ultimate inadequacy of any singular approach. The article tracks the evolution of the city, the catalysts for planning activities, different approaches used, and results of these efforts. It notes that each new approach rejects the previous approach in light of its failure to solve what might be entrenched, complex problems faced by the city. The conclusion calls to question this dismissal of past approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that society as a whole and planning in particular need more creative responses to the problems and challenges they face. Planning needs creativity to imagine and to construct (structurally) different futures. First, the article briefly analyses two case studies: the Hasselt case as an example of creative transport planning and creative local governance; and the Perth case as an example of distorted creativity. Then the article questions the nature of planning creativity needs and looks for a systematic method. Scenario building turns out to be an excellent tool for conceiving possible futures and their processes, what must be changed first and what next. Just as there are many traditions and collective practices there are also many images of what a society wants to achieve. As the opportunities for implementing images are not equal the article reflects on a planning annex governance system that serves all citizens and especially the least powerful. All this has an impact on planners as well. In the final part, the article touches briefly on some preconditions for creativity, on how it could be enhanced and on how realistic the discourse itself is. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Against a background of socio-economic change, planning practitioners are struggling to embrace the various processes of transformation of structures and practices in meaningful ways. Theorists, in turn, are struggling to come to terms with these practice transformations. Whilst many theorists would accept the need for dynamic, relational approaches there is strong debate about the meanings and implications of new theory. Tensions may arise from fundamental differences between transcendental and immanent frames: practice and theory seek immanence, yet are caught in remnants of transcendence. I explore the potential of Deleuze and Guattari's concept of 'becoming' as creative experimentation. I conclude that planning may involve a transcendental structure immanent in its practical local expressions; and that theorizing could benefit from ' becomingplanning'. </jats:p>",

The presence of geographically localized spillovers in a region attracts firms and thereby leads to a higher level of agglomeration. On the other hand, the agglomeration of firms facilitates localized spillovers through local innovation networks. The endogenous nature of the relationship between spillovers and agglomeration, however, has been rarely acknowledged in the existing literature. This article critically reviews a wide range of issues related to technology spillovers and agglomeration and proposes a comprehensive conceptual framework to understand the mechanism of regional economic development. </jats:p>",

Costs to enact, enforce, and defend the restrictions may divert scarce resources. The multi-disciplinary literature encompasses books, articles, court testimony, and court rulings on exotic dance written by researchers in anthropology, architecture, biology, criminology, economics, journalism, law, photography, planning, police work, psychology, real estate, and sociology, as well as accounts presented by former exotic dancers. Topics include First Amendment-related characteristics of exotic dance, its expressive components, performers, patrons, adversaries, and supporters; the validity of studies used to justify zoning, alcohol beverage control, and other restrictive ordinances; and legal justifications and limitations on regulating exotic dance. </jats:p>",

The plan proposed an extensive system of parkways linking public open spaces, which would serve as spines around which low-density suburban neighborhoods would be built. Two long and complexly designed parkways were built, Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway, and special platting was laid out for an envisioned neighborhood, but little development occurred around the parkways for forty years. This article looks at the evolution of built form around the parkways from before they were constructed until the present day, analyzing the development that actually occurred in relation to the original planning vision. </jats:p>",

Between 1915, when he arrived in St. Louis, and 1950, when he retired from civil service to run his private firm, Bartholomew cultivated a professional practice through activities of widely varied scope. He grounded these activities in an urban knowledge system that disciplined the ways in which planning interventions were imagined, organized, and implemented. At the core of this system was a conception of the city as an amalgam of parts, the functions of which could be studied through the derivation of land use ratios. Using St. Louis as a laboratory, Bartholomew assembled a vision of the city and a planning methodology that paved the way for dramatic urban reconstruction after World War II. </jats:p>",

Although the physiology of dying may be the same for most expected deaths, the psychological, spiritual, cultural, and family issues are as unique and varied as the patients and families themselves. As death nears, the goals of care must be discussed and appropriately redefined. Some treatments may be discontinued, and symptoms may intensify, subside, or even appear anew. Physiological changes as death approaches must also be defined, explained, and interpreted to the patient, whenever possible, as well as to the patient’s family, close others, and caregivers. The nurse occupies a key position in assisting patients’ family members at the time of death by supporting or suggesting death rituals, caring for the body after death, and facilitating early grief work. Most of the focus on death and dying in the past has been on dying in general, making the need for a chapter focused specifically on the actual death even more important.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Between 1998 and 2004, the planning community has seen vast progress in terms of the sizes of benchmark examples that domain-independent planners can tackle successfully. The key technique behind this progress is the use of heuristic functions based on relaxing the planning task at hand, where the relaxation is to assume that all delete lists are empty. The unprecedented success of such methods, in many commonly used benchmark examples, calls for an understanding of what classes of domains these methods are well suited for.   In the investigation at hand, we derive a formal background to such an understanding. We perform a case study covering a range of 30 commonly used STRIPS and ADL benchmark domains, including all examples used in the first four international planning competitions. We *prove* connections between domain structure and local search topology -- heuristic cost surface properties -- under an idealized version of the heuristic functions used in modern planners. The idealized heuristic function is called h^+, and differs from the practically used functions in that it returns the length of an *optimal* relaxed plan, which is NP-hard to compute. We identify several key characteristics of the topology under h^+, concerning the existence/non-existence of unrecognized dead ends, as well as the existence/non-existence of constant upper bounds on the difficulty of escaping local minima and benches. These distinctions divide the (set of all) planning domains into a taxonomy of classes of varying h^+ topology. As it turns out, many of the 30 investigated domains lie in classes with a relatively easy topology. Most particularly, 12 of the domains lie in classes where FF's search algorithm, provided with h^+, is a polynomial solving mechanism.   We also present results relating h^+ to its approximation as implemented in FF. The behavior regarding dead ends is provably the same. We summarize the results of an empirical investigation showing that, in many domains, the topological qualities of h^+ are largely inherited by the approximation. The overall investigation gives a rare example of a successful analysis of the connections between typical-case problem structure, and search performance. The theoretical investigation also gives hints on how the topological phenomena might be automatically recognizable by domain analysis techniques. We outline some preliminary steps we made into that direction. </jats:p>"

The options developed were then compared on an equal basis using the principles of LCP to identify the suite of lowest cost options to be considered for further analysis and implementation. The suite of demand management options developed was found to have the lowest whole of society levelised cost. Since the preliminary analysis and release of the Water Resources Strategy in April 2004, a water efficiency team has been set up to develop an implementation plan, implement options, develop an end use model, conduct pilot studies and undertake program evaluations.</jats:p>",

Dieffenbaugher, SPE, and R. Dupre, SPE, Chevron Corp., and G. Authement, SPE, G. Mullen, SPE, Y. Gonzalez, SPE, and P.B. Tanche-Larsen, Baker Hughes Drilling Fluids, prepared for the 2005 SPE/IADC Drilling Conference, Amsterdam, 23–25 February.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Drilling-fluids planning plays a major role in reducing the likelihood of drilling problems in ultradeep waters. Because deepwater drilling is expensive, proper drilling-fluid selection requires careful planning. Common deepwater challenges include hydrate suppression, shallow water flows, equivalent-circulating-density (ECD) management, lost circulation, and viscosity profiles. The full-length paper discusses the planning and execution of a drilling-fluids program for a world-record ultradeepwater well in 10,011 ft of water in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) Alaminos Canyon Block 951. The well was drilled to a total depth of 22,695 ft by use of an advanced synthetic-based mud (SBM) that met all GOM compliance requirements.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since the mid-1990s, operators have explored and developed fields in ever-increasing water depths. The industry has identified techniques and developed new technology that allows them to drill wells safely and successfully in water depths greater than 10,000 ft. Because of the presence of young sedimentary deposits, many of these wells have an extremely narrow margin between the pore pressure and reservoir fracture pressure. The deeper the operator can set the initial casing string, the greater the likelihood of drilling success. Use of a riserless drilling technique has been instrumental in extending casing depths in deepwater and ultradeepwater environments. This technique played an important role in the success of this challenging ultradeepwater project, because the initial upper section was extended to obtain required leakoff tests (LOTs) at the 22- and 17⅞-in. casing shoes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The unmatched combination of technical performance and environmental compliance of synthetic-based drilling fluids has made them the preferred fluids for deepwater drilling in the GOM. On the basis of an overall analysis of this project, the operator selected a proprietary synthetic drilling fluid for drilling the well from the 18×22-in. section to total depth (TD). This decision was based primarily on the presence of highly reactive shales in the deepwater formations and the previous performance of the drilling fluid in offset wells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Several important factors must be considered in the deepwater environment. Most important is the effect of temperature and pressure on the fluid system. As water depth increases, temperature decreases and pressure at the seabed increases. A typical temperature curve for the GOM indicates an average seabed temperature lower than 40°F at water depths greater than 4,000 ft. This cooling, combined with increased pressure, influences drilling-fluid design. Because of the chemical composition of the GOM-compliant synthetic-based fluids, the cooling will increase the viscosity of a base fluid, resulting in an increase in the overall drilling-fluid viscosity.</jats:p>",

Resulting from design diagnosis, a typical decomposition pattern solution to a given redesign problem indicates the portions of the design model necessary for recomputation as well as the interaction part within the model accountable for design change propagation. Following this, in this paper we suggest repair actions with an approach derived from an input pattern solution, to generate a redesign road map allowing for taking a shortcut in the redesign solution process. To do so, a two-stage redesign planning approach from recomputation strategy selection to redesign road map generation is proposed. An example problem concerning the redesign of a relief valve is used for illustration and validation.</jats:p>",

The interurban panel dataset utilised in this study does represent a step forward, by permitting more robust econometric estimation and by incorporating a wider, more balanced range of determinant factors. A coherent set of relationships governing the key market outcomes-house prices, new building, migration and vacancies-can be established. The modelling framework is used to explore differences in behavioural responses between markets in 'high' and 'low' demand states. Simulations are used to track the impact on market outcomes of different policy strategies applied in different types of locality. Supply measures needed to achieve national targets for house price growth reduction are assessed. Measures acting on both demand-side and supply-side variables in areas of high and low demand are compared. These suggest that output is more sensitive than price to policies and that quite strong, concerted policies would be needed to impact significantly on the major market imbalances currently seen. </jats:p>",

However, the analysis suggests that the international economy is developing along a distinct path towards supranational regional bloc formations rather than towards an ever more global pattern. The consequences of this shaping of the international economy for the processes of standard setting in a number of different contexts are discussed. </jats:p>",

The study considers the dedication practice of regional and structure planning, which take in a key position in the precautionary minimization of conflicts and in the provision of land. It becomes clear in this context that the already dedicated land potentials for wind energy will tend to be reduced rather than extended in the future and that a growth of the produced wind energy can be achieved mainly by the re-powering of existing locations. The environmentally compatible management of these locations is one of the tasks of regional planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) offers an unparalleled opportunity for improving river basin management. Active participation is essential for its delivery. “End-of-pipe” solutions will not deliver the improvements needed to achieve its ambitious goals. This research tested DesignWays, a toolkit for participatory planning, as a mechanism for maximizing the long-term social and environmental benefits of such stakeholder and community participation. It examined the emerging role of “planning for sustainability” in the context of river catchments. Sustainable management of water requires integration, and recognition of interconnections between systems at different levels of scale. This is an endeavour in which systems thinking provides useful tools. The development of DesignWays was a conscious attempt to embed ‘new paradigm’ living systems metaphors into a practical planning tool. This paper begins with a description of DesignWays and its development in Southern Africa. An outline of the context of the action research in North-West England is followed by a description of the stages of the process, with highlights of the outcomes. This research had two major outcomes: a contribution to theory through an in-depth exploration of the theoretical basis of participatory, ecologically informed design; and a contribution to practice through investigating DesignWays' potential to meet key challenges of the WFD. This research points to the importance of understanding participatory planning as a societal process, aiming to make the process engaging and meaningful. It has pointed to the need to see participatory planning and education for sustainability as an integrated process. It demonstrated the benefits of an iterative process in which planning at the landscape level of scale informs, and is informed by, work at the site level. It has shown that an approach consistent with a living systems paradigm can contribute to the development of more integrated, ecologically sound plans.</jats:p>",

The research discussed investigates two case studies of deliberative exercises used by local authorities to develop their local transport plans. The analysis avoids the rather simplistic 'check list' evaluative models based upon the Habermasian ideals of communicative rationality and instead develops an approach which attends to the power relations embedded in the process of participation. Significantly, the research, across a range of stakeholder groups, reveals a deeply problematic relationship between citizen involvement and established structures of democratic decision-making. Attention is drawn to the institutional constraints which account for the limited realisation of the participatory agenda in local governance. Conclusions are also developed relating to both the process of participation evaluation and the wider consequences of the expansion of public involvement for the renewal of local democracy. </jats:p>",

IPY will seek to exploit new technological and logistical capabilities, and make major advances in knowledge and understanding. Key objectives are to attract and develop the next generation of polar researchers and engineers, and to engage the interest and involvement of polar residents, and of schoolchildren, the general public, and decision makers, worldwide.

Drawing on a case-study of the Central Thuringia planning region, the analysis focuses initially on the question of whether population shrinkage and ageing actually impact on levels of road traffic, or whether their effects are offset by other factors. As the authors report, road-traffic volumes are no longer growing relentlessly; in the period between 1995 and 2000, they were, in some areas, already in decline. Additional growth in the future is likely, however, essentially on those routes which are of European significance, whilst the more sparsely populated rural regions are expected to see a continuing decline in traffic levels. The conclusion drawn by the authors in the light of prevailing demographic and financial circumstances is that regional planning can — and should — no longer go on calling for the expansion of all categories of the functional road network on a large scale (as has previously happened in Central Thuringia); it should rather address the issues thrown up by the actual development of traffic volumes.</jats:p>"

This assessment covered the entire business and has enabled ecological sustainability to be assessed in terms of quantitative indicators. The LCA was performed by firstly examining a base case which would eventuate if Sydney Water maintained its current operations with only the modifications, augmentations and upgrades planned for implementation between now and 2021. We then performed a number of scenario analyses to examine the benefits of additional demand management, energy efficiency, energy generation, supply augmentation and effluent quality initiatives. The results indicated significant improvements are available and that some of these measures are more desirable than others. We also examined a scenario for the alternative delivery of water and wastewater services in new urban areas. This showed quantitatively that, since connecting new fringe suburbs to the existing system requires significant expenditure on energy for pumping, major improvements in the sustainability of water and wastewater systems can be achieved by using localised, water-saving alternatives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, a general framework for trajectory planning and tracking is formulated for dynamically stabilized mobile systems, e.g., inverted wheeled pendulums and autonomous helicopters. Within this framework, the system state is divided into slow and fast substates. The fast substate is used as a pseudocontrol for tracking a desired slow substate trajectory. First, an exponential fast substate controller is designed to track a fast substate reference trajectory. This fast substate reference trajectory is, in turn, planned so that the slow substate follows its desired trajectory. To ensure that the fast substate reference trajectory is feasible for the exponential controller, it is designed using band-limited “Sinc” functions whose maximum frequency is less than the inverse of the time constant of the exponential controller. To illustrate the procedure, the dynamic model of an inverted wheeled pendulum is reformulated by a partial feedback linearization such that it is amenable to the separation into slow and fast components. The planning and tracking controller design is explained using simulation results. This technique is shown to be easily embedded inside a modified nonlinear model predictive control framework for the slow subsystem. This framework tries to explicitly take the computational delay into account. The computation time required for this technique is encouraging from a real-world implementation perspective.</jats:p>",

We also hypothesize that the management integrity assessment influences the auditor's evaluation of source credibility of management provided evidence beyond its influence via risk assessments (Beaulieu 2001).

We continue to find that management integrity impacts the persuasiveness of evidence sought beyond what is suggested by the auditor's risk assessment. Interestingly, even after controlling for prior-year errors, we find an inverse association between the auditor's assessment of management integrity and the likelihood of detecting misstatements, suggesting the management integrity assessment aids the auditor in ultimately discovering errors.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the emergence of firm-based global environmental standards as an approach to managing the environmental performance of complex global production networks. Firm-based global environmental standards exist when a firm defines a uniform set of process and product environmental performance requirements that must be adhered to by all of a firm's facilities around the world, even if these firm-based standards exceed the requirements of local and national environmental regulations. We identify increasingly stringent end-market environmental regulation, as well as growing concern over the need to protect a firm's reputational capital and operating legitimacy, as two key drivers of the adoption of firm-based environmental standards. Our analysis suggests, however, that firms are responding to these external drivers in part because of the characteristics of global production networks—a production form that depends on the ability to produce from any manufacturing plant to any end market. The paper examines the impact of firm-based environmental standards through case studies of a cement plant in Thailand and an electronics manufacturing plant in Penang, Malaysia. In line with the literature on new institution economics, the case studies demonstrate that firm-based standards are providing a platform for learning and innovation within the firm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore the remaking of globalized standards through harmonization, and its impact upon certified-organic and fair-trade agrofood networks. I focus on certification standards and discuss four shifts associated with globalized standards (an increased importance of multilateral institutions, changes to standards language, displacement of network-specific standards, and a shift away from relational standards). It is then argued, with reference to value-chain rent theory, that the shift to globalized standards has transformed rent relations in ways that benefit certain actors (that is, retailers) and imperil the earnings of others. In brief, globalized standards increase the costs of standards compliance, the full burden of which falls upon immiserated producers, to the point at which farmers see little economic advantage to certified-organic and fair-trade production. I then examine social-accountability standards that seek to ‘fight standards with standards’ by championing the consolidation of strong labor and environmental protections under a single label. The study suggests that a single-label strategy can be successful, yet must struggle to overcome a Polanyian double bind, for, in order to build broad coalitions necessary to extend the reach of protective standards, the coalitions must include corporate interests that prefer weaker, contract-based standards. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organ motion can have a severe impact on the dose delivered by radiation therapy, and different procedures have been developed to address its effects. Conventional techniques include breath hold methods and gating. A different approach is the compensation for target motion by moving the treatment beams synchronously. Practical results have been reported for robot based radiosurgery, where a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm delivers the dose. However, not all organs move in the same way, which results in a <jats:italic>relative</jats:italic> motion of the beams with respect to the body and the tissues in the proximity of the tumor. This relative motion can severely effect the dose delivered to critical structures. We propose a method to incorporate motion in the treatment planning for robotic radiosurgery to avoid potential overdosing of organs surrounding the target. The method takes into account the motion of all considered volumes, which is discretized for dose calculations. Similarly, the beam motion is taken into account and the aggregated dose coefficient over all discrete steps is used for planning. We simulated the treatment of a moving target with three different planning methods. First, we computed beam weights based on a 3D planning situation and simulated treatment with organ motion and the beams moving synchronously to the target. Second, beam weights were computed by the 4D planning method incorporating the organ and beam motion and treatment was simulated for beams moving synchronously to the target. Third, the beam weights were determined by the 4D planning method with the beams fixed during planning and simulation. For comparison we also give results for the 3D treatment plan if there was no organ motion and when the plan is delivered by fixed beams in the presence of organ motion. The results indicate that the new 4D method is preferable and can further improve the overall conformality of motion compensated robotic radiosurgery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Australian Financial Reporting Council recently shocked the world business community by unexpectedly announcing a change in the nation's approach to global-accounting-standards development. The change involved switching from ensuring consistency of Australian accounting standards with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) developed by the International Accounting Standards Board to outright adoption of IFRSs by 2005. At the time of the announcement, Australia had the most developed international harmonisation programme of any country with a well-developed financial reporting system. Events surrounding the change demonstrate how political the accounting standard-setting process can be as it continues to receive front-page media attention, and as it provides a platform in parliamentary and electoral debate. In the meantime, the US role in the global accounting standard-setting arena has moved through phases of indifference to potential active dominance, and European influences have waxed and waned. We examine whether swings in political and regulatory influences that occur when globalisation becomes a national and international goal are explained by regulatory capture theory. We also address the extent to which a subset of a single nation's regulatory system plays a key role in a series of larger national and international games. Drawing upon experiences in Australia, the United States, and the European Union, we identify political influences on initiatives to reform accounting-standard-setting environments, policies, and processes. </jats:p>",

Data about 3,548 participants in nine programs were obtained. Logistic regressions examine associations between independent variables and end-of-life treatment choices. Interviews with the programs’ medical directors augment quantitative analysis. When all of the known participant characteristics are accounted for, substantial amount of variation attributable to the program-indicator variable remains. Program effect explains 36% of the variation in do-not-resuscitate choice, 66% in the choice of artificial feeding, and 50% relating to the presence of health care proxy. The variation in treatment choices attributable to the program of enrollment and the interviews with the medical directors suggest that provider practice styles are important in determining patients’ choices at the end of life. Interventions to enhance advance care planning should target providers of care. </jats:p>",

Global labor standards are increasingly enforced through transnational corporation (TNC) adherence to voluntary codes rather than through national labor regulation. Nonetheless, privatized labor-standards regimes within TNCs continue to be influenced by the national market governance framework in the TNC country of origin. Although, in principle, labor standards are arrived at through global political processes, in practice they are applied in conjunction with TNC production and marketing strategies. The way in which corporate objectives intersect with labor practices is different from one TNC to another, depending in large part on political and regulatory influences in the country of origin of a particular TNC. </jats:p>",

After an examination of the planners’ debates in the Soviet Union during the 1930s, the three East German cities of Eisenhuttenstadt, Schwedt, and Berlin Marzahn are analyzed to show common features as well as the different pathways of urban development. Special attention is given to the relationship between inner-urban transformation and “extensive urbanism,” and to the question of socialist environmental problems and lifestyles. It is claimed that the socialist pathway of urban development differed considerably from the process of suburbanization in the Western countries and can be interpreted as an attempt to realize “socialist utopias” by forming socialist men, socialist families, and socialist neighborhoods with the help of urbanism. </jats:p>",

Next to countering geometric mismatches due to patient setup, smearing can also be used to counter the detrimental effects of breathing motion on the dose to the clinical target volume. We show that the lateral margin and smearing distance can be substantially smaller than the maximum tumor displacement due to setup errors and patient breathing, as measured by the <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6187-math-0015.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp6187:mp6187-math-0015\" /> and the EUD.</jats:p>",

But investment in far-flung jurisdictions carries with it risk and uncertainty, particularly when the corporate standards of firms in emerging markets are below those found in these investors' home countries. In order to mitigate the risks posed by poor corporate standards of behaviour, institutional investors increasingly apply nonfinancial criteria not only to individual firms in emerging markets, but to the corporate practices of whole countries. Though countries and their regulatory regimes are central to external capital-investment decisions, we find convergence to global standards occurs when key actors in the investment value chain demand levels of corporate and social behavior greater than those currently consistent with countries' own regulatory frameworks. We test this hypothesis using the decision of the California Public Employees Retirement System to screen out several emerging-market countries from their investment portfolio on the basis of a variety of nonfinancial criteria. </jats:p>",

We argue that institutional owners have a unique perspective and voice with which to contribute to the formulation of global standards in a variety of areas on the basis of their long-term financial interests. This conclusion is supported by an analytic review of the current state of global corporate governance, including multilateral initiatives (for example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the World Bank); an analysis of significant institutional investors, the role of various rating agencies (for example, Fitch, Moody's), the International Corporate Governance Network, and the growing role of various nongovernmental organizations (for example, the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economics, the Carbon Disclosure Project) in relation to corporate governance. </jats:p>",

The result is investors vulnerable to the risks companies face in global consumer and capital markets. Though some market risks are inevitable, others, such as reputation risk, can be mitigated through increased corporate social and environmental standards and the increased transparency that such higher standards demand. The transparency necessitated by reputation management has a dual role in monitoring corporate behaviour and providing all stakeholders (internal and external) with the information to evaluate corporate behaviour. Driving this process is the belief that higher standards of corporate responsibility pay off for investors over the long term both through potential equity premia and through risk reduction. This paper presents a model for understanding how and why institutional investors may encourage firms to adopt higher standards. To illustrate our argument, we refer to the experience of the UK Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) strategy of corporate engagement and the attempts of the USS to encourage firms to raise their environmental standards by focusing on the climate change impacts of pension-fund investments. Investor engagement in corporate responsibility offers an insight into the role of investors in global-standard setting and global citizenship. </jats:p>",

The discontinuity of water supply, water rationing by sector, nonexistence of operational control and changing regulation during the day by means of valves opening and closing made the system unpredictable. It was a real challenge to take into account all these factors and introduce them in a mathematical model. The result was a long-extended period model that was able to reproduce the system behavior with reliability in extended-period simulations. Based on it, a diagnosis of the critical points of the system was developed, that led to an improvement proposal. The proposals were focused on designing a controlled adduction system with the optimal operational behavior and without the necessity of making day-time changes for achieving a continuous and reliable water supply.</jats:p>",

Spain supports about 70% of the European population. We used stepwise logistic regression on a set of environmental, spatial and human variables to model Bonelli's eagle distribution in the 5167 UTM 10 × 10 km quadrats of peninsular Spain. We obtained a model based on 16 variables, which allowed us to identify favourable and unfavourable areas for this species in Spain, as well as intermediate favourability areas. We assessed the stepwise progression of the model by comparing the model's predictions in each step with those of the final model, and selected a parsimonious explanatory model based on three variables — slope, July temperature and precipitation — comprising 76% of the predictive capacity of the final model. The reported presences in favourable and unfavourable areas suggest a source–sink dynamics in Bonelli's eagle populations. The fragmented spatial structure of the favourable areas suggests the existence of a superimposed metapopulation dynamics. Previous LIFE (The Financial Instrument of the European Union for the Environment and Nature) projects for the conservation of this species have focused mainly on the northern limit of its range, where the sharpest population decline has been recorded. In these areas, favourability is low and Bonelli's eagle populations are probably maintained by the immigration of juveniles produced in more favourable zones. However, southern populations, although stable, show signs of reduction in productivity, which could menace the population sizes in the whole study area. We suggest that conservation efforts should focus also on known favourable areas, which might favour population persistence in unfavourable areas through dispersal.</jats:p>",

It encodes the complete connectivity of free space and allows us to perform exact path planning. We construct a roadmap by performing a sampling of the free space in a deterministic fashion. We obtain a set of deterministic samples by generating an adaptive volumetric grid. Our algorithm is simple to implement and uses two tests: a complex cell test and a star-shaped test during sample generation. These tests can be efficiently performed on polyhedral objects using max-norm distance computation and linear programming. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on environments with very small narrow passages or no collision-free paths. </jats:p>",

The Cimmino algorithm and search procedures based on that algorithm were tested for this purpose. A phase I motexafin lutetium (MLu)‐mediated photodynamic therapy protocol is ongoing at the University of Pennsylvania. PDT for the prostate is performed with cylindrical diffusing fibers of various lengths inserted perpendicular to a base plate to obtain longitudinal coverage by a matrix of parallel catheters. The standard plan for the protocol uses sources of equal strength with equal spaced <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7047-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp7047:mp7047-math-0001\" /> loading. Uniform optical properties were assumed. Our algorithms produce plans that cover the prostate and spare the urethra and rectum with less discrepancy from the dose prescription than the standard plan.

These interventions, however, have typically included changes in medical management, making it difficult to quantitate the key elements of a successful program involving education, discharge planning, and transitional care in the outpatient setting. The investigators utilized an experienced cardiac nurse educator to coordinate a targeted inpatient congestive heart failure education program coupled with comprehensive discharge planning and immediate outpatient reinforcement through a coordinated nurse‐driven home health care program. The comprehensive intervention resulted in a marked reduction in 6‐month readmission rates, from 44.2% to 11.4% (</jats:italic>p<jats:italic>=0.01). The average total cost saving for each subject in the interventional group was $1541, based on the decreased utilization of both skilled nursing services and home health care during outpatient follow‐up. The costs to implement an inpatient education program were negligible, at $158 per subject. There was no difference in discharge medications or medical management protocols that would have influenced these results.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: Given the elective nature of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the increased mortality and the potential loss of decision making capacity, patients undergoing HSCT are encouraged to have advanced care planning (ACP). This however could result in undue anxiety for the patient and their families since going through the process of having ACP explicitly raises the possibility of death. We compared the outcomes of patients with or without ACP who received HSCT for hematologic malignancies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Study Design: Patients age ≥19 yrs undergoing first allogeneic or autologous HSCT for a hematological malignancy between 2001 and 2003 were included in this study. Psychosocial assessments, including discussions about ACP, defined as having living will, power of attorney for health care, and life support instructions, conducted prior to transplant, were reviewed. Patients were classified according to presence or absence of ACP at HSCT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to compare the risk of 100-day mortality between those with and without ACP while controlling for patient-, disease-, and transplant-related variables. Other outcomes evaluated include: days of hospitalization and in-hospital mortality.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: Of the 380 eligible patients, psychosocial assessments were available for 343 patients (90%). Of these, 146 either had ACP (n=138, 40%) or completed it (n=8, 2%) during the pre-transplant process, while 197 did not have it but were open to the idea of having it in the future (n=161, 47%) or did not plan to have ACP (n=36, 11%). Older patients (p &lt;0.001), male sex (p &lt;0.01), and patients with lymphoma versus leukemia (p&lt;0.005) were more likely to have ACP. No differences in level of education, role of patient in the family, smoking or alcohol usage, usage of spiritual faith to cope with illness, stage of disease at transplant, type of transplant, and interval from diagnosis to transplant were noted between those with and without ACP. There was no difference in the risk of 100-day mortality (RR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.36 – 1.81) between patients with or without ACP after adjusting for disease stage and transplant type.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: The absence of differences in the outcomes of patients with or without ACP suggests that engagement in ACP is not reflective of HSCT risk. Factors other than outcome of HSCT need to be considered while counseling patients regarding ACP. The fact that only 40% of patients engaged in ACP prior to HSCT and 11% were not interested in ACP suggests that other factors determine interest in ACP and that a policy of discussing ACP with all HSCT patients will not result in universal acceptance of ACP.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Outcomes following HSCT based on ACP OUTCOME WITHOUT ACP (n = 197) WITH ACP (n = 146) p VALUE Probability of 100-day mortality (95% CI) 8 (4–12) 7 (4–12) 0.79 In-hospital deaths 5 (2%) 3 (2%) 0.94 Median hospital stay in days (range) 13 (8–59) 13 (3–158) 0.7</jats:p>",
