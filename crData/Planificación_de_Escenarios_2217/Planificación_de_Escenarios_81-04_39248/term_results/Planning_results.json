A micromodel actually models the individ ual units passing through the system, rather than dealing with aggregated statistics. The micromodel derives the overall effects of the system by summing its effects on a representative sample of individual units. This type of model is necessary because the complicated interaction of legal regulations and the socioeconomic structure of the population must be modeled in detail if the simulation is to describe all the significant effects of programs. </jats:p><jats:p> We used the microanalytic approach to develop a planning system for the German Federal Student Aid Program (BAFPLAN). This project required the solu tion of several important methodological problems. These included: (1) the construction of a data file representative of the initial population, (2) the arti ficial aging of the data file, and (3) the modeling of changes in human behavior. Future research will ex tend the use of micromodels in legislative planning and will deal with the problem of access to the requir ed data. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to bring forth those elements in the planning process that are believed to play the most important roles in achieving management control over project cost and timely completion. The scope of this paper is limited to the planning and scheduling of hull production operations. Although somewhere hull production and outfitting come together, it is felt that a separate discussion is appropriate since ready-for-outfitting dates must first be met in the hull production area. The planning and scheduling operations described begin generally with the award of a new contract or possibly sometime before that, if management strongly anticipates getting the work.</jats:p>",

Although many non‐profit organizations have sophisticated management systems, others have not been introduced to the methodical approach to organized thinking offered by planning systems. Non‐profit organizations range from huge national organizations to local improvement groups. Many local groups are directed by their national associations; implementation of that direction varies in both complexity and success. The corporate planner, as a community service, can provide an introduction to the tools of planning organization and implementation. The results of planning, particularly the statement of mission and the responsibility assignments for action plans, provide tools that often are not available from other sources.</jats:p>",

The need for effective utilisation of local government manpower is paramount, since up to 70 per cent of councils' expenditure can be manpower related. Furthermore a high proportion of work is service orientated (teachers, social workers, etc.) with only limited scope for a reduction in staffing levels through productivity schemes or the adoption of new technology.</jats:p>",

The central idea is the decomposition of the origin–destination flow matrix into the additive weighted sum of basic matrices. Each basic matrix represents an extremal flow which optimizes some objective function corresponding to some extremal tendency acting in the real flow. The weight of the extremal flow can be treated as the frequency of the choice of the fixed extremal tendency. </jats:p><jats:p> The geometrical and algebraic algorithm of the decomposition of the flow matrix is based on the Minkovsky theorem about the center of gravity of convex polyhedra. Its spatial content is Weber's well-known principle of industrial location (in inverted form), and Stouffer's principle of intervening opportunities. </jats:p><jats:p> Each extremal flow defines the spatially represented hierarchy of the regions of origin and destination. The successive selection of the ‘most probable’ tendencies defines the set of changing hierarchy relationships between the regions. The construction of the successive hierarchies is an elaboration of Nystuen and Dacey's ideas about the use of graph theory in flow theory. </jats:p><jats:p> The most interesting and important fact is the nonuniqueness of the expansion of the real flow by the shares of extremal tendencies, that is, nonuniqueness of results of analysis. This ensues from the fundamental statement that the analysis depends on the investigator's point of view. </jats:p>",

Economic well-being is measured by regional motorization rates, which were found to be highly correlated with personal income levels. Various measures point towards a divergence in regional inequalities, although the rates of change of these measures are declining with time. An analysis of the spatial pattern of the regional levels of economic well-being indicates a well-defined core–periphery structure which is significantly stable over time. Spread and backwash effects are examined within the labour markets of the primary and secondary cores. This examination shows that backwash effects were the dominant factor in shaping the space-economy within the regional systems. The levels of economic well-being within the labour markets were found to be positively related to the levels of the respective cores. From a policy point of view it can be concluded that the persistent pursuit of the national objective of dispersal of population has been concomitant with an increase in the levels of regional inequalities within a national framework, and that backwash effects have caused an increase in the regional imbalances between the cores and their respective peripheries. </jats:p>",

With common probabilistic concepts and models, it is shown that limitation of children and parental satisfaction may not be seriously conflicting goals, as commonly believed.

The internal and external pressures which have contributed to a coercive attitude toward the problem of too rapid population growth are discussed. The allocation of Bangladeshi health service resources is examined in terms of expenditure, manpower, and facilities; they are found to be both inequitably distributed and inefficiently applied. Some alternatives to present patterns of development are touched upon. It is concluded that despite the country's poverty, most people do not have to go without basic primary health care (including family planning), which can be afforded even by countries as economically impoverished as Bangladesh. </jats:p>",

Responsibilities of planners varied between operating companies, divisions, and the corporate parent company. Corporate planners had widened the scope of their plans since the late 1960s, made fairly extensive use of written documents and procedures, and often used a high number of sophisticated techniques for forecasting and evaluation, but their use of documents and techniques was far from uncritical.

Use of the model on such typical product‐innovative fields as a ‘new venture’ portfolio and effect‐chemicals R &amp; D has yielded valuable insights into variability in output of ventures suitable for commercialization, the degree of confidence which may be placed in achieving a desired objective, and its relation to costs and resource allocations at different stages of the process.

This method uses an interdisciplinary team composed of specialists and decisionmaker to develop and analyze treatment alternatives and uses impact prediction matrices with explicit evaluation criteria to illustrate and record ratings of impacts on resource factors. The method is a system for organizing, for discovering appropriate alternatives, for facilitating interaction, and for documenting environmental analysis. It provides for decisionmaker control over the project, for exchange of value perspectives, and for reduction in conflict between specialists. The quality of decisions which result from the method presented depends upon the information available and the effectiveness of interaction between all members of the interdisciplinary team.</jats:p>",

The cost of constructing survey-based models, however, often forces the practitioner to use models based upon secondary information. This paper attempts to determine the seriousness of using a state table from the multiregional input–output (MRIO) model for the USA in lieu of a survey-based model. By means of data for West Virginia and Kansas, input and supply coefficients and output and supply multipliers are examined. The comparisons indicate that the structures embodied within the MRIO models differ significantly from those within the survey-based models. </jats:p>",
