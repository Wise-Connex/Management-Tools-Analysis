The question of personnel movement in relation to the organisation is discussed as a manifestation of organisational behaviour, and certain dimensions of organisational control are considered. It is argued that a consideration of the theoretical and practical contributions of behavioural scientists are essential for manpower planning.</jats:p>",

Regrettably, British universities have made their own not insubstantial contribution to the development of this attitude; in the author's view, some British dons are masquerading as operational researchers and management scientists and would be better described as applied mathematicians. Within the context of distribution then, it is hardly surprising if many managers are under the impression that operational research necessarily involves the use of mathematical programming techniques or the development of complex simulation models of the distribution system under study. The purpose of this paper is to argue the case for the merits of simple models in distribution and transport planning. The author is not, of course, questioning the enormous value of more elaborate models and techniques, particularly in tackling the distribution problems of large and complex organisations, but he is trying to establish a more balanced perspective. The models are illustrated by examples drawn from work carried out by the author and by some of his former colleagues at Metra and IPC.</jats:p>",

Without detailed plans made well in advance and kept current, such an accident can have serious consequences for a company that is not prepared.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Field experience in developing the sour-gas reserves discovered in Western Canada in the early 1950's showed that metals often failed quickly when exposed to sour gas because of its hydrogen sulfide (H2S) content. For a time there was considerable concern about the industry's ability to provide facilities that could safely handle this gas, but research by both industry and universities developed the necessary technology, and today sour-gas production and processing in this area is a safe, routine operation. This achievement can be attributed, for the most part, to the careful selection, quality control, and inspection of materials scheduled for use in sour-gas service.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Now once again the industry is faced with a new challenge for producing sour gas. Drilling for and producing from deep, high-pressured reservoirs of producing from deep, high-pressured reservoirs of high H2S content present a hazard not normally associated with the production of sour gas from moderately pressured reservoirs. This is the threat of blowouts caused by the often rapid failure of high-strength steels when they are exposed to hydrogen sulfide. When H2S is Present, the yield strength of steel must be limited to about 90 to 100 ksi and stringent quality control and inspection procedures must be set up to insure that higher strength materials are not used to drill or complete the well. In spite of all possible precautions, there will always exist the possibility that failure of some component during the possibility that failure of some component during the lifetime of a well may lead to a blowout with disastrous results. When a blowout occurs in an ultra-deep well, much time may be required to control it if relief wells must be drilled. Thus if the well does not bridge or the reservoir does not deplete quickly, the operator will be faced with protecting the lives and property of nearby residents for an extended period. This is particularly serious when the period. This is particularly serious when the blowout occurs near a heavily populated area.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>We shall discuss here various elements that Shell considered in developing contingency plans for its deep Smackover drilling program in Mississippi. The actual plans are quite detailed and outline the responsibilities and duties of all concerned, from top management to the field operations personnel. They are divided into two parts, one dealing with procedures for protecting the operating personnel, and the other outlining means for protecting nearby residents and their property. The execution of the latter is primarily the responsibility of the staff organization; primarily the responsibility of the staff organization; however, the field operating personnel are responsible for the production of any endangered residents until the staff group relieves them of this function. The plans are principally designed to cope with the period of shock that immediately follows an accident, when there is the greatest danger of losing control of the situation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>General Considerations</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Contingency plans must be specific in assigning duties and areas of responsibility, so that each man knows what is expected of him during an emergency.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 347</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

All quantities are treated as distributions over geographic space, rather than concentrations at nodes of a network. We present a continuous model of spatial interaction and calibrate it for Greater Manchester. The model is a trip distribution model which produces an allocation of trips from any area to all other areas in accordance with a derived trip density function. The inputs to the model are density functions for residences and workplaces of car commuters, and a velocity field. The velocity field defines a measure of the travel time between different locations. </jats:p><jats:p> The outputs of the model are spatial distributions of accessibility of locations to jobs and residences, and a spatial distribution of traffic flow. We find that the location most accessible to jobs in Manchester is not in the centre of the city, but in a ring more than half a mile away from the centre. The maximum accessibility to residences is found to be approximately five miles away from the centre. The flow of traffic is derived as a spatial pattern and is found to peak approximately three miles from the centre of Manchester. The paper restricts itself to vehicular traffic and to radially symmetric spatial distributions. It should be seen as an attempt to introduce three major elements: time, distribution, and traffic assignment into a geometrical framework for dealing with problems of urban spatial interaction. </jats:p>",

The traffic is heaviest nearer the metropolitan centres. </jats:p><jats:p> The commodity flows will be larger in the coming years but smaller in relation to the growth in national income, which may lead to a reduction in the proportion of transport investments. Reference is made to the likely emergence of a larger number of smaller regions in India with no vital dependence on any single metropolitan centre as at present. The commodity-mix of the commodity flows in future will change in favour of manufactured goods. This may lead to greater competition between rail and road transport. </jats:p>",

Environmental considerations, and in particular the aspects of noise, play a large part in the design of these stations. The requirements for silencing to meet very low ambient noise levels and the development of gas turbine compressor unit enclosures is dealt with in some detail. The need for acoustically efficient and aesthetically pleasing structures is emphasized. The paper compares some representative alternative designs for individual enclosures with the design of an equivalent building and concludes that for small numbers of units, the individual enclosure is the economic solution. Other aspects of noise, including venting of gas are discussed and future design trends indicated. In the consideration of future designs, ease of maintenance and security are fundamental considerations, together with the need to ensure that noise emitted will not pollute the environment.</jats:p>",

The basic units are seen as cultural and idiosyncratic cognitions, and an inventory of classes of these \"response determinants\" is suggested. The processes are explained by a synthesis of Janis's conflict theory and Festinger's dissonance theory. </jats:p>",
