      "abstract": "<jats:p> Normative ethics provide guidelines for deciding what makes right acts right. Planners who have written explicitly about ethics have taken a wide variety of approaches-descriptive, analytical, and normative. Normative approaches in planning have been shaped by the dispute in philosophy between two major approaches to ethics. Utilitarianism focuses on the goodness of consequences in deciding what is right. Deontological approaches focus on rules, rights, and actions that are right in themselves. Because neither of these approaches is fully satisfactory by itself; others have been developed that attempt to deal with particular weaknesses. Rule-utilitarianism and intuitionism are discussed here. Either could be thought of as the approach that underlies professional codes of ethics. </jats:p>",

All mathematical modeling computations are performed on a VAX 11/750 host computer and the graphic manipulation is carried out by the Evans &amp; Sutherland PS390 color display system. The results of the simulation are stored in a log file, including the rotation angles of the joints and the location of the pulley and the insertion points as a record of the tendon transfer design for a specific hand. The methods are based on the modeling of two separate types of tendon paths that consist of straight line segments and curved segments that follow bone contours. The method further assumes that the path of the tendon will always evolve to a planar curve. By integrating this technique with an existing kinematic model of the hand derived from CT-scans, a clinically relevant method has been developed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Die Diskussion um eine neue Wohnungsnot und die seit Herbst 1988 beschlossenen wohnungspolitischen Maßnahmen sollten nicht nur Anlaß für eine Überprüfung der bisherigen Konzepte und Förderpraxis in der Wohnungspolitik, sondern auch der im Rahmen der Gemeinschaftsaufgabe \"Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur\" betriebenen Regionalpolitik sein.Eine allgemeine Wohnungsnot besteht nicht. Die partiellen Engpässe am Wohnungsmarkt haben zwei ganz unterschiedliche Ursachen: ein \"massives wohlstandsbedingtes Nachfragewachstum\" (G. Hasselfeldt) nach zusätzlichem Wohnraum und einen durch den Zustrom von Aus- und Übersiedlern verstärkten Bedarf an bezahlbaren und familiengerechten Wohnungen für einkommensschwache Haushalte. Neben der allgemeinen Einkommensentwicklung haben dazu auch die wohnungspolitischen Maßnahmen seit Anfang der 80er Jahre beigetragen: die vielfältige staatliche Förderung der Bildung von Wohneigentum und die Vernachlässigung des Mietwohnungsangebots. Da die Lage am Wohnungsmarkt in zunehmendem Maße die räumliche Mobilität der Erwerbspersonen beeinflußt, sollten wohnungspolitische Maßnahmen auch unter arbeitsmarktpolitischen Gesichtspunkten gesehen werden. Eine erhebliche Zunahme der Pendlerströme (auch Fernpendler), abnehmende Bereitschaft, den Wohnort zu wechseln (an der einmal erworbenen Immobilie wird fest gehalten), dazu ständig steigender Flächenverbrauch für Wohnungsbau und technische Infrastruktur weisen auf Fehlentwicklungen hin, die durch die neuen wohnungspolitischen Maßnahmen eher verstärkt als abgeschwächt werden könnten. Eine \"Neubestimmung der Entscheidungsgrundlagen im Bereich der Wohnungs- und Siedlungspolitik” (W. Schramm) scheint notwendig geworden zu sein.Die Regionalpolitik war bisher wesentlich mehr an den Zielen der allgemeinen Wirtschaftspolitik als an den Grundsätzen der Raumordnungspolitik orientiert. Zu wenig wird die \"Raumwirksamkeit\", d.h. die mit den Maßnahmen direkt und indirekt verbundene Flächeninanspruchnahme, berücksichtigt. Eine Verbesserung der regionalen Flächennutzungsstrukturen durch eine \"geordnete Flächenhaushaltspolitik\", wie sie seit Jahren von der Akademie für Raumforschung und Landesplanung (ARL) gefordert wird, sollte unverzichtbarer Bestandteil der Regionalpolitik werden.</jats:p>"

I) mit einer knappen fremden und einer ausführlicheren eigenen Beurteilung der Lage des Schienenverkehrs im ländlichen Raum der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Beide Urteile besagen, daß der Schienenverkehr in der Fläche nur noch eine geringe und weiterhin abnehmende Bedeutung besitzt. Sowohl wesentliche Ursachen dieses Zustands als auch künftig mögliche negative Konsequenzen aus ihm für die betroffenen Räume und Orte werden dargelegt.Die Analyse von Ursachen wird (in Kap. II) insoweit vertief, als der eingetretene Zustand von der herrschenden Meinung im wesentlichen auf den marktlichen Wettbewerb zwischen den Verkehrszweigen zurückgeführt wird. Dieser Auffassung wird entgegengehalten, daß gerade im Verkehr der marktliche Wettbewerb sich selbst in einem rein marktwirtschaftlichen System unter infrastrukturellen und verkehrspolizeilichen Bedingungen abspielt, die das Ergebnis politischer Konkurrenz betroffener Gruppen, Verkehrszweige und anderer Wirtschaftszweige um die Gestaltung solcher Bedingungen sind.Des weiteren wird (in Kap. III) anhand ausländischer Gegenbeispiele begründet, daß die in der Bundesrepublik wie in den meisten anderen Ländern der westlichen Welt eingetretene Lage keineswegs die Folge unausweichlicher, gleichsam sozial- und wirtschaftsgesetzmäßiger Sachzwänge ist.Schließlich wird (in Kap. IV) danach gefragt, welche Chancen bei uns bestehen, die Schienenverkehrsbedienung ländlicher Räume zu erhalten. Solche Chancen sieht der Verfasser auf kürzere Sicht nicht, wohl aber auf längere.</jats:p>"

Während das Planungskonzept eine Beteiligung der betroffenen Anwohner vorsah, konnte in der Praxis eine intensive Bürgerpartizipation kaum gewährleistet werden. Die Einstellung der Wohnbevölkerung zu den Umgestaltungsmaßnahmen war nur schwer zu ermitteln. Eine im November 1989 durchgeführte Haushaltsbefragung sollte daher Aufschluß über die Wirksamkeit der Neugestaltung und die Akzeptanz des Wohnumfeldprogramms bei der ansässigen Wohnbevölkerung geben. Ein Vergleich mit Befragungsergebnissen aus einem noch nicht umgestalteten Teilgebiet der Oststadt offenbarte Defizite im Planungskonzept und Verbesserungsmöglichkeiten bei den bereits vollzogenen Maßnahmen. Der Beitrag erläutert die Befragungsmethode und zeigt, wie die Ergebnisse in die Planung und Weiterführung des Wohnumfeldprogramms umgesetzt wurden.</jats:p>"

It is shown that through use of these models it is possible to identify cost-benefit ratios for various rationalization and modernization tasks, and to create an action plan for their implementation. The proposed production information model aims at reducing every job into its smallest elements in the form of processes and activities as well as rationalizing the subjective concepts of complexity, size, quality, etc. through the use of metrics. The paper also discusses the increasing reality variance of accounting systems and proposes the introduction of single-factor and total-factor productivity for correct evaluation of operating performances and of investment decisions. While the model is generic enough to cover all eventualities, its application to specific yards requires additional tailoring to reflect the effects of layout, facilities, organization and labor resources on the yard performance. The paper suggests that adoption of such models avoids subsystem optimization or importation of methods and techniques which might have been successful in some other operation and yet may not be appropriate in given circumstances.</jats:p>",

Der Wegfall steuerlicher Bevorzugungen und die Übernahmen der gemeinsamen Agrarpolitik verstärken diesen Prozeß. Demgegenüber steht nur die günstige Entwicklung der Textil- und Bekleidungsindustrie. Die Orientierung auf diesen Sektor trägtjedoch zu einer ungleichen Integration Griechenlands in die internationale Arbeitsteilung bei und schafft Industriestrukturen, die langfristig international nicht wettbewerbsfähig sind.Die Region Thrakien steht somit am Vorabend der Realisierung des europäischen Binnenmarktes vor einer schwierigen Aufgabe, deren Bewältigung zukünftig einen massiven und koordinierten Einsatz wirtschafts- und strukturpolitischer Instrumentarien erfordert.</jats:p>"

The main goal of the research is to study the timing and volume of the lagged migration adjustment to the regional economic turnaround and the temporal stability of patterns of regional inflows and outflows. The paper is an examination of the responsiveness of interstate migration to changing regional economic conditions based on annual interstate migration data and a set of cross-sectional destination-specific Poisson regression models. The results of the analysis add to our understanding of the economic revival in New England and the prospects for longer term employment growth in the region. Our knowledge of migration response and the regional labor-market adjustment process in general is also furthered. </jats:p>",

In the best and worst senses, we are a nation of amateurs: making music because it seems worthwhile; our youth and adult music-making traditions are witness to this. We are also aesthetically ambitious and worry about the mechanisation of the curriculum and losing a sense of delight and spontaneity. All of these may seem threatened by the National Curriculum. Yet it is important to be more consistent and organised in the music curriculum. There will still be scope for the unplanned, the unpredictable. There always is</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

It is argued that this process of regulation constitutes an important facet of state development in specific conjunctures. A second facet of uneven state development is also examined: the production of specific experiences of state regulation within localities. Results from case studies of cooperative housing in Toronto are used to illustrate the role of local political relations in shaping people's experiences of state regulation. </jats:p>",

Moreover, and more importantly, some conclusions obtained by prior studies on location theory can be shown to be special cases of these more general results, but others are not defensible when the transportation rate depends upon quantity shipped. </jats:p>",

In this paper, housing market behaviour, especially the increasing differentiations in urban ground rent between spatially defined submarkets, in Albury-Wodonga, Melbourne, and Sydney is explored.

Four possible explanations are considered: ignorance; theoretical problems; practical problems; and institutional or cultural factors. It is concluded that economists have been too narrow in their focus on efficiency as an appropriate objective function for legislators and pressure groups, and that there are numerous problems associated with bringing in incentive-based policies for the control of pollution. However, the basic attraction of such policies—that by permitting flexibility in emission reductions across sources, cost savings are made possible-remains sufficiently strong to warrant more research attention being given to modelling such policies in specific situations. </jats:p>",

The clinical use of 3DCT in temporal bone surgery has not been evaluated. We used 3DCT to assess temporal bone anatomy in 9 patients. These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinfiammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma. We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two‐dimensional CT scanning (2DCT). While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3‐D presentation of data. We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use.</jats:p>",

We asked children aged 4 to 7 years to draw a man, and examined the effects of asking for specific details on the relative sizes of head and trunk. Asking children to depict details of a jacket in their drawing of a man resulted in drawings with a reliably larger trunk area relative to that of the head. Although asking children to depict teeth did result in a larger head relative to the trunk, this effect was not statistically significant. However, asking children to draw a man from the back so that his face could not be seen resulted in significantly smaller heads relative to the trunk. These results indicate that children can preplan the size of head and trunk in anticipation of the amount of detail they intend to include within the outline. The results also suggest that the overestimation of the size of the head commonly found in young children's figure drawing is partly a result of the greater amount of detail usually included in the outline of the head compared to the trunk.</jats:p>",

However, its value in the management of prostate cancer remains undefined. The present study addresses the impact of planning CT on the designated target volumes for localised carcinoma of the prostate at a multi‐institution national level. Nine radiation oncologists from different centres in Australia and New Zealand were asked to designate a target volume on five sample patients with different disease stages (A2‐C2) using both conventional cystogram films and planning CT scans.</jats:p><jats:p>Target volumes estimated by CT means in this study differed by more than 10% from those estimated by conventional means in 75.6% of instances, being smaller in 55.6%. Volumes varied widely between individual radiation oncologists, both using conventional planning and CT information. These variations were found to exceed any differences in the volume caused by the planning technique itself. Results from this survey suggest that volumes appear to change more according to the individual radiation oncologist rather than to any other factor. In most or all of the sample cases six of nine radiation oncologists defined the borders of their CT volumes to be either consistently smaller (5 out of 9) or greater (1 out of 9) than their conventionally defined borders.</jats:p><jats:p>The results of this survey are potentially important and warrant repetition with larger sample numbers in other countries where interactive CT planning facilities exist, both with and without diagnostic radiological input, to exclude similar variation and to define causes for any variations that do become apparent.</jats:p>",
