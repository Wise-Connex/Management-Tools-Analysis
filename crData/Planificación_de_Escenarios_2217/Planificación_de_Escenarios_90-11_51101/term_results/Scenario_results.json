      "abstract": "<jats:p> We review here the random dimer model of a binary alloy which we have recently demonstrated exhibits an absence of localisation. Specifically we show that if one (or both) of the site energies is assigned at random to pairs of lattice sites (that is, two sites in succession), an initially localised particle can become delocalised. We show explicitly that transport obtains in this model because [Formula: see text] of the electronic states are extended over the whole sample. The relevance of this model to the insulator-metal transition in polyaniline is discussed. The dual of the random dimer model is also shown to exhibit an absence of localisation and is shown to be relevant to transmission resonances in Fibonacci lattices. </jats:p>",
