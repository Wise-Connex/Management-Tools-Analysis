In this article Professor Jones out lines some effects of the new Income Tax Act in regard to taxes which become exigible upon death. Particular emphasis is placed on the effect of section 70 on the disposition of capital gains and the new concept relating to valuation contained in section 164(6). In addition, the article discusses several techniques to minimize or reduce taxes payable, such as the estate \"freeze\", the tax-free \"roll-over\"for property passing to spouse, the transfer of non-capital assets to beneficiaries, the importance of assets being situated in Alberta, the usefulness of the corporate \"freeze\" and the lawyer's role in the \"evaluation of assets\" process.</jats:p>"

First, a comprehensive inhouse contingency plan should be prepared before commencing operations in an area. The plan will ensure that adequate first-aid measures are on hand at all times and will go on to list the location and availability of additional assistance both in equipment and manpower.Second, the operator should be prepared to participate in the oil industry's National Oil Spills Action Plan. This plan is designed to ensure that the entire resources of the industry can be made available and effectively co-ordinated to combat an oil spill anywhere on the coast of Australia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two metropolitan cities of similar size and less than 400 Kilometres apart, yet London and Paris display vastly contrasting patterns of retailing. Retailing, unlike manufacturing industry, has yet to go truly multi‐national in its organisation; but the trends in this direction are clear. Retail organisations in England and France, however, will have to contend with very different patterns of retailing in the two metropolitan cities should they decide to set up in them. The reasons for these differences are partly historical and partly administrative. Since 1945 the outward growth of London has been limited by an extremely powerful system of land‐use planning. This has had the effect of stopping London at the point that its outward growth had reached prior to the outbreak of World War II. By 1938, aided by the development of suburban electric railways in the two decades since 1918, the suburbs of London had sprawled out 19 to 24 Km from the centre. In that year, an Act of Parliament created the Green Belt, which provided a means of restraining further development. The area within the Green Belt is now the province of the Greater London Council, the strategic planning authority for London set up in 1964. Beyond the Green Belt, in the Outer Metropolitan Area, some 40 to 50 Km from Central London, a series of new towns has been built. While Greater London has lost population and jobs since the war, this area beyond the Green Belt has witnessed a major growth of population and jobs in the same period. (Milton Keynes, for instance, is planned to accommodate 500,000 people and by 1977 a covered shopping centre of 84,000 m2 will be open, rising to 172,000 m2 of shopping space by 1991 with 28,000 car parking spaces).</jats:p>",

Before discussing the second and subsequent plans, it will be useful to review the main features of the initial efforts at planning in Iran.</jats:p><jats:p>The development policies of the government during the reign of Reza Shah (1925-1941) did not constitute development planning as the term has come to be understood in the postwar economic literature. The prewar policies were restricted to partial investment programs for the public sector only, with little consideration concerning the activities of the private sector. Furthermore, even the public sector programs did not reflect any explicitly defined set of policy objectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>THE TEST OF A THEORY IS IN ITS APPLICATION. THE DIFFICULTY IS that in political theory, application is rarely a sufficient test. This is especially true of the kind of theory in which I am interested. It is abstract, highly generalized, and for this reason, tends to be illustrated by means of applications which neither prove nor disprove. A lack of clear guides for disproof is one of the more serious deficiencies of highly general theory. If that is so, what is the point of doing it? One answer is that if such theory can lead in an <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> way to logically inferred predicaments which repeat themselves in many forms in the real world, this should allow us to anticipate events. This, in turn, allows us to compare these common predicaments in diverse settings to discover the necessary and separate it from the contingent. This can represent a big step forward if it results in new types of data and different forms of linkages between variables. The ‘tests’ then are more insightful generalizations rather than ‘validations’. If such generalizations can be made subject to quantitative proof, so much the better. In any case, the route to validation is bound to be indirect. Propositions locked into a logical structure of thought will remain for long cumbersome and wearisome. Despite this, as long as not too many people waste their time with it, a general theory approach seems worth the effort.</jats:p>",

For example, a proposal to create a major highdensity center of employment and residential development, could generate traffic demands far in excess of the road network capacity within and adjacent to the center. This can be considered a primary impact. The road congestion, in turn, can cause a shift in the modal split (that is, the percentage of total trips by auto and transit), causing more people to travel to the center by public transit. This can be considered as a secondary impact.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">In 1958, the Ontario Department of Mines appointed a committee to study the accident situation and mining methods used in the uranium mines in The Elliot Lake district. This committee reviewed the existing knowledge on mine design, pillar support and roof spans\nand came to the conclusion that scientific knowledge had not yet reached the stage of producing rational design procedures which would reduce the dependence on trial-and-error methods. Since that time, the Mining Research Centre has made numerous stress measurements in two mines to define the\npre-mining and pillar stresses. A comprehensive series of tests has been done in the laboratory to measure the compressive strength of the rock; a geological survey of the region has been made to evaluate tectonic stresses; and a survey was done on mining conditions with regard to stable and\nunstable pillar configurations. This information has been used to evaluate pillar design as effected by pillar width and height, depth below surface, extraction and pre-mining stress fields. The resultant design of pillar widths and corresponding extraction as the depth increased is in line with\npast and present experience in these mines. The information available on roof stability is still insufficient to design stable stope spans with the same degree of confidence; experience and trial-and-error methods are still required</jats:p>"

It presents a planning schema in which static micro level analysis is incorporated into a dynamic general equilibrium framework. The paper is critical of conventional policy approaches based as they are on false notions of the nature of the nutrition problem. The problem is generally one of calorie rather than of protein deficiency, and it arises from inadequate effective demand for food rather than as a result of insufficient supply. If the continued existence of malnutrition is not simply to be accepted it will have to be treated as primarily a symptom of poverty. Thus, policies to end it will seek to generate incomes among the poor. Analytical and empirical work is needed to identify the nature of specific policy alternatives and to predict their effects. Practical criteria to reflect social objectives still need to be developed. Technological approaches to increasing food supplies overlook the poverty of the undernourished and the prediction of growing food ‘surpluses’.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p>PLANIFICATION DE L'ALIMENTATION ET LA NUTRITION</jats:p><jats:p>L'auteur examine la question de l'alimentation et la nutrition planifiées. Il présente une méthode de planification incorporant une microanalyse statique dans un cadre de travail équilibré, général et dynamique. Il s'élève contre les méthodes classiques utilisées pour appréhender le problème de la nutrition et reposant sur des notions erronées de la nature de ce problème. Selon lui, il s'agit en général d'un problème de calories plutôt que de carences protéiques, problème qui découle de l'insuffisance de la demande effective en matière d'alimentation et non d'une insuffisance de production. A moins que l'on n'admette tout simplement la persistance du phénomène de la malnutrition, il faudra le traiter comme étant primordialement un symptôme de pauvreté. Dès lors, les systèmes d'élimination de la malnutrition s'emploieront à engendrer des revenus parmi les catégories sociales pauvres. Des travawc analytiques et empiriques sont nécessaires pour définir la nature des différentes méthodes d'action spécifiques que l'on pourrait choisir et pour prédire leurs effets. Un travail plus approfondi est encore nécessaire pour déterminer les critères pratiques qui doivent refléter les objectifs sociaux. Les méthodes technologiques employées en vue de parvenir à l'accroissement des approvisionnements alimentaires ne tiennent pas compte du paupérisme des sous‐alimentés et de la prédiction de l'augmentation des surplus alimentaires.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>NAHRUNGSMITTEL‐ UND ERNÄHRUNGSPLANUNG</jats:p><jats:p>Diese Arbeit behandelt Nahrungsmittel‐ und Ernährungsplanung. Sie stellt ein Planungsschema dar, bei dem die statische Analyse auf der Mikroebene in einen dynamischen allgemeinen Gleichgewichtsrahmen einbezogen wird. Die Arbeit setzt sich kritisch mit konventionellen Verfahrensansätzen auseinander, die auf falschen Annahmen über die Art des Ernährungsproblems beruhen. Das Problem ist im allgemeinen eher eines von Kalorien‐ als von Proteinmangel und es ergibt sich in stärkerem Mass aus einer unzureichend wirk‐samen Nachfrage nach Nahrungsmitteln und ist weniger ein Ergebnis unzureichenden Angebots. Wenn man sich nicht mit der nach wie vor bestehenden Unterernährung einfach abfinden will, wird sie vor allem als ein Symptom von Armut behandelt werden müssen. Daher werden Verfahren zu ihrer Beseitigung darauf abzielen, Einkommen unter den Armen zu schaffen. Analytische und empirische Arbeiten sind erforderlich, um die Art spezifischer Verfahrensalternativen zu erhellen und ihre Wirkungen vorauszusagen. Praktische Kriterien, die soziale Ziele einbeziehen, müssen noch entwickelt werden. Technologische Ansätze zur Erhöhung der Nahrungsmittelversorgung übersehen die Armut der Unterernährten und die Voraussage der wachsenden Nahrungsmittelüberschüsse.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This calls for a careful appraisal of alternative development strategies.

Differential capitalisation factors are used according to the projected rate of growth of value added in different classes of farming. But the figures produced at the end of the exercise are still very small in relation to other figures in the cost benefit.

The difficulties are administrative, technical, and psychologic. There is often a gap to be bridged between the planners and the providers of information. In Scotland, the integration of the previously separate administrations of hospitals, general practice, and public health under single health boards offers new opportunities for planning health programs. This change is an incentive to reform and upgrade the information services for planning. Some of the proposals are described. </jats:p>",

In many cases, the introduction of a new product results in both rapid demand growth and significant changes in the production rate through‐out the startup period, during which productivity and product output increase significantly. It is demonstrated that, if these two phenomena are not estimated and used as a basis of closely coordinated planning between production and marketing, very large costs can be incurred – either lost sales and potential introduction failure related to stock out conditions caused by “underproduction” or excess inventory holding, obsolescence and opportunity costs when an over production imbalance occurs. Following a description of the problem examples are used to illustrate the benefits of increasing rigor in the joint planning of new product introductions. Finally, a general methodology based upon an heuristic pattern search algorithm is employed to provide an optimal solution to a multivariate planning example.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A statistical evaluation was made of the daily rainfall at Caguas and Fajardo, covering 70- and 60-year periods. The purposes of this evaluation were: 1, To investigate the character, if any, of the rainfall distribution and of its deficiency (drought) characteristics; and 2, in the event that any character was found in rainfall in the sense of distribution and deficiency, to develop a Rainfall Deficiency Index which would be useful to agricultural and other programs and inventories. The study first consisted of determining the least rainfall in 60, 120, and 180 consecutive days, and the maximum rainfall in 30 and 90-day periods of each year. This analysis suggested the occurrence of most deficient and least deficient rainfall in 120 (or 180) day cycles during the drier part of the year within 10- to 11-year periods; the Caguas data beginning in 1899 and in 1909 at Fajardo. The suggested cycles appear to be more defined at Caguas than Fajardo. It appears that years ending in 6 or 7 almost invariably seemed to be among the driest in their respective decades; 1899 to 1968. Years ending in 1 or 2 seemed identified with least deficient and better distributed rainfall. This preliminary analysis was based mainly on the least rainfall in 120 days parameter. It was found that the ratio of the mean least rainfall in 120 days of the dry years (ending in 6 or 7) to the \"wet\" years (ending in 1 or 2) is 0.364 for Caguas and 0.603 for Fajardo. Also, the coefficient of variation of the data for dry and \"wet\" years was lower than when calculated for all years. Contrast between dry and wet years is apparent even for the least rainfall in 180 days (6 months of the year). In this respect the ratios of dry to \"wet\" years are 0.494 and 0.595 for Caguas and Fajardo, respectively. There is no apparent contrast, however, when the annual, or even maximum, rainfall in 90 days at the two locations is compared for \"wet\" and dry years. A Rainfall Deficiency Index (DEF) is proposed. Such deficiency is normally distributed for Caguas and Fajardo. This index integrates the deficiency and distribution characteristics of the annual rainfall. It can be used, therefore, as a guide for evaluating the rainfall characteristics in the agricultural regions of Puerto Rico and for the determination of priorities for supplemental irrigation. A Rainfall Distribution Coefficient (DIS) was developed as a direct means of describing the distribution characteristics of annual rainfall, and it accounts indirectly for the rainfall deficiency within a given area or areas of similar annual rainfall. DEF accounted for 74.0 and 64.4 percent of the variations in DIS at both Caguas and Fajardo.</jats:p>"

For this reason Management Science is somewhat of a misnomer, but this does not mean that the art of management is not susceptible to analysis and study. On the contrary, it is possible to analyse how good managers work and to identify their strong points. When we do this we are struck by the systematic way in which good managers approach problems. This systematic approach is frequently not appreciated in a conscious way by the managers themselves, but it seems to be the key to their success. Since no manager can operate effectively in isolation, but must communicate with others, it is important for a successful manager to be able to communicate not only his decisions but also the reasoning behind his decisions. A systematic approach to decision making offers a framework for communications, and the larger the organizational unit involved the greater the necessity for information to be written down and passed on in a formal way.</jats:p>",

One of its products, the city, has the longest history and has at times achieved a congenial and even inspiring setting for human affairs. In analysis, the components of the planning process emerge with Renaissance theory, but develop with the growth of nations and cities, colonization, and the birth of the great metropolis. New concepts bring changes in urbanized societies, but the pace of improvement slows as problems proliferate. The lack of social planning at last becomes apparent and, together with the realization that over-population and the side effects of industrial development threaten the continuation of life on earth, demands the view of the environment transcending the economic-physical approach of routine planning technology. </jats:p>",

This article examines the three most pervasive mechanisms causing communicative turbulence and thus affecting decision. These three forces, media, education, and planning, are dealt with as separate entities in view of their related but somewhat disparate character. Taken together they do, however, hold out the greatest hope in meeting the critical problems of the day. And, taken separately, they can each create turbulence of such intensity as to threaten nearly all constructive efforts toward meeting the challenges of urban change and reformation. Today, the media are forsaking their objectivity and their public service responsibility for an interpretative role which deprives society of a sound information source. Television in its present aspects is an active deterrent to successful public education. Public education is foundering from a complex of confused programs and interpolations from the various special interest groups and the interpositioning of the courts between the citizens and their elected local school boards. Solutions suggested are both new and old. Higher education is suffering from the effects of the student population explosion, further complicated by special interest pressures and by unwise quasi-dictation from certain federal agencies. The planning process, as prerequisite to improved management in all areas of social activity, is beginning to show advances in effectiveness owing to accumulated experience, increased and assimilated data, and growing public acceptance, particularly in the field of urban planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban change is an extreme example of the proverbial product of a committee—most of the changes cannot be attributed to formal or organized planning. Planners who are trying to introduce a more orderly future, to correct present problems, and minimize future ones, must call upon all the skills of man—and perhaps, more—and it is unfortunate that planners are divided, in C. P. Snow's sense, into two cultures which little understand one another. The contribution of technology to planning solutions has its greatest potential and its severest limitations in the emphasis upon formal models, and analysis and evaluation based largely on quantitative techniques. The understanding of these methods, and the combining of them with other methods of planning, will provide the \"optimal\" solution. </jats:p>",
