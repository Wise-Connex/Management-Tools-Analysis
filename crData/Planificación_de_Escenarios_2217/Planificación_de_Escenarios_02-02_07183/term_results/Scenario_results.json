      "abstract": "<jats:p>The future cannot be measured. foresight is largely a matter of conjecture, and at the heart of conjecture lies conversation. Organizations are essentially networks of personal interconnections based on conversation. Thus, in enabling complex adaptive organizations to look ahead, conversation, in one form or another, becomes a key component of strategic planning. This article describes the range of interview methods from structured to more active and creative methods and the emergence of “the strategic conversation”. The use of this technique is illustrated by examples.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is remarkable consistency in the evolution of university-level tourism programmes around the world, especially when such programmes evolved out of the polytechnic system. After a relatively slow incubation period, tourism education programmes tend to undergo a period of rapid expansion, where both the number of providers and student demand increase dramatically. Most academics feel this growth is unsustainable and predict that a shake-out in programmes is inevitable. Australia was one of the first countries to pursue university-level tourism education programmes aggressively as part of national policy. As such, it is evolving through its life cycle ahead of many other jurisdictions. The Australian experience may, therefore, be a precursor to what could happen in other jurisdictions. This paper reports on a qualitative study of what senior Australian tourism academics feel the future will be for the sector. Most feel that Australia is now in the late maturity or early decline stages of the tourism education life cycle. Consequently, most predict a consolidation of programmes, although there is much debate about which programmes will thrive and which will falter. They also believe that fee-paying postgraduate programmes may be the catalyst to revive the life cycle. </jats:p>",

Whether such hemodynamic compromise from pausing to ventilate is enough to affect outcome is unknown.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>\n                <jats:bold>\n                  <jats:italic>Methods and Results</jats:italic>\n                </jats:bold>\n                —\n              </jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            Thirty swine (weight 35±2 kg) underwent 3 minutes of untreated ventricular fibrillation before 12 minutes of basic life support CPR. Animals were randomized to receive either standard airway (A), breathing (B), and compression (C) CPR with expired-gas ventilation in a 15:2 compression-to-ventilation ratio or continuous chest compression CPR. Those randomized to the standard 15:2 group had no chest compressions for a period of 16 seconds each time the 2 ventilations were delivered. Defibrillation was attempted at 15 minutes of cardiac arrest. All resuscitated animals were supported in an intensive care environment for 1 hour, then in a maintenance facility for 24 hours. The primary end point of neurologically normal 24-hour survival was significantly better in the experimental group receiving continuous chest compression CPR (12 of 15 versus 2 of 15;\n            <jats:italic>P</jats:italic>\n            &lt;0.0001).\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            <jats:bold>\n              <jats:italic>\n                <jats:bold>\n                  <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>\n                </jats:bold>\n                —\n              </jats:italic>\n            </jats:bold>\n            Mouth-to-mouth ventilation performed by single layperson rescuers produces substantial interruptions in chest compression–supported circulation. Continuous chest compression CPR produces greater neurologically normal 24-hour survival than standard ABC CPR when performed in a clinically realistic fashion. Any technique that minimizes lengthy interruptions of chest compressions during the first 10 to 15 minutes of basic life support should be given serious consideration in future efforts to improve outcome results from cardiac arrest.\n          </jats:p>",
