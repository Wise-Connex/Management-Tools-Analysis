In this paper I take a closer look at their divergence and outline the role that a planning support system (PSS) can play in bridging this growing gap. I consider the benefits of participatory planning and show how my prototype of a PSS can contribute to its success. To that end, the functionality of this PSS is described in the context of the initial experience with its application in a diversity of planning circumstances. Some conclusions are then drawn on how a PSS can overcome some of the barriers to GIS support within planning practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning system that was formalised in Britain in the 1947 Town and Country Planning Act is distinctive for the way in which it explicitly nationalised the rights to future development and distinguished between physical development and land-use change. Contingent causes for these characteristics can be found in the experience of planning in the first half of the 20th century which in turn was developed from sanitary legislation of the 19th century. There are, however, more fundamental reasons for the way in which the British planning system was constituted. In this paper I argue that the nationalisation of development rights and the separation of land use from building have their conceptual roots in medieval property law. As a colonial state in the period after the Norman Conquest, England saw the imposition of feudal law in its purest form. In such a system, owners of land were denied absolute rights to property of the kind available under Roman law and its derivatives. Legal theorists developed the doctrine of the estate which gave concrete existence to the limited rights of all those with an interest in a given parcel of land (those with tenure). Present and future rights to use could be distinguished. This conceptualising of property interest was to have profound consequences not only for property relations but also for the emerging planning system in the 20th century. It created a system which gave the state unprecedented control over changes to land, but which also had some significant disadvantages. </jats:p>",

Bacon (1910 -) orchestrated revitalization of downtown Philadelphia after World War II and served as one of the most articulate voices for a vigorous urban planning process in American cities. As executive director of Philadelphia’s City Planning Commission from 1949 to 1970, he created Penn Center, restored Society Hill, and preserved open space throughout the revitalized center city. His widely read book, Design of Cities (1967), has greatly influenced the way cities are understood and planned. Architect Alexander Garvin explores the influences on Bacon’s many contributions to twentieth-century planning through a conversation with the exuberant urbanist. </jats:p>",

The design standards proved adaptable to private development, model industrial villages, public housing, and state new towns. Today, the ideas of Howard, Raymond Unwin, and John Nolen are providing the basis for sustainable development and the New Urbanism movement. This review seeks to draw out the continuum between Howard’s garden city model and changing urban paradigms of the twentieth century. </jats:p>",

However, the theory of how locational externalities impact upon house prices is not reflected in the traditional measurements of location used in these studies. The result is that many hedonic house price models suffer from parameter estimates that are either insignificant or counterintuitive. In this paper I attempt to move towards a more realistic valuation of locational externalities by examining the effects of location upon house prices from a geographical as opposed to a purely economic perspective. A multilevel conceptualisation is presented, which takes into account the spatial effects of locational externalities upon house prices. A location-sensitive GIS of Cardiff and a multilevel specification of the hedonic model is then used to model these effects. I conclude that a more realistic treatment of location is required if locational externalities are to be valued successfully. </jats:p>",

In practice, in the Netherlands, measures to give concrete form to sustainable construction are only scantily applied. The suspicion arises that it is not technical factors but institutional factors that underlie the fact that as yet sustainable construction has failed to force a definitive breakthrough. The authors review to what extent institutions that influence the decisionmaking of players in the building sector regarding whether or not to apply sustainable construction have hindered improvement in sustainable construction. </jats:p>",

The planning model has been developed using both a hypothetico‐deductive and an inductive approach, incorporating recent developments in US and UK political campaign management and depth interviews with political strategists in the UK. Suggests that national political parties need to co‐ordinate their election campaigns more effectively in order to strengthen their image among key citizen and voter groups by determining which target areas are most in need of resources. Further research is needed to determine how to position the party and to select and place advertising in the relevant media. Concludes that local election campaigns are becoming more co‐ordinated by national parties but that such co‐ordination neglects to provide local area research and telemarketing campaigns, and post‐election analysis exercises to monitor strengths and weaknesses in party strategy and campaign plan implementation.</jats:p>",

As opposed to the traditional approach, of minimizing the population along the routes, we propose to include a compensation cost as a direct cost of choosing the routes. This compensation could include, for instance, a reduction in property tax rates. Two formulations are presented, covering different patterns of effects on property values.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This review evaluates the perception that subsidized housing results in negative neighborhood impacts by considering four commonly studied putative impacts of subsidized housing location: property values, racial transition, poverty concentration, and crime. The authors assess theoretical and methodological bases for discerning impacts and determine which study results inspire confidence. Research reveals a relationship between the presence of subsidized housing and both property values and crime in certain circumstances, with both positive and negative impacts, and suggests that the presence of subsidized housing does not lead to racial transition. Research on the impact of subsidized housing on poverty concentration is too flawed methodologically to permit conclusions. Future research must, among other steps, control for variability of impacts across types of neighborhoods, use data that distinguish between residents of subsidized and nonsubsidized housing, and take into account changing attitudes as well as the context in which housing is proposed. </jats:p>",

Like spatial analysis, traffic demand modeling is subject to the modifiable areal unit problem (MAUP). In this paper we report the findings of a simulation study, which uses eleven zoning structures and two levels of network detail to assess the effects of TAZs, centroids, and network detail on statewide traffic demand modeling in Idaho. First, trips generated between smaller TAZs have shorter trip lengths, higher proportions of interzonal trips, more accurate estimated volume-to-ground-count ratios, and lower percentage root mean square errors ( E<jats:sub>RMS</jats:sub>) between estimated volumes and ground counts. Second, the effect of centroid locations is mixed and generally slight with small TAZs. Third, the level of network detail impacts E<jats:sub>RMS</jats:sub> values in two ways: larger TAZs produce lower E<jats:sub>RMS</jats:sub> values than smaller TAZs on the less detailed network, and the detailed network outperforms the less detailed network, regardless of the size of TAZs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we propose a multiclass, multicriteria network equilibrium framework for urban location and transportation decisions in the Information Age, in which the advent of telecommunication networks may provide a substitute for physical transportation. The framework interprets the option of telecommuting as a transportation mode choice and considers three distinct scenarios: (1) residential locations are known, as well as the number of residents, and one seeks to determine their places of work, along with their optimal routes of travel; (2) places of employment are given and the numbers employed are known, but one wishes to determine their residential locations and their optimal travel routes; and (3) the total number of individuals are given and one seeks to determine their residential locations, their employment locations, as well as their optimal routes of travel between. We allow each class of decisionmaker to have his or her own set of criteria associated with the route and locational decisions. We identify the underlying network structures of the problems, derive the governing equilibrium conditions, and establish the equivalent variational inequality formulations. We provide qualitative properties and propose a computational procedure along with convergence results. We then apply the algorithm to a numerical example and its variants. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The dynamic nature of land qualities both in space and in time suggests that, whatever the stages of the development of an area, it is always crucial to assess land qualities in terms of their potential and suitability for specific kinds of land use on a sustainable basis. In this paper we demonstrate an integrated method of biophysical land-suitability assessment, which combines two basic land-evaluation principles: allowing trade-offs among evaluation criteria, and a limiting condition approach. Decision criteria consist mainly of biophysical parameters, based on internal and external groups of land properties. Internal variables include various physical and chemical characteristics of soils, whereas external variables are those of topographic attributes. A fuzzy set methodology was employed to calculate values of a membership function, MF (0 ⩽ MF ⩽ 1.0), of each land variable. These fuzzy membership values were then combined to produce land-suitability indices, LSIs (0 ⩽ LSIs ⩽ 1.0), which can be used to assess the potential of land for a nominated land-use type. The analysis procedure implements a convex combination, which permits trade-offs between criteria of the same group, and a multiplicative function, which takes no account of compensation between groups (internal and external variables). A limiting condition approach is also incorporated in this system to resolve shortcomings found when using a convex combination technique alone. The results show that LSIs are consistent with categorical classes generated from applying the well-established method based on the Food and Agriculture Organisation framework for land evaluation. However, the LSIs, as derived from a cell-by-cell operation, produce more detailed subdivisions of land in terms of their potential for a given purpose. The main advantages of using this model include: (1) it minimises subjectivity in the evaluation procedure; (2) it takes into account the combined effects of the factors considered, while preserving information on biophysical constraints for a given purpose; and (3) it is amenable to further computer-based applications, especially for use in geographical information systems. </jats:p>",

Following our research on the Sheffield Urban Contextual Databank (SUCoD) project, this paper presents an alternative framework for building virtual cities, which goes beyond conventional static urban modelling. A three-tier system framework is described in conjunction with the design and implementation of the SUCoD prototype. We demonstrate SUCoD's novel functionalities by showing that complex urban contextual information sets, including three-dimensional interactive models, multilayer interactive maps, and hypermedia documents, can be retrieved dynamically by user-specified urban contextual attributes, spatial locations, and boundaries. The three-tier framework also facilitates system development in an extensible way, allowing continuous parallel extensions of system functionalities, user-interface components, and contextual data resources. SUCoD's dynamic capabilities are considered crucial in its future uses for urban contextual modelling on demand in relation to the past, present, and future of the City of Sheffield. </jats:p>",

The first two experiments show that action planning includes the anticipation of action effects. In an initial acquisition phase, participants learned that their response to a stimulus would produce a particular effect, that is, another stimulus contingent on the response. In a subsequent test phase, targets were presented together with flanker stimuli taken from the set of effect stimuli. When the flankers were the learned effects of the response required by the target, the response was facilitated. The second series of experiments shows that, even within the learning of action effects, the effects are integrated with the action plan. Participants had to respond to two succeeding stimuli. The identity of the second stimulus depended on the identity of the first stimulus. Hence, the second stimulus could be considered to be an effect of the response to the first stimulus. Action-effect learning should accelerate the response to the second stimulus. The 1rst response was required only in half of all trials. In the other half of trials a late or an early NOGO signal stopped response planning. Action-effect learning depended on the presentation time of the NOGO signal; there were clear learning effects with late NOGO signals and rather small effects with the early signals. Discussing the results, an anticipatory or feed-forward learning mechanism is suggested: the planning of an action involves the anticipation of its environmental effects. If the effects are not yet known, there remain free slots defined by properties of the desired effects. Searching for suitable effects in the course of and resulting from action execution will 1ll in the slots.</jats:p>",

Relationship marketing represents a dynamic tension between the forces of individualism and collectivism, yet the role of individualism and selfishness is relatively unexplored. This paper presents theoretical frameworks for their study. Impacts of selfishness on relationship marketing are discussed and suggestions made for how firms may reconcile selfishness with co‐operative strategies. It is argued that selfishness may be crucial to successful relationships and may produce greater economic welfare than pervasive collectivism.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ideas of belonging, cultural identity, and social relations based on ancestral connection, blood, and primordial kinship, have a contradictory presence in cultural theory and public culture. The search for alternatives to fixed, essentialist, and exclusive ways of imagining culture and belonging has been central to recent cultural theory and cultural geography. This has involved much attention to cultural routes, mobility, and hybridity and a critique of cultural roots, fixity, and purity in response to increasing transnational flows, the experience of displaced people, racism, and ethnic fundamentalism. Yet discourses of indigeneity and new migration patterns, as well as cultural globalisation more widely, have also prompted the growth in genealogy amongst ‘settler’ groups in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States who search for European, and often specifically Irish, roots. In this paper I explore the relationships between ideas of nation, ancestry, and diaspora. I focus on what happens when questions of nationality, ethnicity, and identity meet in the practice of ancestral research in Ireland, and begin to track the spatially differentiated cultural politics of genealogy. As the language of genealogy travels with Irish roots tourists and through electronic networks, the implications of genealogical practices and identifications can mutate so that what may be a politically regressive turn to ethnic purity and racial discourse in one context can, in another, productively unsettle older exclusive versions of belonging. For both individual and collective identities, genealogical projects can have unsettling results. </jats:p>",

Such changes are necessitated by the globalization of markets aided by the facilitating communications and information processing technologies. In recent years, the discipline has also witnessed significant paradigm shifts such as relationship marketing and micromarketing. Information technology enabled marketers to accumulate large quantities of detailed information about their current and potential customers. However, to convert such vast databases effectively into useful management information, the traditional marketing research tools primarily based on parametric statistical methods are proving to be inadequate. In this context, in this paper it is argued that neural network models (NNMs) will prove to be robust methodological alternatives for marketers to practice database marketing effectively.</jats:p>",

When observers are asked to indicate the 1nal position of a moving stimulus, their localizations are reliably displaced beyond the 1nal position, in the direction the stimulus was traveling just prior to its offset. Recent experiments indicate that these localization errors depend on whether or not observers track the moving stimulus with eye-movements. If they track, there is a localization error; if not, the error reduces to zero. The present series of experiments investigated whether localization error might be due, in part, to the binding of the moving stimulus in an action plan. Experiment 1 utilized circular stimulus trajectories, and the eye tracking/ no-tracking discrepancy revealed in previous studies was replicated. Experiment 2 required central 1xation by all observers, and either the computer program (i.e. induction) or a button press by the observer (i.e. intention) produced the stimulus offset.</jats:p>",

Since morphological filtering is the origin of several applications in computer vision, in this paper we are going to describe some new features to implement morphological operations by using digital signal processors. After that, an application to path planning is proposed. The standard shortest path planning problem determines a collision‐free path of shortest distance between two distinct locations in an environment scattered with obstacles. Consequently, a path planning algorithm which uses morphological operations and a DSP to process images is then described.</jats:p>",

The aim is to clarify the extent to which the differences in the current residence of ethnic return migrants stem from their childhood growth environment. First, the groups of foreign-born Estonians are compared based on 1989 Soviet census data. The ethnic return migrants' place of residence is significantly related to their level of education and language skills: two variables corresponding to their previous residence, migration experience, and generational belonging. Second, the survey data are used to measure how closely the return migrants' current level of education and language skills correspond to their early socialization environment. The parents' level of education and the language of childhood significantly impact upon the level of education and language skills that return migrants have today. However, the current differences in the level of education and language skills have also been influenced by their life environment in Estonia. Yet, even when the influence of the current life environment on these variables has been eliminated, the levels of education and language skills appear to be an important source of the differences in residence. Thus, the research supports the idea that an individual's earlier socialization environment has a critical impact on their choice of residence. </jats:p>",

Twenty‐four undergraduates participated as subjects in the experiment. Participants were told to memorize 24 plans of one day (e.g. ‘13:00’, ‘making a telephone call’), and were then asked to recall them in the test phase. Furthermore, we tried to explore their knowledge of everyday activities using a questionnaire. The result showed that plans of night, morning, and evening were recalled better than that of afternoon. This result was explained by the notion that knowledge of one's personal daily activities might affect memory of plans. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore the social construction of masculinities among white working-class youth in contemporary Britain. The literatures of urban sociology, cultural studies, and education have been remarkably ambivalent about ‘lads’, both celebrating and criticising the anti-authority young men who have strutted across the pages of numerous books, papers, and reports. Policymakers, on the other hand, have feared rather than envied this group, representing them as a danger to respectable society. First, through an analysis of these discourses and, second, through an empirical study of two groups of young men, one in a northern English city, the other in a southern city, over a twelve-month period, I explore contemporary versions of masculinity, assessing the extent to which the attitudes and behaviour of the young men whom I interviewed reflect hegemonic notions of working-class masculinity. I suggest that this version of masculinity is itself complex and variable, combining not only protest and resistance but also respectability and domestic aspirations. These latter attributes have generally been ignored in studies of lads'. </jats:p>",

In order to support the design of future negotiated agreements it is useful to discuss how environmentally effective negotiated agreements can be designed. Based on rational decisionmaking and economic theory, the OECD has put forward eight recommendations for designing pollution abatement schemes through negotiated agreements that set ambitious targets, ensure target achievement, and reach targets in an efficient way. Based on three cases of negotiated agreements regulating industrial energy consumption in Denmark, the Netherlands, and France, the adequacy of the OECD recommendations will be discussed. It is found that the recommendations should pay more attention to the question of efficiency of agreements and to the difficulties in defining unambiguous targets. Apart from these deficiencies it is concluded that the recommendations cover all phases, are soundly based in theory, and give a meaningful evaluation of negotiated agreements. </jats:p>",

The Netherlands has taken a particularly hard line against what it calls ‘peripheral’ developments by establishing rules at the national level to curb the growth of out‐of‐town hypermarkets and shopping malls. With the arrival of the Fifth Report on Spatial Planning draft, this resolve seems to have weakened, and deregulation and decentralisation have become the new catchwords. Paradoxically, this is occurring as Belgium, Germany, France and the UK – all of whom have had experience with a more liberal policy – are tightening restrictions. This paper explores this curious shift in terms of political interests, asking who was served by the old planning regime, and who would rather see it go. In this debate, planning ideology and rhetoric was pitted against that of free‐market competition. In the end, it seems as if the latter has gained the upper hand.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author develops the concepts of ‘governance policy’ and how it relates to existing public policy typologies, especially ‘constituent policy’. Although distributive, regulatory, and redistributive types of policy are well understood, scholars have long struggled with an appropriate definition to complete this four-fold typology. Lowi referred to this fourth type as ‘constituent policy’—conferring broad costs and benefits to society—as opposed to policy that affects narrow (often economic) interests. Lowi's conception of constituent policy assumed a top-down process of policymaking dominated by elected officials and administrative agencies. Governance policy represents an attempt to refine the concept of ‘constituent policy’. Governance policy has a prominent procedural component and can be initiated by a bottom-up process of policymaking, via citizen initiatives or interest groups, as well as by a top-down process through political elites. This author explores the history and social significance of governance policy. Cross-sectional data from the fifty states of the USA are used to statistically model explanations for the adoption of nine governance policies. Empirical analysis suggests that states with frequent usage of ballot initiatives are more likely to adopt governance policy, after controlling for other factors. The author also suggests that a Progressive reform tradition, measured by a moralistic political culture, may provide an important trigger for the initial adoption of state direct democracy mechanisms. This suggests that prior adoption of direct democracy mechanisms may provide a necessary intervening trigger for frequent reliance on governance policy. </jats:p>",

As a result of this segregation, a power relationship has been established that informs men's relationships both with women and with other men. While in prison, Irish men developed highly charged political friendships which reinforced the exclusion of women from the body politic. The eradication of women from the political discourses of the prison has been reincarnated years later in the spaces of Nationalist clubs. The private spaces of Long Kesh gave birth to a third space which is constructed from the traditional characteristics of both the private and the public spheres. This third space, unlike the impenetrable walls of the prison, represents an opening up of space whereby men no longer had to mirror the unrealistic image of the superhero. Instead this space represented a homeplace where these men could simply be themselves.</jats:p>",

I explore trade politics in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s in light of two related propositions. First, globalization's domestic effects and the policy requirements imposed by the world economy are at once real and negotiated in the political process—the global economy is ‘socially constructed’ for domestic political/purposes. Second, the ways that the world economy has been constructed can be well understood by using the issue framing and ‘garbage can’ literatures from policy studies. Understandings of the domestic policy requirements of the world economy are at once manufactured in the political process as interests seek to connect old solutions to promising new problems and shape that process as those understandings come to mark the limits of political economic possibility. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1980s, under the influence of global economic processes, there have been dramatic changes in the distribution channels of food, beverages, tobacco, and other fast-moving consumer goods in Turkey, resulting in a redistribution of both economic and social power. The outcome has been the rise of a few businesses, with others being left increasingly vulnerable in the face of a changing environment. Consequently, there has been an important power shift towards large and enormously influential corporations (active in retailing, distribution, as well as in manufacturing) from small manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers who share commonalities with each other despite belonging to different sectors. One indicator of this shift is an ever-growing resentment among traditional communities, witnessed by their lobbying efforts as they look to the state to protect them from the devastating effects of intensifying competition. In this paper, the authors adopt a political economy approach in order to understand this power shift and to incorporate the larger political economy and the effects of globalization into their analysis. They show that these changing power structures are intrinsically connected to both the government's economic policy and also to global influences. In this context, three attributes of post-1980 Turkey are of primary interest: import liberalization, the opening up of the economy to global firms, and persistently high inflation and interest rates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Traditionally, when the public sector wanted more capital assets, it borrowed funds for the purpose. Under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI), private consortia borrow funds to build assets and then, in return for a charge, use them to provide services for the public sector. The authors explore the implications for the public finances of using the PFI. A widely held belief, which has been put forward by the Treasury, is that using the PFI allows investment in assets used by the public sector to grow, even within public spending limits, because PFI investments fall outside the ambit of public borrowing. However, the authors show that if a constant amount of spending is transferred every year from traditional finance to PFI finance, then the fall in public borrowing will diminish over time and may eventually wholly disappear. So, even if some PFI finance is used every year, the scope for extra investment will diminish and may eventually disappear. They also show that, if PFI finance is used, then the required tax yield for a given level of investment may be permanently higher or permanently lower. In addition, they show that, even if a switch to PFI did reduce both public borrowing and taxes, then it might not facilitate much extra investment. </jats:p>",

The key purpose is to document how this information is communicated, consumed, and embodied, and also to evaluate how ‘healthy’ and ‘ill’ bodies constitute important geographies which are negotiated and contested in virtual space. There are two clear foci in the paper. First, using Foucauldian understandings of medicalisation, the notion of a ‘fourth spatialisation’ of the medical gaze is evaluated in the context of the Internet as a new geography of health promotion which enables human subjects to ‘self-diagnose’ and to ‘discipline’ their bodies. Second, this argument is complicated by the use of empirical examples gathered from MS chat rooms, places in which communities of people gather to discuss and to contest medical knowledges which surround the ‘ill’ body. The paper concludes with speculation on research pathways for a ‘new medical geography’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors examine the geographical relations between small business clients and their external suppliers of business advice. The analysis is based on the stratified random sample survey carried out by the ESRC Centre for Business Research in 1999. The analysis demonstrates the importance of localisation in a simplistic sense: a large percentage of advisors are drawn from within 10 km of the client, and almost all from within 50 km for most types of advisor. There are important differences between types of advisors, with public sector advisors, chambers of commerce, and enterprise agencies being the most localised. However, the high degree of localisation is shown to be chiefly dependent on the agglomeration benefits of the accessibility and size of centres in which advisors are located. The general pattern of client – advisor relations is demonstrated to be modelled accurately by a standard spatial interaction model. A key finding is that the spatial pattern of the location of the supply of advisors, particularly the size of the business centres in which they are located, is a key determinant of choice and must be taken into account simultaneously with any role of distance which influences demand, in order to explain the pattern of choice of business advisors. This suggests that small business support policies should be focused chiefly towards small and medium-sized enterprises that have difficulty in accessing major supply sources by virtue of their locations; that is, they should be focused on rural and more peripheral areas. </jats:p>",

Maximum and minimum infrarenal aortic neck diameters were measured from axial CT scans and 3D reformatted slices at the same point on the vessel. Diameter measurements were made at the largest point within the 10-mm segment of vessel below the lowest renal artery. Excluded were aneurysms with proximal neck minimum diameters &gt;30 mm, neck lengths &lt;15 mm, or angulation &gt;75° measured on the axial CT slice. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results:</jats:title><jats:p> Measuring from reformatted CT slices, 86 (71.6%) cases had ≤2-mm differences between maximal and minimal neck diameters, comprising the “round neck” group A. In 34 (28.4%) cases, the neck was not round: 26 (21.7%) had diameter differences between 2 and 4 mm (group B) and 8 (6.7%) had a &gt;4-mm difference (group C; range 4.1–8.1 mm). Although AAA diameter, neck length, and neck angle progressively increased as the difference between neck maximum and minimum diameters grew, i.e., greater eccentricity, these trends did not reach statistical significance. Mean infrarenal neck maximum diameter was significantly larger in group C (30.2 ± 3.4 mm) compared to groups A (23.0 ± 2.9 mm, p = 0.0002) and B (23.8 ± 3.6 mm, p = 0.0003). Hence, 28.4% of AAAs had a noncircular aortic neck of varying degree, and 6.7% had an eccentricity factor that may have clinical significance. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions:</jats:title><jats:p> This study confirms the importance of selecting an endoprosthesis sized 15% to 20% larger than the infrarenal aortic neck diameter. Three-dimensional reconstruction using reformatted CT slices perpendicular to the flow lumen is an important tool that offers enhanced accuracy of infrarenal aortic neck evaluation. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

With increasingly stringent environmental regulations, the current utilization of mineral oil-based fluids is dependent upon shipping all cuttings back to shore for processing and subsequent disposal, resulting in high supplemental costs. Additionally, potential adverse weather conditions could temporarily preventing the transfer of cuttings from the platform to a supply vessel, thereby curtailing the drilling operations and further increasing drilling costs. The operator realized that significant savings to the current overall well costs could be realized if a water-based drilling fluid system were successfully used to drill the large-diameter hole interval that produced the highest volumes of cuttings.</jats:p>",

The scope for increasing the level of local sourcing through policy intervention is then examined and the suitability of various policy models for the UK regions is considered. A number of obstacles to greater local sourcing are identified including the sourcing strategies employed by multinationals and problems of availability, capacity, and competitiveness in local supply bases. The scope for policy intervention, it is argued, is quite limited but supplier-development policies designed to tackle issues of supplier capacity and competitiveness have greater potential than simple ‘brokering’ services. </jats:p>",

We approach this problem through a series of simulation experiments where population and employment are systematically redistributed between different zones within the region. With this procedure we provide some quantitative estimates of prediction errors that follow from the inability to take into account long-term consequences of the location pattern of firms and households.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By using information on state of birth in the 1990 Census of the United States, the authors create a variable serving as a proxy for the distribution of adult children in 1985. This variable is then used in a two-level nested logit model to explain the 1985 – 90 interstate primary migration of elderly black people and elderly white people within the context of environmental amenities and other factors. The main findings are as follows. First, the location of adult children as well as environmental amenities are among the most important attractions for the primary migration of elderly black and white people. Their effects are stronger on white people than on black people. Because a relatively high proportion of out-migrated black adult children are located in the industrial states of the snowbelt and a relatively high proportion of their white counterparts are located in high-amenity states of the sunbelt, the attractions of adult children and environmental amenities are more prone to counter each other for elderly black people and to reinforce each other for elderly white people. Consequently, the net transfers of elderly primary migrants are small and somewhat oriented toward the snowbelt for black people, but they are voluminous and strongly oriented toward the sunbelt for white people. Second, the attraction of adult children is strong for not only the unmarried but also the married elderly, although it is somewhat stronger for the widowed aged 75 years and over. This finding can be taken as evidence for the viability of the ‘modified extended family’ system, which not only legitimizes the out-migration of adult children for career advancement but also encourages the migration of elderly parents to be close to their non-coresident children for services that require continual proximity. It also suggests that the elderly do not have a strong tendency to delay their migration toward non-coresident children until the loss of a spouse or becoming very old. </jats:p>",

On the one hand, it may tighten management control by bringing a new level of panoptic visibility to organizational activities; on the other hand, the embedded business model within the ERP may drive empowerment of employees and greater control relaxation through the configuration of new process design. How will the implementation of an ERP system affect organizational control? Our This research seeks to understand how the different forces play out in the context of ERP implementation, and to explore the implications for traditional power distribution in organizations.This paper adopts a mixed qualitative-quantitative methodology in an intensive case study of a restructured hospital in Singapore. A survey of 260 users was administered, supplemented by approximately 27 hours of individual interviews with 23 people. Results reveal that although ERP as a technology can facilitate both empowerment and panoptic control, management has consciously resisted empowerment by working to re-institute the \"loss of power\" driven by power lost through the ERP implementation. On the other hand, the new panoptic visibility, though partially unintended, appears to have evolved naturally and was readily learnted and applied in the organization. This study is significant in exposing the likelihood of ERP implementation as a technology to that perpetuates management power. At least in the context of the hospital studied, it is yet another means of enlarging the management authority for \"total control.\"</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the spatial distributions of four types of technological hazards in the Phoenix, Arizona, metropolitan area. The focus is on the locations of hazardous industrial and toxic waste sites in relation to the demographic composition of adjacent neighborhoods. Our interest is to determine whether hazardous sites, including industrial facilities in the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, Large Quantity Generators of hazardous wastes, Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities, and federally identified contamination sites, are disproportionately located in areas with lower income and minority residents. We examine patterns of environmental inequity in Phoenix, a sprawling Sunbelt city with a growing post-Fordist industrial sector. First, using 1996 EPA data for four types of technological hazards, and 1995 Special Census data for Maricopa County, we employ a GIS to map the spatial distributions of hazardous sites and to analyze the demographic characteristics of census tracts with and without point-source hazards. A second methodology is used to produce a cumulative hazard density index for census tracts, based on the number of hazard zones—one-mile-radius circles around each facility—that overlay each tract. Both methodologies disclose clear patterns of social inequities in the distribution of technological hazards. The cumulative hazard density index provides a spatially sensitive methodology that reveals the disproportionate distribution of risk burdens in urban census tracts. The findings point to a consistent pattern of environmental injustice by class and race across a range of technological hazards in the Phoenix metropolitan region. </jats:p>",
