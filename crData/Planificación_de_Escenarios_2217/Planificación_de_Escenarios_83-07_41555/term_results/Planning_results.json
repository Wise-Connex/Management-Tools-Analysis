Answers to these questions create a three-dimensional matrix of obligation where all three dimen sions comprise a holistic gestalt—some— times consistent and sometimes in con flict. Within this framework is the notion of multiple moral communities, the pulls between good ends and right actions, and the ambiguities and complexities of the situational contexts of ethical choice. </jats:p>",

Not only does it fail to guide prac tice, it contributes to cognitive dissonance and alienation among practitioners. Plan ning schools agree on no body of litera ture and ideas to count as planning theory. Planning is like a paradigm \"in crisis,\" in that theory does not mesh with experience. Moreover, neither of the two main candidates for the prime exemplar for planning practice—the master plan model or the policy analysis model — is acceptable enough to provide coherence to the field </jats:p>",

Often data from such sources are in conflict with each other as well as at odds with professional recommendations, and planners and public officials must evaluate the veracity of dif ferent inputs. This article illustrates how citizen input can vary depending upon the method used to obtain it, discusses the reasons for these differences, and sug gests factors that must be considered when using citizen input in practice and when educating planning students. The article holds that planners have an obliga tion to face up to tough, possibly unpop ular planning decisions that cannot be derived by averaging out citizen opinion. </jats:p>",

Implications of recognizing the distinction between land-use decisions and their uncertain outcomes are discussed. The land-use changes are modelled using a Markov process. Because of the computational difficulties in determining the return associated with the complete range of possible decision sets, a heuristic technique is required.

Despite this attachment to national planning, Malaysia remains a staunchly market-oriented, open, and predominantly private enterprise economy. Nevertheless, as the role of planning expanded, private sector activity became increasingly subject to policy interventions predicated upon the politically-determined goals of development planning.</jats:p>",

Indeed, Malaysia ranks as one of the non-Communist developing countries where planning is most highly institutionalized. Malaysian planning evolved as an effective policy mechanism for directing the authoritative allocation of public resources towards declared developmental objectives. Despite this attachment to national planning, Malaysia remains a staunchly market-oriented, open, and predominantly private enterprise economy. Nevertheless, as the role of planning expanded, private sector activity became increasingly subject to policy interventions predicated upon the politically-determined goals of development planning.</jats:p>",

The beam data may consist of, e.g., percentage depth doses along the central axis plus off‐axis ratios (OAR) at several depths. In some systems, the calculation of an off‐axis plan is based on the assumption that the OAR can be represented by a separable function: OAR(<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>y</jats:italic>)= <jats:italic>f</jats:italic>(<jats:italic>x</jats:italic>)⋅ <jats:italic>g</jats:italic>( <jats:italic>y</jats:italic>), where <jats:italic>x</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>y</jats:italic> are the symmetry axes perpendicular to the beam axis and the functions <jats:italic>f</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>g</jats:italic> are equal for a square open field. The errors of this assumption for a 4‐MeV machine were measured for open fields and wedged fields at five different depths. The measured dose was compared with that predicted by the above equation for points at 50%, 75%, and 88% of the half field width from the beam axis.

Specifically, the paper examines towns from the Manitoba portion of the prairies which have benefited from modest population gain in the period 1966–1976. It relates that population change to a number of factors presumed to be influential in this essentially rural nonmetropolitan milieu. These embrace objective quality-of-life indicators, objective measures of economic activity, and subjective indexes expressing people's preferences for small-town living. A two-part model of small-town population change is construed, one part to focus on the relationships between population change and economic activity for the 1971–1976 episode and the second part to deal with the situation pertaining to 1966–1971. The division is maintained in order to trace nonrecursive as well as recursive effects on population change. The preeminence of social as opposed to economic factors is a major conclusion arising from this model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the elderly comprise an increasing proportion of the urban populations of Western societies, issues affecting their welfare attract greater concern. Theories of gerontology which focus upon the process of ageing highlight the importance of morale and the ways in which it may be related to key events in the life cycle such as retirement, onset of ill-health, or loss of spouse. These ‘personal’ factors are clearly of fundamental importance, but there are also ‘situational’ factors which exert an influence upon the morale of old people. Residential environments and neighbourhoods fall into this latter group of factors. In this paper a simple recursive model is developed which seeks to examine the extent of influence of situational factors upon morale. The model allows direct and indirect influences to be measured and it tests for the interplay of personal and situational factors. Results show that personal competency has a strong influence upon morale, not just directly but also through its impact on other related factors such as spatial mobility. Empirical data used as input to the model also allow an examination of variations in environmental influences upon morale among different social-class groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An understanding of local concepts of illness and disease that underlie disease classification systems is essential for designing culturally relevant training programs in primary health care. Prior to training personnel in primary health care in Idere, Nigeria, residents were interviewed revealing that two main groups of disease exist. Generally, arun is serious, chronic and contagious, while aisan represents temporary indispositions. When given seventeen conditions to classify, respondents clearly demarked five as arun and five as aisan while the remainder fell in a grey area in between. Ironically, malaria which is a dangerous disease to young children, was classified as aisan. </jats:p><jats:p> The disease classification system is being used as a general point of departure for discussion during training. Concerning training on the specific diseases, appropriate ideas are reinforced while others are modified all within the context of the local classification system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problems created by multicollinearity when estimating a single equation least squares model are well-known. This problem is particularly troublesome in ecological research because of the heavy reliance of this field on census data and other secondary data sources. This paper explores one solution to the problem of multicollinearity in ecological research—ridge regression. Using census-tract data from Cleveland, Ohio for the years 1960–1970, an ecological model, known as the tipping-point model, of neighborhood change, was evaluated. It was determined that multicollinearity was a problem. To minimize the detrimental effects of multicollinearity and to facilitate structural interpretation, the model was reestimated with the ridge regression technique. The result was a total mean square error that was significantly smaller than the total variance resulting from an ordinary least squares solution. Hence, the estimates of the coefficients produced by the ridge regression were closer, on the average, to the true population parameters than the ordinary least squares estimates. </jats:p><jats:p> Results of the ordinary least squares and ridge regression are presented and discussed and the utility of ridge regression in ecological research is evaluated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Large areas of the remaining wetlands in the United Kingdom are faced with virtual extinction because of the pressures engendered by high productivity farming practices, reinforced by subsidised land drainage and flood protection schemes as well as by price supports for agricultural produce in the European Economic Community. Unique environmental resources are being put at risk by changing farming methods and in particular by arable conversion schemes. A case study, the Yare Barrier Proposal in Norfolk, is used to analyse and evaluate the environmental impacts of drainage and flood protection schemes on the surrounding wetland ecosystems. An opportunity cost model is used to estimate the costs and benefits involved in this policy decision on preservation versus development. We conclude that the case for the agricultural development of the wetlands made on the grounds of economic efficiency is not a strong one. </jats:p>",
