It could be said that the purpose of these studies are to state how large the security loading must be in order to avoid ruin of the insurance business. It has often been said that the classical approach with an infinite planning horizon is unrealistic. The main reason for this attitude is that if the security loading is equal to zero then ruin is certain. Since in practice it is often difficult to estimate the true size of the security loading the whole problem of ruin or non-ruin seems to rest on a rather shaky foundation. This attitude to the problem is reflected in studies in risk theory performed in recent years. The infinite planning horizon is then often replaced by a finite time period. Since the probability of ruin during a short period of time depends to a minor extent on the size of the security loading these studies are concentrated mainly on the shape of the claim distribution, while the security loading is of minor interest.</jats:p><jats:p>Let us think of a gambling-house, where coin-tossing is practised. Let us assume that the gambling-house for reason of fairness decides to pay two dollars to each winner who has staked one dollar. Probability theory tells us that however rich the gambling-house may be, it will be ruined in the long run. This simple example reminds us of the trivial fact that insurance business without a sufficient security loading in the premium is commercially impossible.</jats:p>",

Following the definition of some basic terms and concepts which might be used in the future development of a notational schema, the paper considers some possibilities which are inherent in the idea of timing space. This is followed by similar consideration of the idea of spacing time. These themes are compounded in a simple example which suggests that fundamental ongoing processes in daily urban behaviour are usefully summarised by what we call the accordion effect. The final section proposes that new insights into the problem of evaluating the quality of life of urban residents are obtained when such an approach is taken. </jats:p>",

For a general distributed-lag transfer-function model of regional economic structure, the paper examines the nature of patterns of parameter variation that may be present. Methods of estimating such adaptive or innovative changes in parameter variation are then discussed, and one method based upon assuming a random-walk model of parameter behaviour is applied to estimating dynamic parameter trends, shifts, and stochastic variation for a five-equation model of the North-west region. Changes in this model structure are found to characterise, mainly, parameters associated with employment linkage, and migration and industrial-movement responses. In most cases, the employment-exchange areas in the North-west are shown to be increasingly amplifying, rather than damping, national economic fluctuations. An attempt is also made to link the observed shifts in parameter values to changes in policy instruments. </jats:p>",

Several weighted and double-weighted digraphs are built to provide a test of the construction methodology, to provide a test of the methods of analysis of such digraphs, and to illustrate the type of analysis one can make using such digraphs as models of complex systems. The digraphs are constructed within the context of the transportation system of a hypothetical metropolitan area, similar to the County of San Diego, California. The digraphs are used to compare fuel consumption and air pollution under two scenarios: the nominal case, where clean air standards are met by some retrofitting of cars with smog control devices; and the bus case, where cars are banned and an expensive wide-ranging bus system is introduced. It is concluded that weighted and double-weighted digraphs can be constructed relatively inexpensively and that at least weighted, and probably double-weighted, digraphs can be used at an early stage of a policy-making task to set directions for further research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Multiple-use planning is useful in matching forest production possibilities and social desires. A linear programming model for multiple-use planning is presented. Planning is approached as a set of production objectives which have a set of management activities to help achieve them and a set of constraints which limit the management activities. Timber yield is the objective function and other multiple-use objectives are stated as constraints. Production can be increased by certain management activities, but these activities are limited by budget, cutting, and other technical constraints. Size of the area cut is the choice variable and the solution is tied to 21.6-acre (8.74-ha) grid cells thereby identifying the geographical location of management and production activities. The model was tested on a planning unit and sensitivity analyses were performed on the initial optimal solution. These indicated that on this planning unit, there is a wide range of production alternatives which will not affect other multiple-use production possibilities and that production is sensitive to budget changes. </jats:p>",

Three main aspects are presented: the construction of mixed-mode demand models; the calculation of user benefits; and the consideration of optimization procedures for the design process. The problems of determining the optimal number, location, parking charges, and sizes of car parks are considered. Discussion is appropriate to car—bus and car—rail interchange. </jats:p>",
