Whether Spanish conquistador or Virginia planter, each hoped to make America and native Americans into the shape of idealized Europes and Europeans. Of all those who made such plans, it was the Society of Jesus that had sufficient authority and manpower to put its visions into practice. Jesuits who came to New France in the 1630s brought not only Christianity but a whole complex of European social and political values. To examine Jesuit “civilization planning” in New France is to see in microcosm a significant part of early European-Indian relations.</jats:p>",

By repeating the analysis for several levels of investment, a cost‐effectiveness tradeoff curve can be developed.</jats:p>",

The first classification system for the growth pole draws on the techniques developed by Luttrell and Tosco in their research projects connected with the Mezzogiorno and North-west England. The second model postulates alternative linkage development paths which the firm may take both in terms of location and production—process structure over time. </jats:p>",
