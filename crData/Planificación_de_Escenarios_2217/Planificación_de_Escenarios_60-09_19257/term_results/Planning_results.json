Our intention here is to present some findings bearing upon the role of long-range planning primarily, though not exclusively, in metropolitan governments.</jats:p><jats:p>Much, though surely not all, of city planning today is directly related to capital programming. This is especially so in <jats:italic>large</jats:italic> cities for at least three major reasons: basic physical plant and utilities are often run down or obsolescent for a complex of historical reasons; many routine programs are “capital-intensive” and are becoming more so under the impact of new technology and professional standards; and urban renewal has entailed an increasingly entrepreneurial approach to land-use planning. Capital programming itself is a process of separate budgetary decision on capital items, however defined. The rationale for the separate decision process values “planning” highly and emphasizes <jats:italic>fiscal</jats:italic> planning of outlay that is loan-financed and <jats:italic>physical</jats:italic> planning of projects distinguished by “lumpiness” and/or longevity. It follows from these considerations that the planning and programming of physical improvements cannot be sharply separated from the remainder of municipal policy. City planning as applied to capital programming has to do not only with land use but with most functional programs and with fiscal policy.</jats:p><jats:p>While some long-range municipal planning will probably take place in the line departments, the focal point of planning is likely to be the review and assembly of the overall capital program, at which point fiscal, programmatic and land-use planning all come into play even if the principal competence and concern of the planning agency is in land-use planning. The planning agency can be conceived as performing any or all of the four roles of <jats:italic>research, integration, allocation</jats:italic>, and provision of the <jats:italic>long view.</jats:italic> While conceptually distinguishable, these roles tend to merge in the practice of capital program review.</jats:p>",
