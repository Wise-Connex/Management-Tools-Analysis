Transient climate change simulations of a coupled ocean‐atmosphere GCM (ECHAM4/OPYC3) project a change towards enhanced ENSO activities in the tropical Pacific, as well as increase in mean monsoon rainfall and variability over India. However, the interannual correlations between the two are strong throughout the 240 year simulation. Analysis of monsoon viz‐a‐viz ENSO in the model simulations suggest a diminished impact of warm ENSO (El Niño) events on monsoon, while the impact of cold ENSO (La Niña) events remains unchanged in the scenario. Anomalous warming over the Eurasian landmass as well as enhanced moisture conditions over the Indian monsoon region in the global warming scenario have possibly contributed to the weakening of the impact of warm ENSO events on monsoon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To improve a working process, one or more process components can be replaced by innovative ones. The literature provides a possible source of innovative process components. However, it is often difficult to evaluate whether a particular innovative process component satisfying an improvement goal can be introduced to replace a process component in the working software process to be improved. In previous works, the authors of this paper proposed a characterization and evaluation framework to address the above problem. To improve the usability of the framework, a scenario was defined for each question to help the user answer it methodically. The experiment presented in this paper aims to verify if a scenario‐based reading technique improves the usability of the framework. The results obtained show that the technique proposed makes assessment of which process components of a working process are candidates for making innovation more reliable. Moreover, the scenario‐based reading technique is user independent and only a little training may be sufficient to sensibly improve the effectiveness of use of the scenarios. The trustworthy results of this technique and its independence of the user's previous knowledge and ability ensure that it can be applied methodically.
