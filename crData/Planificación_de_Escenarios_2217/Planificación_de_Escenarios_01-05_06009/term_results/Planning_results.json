Within the planning profession, there has likewise been a growing recognition of its possible relevance in the areas of land use and general community development, and planners are increasingly finding themselves either leading or being expected to contribute to local “sustainable development” efforts. The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to the sustainability framework in terms of its scientific basis and cultural interpretations and to identify and explore conceptual associations that tend to tie it to the planning profession. </jats:p>",

However, such work arrangements do affect workers’ travel needs and thus themix of travelers, destinations, and trip purposes, as well as equitable access to housing, jobs, and amenities. They are also likely to further disperse residences in the long run, with consequences for both land use and transportation, except where counterbalanced by workers’ rising time values and/or increased uncertainty about future travel destinations or times. Thus, the authors recommend that academic researchers and metropolitan planning organizations cooperate to identify effects of telecommunication-and mobility-enabled work arrangements on travel and location behavior in the long run and at the detailed scale necessary for truly forward-looking planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper identifies features of well-known planning modes affecting the likelihood of manipulation. Results from social choice theory and the economic theory of organisation help to explain why certain combinations of planning styles and organisational characteristics stimulate or hamper manipulation. Although the planning process can be rigged in many ways, false revelation of preferences and strategic agenda formation are primarily studied here. When each decisionmaker can rank the alternatives any way he or she wants, the Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem states that manipulation-free procedures for making recommendations do not exist unless cyclical decisions or high concentrations of power are accepted. In general, a low probability of cyclical recommendations and a strong organisational bias favouring certain interests and alternatives reduce the likelihood of successful manipulation. It is argued that these conditions are present particularly in advocacy planning and—perhaps counterintuitively—to some extent in disjointed incrementalism. </jats:p>",

Unlike HSP's heuristic, our method    does not assume facts to be independent. We introduce a novel search    strategy that combines hill-climbing with systematic search, and we    show how other powerful heuristic information can be extracted and    used to prune the search space. FF was the most successful automatic    planner at the recent AIPS-2000 planning competition. We review the    results of the competition, give data for other benchmark domains, and    investigate the reasons for the runtime performance of FF compared to    HSP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Supply chain integration (or synchronisation) is to a large extent still only a promise, despite many considerable efforts by organisations and their customers and suppliers. Lack of visibility of true consumer demand and collaborative relationships based upon joint decision making remain significant barriers to the goal of supply chain integration. Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) is a strategy which promises to overcome these barriers, and seeks through joint planning, joint decision making and the development of a clearer understanding of the dynamics of the supply chain replenishment process to deliver some of the promised benefits of actual supply chain integration. Despite the existence of a detailed and comprehensive process model, and promising initial results there has not been widespread adoption of CPFR, justifying the need to revisit the process model and to further explore the inhibitors and enablers. Based upon a review of the existing literature and a comprehensive survey of participants in existing CPFR implementations, this paper identifies the critical inhibitors and makes some proposals as to how these inhibitors may be overcome.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the concerns, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of some people continue to be misstated, unknown, and ignored. Furthermore, some people continue to be excluded in information gathering and planning either by design or lack of effort, which can lead to poor information and planning, increased conflict and cost of conflict, poor collaboration, and increased mistrust and apathy. Use of key informant interviews, focus groups, and visual techniques such as stakeholder mapping, vision galleries, and sacred place mapping can help planners, municipal foresters, and arborists to better develop mail and telephone surveys. These methods can also be used to gather information about people's opinions and attitudes, help identify and include both insiders and outsiders in the community forest planning process, and help reduce conflict.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We present a procedure that uses nonlinear optimization theory to plan complex, three-dimensional well paths and path corrections while drilling. The problem of hitting a 3-D target is posed as seeking a profile that optimizes some well-defined objective function (the optimality criterion) subject to equality and inequality constraints. The well path is idealized to contain a finite combination of turn and straight sections. Operational restrictions translate into inequality constraints, and target restrictions translate into equality constraints. Several optimality criteria may be chosen, and appropriate choices are discussed. In this work, we choose optimization with respect to user preferred parameters as the criterion. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is solved using a sequential gradient-restoration algorithm (SGRA), with scaling and optimal step-size selection. The optimization problem formulation and the solution procedure are described. The procedure is robust, efficient, and clearly superior to trial-and-error heuristic techniques that are commonly used to plan well paths today. A computer program based on this technique has been developed and successfully used. Two examples are included to illustrate the procedure. It is concluded that nonlinear optimization is a powerful and versatile mathematical tool that can be used for planning better, optimal well paths, and can be extended to several other drilling and production problems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents the first randomized approach to kinodynamic planning (also known as trajectory planning or trajectory design). The task is to determine control inputs to drive a robot from an ini ial configuration and velocity to a goal configuration and velocity while obeying physically based dynamical models and avoiding obstacles in the robot’s environment. The authors consider generic systems that express the nonlinear dynamics of a robot in terms of the robot’s high-dimensional configuration space. Kinodynamic planning is treated as a motion-planning problem in a higher dimensional state space that has both first-order differential constraints and obstacle-based global constraints. The state space serves the same role as the configuration space for basic path planning; however, standard randomized path-planning techniques do not directly apply to planning trajectories in the state space. The authors have developed a randomized planning approach that is particularly tailored to trajectory planning problems in high-dimensional state spaces. The basis for this approach is the construction of rapidly exploring random trees, which offer benefits that are similar to those obtained by successful randomized holonomic planning methods but apply to a much broader class of problems. Theoretical analysis of the algorithm is given. Experimental results are presented for an implementation that computes trajectories for hovercrafts and satellites in cluttered environments, resulting in state spaces of up to 12 dimensions. </jats:p>",

A commercially available hierarchical planning software suite is used to analyze the impact of the adjacency and harvest size objectives within SFI on a representative forest of the U.S. Southeast. Ten alternative, spatially feasible tactical schedules were developed for a 15 yr planning horizon and achieved 73.4 to 75.6% of the harvest volume predicted by the nonspatial strategic harvest schedule. Spatially feasible harvest levels were negatively affected by increasingly restrictive spatial parameters: the cost of increasing the greenup interval by 1 yr was at least 5% of the strategic harvest volume, and reducing the maximum allowable block size from 180 ac to 60 ac yielded a 10% reduction in harvest. The planning software has been implemented at Champion International Corporation, providing planners with a valuable tool for strategic and tactical forest planning. South. J. Appl.

The results show considerable variation between villages and the analysis of the bid function shows underlying factors to project success that can be used in project planning. The policy implications are to plant new VWL where natural forests are inaccessible, where people have prior experience of VWL, and where fuel consumption relies heavily on market purchases. Such plantations are expected to give greatest benefit to families with few men and many women. An analysis of the reliability of the study concludes that many of the observed biases originate from the enumerators. The study also recommends that one should be careful with the use of a discrete design in a cultural context such as this that is prone to yea-saying, and that strategic bias can arise from an open ended question that follows up the start bid in a culture characterized by bargaining.</jats:p>",

Administrative data are available from a variety of state, federal, and private sources and can, in many cases, be combined. As a tool for planning and surveillance, administrative data show great promise: They contain consistent elements, are available in a timely manner, and provide information about large numbers of individuals. Because they are available in an electronic format, they are relatively inexpensive to obtain and use. In the United States, however, there is no administrative data set covering the entire population. Although Medicare provides health care for an estimated 96% of the elderly, age 65 years and older, there is no comparable source for those under 65.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to detail some of the epistemological difficulties in ever achieving that aim. We do so by offering a foundational scientific analysis of home death in Washington State, and then turning to a postmedical deconstruction of that scholarship within the space of a single paper. Although the result is a reflexive self-critical paper on how we know the geography of home death, it is by no means a resolution of the debate. A key epistemological impasse is identified between the foundationalism in our quantitative analysis and our poststructural critique. This impasse leads to different and irreconcilable aims between the two halves of the paper. In our reflections we stress the need to recognize explicitly this epistemological irreconcilability in order to temper the promise of an easy solution to the debate between medical and health geography. We nevertheless suggest that scholarly, ethical, and political insights can be gained from this project. </jats:p>",

Participants were students and faculty members from multiple adult education graduate programs in North America. Results indicated that in conflicted planning situations, counteracting was favored as an influencing tactic over reasoning and consulting. In consensual planning situations, reasoning and consulting were favored, and counteracting was deemed ineffective. Program planners may benefit from a greater understanding of the power and influencing tactics used in different situations. Further work can better identify and measure the factors that are most critical when negotiating power and interests. Future research should focus on enhancing instrument reliability and validity, clarifying the theoretical model, and using a broader sample of program planners. </jats:p>",

Although much of the current Internet discussion focuses on sales and marketing applications, step change improvements in the management of the supply chain are possible using the same fundamental technologies. However, it is argued that a paradigm shift in the way in which manufacturing companies plan and control their operations is required if full advantage is to be gained; an alternative to the traditional linear transfer of information within supply chains is required. The Internet provides the opportunity for demand data and supply capacity data to be visible to all companies within a manufacturing supply chain, consequently companies can be in a position to anticipate demand fluctuations and respond accordingly. This is in contrast to the more established reactive approach. This paper proposes the development of supply webs and a more interactive approach to supply chain partnering and identifies some of the research issues within this context to facilitate the development of Internet‐based manufacturing planning and control.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A number of cities in the United Kingdom have recently placed a policy focus on the ability of sports events and stadia to stimulate economic and physical regeneration. Such development is most often justified from a development and regeneration perspective. Under this paradigm, the urban redevelopment which occurs consequent on stadium construction creates benefits which ‘trickle down’ from property developers, sports teams, and stadium operators to the wider community—largely in the form of employment growth. However, the attraction of the hallmark events which are (in the United Kingdom) the major revenue stream of the stadium can be reread in the context of the constant competition evidenced between cities and between regions to draw in mobile capital resources via a programme of public subsidy for private business. Under such a paradigm, the potential for the stadium to contribute to uneven development, both within and between cities, is problematic. The author examines the arguments for and against stadium development in terms of the likely effects on the economic and social fabric of the city, and identifies likely winners and losers. The role of mobile capital, political elites, and growth coalitions in driving changes in the structure and use of common space in the urban core is examined with the aid of a case study of Cardiff and the Millennium Stadium. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, regulationist research has increasingly focused on questions of subnational governance and regulation. Whilst there has been a shift towards new forms of local governance across the United Kingdom, in this paper I contend that the interaction between new mechanisms of (national) regulation and preexisting local conditions has produced considerable spatial variation in the precise forms of governance that have emerged at the local level. Following Peck, I suggest that this can be seen in terms of the interaction of distinct institutional ‘layers’. This insight is developed by adapting Offe's notion of ‘institutional filters’ to emphasise the role of regional agencies in mediating and ‘filtering’ the effects of wider (national) regulatory mechanisms. In the second half of the paper, I apply these ideas to a particular regional case study, assessing how the national-level shift towards neoliberalism has shaped the practice of economic governance in the Scottish Highlands in the 1990s. As mid-level metaphors, ideas of institutional ‘layers’ and ‘filters’ help to open up a space for the consideration of agency and strategy at regional level, thereby addressing what has been termed the ‘regulationist enigma’, defined in terms of the need to avoid ‘reading off’ regional transformations from the posited logic of broader macrostructural shifts. </jats:p>",

In this study we examine trends in regional inequality over the period 1964 to 1991 during which fundamental changes in health policies were implemented. We follow a multidimensional approach in the sense that several indicators of health facilities are considered. Regional inequality is measured by means of Theil's second measure of multidimensional inequality. The partial common principal components (PCPC) model is used to construct the weights for this measure whenever appropriate, and principal component analysis (PCA) is used when otherwise. The PCPC model is a generalisation of the classical method of PCA for several samples (years). Component coefficients are estimated by assuming that the first component is common for all years. Spatial inequality between regions as well as within regions is analysed to highlight the role of policy and other regional characteristics. Spatial spillovers are analysed by including the effects of health facilities in neighbouring regions. The analysis shows that the health policies of the Spanish government in the 1980s and decentralisation of power may have helped to reduce regional inequality, although no firm conclusions can be drawn yet. </jats:p>",

For a local population, the data available from the census allow a three-level nested model to be assumed, with an individual level (level 1), an enumeration district (ED) level (level 2), and a ward level (level 3). The consequences of ignoring one of the three levels in this model are assessed here theoretically. Empirical results, based on 1991 UK Census data, are also provided, comparing the variance components estimated from the three-level model with analyses based on models where the ED or ward level are ignored. The results show how the variation that occurs at the level not included in the models is redistributed to the other levels that the models do include. </jats:p>",

Sales prices and assessment data from the Hamilton, Ontario, metropolitan area for 1976, 1996, and 1999 confirm these patterns and show that they are persistent. In addition, cross-tabulations by market value and location show that geographical variations in assessment ratios are caused by the inequitable treatment of inexpensive property, not vice versa.

This contribution analyses workplace mobility—the acceptance of a job at a great distance from the place of residence—using a direct measure which includes both migration and long commutes as means for covering this distance. Two sources of spatial inflexibility are identified. The first is a low overall chance of general job mobility; the second is a limited search area leading to low workplace mobility. In a two-step analysis we show that workers who find another job are a highly selective group. Within this group the variation in accepting a job at a great distance is wide, because of the individual restrictions that are often gendered. We also show that ample availability of job opportunities stimulates general job mobility and reduces workplace mobility, but only after controlling for individual restrictions. These findings are in line with the spatial mismatch hypothesis. </jats:p>",

The dwell times are optimized using an inverse planning simulated annealing algorithm (IPSA) governed entirely from the anatomy extracted from a CT and by a dedicated objective function (cost function) reflecting clinical prescription and constraints. With this inverse planning approach, the focus is on the physician's prescription and constraint instead of on the technical limitations. Consequently, the physician's control on the treatment is improved. The capacity of this algorithm to represent the physician's prescription is presented for a clinical prostate case. The computation time (CPU) for IPSA optimization is less than 1 min (41 s for 142 915 iterations) for a typical clinical case, allowing fast and practical dose optimization. The achievement of highly conformal dose coverage to the target volume opens the possibility to deliver a higher dose to the prostate without inducing overdosage of urethra and normal tissues surrounding the prostate. Moreover, using the same concept, it will be possible to deliver a boost dose to a delimited tumor volume within the prostate. Finally, this method can be easily extended to other anatomical sites.</jats:p>",

Participants are asked to preplan mentally a sequence of moves to match a start set of discs to a goal, and then to execute the moves one by one. The mental preplanning stage has been identified as critical to efficient performance. The current experiments examined whether manipulations of mental preplanning influence performance on the TOL. In Experiment 1, the effect of different planning instructions was examined. Those told to make full mental plans spent considerably longer in planning than participants given no specific planning instructions, yet there was no effect of instruction condition on the efficiency of executing plans. Experiment 2 investigated whether people were able to plan mentally, by looking at their ability to identify intermediate states of an optimum mental plan. Results indicated that most individuals could make accurate preplans up to two subgoals ahead, but not three. However, making an efficient preplan did not result in better subsequent execution of moves to solve the TOL trial. It is concluded that people can make effective mental plans for a limited number of moves. However, on the TOL task, mental preplanning does not offer benefits in terms of quicker performance, or more accurate solution. The nature of planning in the TOL task is therefore questioned. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Tower of Hanoi (ToH) task was given to 238 children aged from 7 to 15 years, and 20 adults. Individual variation within an age band was substantial. ToH score did not correlate significantly with Verbal IQ, nor with ability to inhibit a prepotent response. We readministered the ToH to 45 children after 30 to 40 days. The test‐retest correlation of .5 is low in relation to accepted psychometric standards, though at least as high as reliability of the related Tower of London (ToL) in adults. The reasons for low reliability remain unclear; task novelty did not seem to be involved, as children did not improve on retest. We conclude that it is not safe to use this test to index integrity or maturation of underlying neurological systems in children. We compared our results with three published studies using the ToL with children, and found similar levels of performance on problems involving the same number of moves. Another study using automated ToL obtained much poorer scores, suggesting that computerised presentation may impair children's performance.</jats:p>",

Various pre‐operative scans (T1‐ and T2‐weighted MRI, MR angiography, and functional MRI (fMRI)) are fused and automatically aligned with the operating field of the interventional MR system. Both pre‐surgical and intra‐operative data may be segmented to generate three‐dimensional surface models of key anatomical and functional structures. Models are combined in a three‐dimensional scene along with reformatted slices that are driven by a tracked surgical device. Thus, pre‐operative data augments interventional imaging to expedite tissue characterization and precise localization and targeting. As the surgery progresses, and anatomical changes subsequently reduce the relevance of pre‐operative data, interventional data is refreshed for software navigation in true real time. The system has been applied in 45 neurosurgical cases and found to have beneficial utility for planning and guidance. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2001;13:967–975. © 2001 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.</jats:p>",
