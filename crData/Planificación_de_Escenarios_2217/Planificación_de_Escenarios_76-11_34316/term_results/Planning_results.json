      "abstract": "<jats:p>A new increasing awareness of the finite quality of land as a resource exists in the United States today. This change in perspective is challenging traditional practices resulting in conflicting values in American society. The issue of land use planning is extremely complex and influences by a multitude of independent yet interrelated factors such as government—local, State, and Federal, the citizen; the developer; the courts; industry and technology; and banking. Tradiationally, the right to plan and control land in the United States rests with each individual State. There are a minimum of 160 Federal programs—grant, loan, and regulatory, which impact land use in addition to individual State and local programs. A variety of tools and mechanisms have been developed to resolve the complex land use problem. Coordination is sought in all 50 States through an A-95 Clearinghouse mechanism and supplemental State programs. The courts are taking an increasingly active role in influencing the direction of land use planning. An attempt to relate recently enacted or proposed noise control legislation to these land use processes will be included.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The EPA has developed an Airport Noise Regulatory concept, including an impact analysis methodology and a readily understandable format for the presentation of results. The regulatory process provides a means of reducing and/or preventing aviation noise impacts via a balanced mix of aviation actions and lead use controls. The analysis methodology which EPA has developed is based upon a comparison of aviation noise and the background levels which are due to all sources other than aviation. Hence, the noise impacts of multi modal systems can be evaluated. Noise criteria have been developed for the classification of airports, by severity of impact, and for goals necessary to protect the public health and welfare. The regulatory process was designed to insure participation of the airport proprietor, local governments, and the general public. Each airport noise abatement plan will be subjected to public scrutiny, in an open hearing, as well as to review by the Federal Aviation Administration, with consulation by the EPA. The process results in an airport operating pier for noise abatement which is basic to land use planning.</jats:p>",

Land use plans developed during the study were concerned with a variety of proposed projects at one large waterfront facility operated by the Port of Seattle and covering the time period of 1976–1980. During the study both adverse and beneficial noise impacts were identified using the criteria of the existing conditions at the facility and the Washington State Noise Standards. Emphasis in the paper presented is placed on the cost effectiveness of careful land use planning through a tradeoff comparison between different noise-abatement approaches. The results and discussions presented are based on measurements of noises made specifically for this study, during previous waterfront noise studies and those reported in the literature. Proposed and potential uses for the waterfront facility are described in the terminal layout plan along with projected construction and facility changes. These include relocation of roads, rail tracks, rail headings, location of ship unloading berths, truck and rail car loading ramps, and building demolitions and replacements.</jats:p>",

The conditions for first and second-order dynamic equilibrium are determined, and it is shown that first-order equilibrium provides a useful criterion for financial health. Two sets of first-order solutions are examined: (1) those involving total expenditures, operating income, and the endowment payout rate; and (2) those involving tradeoffs between the net budget increase factor and tuition. The endowment payout rate emerges as a key policy variable that should be set on the basis of budget variables and total return on the endowment, rather than as the result of endowment yield. A region of instability in the solution space is defined; this region should be avoided. Stationary equilibrium, in which the fraction of the budget supported by endowment remains constant over time, simplifies the model and has other desirable properties. </jats:p>",

The purpose of the workshop was to prepare local, state, and Federal government land use planners to identify and quantify potential noise problems using current analytical techniques and solutions to noise problems through compatible land use planning. The Workshop was divided into several major elements. Problem definition, assessment alternatives and problem solutions presented the land use planner with a logical, sequential path of attack. A discussion of the integration of Federal, State, and local legislative parameters into the planning process was coupled with the latest analytical techniques and noise prediction programs. Potential solutions to the noise problems included planning as well as operational controls. Comprehensive and master planning, zoning, architectural controls, building codes, and capital improvement planning were among the solutions covered. The purpose of this paper is to present highlights of the major elements of the Workshop.</jats:p>",

The study began with an experimental design and the random assigment of areas to treatment and control but was completed as a multivariate analysis, treating program input as an interval-scaled independent variable. Using “before” and “after” area sample surveys and patient service data from operating programs, the demographic impact of the program was estimated. The impact detected was nonsignificant; according to our analysis, overall use of physician-administered contraception was not affected by the subsidized programs. The only program-induced change of activity related to reproduction that we recorded was increased use of subsidized services in study areas with high program input and increased use of private physician services where program input was low. These findings need to be interpreted with the caution usually exercised in evaluating imperfect field experiments.</jats:p>",

An analysis of a new specialty in city planning—advocate planning—suggests that this model be extended so that social movements are seen to enter a profession through the creation of new specialties or segments. By showing that the new practitioners of advocacy planning were highly, though variably, influenced by social movement organizations of the 1960s, this paper suggests the outlines of conflict and difference within the new segment itself Based on interviews with 112 advocate planners in ten cities, the study finds the new practitioners to be young and of similar background to those composing the activist youth movements of their times in college and graduate schools. The differences among them, in regard to their orientation to politics and professionalism, are also examined in the light of new developments in the analysis of reform movements. </jats:p>",

Consequently, it was hypothesized that adjustment to retirement would be more successfully accomplished by enlisted men than by officers regardless of how well they planned or how long they had been retired. A three-factor analysis of variance for unequal groups was conducted to test the statistical significance of rank, number of years retired, and preretirement planning on retirement adjustment. The effects of all factors and all interactions of factors were found to be nonsignificant with the exception of preretirement planning (p &lt;.001). Those who planned well adjusted well, regardless of rank or number of years retired. </jats:p>",

Since the responsibility for land use planning in California lies almost entirely with local government, the State has provided, through various pieces of legislation, the means for insuring that noise is considered in the process. Among the approaches the State has adopted are (1) a requirement that cities and counties adopt a noise element as part of their general plan; (2) the establishment of an Office of Noise Control to provide assistance to local governments and coordinate efforts at the State level; (3) the establishment of airport land use commissions; (4) the use of the EIR/EIS review process; and (5) the adoption of noise insulation standards for multifamily dwellings. The effectiveness of these measures in achieving noise compatible land use is discussed. Examples of good and bad land use in the vicinity of various sources are presented and analyzed. Some alternative approaches are presented and pitfalls pointed out.</jats:p>",

The limited utilization, despite considerable community recruitment efforts, and the few problems encountered with patients served suggest that handicapped individuals can be seen at lower cost and at greater efficiency in regularly scheduled clinics, provided staff are attuned to their special needs. Informal interviews with residential center and clinic staff, with parents, and with clients confirm the need for (a) strengthening in-service training in sex education and contraception to prepare potential clients for more effective use of family planning services; (b) counseling with parents who place a high priority on training for independent community living but are reluctant to face the sexuality of their dependent offspring; and (c) increasing community awareness of the legitimate needs and rights of hard-to-reach handicapped persons in preventing unwanted pregnancies. </jats:p>",
