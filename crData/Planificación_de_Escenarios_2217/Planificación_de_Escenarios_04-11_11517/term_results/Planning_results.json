      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews literature fromthe health field investigating the characteristics of environments that support or hinder physical activity. This literature shows that physical activity is associated with objective and subjective measures of accessibility to recreational facilities and local destinations, as well as with neighborhood safety and visual quality. Walking and biking emerge as prominent forms of physical activity and occur primarily in neighborhood streets and public facilities, suggesting that building walkable and bikable communities can address health as well as transportation concerns. The studies help advance environment-behavior research related to urban and transportation planning. They identify behavioral and environmental determinants of physical activity and employ rigorous data collection methods and theoretical frameworks that are new to the planning field. The article concludes that multidisciplinary research will likely yield promising results in identifying the aspects of environments that can be modified to encourage physical activity and physically active travel. </jats:p>",

Nonprofessionals, however, also played a role in the city’s development at the turn of the twentieth century. Two faith-based women’s organizations established neighborhood facilities for women seeking to protect their reputations. Leaders of the Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) for whites and the Phillis Wheatley Association (PWA) for African Americans negotiated gender and racial obstacles to adapt and construct buildings for young working women, unwed mothers, and spinsters and widows. The location of these properties suggests that the YWCA and PWA created a morally safe region that transcended emerging racial boundaries. This article uses organizational archives and Sanborn Fire Insurance maps to examine how leaders of the YWCA and PWA contributed to neighborhood-level planning for communities of women. </jats:p>",

Much of the existing scholarship on this topic focuses on the spatial mismatch hypothesis, the geographic separation between employment and housing. Although this concept has merit, to meet the transportation needs of welfare recipients, policy makers must move beyond conventional notions of the spatial mismatch hypothesis. This article draws from theoretical and empirical scholarship on travel behavior, transportation infrastructure, poverty, gender studies, and residential segregation and recommends transportation policies to better connect welfare recipients to employment. </jats:p>",

At the time, traffic mitigation efforts boiled down to a fundamental conundrum: was the solution to traffic congestion more roads or more rules? This article chronicles the debates over traffic congestion relief in downtown Boston during that period, analyzing the two radical, competing proposals of roads, in the form of a major new surface thoroughfare called the Loop Highway, versus rules, in the form of stricter parking regulations. The article analyzes the debates over these proposals and the reasons why the city adopted neither approach. While politics had its hand in dooming the proposals, poor planning played a central role as well. The lack of a comparative analytical framework for evaluating the competing “roads” and “rules” proposals gave detractors the ammunition to oppose either approach on the grounds that the alternative approach would be superior. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In most traditions of spatial planning in Europe, planning policy documents involve a symbolic representation of the territory in the form of icons, diagrams, and maps. There are, however, significant national and regional differences in the use of cartographic visualisations in strategic spatial planning in European countries, which can cause problems when several countries come together to discuss policy options for a transnational territory, as for the preparation of the European Spatial Development Perspective. In an attempt to understand better the differences in visualising spatial policy in different planning traditions, this paper reports on findings from an analysis of the form of cartographic visualisations in strategic spatial planning documents in England and Germany. In particular, differences in the written and visual representations of spatial policies, and the ‘scientific’ or ‘artistic’ representation on policy maps are considered. The findings show that, although the function of plans in the planning system ultimately determines the form and style of visualisations, traditional and ‘scientific’ representations seem to dominate planning at regional level in these countries, and experiences with an ‘artistic’ style of visualisation are limited. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relevance of these findings for transnational spatial policy processes, where a communication-oriented use of cartographic visualisations appears most appropriate. </jats:p>",

Some of these EOR technologies are currently producing substantial incremental oil; others have not yet made a commercial impact. As all EOR processes are reservoir- and reservoir fluid-specific, it is necessary to identify the appropriate EOR technology for use in a reservoir, design the project to achieve the required economic incremental recovery, and manage the project to meet or exceed expectations. This paper discusses how to plan, design and manage an EOR project, proceeding from process selection through geologic analysis and modeling, project economics, project design, pilot testing (when and if required), and project implementation and surveillance. In each stage, key risks are identified, and actions to minimize those risks are given.</jats:p>",

A number of research efforts have been made to detect such constraints and to use them for guiding search, in the hope of speeding up the planning process.     We go beyond the previous approaches by considering ordering constraints not only over the (top-level) goals, but also over the sub-goals that will necessarily arise during planning. Landmarks are facts that must be true at some point in every valid solution plan.  We extend Koehler and Hoffmann's definition of reasonable orders between top level goals to the more general case of landmarks. We show how landmarks can be found, how their reasonable orders can be approximated, and how this information can be used to decompose a given planning task into several smaller sub-tasks. Our methodology is completely domain- and planner-independent. The implementation demonstrates that the approach can yield significant runtime performance improvements when used as a control loop around state-of-the-art sub-optimal planning systems, as exemplified by FF and LPG.</jats:p>"

Resulting differences in plan quality and complexity are presented here. Plans calculated using a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0002\" /> leaf width were chosen over the <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0003\" /> leaf width plans in seven out of nine cases based on clinical judgment. Conversely, optimization results revealed a superior objective function result for the <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0004\" /> leaf width plans in seven out of the nine comparisons. The <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0005\" /> leaf width objective function result was superior only for very large target volumes, indicating that expanding the solution space for plan optimization by using narrower leaves may result in a decreased probability of finding the global minimum. In the remaining cases, we can conclude that we are often not utilizing the objective function as proficiently as possible to meet our clinical goals. There was often no apparent clinically significant difference between the two plans, and in such cases the issue becomes one of plan complexity. A comparison of plan complexity revealed that the average <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0006\" /> leaf width plan required roughly 60% fewer segments and over 40% fewer monitor units than required by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0007\" /> leaf width plans. This allows a significant decrease in whole body dose and total treatment time. For very complex IMRT plans, the treatment delivery time may affect the biologically effective dose. A clinically significant improvement in plan quality from using narrower leaves was evident only in cases with very small target volumes or those with concavities that are small with respect to the MLC leaf width. For the remaining cases investigated in this study, there was no clinical advantage to reducing the MLC leaf width from <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2607-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2607:mp2607-math-0008\" />. In such cases, there is no justification for the increased treatment time and whole body dose associated with the narrower MLC leaf width.</jats:p>",

Towards this end, the manual first addresses CSO abatement program planning in order to provide an overall framework within which the application and design of CSO treatment facilities may be considered. Following the establishment of a planning framework, guidance is provided for CSO treatment facility preliminary design, which encompasses such steps as the development of CSO control and treatment objectives, assessment of design flows, development of a treatment process train, site-specific considerations, and costs and operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) factors. Finally, preliminary design considerations are developed in more detail for CSO retention treatment basins (RTBs), which are commonly applied to control and treat CSOs in the Great Lakes municipalities. Well-designed RTBs can meet the Ontario requirements for CSO pollution abatement and thereby contribute to the remedial action in the Great Lakes Areas of Concern.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Ontario's Stormwater Management, Planning and Design Manual released in March 2003 integrates some of the advancements made in stormwater management since the 1994 version of the Manual was published. Perhaps the most significant update is the recognition of in-stream erosion control and water balance objectives in addition to flood and water quality objectives for stormwater management. Specific design criteria which would allow these objectives to be achieved are not set out, but procedures that can assist in the development of criteria based on local watershed and receiving water conditions are described. While refinements will undoubtedly be needed, approaches to designing end-of-pipe facilities to prevent undesirable geomorphic changes are included. Approaches to protect groundwater and baseflow characteristics are also included although guidance on addressing potential trade-offs between groundwater quantity and quality is an additional challenge for the future. Little design guidance is available in Ontario on techniques to mitigate impacts on wetlands, however, developments from other jurisdictions may be transferable. The 2003 Manual promotes an integrated, treatment train approach to stormwater management that emphasizes prevention first, followed by lot-level and conveyance controls and finally, endof- pipe controls. Some information on better site design techniques is incorporated but in comparison to other jurisdictions, less emphasis has been placed on low-impact development strategies. Ontario's approach to design for water quality (suspended solids) control has evolved little. To complement the prevention and treatment train philosophy, the removal efficiency approach to sizing end-of-pipe facilities needs to be used in conjunction with effluent criteria and/or minimum requirements for source protection. Significant advancements in stormwater modelling over the last decade are not well reflected in the Manual; the limited discussion of modelling focusses on an event-based approach. Whether event or continuous modelling is utilized, Ontario practitioners will need guidance on adapting input data to account for the anticipated effects of climate change. Development of sound guidance on monitoring increasingly complex, multi-objective stormwater management systems and the ecosystems they are designed to protect will be critical to ensure that the knowledge gained from performance evaluations may continue to be utilized to refine the design and management of stormwater systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Drawing on a recent ethnographic research project conducted in an urban neighbourhood of Liverpool, England, this paper focuses on Somali speakers, relating the experience of members of this minority language community to the local linguistic and cultural ecology of the city. The community forms part of a Somali diaspora created largely as a consequence of civil war in Somalia towards the end of the twentieth century. The paper opens with an account of the context of the languages and cultures of Liverpool, going on to explore the communicative roles of languages and literacies — Somali, English and Arabic — in the lives of members of the Somali community. Also reported are insights, gained in interviews, into the symbolic values which these languages and literacies hold for them. These data indicate unresolved tensions felt by the interviewees in relation to issues both of cultural identity and of social and educational aspirations — tensions which are closely linked to widespread concern in the community over what is perceived as inter-generational language shift, from Somali to English. This concern has led to the setting up of Somali literacy teaching for young people in the community, and the study included observation of these classes. The paper considers the contribution of such affirmative action to the maintenance and valorisation of Somali, as the language of community heritage, before concluding with discussion of the implications of the Somali community experience in Liverpool — of both marginalisation and resistance — for the management of multilingualism in this modern city.</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>\n                        <jats:bold>Sommaire</jats:bold>\n                    </jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>\n                        <jats:italic>Les langues dans la marge: Le cas du somalien à Liverpool</jats:italic>\n                    </jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>Cet article se concentre sur les locuteurs somaliens. Les informations obtenues se rapportent à l’expérience des membres de cette communauté linguistique minoritaire et s’inspirent des conclusions d’une étude ethnographique menée dans un quartier urbain de Liverpool, en Angleterre. La communauté fait partie de la diaspora somalienne, créée principalement à la suite de la guerre civile en Somalie vers la fin du 20ème siècle. L’article présente le contexte des langues et cultures de Liverpool ainsi que les rôles de communication des langues et des taux d’alphabétisation pour les langues — somalien, anglais, arabe — dans la vie des membres de la communauté somalienne. En s’appuyant sur des entretiens effectués, cet article donne aussi un aperçu des valeurs symboliques que représentent pour eux ces langues et leur taux d’alphabétisation. Ces données révèlent les tensions irrésolues ressenties par les personnes interviewées en ce qui concerne les questions à la fois de culture identitaire et d’aspirations sociales et en matière d’éducation. Ces tensions sont intimement liées à une inquiétude répandue parmi la communauté en ce qui concerne les changements qui semblent intervenir au niveau du somalien et de l’anglais entre les générations. Cette inquiétude a mené à la création d’un enseignement du somalien pour les jeunes de la communauté et cette étude inclus les observations de ces classes. L’article prend en considération la contribution d’une action si affirmative pour le maintien et la valorisation du somalien, en qualité de langue du patrimoine de la communauté, et termine en conclusion par une discussion des implications — à la fois de la marginalisation et de la résistance de la communauté somalienne à Liverpool — en ce qui concerne la gestion du multilinguisme de cette ville moderne.

La komunumo formas parton de somalia diasporo kreita plejparte rezulte de la civila milito en Somalio fine de la dudeka jarcento. La artikolo komenciĝas per prezento de la lingva kaj kultura kunteksto de Liverpool, kaj poste esploras la komunikajn rolojn de lingvoj kaj leg- kaj skribkapabloj — somaliaj, anglaj kaj arabaj — en la vivoj de anoj de la somalia komunumo. Oni ankaŭ raportas pri perceptoj, gajnitaj el intervjuoj, pri ilia sento de la simbolaj valoroj entenataj en tiuj lingvoj kaj kapabloj. Tiuj datenoj indikas, ke la intervjuatoj sentis nesolvitajn streĉitecojn rilate demandojn kaj de kultura identeco kaj de sociaj kaj edukaj aspiroj — streĉitecojn proksime ligitajn al disvastiĝinta maltrankvilo en la komunumo pri tio, kion oni perceptas kiel intergeneracian lingvoŝoviĝon de la somalia al la angla. Tiu maltrankvilo kondukis al starigo de somalia alfabetiga instruado por komunumaj gejunuloj, kaj la studo enhavis ankaŭ observadon de tiuj klasoj.

This paper discusses such informal settlements as 'forgotten places' in the global era. It makes two arguments. First, it argues that this shelter crisis is inherent to globalising cities in developing countries, as a contradiction emerges between the extensive redevelopment and rising property values that accompany 'global city' development and the shelter needs of low-income people. The second is that informal settlements have increasingly been forgotten by urban planners despite this housing crisis, as planners have consciously abandoned place-based poverty alleviation efforts based on the rationale that they are no longer tenable in the global era. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Freshwater ecosystems have suffered severe losses of biodiversity as a result of human activities, however there has been limited attention to freshwater conservation planning. Key criteria for biodiversity conservation in the terrestrial realm (i.e., representation, special elements and focal species) may also be useful in freshwater systems. Thus, we explore freshwater fish conservation in Nova Scotia (NS) with respect to these key criteria. Representation of freshwater fish habitats and communities should include examples of typical and unique biogeographical regions, streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, wetlands, and community assemblages. Special elements include critical habitat for species- and communities-at-risk, and hotspots of diversity and rarity. Sufficient habitat to maintain viable populations of focal species should also be conserved. Focal species 1) are functionally important, such as those at higher trophic levels and key prey, 2) have large-area requirements or are wide ranging, 3) are indicators of habitat quality and/or management practices, and 4) are flagships, such as charismatic and vulnerable species that garner support for aquatic conservation. Considerations of representation, special elements and focal species serve to identify important areas for conserving freshwater fish species, assemblages and habitat in NS. Intolerant and coldwater communities and species such as Atlantic whitefish Coregonus huntsmani, Atlantic salmon Salmo salar, brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis, lake trout Salvelinus namaycush and rainbow smelt Osmerus mordax warrant conservation attention in NS due to their relatively high ecological importance and/or vulnerability. Other factors for selecting among potential sites for conservation are stability and resilience to broader cross- or transboundary threats such as exotic species, global warming, and acidification. Furthermore, as a consequence of the fluidity and connectivity of aquatic ecosystems, conservation planning should encompass a relatively large portion of selected drainages. Our approach may be useful for other temperate regions in North America.En raison des activités humaines, les écosystèmes d’eau douce ont subi de graves pertes sur le plan de la biodiversité; cependant, on a prêté qu’une attention limitée à la planification de la conservation des eaux douces. Les critères principaux en matière de conservation de la biodiversité dans le domaine terrestre (à savoir la représentation, les éléments spéciaux et les espèces focales) peuvent aussi être utiles pour les eaux douces. Ainsi, nous examinons la conservation des poissons d’eau douce en Nouvelle-Écosse en fonction de ces critères. La représentation des habitats et des communautés de poissons d’eau douce doit comprendre des exemples de régions biogéographiques, de cours d’eau, de lacs, d’étangs, de milieux humides et d’assemblages de communautés typiques et uniques. Parmi les éléments spéciaux, on compte l’habitat essentiel pour les espèces et les communautés en péril ainsi que les hauts lieux de diversité et de rareté. De plus, il faut conserver suffisamment d’habitat pour maintenir des populations viables des espèces focales. Ces espèces sont importantes sur le plan fonctionnel (qu’on pense aux espèces des niveaux trophiques supérieurs et aux proies principales), ont besoin de beaucoup d’espace ou parcourent un vaste territoire, sont des indicateurs de la qualité de l’habitat ou des résultats des efforts de gestion et jouent un rôle symbolique, comme les espèces charismatiques et vulnérables qui suscitent l’appui en faveur de la conservation des milieux aquatiques. Les facteurs comme la représentation, les éléments particuliers et les espèces focales permettent de repérer les zones importantes pour la conservation des eaux douces, des espèces de poisson, des assemblages et des habitats. En raison de leur importance écologique relativement élevée ou de leur vulnérabilité, il faut accorder de l’attention sur le plan de la conservation aux communautés et aux espèces intolérantes et d’eaux froides, comme le corégone de l’Atlantique (Coregonus huntsmani), le saumon atlantique (Salmo salar), l’omble de fontaine (Salvelinus fontinalis), le touladi (Salvelinus namaycush) et l’éperlan (Osmerus mordax). D’autres facteurs servent au choix de sites potentiels de conservation, comme la stabilité et la résilience à des menaces transfrontalières, qu’on pense aux espèces exotiques, au réchauffement planétaire et à l’acidification. De plus, la planification devrait couvrir une part relativement grande des bassins hydrographiques choisis. Notre approche peut s’appliquer à d’autres régions tempérées de l’Amérique du Nord.PROC.

Meaningful public debate on this issue requires expert information about the likelihood that the virus will in fact be used as a weapon. Informed voluntary individual decision making, about whether to get vaccinated if vaccine is made available to the public, would similarly require appreciation of the likelihood of attack.

The time of the trend reversal coincides with the development of an excess supply of housing space and decreasing rents, which determine the situation of east German housing markets until today and allow a relatively large freedom of choice in the search for housing. Under these conditions the social contrasts between emptying areas and areas that receive immigrants are increasing. Simultaneously a cultural differentiation between individual urban sub-areas is emerging as a result of the development of characteristic milieus. The article aims to provide a deeper insight into the developments in old residential areas near the inner cities since the middle of the 1990's. Recent trends are considered by taking the social change in the inner-city fringe areas from the period of industrial expansion in Leipzig over a period eight years as a case in point.</jats:p>"

However, the analysis performed during planning for a new structural fabrication facility at the Quonset Point site of Electric Boat Corporation indicates that excessive, non-value-added time is spent in material movement, job setup, and locating resources (crane, service material, inspection equipment, etc.). Although these problems are evident in many shipbuilding operations, they are especially problematic in submarine fabrication, where the structural components are high value added, production volumes are low, movement of in-process products is costly, and inspection requirements are stringent. In planning for the new facility for structural fabrication, Electric Boat is using a product-centric approach. The goal is to define manageable families of products and design a facility to ensure that all of the resources required by these products are readily available during their fabrication. In this paper the authors first present the methodology used to develop process models for the product families at Electric Boat. These process models provide critical input to the design team determining space, equipment, and manpower requirements for the new facility. The authors then discuss the design process for a new facility focused on the production of structural product families for submarines.</jats:p>",

The capacity of devolved administrations with greater autonomous powers to tailor policies to local preferences, to generate innovation in the provision of policies and public services, and to encourage greater participation and be more accountable is supposed to deliver greater economic efficiency. There is, however, little empirical evidence to substantiate these claims. In this paper we assess the horizontal link between devolution and regional economic growth in six national contexts (Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Spain, and the USA). Regression analyses are used in order to test whether changes in cross-regional differences in growth patterns within each country can be attributed to changes in levels of regional autonomy. The results suggest that, contrary to the expectations of devolutionists, the degree of devolution is in most cases irrelevant for economic growth and, when it matters—as in the cases of Mexico and the USA—it is linked to lower rather than greater economic efficiency. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article discusses how succession‐planning can ensure continuity of leadership at water utilities in the upcoming years when an exodus of institutional knowledge and leadership is expected to occur as members of the Baby‐Boom generation retire. Progressive utilities are using succession planning as a best practice to prepare for the transition risk that accompanies a CEO or senior officer departure. A domino effect occurs when any senior officer leaves, and at such times succession planning is used to assess the cadre of top leadership talent. A set of moves based on these assessments yields a stronger team and greater bench strength, as opposed to weakening the net effectiveness of the senior team. The article discusses two best‐practice examples of how utility CEOs and their boards of directors faced succession planning challenges.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article deals with the phenomenon of overregularization in a language already extremely regular, i.e. Esperanto, in children who are learning it as their mother tongue together with one or two other national languages. It consists of an analysis of the diaries kept by Esperanto-speaking parents, tracing the development of five children who were brought up speaking Esperanto as one of their two or three mother-tongues. The children were all of European origin, and their ages ranged from one to five years. The different forms of overregularization have been subdivided into three levels of complexity based on the number and type of morpheme compositions used, and the degree of semantic elaboration. Detailed comments are provided on the forms and meanings of the various examples representing each level, showing the correlation between the age of the children and the growing complexity of the forms. This study can be seen as a first step towards a more systematic analysis of the typologies of overregularization specific to this category of early bilingual children and a better understanding of their language development profile.</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>Sommario</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>\n                        <jats:italic>Regolarizzazione di una lingua regolare: Il fenomeno della iperregolarizzazione in bambini che parlano l’esperanto</jats:italic>\n                    </jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>Questo articolo si occupa del fenomeno della iperregolarizzazione in una lingua già estremamente regolare, cioè l’esperanto, da parte di bambini che la stanno imparando come lingua materna insieme ad una o due altre lingue nazionali.

I bambini sono tutti di estrazione europea e le loro età vanno da uno a cinque anni. Le differenti forme di iperregolarizzazione sono state divise in tre livelli di complessità basati sul numero e sul tipo di combinazioni di morfemi e sul grado di elaborazione semantica. Vengono forniti commenti dettagliati sulle forme e sui significati dei vari esempi rappresentantivi di ogni livello, che mostrano la correlazione tra l’età dei bambini e la crescente complessità delle forme.

Family planning technologies, more than simply a means for preventing conception, are involved as identity artefacts in the construction of bodies and in the reproduction of power relations. As such, modern contraceptives, organized by and implemented through, donor-funded programmes constitute a discursive apparatus through which scattered hegemonies are disseminated. Women's use of family planning, traditional and modern, allows them to counter the expectations of these hegemonies at some times, and to embody them at others. Both service providers and clients, construct identities, referenced through women's bodies, using the discourses of international population control and family planning. This paper uses data collected in Tanzania to understand how notions of modernity in the family planning programme construct Tanzanian female bodies as ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’, how these discursive inequalities reflect and compound material disparities and how these logics come into play in the ways that women construct themselves and each other. </jats:p>",

Very little is known, however, about these attempts in terms of the number of municipalities involved, economic efforts, ways of marketing, target groups, etc. Furthermore, and more importantly, as for place-marketing studies in general, there have been few attempts at evaluation. The author's purpose is to provide an overview and to evaluate the effects of place-marketing efforts made by municipalities in Sweden to attract in-migrants. The empirical material is based largely on survey responses from 220 municipalities, and provides data for a general overview as well as for the evaluative approaches employed in the study. Among other findings, the results suggest that, although this kind of marketing has definitely become more important over the last few years, there is little evidence of any significant effects on interregional migration flows. </jats:p>",

Accordingly, this paper hypothesizes that organizational performance can be ascribed to the simultaneous emphasis on decentralized strategy making and strategic planning processes. This is investigated in a study of 185 manufacturing organizations operating in diverse industries spanning food processing and computer products. The study shows that both decentralized decision structure and planning activities are associated with higher performance in dynamic environments. These findings confirm that effective organizations engage in more complex strategy formation processes that complement the decentralized post‐bureaucratic form with formal mechanisms of rational analyses and operational integration. The paper highlights a need to extend our understanding of the duality between decentralization and planning.</jats:p>",

We argue in this paper, however, that both the nature of appraisal and its role in the political process have been inadequately conceptualised. Exploring a literature that has tended to polarise ‘technical’ and ‘deliberative’ models, we identify a need for sensitive selection and combination of approaches, taking account of both the object and the objective of appraisal in particular contexts. We suggest that an important role for appraisal (by design or by default) may be that of providing spaces for dialogue and learning in the making of policies and decisions. A better understanding of such processes requires further research, particularly well-designed longitudinal work involving retrospective and ‘real time’ studies of appraisal in practice. </jats:p>",

In addition to technical and economic goals, participatory planning also seeks community development outcomes, including community control, ownership and autonomy. This paper presents an evaluation of one such planning project, conducted at Mapoon in 1995. The Plan successfully improved physical infrastructure and housing, but had mixed success in terms of community development. Despite various efforts to follow participatory processes, the Plan was essentially a passing event, community control progressively diminished after its completion, and outcomes fell short of notions of ownership and autonomy. This suggests some misunderstandings between the practice of participatory planning and the workings of governance.</jats:p>",

Each fusion was visually checked and corrected as necessary. The computerized tomography (CT) scans for radiation treatment planning (slice thickness 1.25 mm), as well as stereotactic angiography for arteriovenous malformations, were acquired using head fixation with stereotactic arc or, in the case of stereotactic radiotherapy, with a relocatable stereotactic mask. Different magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences (T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans were obtained without head fixation.

Fully automated image fusion of different MR, CT, and PET studies was performed for each patient. Only in a few cases was it necessary to correct the fusion manually after visual evaluation. These corrections were minor and did not materially affect treatment planning. High-quality fusion of thin slices of a region of interest with a complete head data set could be performed easily. The target volume for radiation treatment planning could be accurately delineated using multimodal information provided by CT, MR, angiography, and PET studies.

Fused multimodality imaging improves the target volume definition for radiation treatment planning. High-quality follow-up image data sets should be acquired for image fusion to provide exactly comparable slices and volumetric results that will contribute to quality contol.</jats:p>",

The business press and various government task forces have discussed challenges raised by e‐commerce for traditional “source‐based” tax systems; however, these discussions have presented little evidence of firms' reliance on e‐commerce for tax‐planning purposes. Similarly, academic research has seldom examined whether firms' decisions to implement e‐commerce are by tax‐planning considerations.</jats:p><jats:p>It is thus largely unknown whether firms actively consider taxation issues when evaluating e‐commerce, how the factors that have been identified as influencing decisions to implement e‐commerce systems are balanced against tax‐planning considerations, and what barriers might exist in practice to using e‐commerce for tax planning. We choose a qualitative interview‐based approach to explore these issues.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings suggest that tax planning is not considered by most of our respondent companies in their decisions to deploy e‐commerce. The companies we interviewed tended to implement e‐commerce over several years, starting with back‐office technologies like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Accordingly, the ability to perform online sales transactions, which is a key component of using e‐commerce for tax planning, often was not yet in place. One implication of these results is that if concerns over tax revenue losses are realistic, tax policymakers may have some time to refine tax legislation to address the challenges raised by e‐commerce.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The forestry company, Stora Port Hawkesbury Limited, owns 280 properties throughout Cape Breton Island and eastern mainland Nova Scotia with a total cumulative area of 24 590 ha. This study utilized a coarse filter analysis to determine which of these land holdings support representative and outstanding natural features compatible with the creation of a system of privately-owned nature reserves. Aerial photographs were used to document each property. Approximately 35% of the private land holdings were caught by the coarse filter to be considered candidate protected sites. Significant features identified include old-growth forests, wetlands, ravines, headwaters, lakeshores, coastlines, lagoons, talus slopes, forested floodplains, ephemeral rivers, oxbow lakes, riparian zones, and mountain barrens. Other studies have subdivided Nova Scotia into a series of 80 distinct natural landscape units, most of which have few or no protected areas. A Stora-owned system of nature reserves could help fill significant representation gaps within the province-wide system of protected areas, since nearly three-quarters of landscape units containing Stora properties are inadequately represented with existing protected sites. Other Stora-owned properties are located along significant waterways or positioned adjacent to larger existing protected areas. Later stages of this project will field-verify interpretations of the coarse filter analysis and further refine the list of candidate protected sites presented here.En Nouvelle-Écosse, la société forestière Stora Port Hawkesbury Limited possède 280 propriétés dans l’île du Cap-Breton et dans l’est de la partie continentale; la superficie totale des propriétés est de 24 590 ha. La présente étude utilise le principe du filtre brut pour établir quelles propriétés renferment des caractéristiques naturelles représentatives et exceptionnelles pour la création d’un réseau de réserves naturelles privées. On a utilisé des photographies aériennes pour documenter chaque propriété. Environ 35% des propriétés privées analysées ont été retenues pour analyse plus poussée. Parmi les éléments importants repérés, on compte des vieilles forêts, des milieux humides, des ravins, des eaux d’amont, des rivages de lacs, des côtes, des lagunes, des pentes d’éboulis, des plaines inondables boisées, des rivières éphémères, des méandres morts, des zones riveraines et des landes de montagnes. Dans d’autres études, on a subdivisé la Nouvelle-Écosse en 80 unités de paysage naturel, dont la plupart renferment peu de zones protégées ou aucune. Comme près des trois quarts des unités de paysage qui comprennent des propriétés de la Stora ne sont pas bien représentées dans les sites protégés actuels, un réseau de réserves naturelles appartenant à la société Stora pourrait contribuer à combler des lacunes importantes dans la représentation des types de milieux dans le réseau provincial de zones protégées. D’autres propriétés de cette société sont situées le long d’importantes voies navigables ou sont adjacentes à de grandes zones protégées. Dans les étapes ultérieures du présent projet, on validera sur le terrain les résultats de l’analyse par filtre brut et améliorera la liste des sites candidats présentés dans le présent document.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Britain's passenger rail services were privatised in 1996/97 to reduce public subsidies and produce customer benefits through the private sector competing for medium or long-term franchises. Private sector franchisees were committed to investment in rolling stock, services, and infrastructure and were expected to deliver more market-oriented and cost-effective services whilst subsidies decreased on an annual sliding scale. The author analyses why some franchisees have been unable to achieve the annual financial improvement required to match tapering subsidies. The greatest challenges are identified in Regional franchises outside southeast England, where contracts were let towards the end of rail privatisation when competition was fiercest. Some contracts have been terminated or renegotiated. Reasons are investigated for record levels of passenger traffic across the rail network, privatisation's major, and unexpected, achievement. Traffic growth slowed, and was confined to the London and South East sector, after the Hatfield accident in October 2000. Reasons are identified for delays in refranchising and the sudden policy change from long-term investment-led franchises to short or medium-term contracts. The comparative financial and customer benefits of refranchising are analysed. Finally, the achievability of the government's Ten Year Transport Plan target of 50% growth in passenger traffic is questioned. </jats:p>",

The aim is to integrate the anatomical and functional information completely into the radiation treatment planning and to achieve an exact comparison for follow-up examinations. Special conditions and advantages of BrainLAB's fully automatic image fusion system are evaluated and described for this purpose.</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic> In 458 patients, the radiation treatment planning and some follow-up studies were performed using an automatic image fusion technique involving the use of different imaging modalities. Each fusion was visually checked and corrected as necessary. The computerized tomography (CT) scans for radiation treatment planning (slice thickness 1.25 mm), as well as stereotactic angiography for arteriovenous malformations, were acquired using head fixation with stereotactic arc or, in the case of stereotactic radiotherapy, with a relocatable stereotactic mask. Different magnetic resonance (MR) imaging sequences (T<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, T<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>, and fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery images) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans were obtained without head fixation. Fusion results and the effects on radiation treatment planning and follow-up studies were analyzed.</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">The precision level of the results of the automatic fusion depended primarily on the image quality, especially the slice thickness and the field homogeneity when using MR images, as well as on patient movement during data acquisition. Fully automated image fusion of different MR, CT, and PET studies was performed for each patient. Only in a few cases was it necessary to correct the fusion manually after visual evaluation. These corrections were minor and did not materially affect treatment planning. High-quality fusion of thin slices of a region of interest with a complete head data set could be performed easily. The target volume for radiation treatment planning could be accurately delineated using multimodal information provided by CT, MR, angiography, and PET studies. The fusion of follow-up image data sets yielded results that could be successfully compared and quantitatively evaluated.</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> Depending on the quality of the originally acquired image, automated image fusion can be a very valuable tool, allowing for fast (∼ 1–2 minute) and precise fusion of all relevant data sets. Fused multimodality imaging improves the target volume definition for radiation treatment planning. High-quality follow-up image data sets should be acquired for image fusion to provide exactly comparable slices and volumetric results that will contribute to quality contol.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper combines recent advances which appreciate the ontological intricacies of scale; with the (re)turn of institutional perspectives on social and economic life and its governance. The authors use these perspectives to understand better questions of contingency, difference, and indeed convergence when comparing the historical process of scale construction and political governance (both institution building and image/narrative building) in two European cities. The paper thus reveals contrasting scalar strategies of interurban competition in two city case studies. The authors first outline the main theoretical and conceptual developments in the now burgeoning literature on scale, adding that in their opinion the perpetual construction and reconstruction of scale is not only an example of socially instituted process, but also one of constructed variety. The authors go on to propose a musical metaphor—a keyboard of scale—to capture the properties of simultaneity, elasticity, and multiplicity in scale construction, and use this metaphor to frame the discussion of the two cases. The authors conclude that when comparing cities—indeed all superficially commensurable territorial units—we must be sensitive to the specificity of scale construction in each and every instance. For example, the cases reported here demonstrate that a range of meanings shelter under the umbrella of the ‘urban’. Moreover, these meanings are reconstituted and reconfigured through history. </jats:p>",

The main factors influencing the location of residential construction are analysed by means of a statistical analysis. The most significant variables appear to be the proximity of a location to existing residential areas, location in new towns receiving government support, the accessibility of workplaces, distance to railway stations, and, to a lesser extent, the accessibility of nature, surface water, and recreational areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In May of 1999, a workshop was held to lay the groundwork for a conservation plan to maintain and restore terrestrial and marine biodiversity. The products of the workshop include vision maps and recommendations for biodiversity conservation in Nova Scotia. The wild lands conservation vision identifies existing protected areas, areas suitable for filling gaps in the representation of natural landscape types, and other areas of significant ecological value. Four types of conservation areas are proposed: 1) core areas, to be managed primarily for ecological processes; 2) connectivity zones between core areas; 3) aquatic/marine zones around islands, headlands, bays, lakes and rivers; and, 4) compatible use zones, which provide a buffer function while allowing for human uses. The wild seas conservation vision includes five conservation categories: 1) marine management units; 2) marine protected areas (MPA’s) selected with particular attention to the benthic zones (ocean floor); 3) core “no take” zones in areas of unique or sensitive features, species or assemblages; 4) a special management zone for larval retention; and, 5) a “no-dragger” zone to protect fragile deep sea corals.En mai 1999, on a tenu un atelier visant à préparer le terrain pour un plan de conservation ayant pour but de maintenir et de restaurer la biodiversité terrestre et marine. Les produits de l’atelier comprennent notamment des cartes et des recommandations en ce qui concerne la conservation de la biodiversité en Nouvelle-Écosse. Le projet de conservation des terres sauvages comprend les zones actuellement protégées, les zones qui permettraient de combler les lacunes dans la représentation des types de paysages naturels et d’autres régions importantes sur le plan écologique. On propose d’établir quatre types de zones de conservation : 1) des zones principales, à gérer surtout en fonction des processus écologiques; 2) des zones de connectivité entre les zones principales; 3) des zones aquatiques ou marines autour des îles et des caps, baies, lacs et rivières; 4) des zones d’utilisations compatibles servant de zones tampons et utilisables par les humains. En ce qui concerne la conservation des mers sauvages, on propose cinq catégories de conservation : 1) des unités de gestion marines; 2) des zones de protection marine (ZPM) choisies particulièrement en fonction des zones benthiques (plancher océanique); 3) des zones principales sans prélèvement dans des régions à caractéristiques, espèces ou assemblages d’espèces uniques ou sensibles; 4) une zone de gestion spéciale pour la rétention larvaire; 5) une zone sans dragage pour protéger les coraux fragiles des grands fonds marins.</jats:p>"

Our main assumption is that for each location there is a combination of factors which is the most efficient, given the endowment of the location in terms of technology access and the relative cost of factors. We estimate our model using a panel of more than 1000 industrial firms over a six-year period. The contribution of skilled labour is emphasised in the firms located in urban areas, unskilled labour in rural firms, and capital in periurban units. The functional distribution of jobs also plays a discriminating role: direct production and similar functions seem to be more concentrated in periurban and rural areas, whereas tertiary functions are clearly assigned to urban units. We then make conclusions as to the existence of different technical paths of growth, with high productivity growth and a dramatic decline of demand for unskilled labour in urban areas, and the maintenance of a labour-intensive method of production in rural areas. </jats:p>",

Recent findings in the visual attention literature, however, argue widely for early object-based selection processes. The present experiments were designed to examine the contributions of object-based and space-based selection processes to the preparation time of goal-directed pointing movements. Therefore, a cue was presented at a specific location. The question addressed was whether the initiation of responses to uncued target stimuli could benefit from being either within the same object (object based) or presented at the same direction (space based). Experiment 1 replicated earlier findings of object-based benefits for non-goal-directed responses. Experiment 2 confirmed earlier findings of space-based benefits for goal-directed hand pointing movements. In Experiments 3 and 4, space-based and object-based manipulations were combined while requiring goal-directed hand pointing movements. The results clearly favour the notion that the selection processes for goal-directed pointing movements are primarily object based. Implications for theories on selective attention and action planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

The most important findings are that (a) motherhood is postponed to increase child‐free time, (b) cohabitation is increasingly becoming an alternative to marriage, (c) marriage (but not partnership) is increasingly optional for childbearing, and (d) employment is prioritized over family formation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The applied geological mapping study of the Wigan Metropolitan Borough was completed in October 1995 by the British Geological Survey (BGS) in association with the planning consultants Roger Tym &amp; Partners. The aim of the project was to provide a geoscience basis for planning and development decisions. The users of the study were seen primarily as planners and developers but also engineers, conservationists and others. The important common factor was that the users need not have geological training. The study represented the state-of-the-art in the UK in terms of the transfer of geological information to nongeologists. Geoscience data were compiled as a series of nine thematic maps and a technical report in which the geology of the area, and its modification by human activities, were described. The engineering geology map is significant in that it uses the stripe method of showing subsurface information, a method rarely used in the UK since its first use by Dearman in the North East of England. The key geological factors relevant to planning and development were identified by the project team during discussions with local planners and developers. They were summarized on a map and described in a report that indicated how and where geology might significantly affect development. The successful outcome of this study required a multidisciplinary team approach and good communication between team members.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> The School Health Portfolio System (SHPS), developed originally to evaluate the Florida Coordinated School Health Program Pilot Schools Project, offers a new and innovative system for planning and evaluating a coordinated school health program at the individual school level. The SHPS provides practitioners a detailed but easy‐to‐use system that enables schools to create new programs or modify existing programs across all eight components of the CSHP model, as well as administrative support critical to sustainability. The System comes packaged as a self‐contained, notebook‐style manual divided into 15 sections. It includes electronic templates of key documents to guide school teams in creating a customized portfolio, and a list of sample goals and artifacts that confirm achievement of a goal related to the school's coordinated school health program. An evaluation rubric provides a structured method to assess a program portfolio's contents, and the extent to which the contents document achievement of program goals. The rubric produces both a qualitative assessment, such as a narrative summary of program strengths and areas for improvement, and a quantitative assessment, such as a numerical score (0–100), letter grade (A‐F), or 5‐star system (* ‐ *****). The physical structure, function, and scoring of the rubric depend on the method of assessment. The SHPS enables schools to set goals based on individual school needs, and incorporate CSHP goals into school improvement plans ‐ a critical factor in sustainability and accountability. The System also offers teams the option of coordinating their efforts with CDC's School Health Index as a companion assessment measure. This article outlines the process a team would follow in developing a portfolio, and includes a sample assessment for the area of School Health Education.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis (L., 1758), is threatened throughout its distribution, prompting management of habitats and populations for conservation. Quantitative data on habitat requirements for this species are needed to better evaluate which areas are the most suitable, or what actions can improve habitat suitability. We studied relationships between the distribution and abundance of E. orbicularis and the environment by analysing water quality and features of 39 wetland and upland habitats in the Po River delta of northern Italy; visual transects and point counts were used to determine turtle presence and relative abundance. Emys orbicularis occurs more frequently and abundantly in permanent wetlands surrounded by woodlands, and its presence does not appear to be related to water eutrophication. Woodlands strongly influence adjacent wetland features and may be important for turtles' terrestrial activities such as nesting and dispersal. Habitat management and conservation plans for E. orbicularis should include protection of extensive terrestrial woodland habitat containing diverse wetland systems, to support turtle survival at different life-history stages. The requirements for wetlands and natural terrestrial habitat are difficult to meet in the currently human-dominated European lowlands; nevertheless, conservation plans for this species should take a broad-scale approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Stereotactic arc treatment of small intracranial tumors is usually performed with arcs collimated by circular cones, resulting in treatment volumes which are basically spherical. For nonspherical lesions this results in a suboptimal dose distribution. Multiple isocenters may improve the dose conformity for these lesions, at the cost of large overdosages in the target volume. To achieve improved dose conformity as well as dose homogeneity, the linac jaws (with a minimum distance of 1.0 cm to the central beam axis) can routinely be used to block part of the circular beams. The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of blocking cones with diameters as small as 1.0 cm and a minimum distance between the jaw and the central beam axis of 0.3 cm. First, the reproducibility in jaw positioning and resulting dose delivery on the treatment unit were assessed. Second, the accuracy of the TPS dose calculation for these small fields was established. Finally, clinically applied treatment plans using nonblocked cones were compared with plans using the partially blocked cones for several treatment sites. The reproducibility in dose delivery on our Varian Clinac 2300 C/D machines on the central beam axis is 0.8% (1 SD). The accuracy of the treatment planning system dose calculation algorithm is critically dependent on the used fits for the penumbra and the phantom scatter. The average deviation of calculated from measured dose on the central beam axis is <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp4193-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp4193:mp4193-math-0001\" /> (1 SD), which is clinically acceptable. Partial cone blocking results in improved dose distributions for elongated tumors, such as vestibular schwannoma and uveal melanoma. Multiple isocenters may be avoided. The technique is easy to implement and requires no additional workload.</jats:p>",
