Unfortunately, the RPN components have ambiguous definitions, and multiplying ranked values is not a valid operation. As a result, the RPN produces inconsistent risk priorities. In addition, FMEA uses distinct analyses for each system level and life cycle phase, making it difficult to consolidate interrelated risk information. The goal of scenario-based FMEA is to delineate and evaluate risk events more accurately. Probability and cost provide a consistent basis for risk analysis and decision making, and failure scenarios provide continuity across system levels and life cycle phases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper seeks to link the seemingly diverse genres of the Indian captivity narrative and the alien abduction scenario. Whilst the Indian captivity narrative is plainly derived from first-hand accounts and can demonstrate a historical development based on the actuality of the experiences it describes, the alien abduction scenario though protesting its objective basis cannot. Rather than rejecting the validity of the alien abduction scenario on this account, the following attempts to account for the claims to reality of the alien abduction narrative by arguing that it exists in a historical continuum with the Indian captivity narrative. The narrative functions as part of a greater historical myth system in which national values of community safety and security, national progress and vitality and the preservation of core values against hostile enemies are central components. I argue that in the twentieth century the alien abduction narrative re-imagines these core concerns and in the context of exploration of the new frontier of space, provides for a re-energizing of the traditional captivity narrative, one in which abductees are positioned as colonists in perilous existence on the ‘final frontier’.</jats:p>",

Problem‐based learning is a method of teaching that uses a patient situation or scenario to stimulate students to acquire and apply information to solve problems. Concept mapping can promote problem‐solving and critical thinking to help students organize complex patient data, process complex relationships and offer holistic care to patients.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods. </jats:bold> An experimental design was used, with participants randomly assigned either to a control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in six problem‐based learning scenario discussions during the 16‐week semester, while the control group attended a traditional course.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold> The experimental group had significantly higher proposition and hierarchy scores for their concept maps compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the cross‐link and example scores between the two groups. In general, the total score difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance levels. Only one student in the experimental group obtained a high score; most participants in both groups (over 50%) obtained low scores.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions. </jats:bold> Concept mapping strategies may be useful for analysis of individual student's thinking processes for (1) emphasizing key concepts or main ideas, (2) understanding relationships between different concepts, including cause–effect and part–whole relationships, (3) reviewing propositions, hierarchies and cross‐links in a logically scientific way, and (4) revising concept structures to agree with theory and experience.</jats:p>",

The fire behaviour of these panels is a combination of material characteristics such as the core material and mechanical behaviour of the panels such as joints, dilations etc. The use of small or intermediate scale tests can be questioned for such types of products.</jats:p><jats:p>Within the proposed European product standard for sandwich panels (prEN 14509) the intermediate scale test method SBI (EN 13823) has been suggested as the fire test method to certify panels. The standard does, however, use quite an artificial mounting procedure, which does not fully reflect the end‐use conditions of the panels.</jats:p><jats:p>In a previous research project conducted by Nordtest it was shown that the correlation between the SBI test method and both the ISO 9705 and ISO 13784 part 1 was insufficient. The test data produced for the SBI test method, however, did not use the above mentioned mounting technique.</jats:p><jats:p>In this article new data for a number of products are added to the database using the mounting procedure of the product standard. The data are compared with the previous data and show that the mounting method of the product standard results in slightly more severe conditions but that there are still discrepancies with the full‐scale test results. The data also show an unacceptable level of repeatability due to the fact that small dilations result in a wide variation of classification result. The new data together with the old data show once more that it is dangerous to make a fire safety assessment of a sandwich panel based on small or intermediate scale tests.
