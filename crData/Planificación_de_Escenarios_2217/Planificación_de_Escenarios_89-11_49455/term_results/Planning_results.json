      "abstract": "<jats:p> Simple heuristic formulas are developed to estimate the simulation run lengths required to achieve desired statistical precision in queueing simulations. The formulas are intended to help in the early planning stages before any data have been collected. The queueing simulations considered are single replications (one long run) conducted to estimate steady-state characteristics such as expected equilibrium queue lengths. The formulas can be applied to design simulation experiments to develop and evaluate queueing approximations. In fact, this work was motivated by efforts to develop approximations for packet communication networks with multiple classes of traffic having different service characteristics and bursty arrival processes. In addition to indicating the approximate simulation run length required in each case of a designed experiment, the formulas can help determine what cases to consider, what statistical precision to aim for, and even whether to conduct the experiment at all. The formulas are based on heavy-traffic limits for queues (the limiting behavior as the traffic intensity approaches its upper limit for stability) and associated diffusion approximations. In particular, the formulas apply to stochastic processes that can be approximated by reflected Brownian motion, such as the queue-length process in the standard GI/G/1 model. </jats:p>",

In this way it is shown that the benefits of strategic planning are not realized unless the process is totally integrated with current operations. This study shows that only rarely is strategic planning a live process within companies. However, to make an improvement is extremely difficult because frequently the commitment and energy does not exist in companies. As a result, many companies are failing to benefit from their strategic planning efforts and are thus failing to establish appropriate long‐term corporate positionings.</jats:p>",

The importance of making such distinctions should be clear; risk‐averse decision makers will want to bear risk only if they can be reasonably confident of commensurate increases in expected return. When parameters are unknown, statistically testing for differences in their estimated values is appropriate. An illustration of such tests using data from Hazell suggests considerable resources must be devoted toward data generation if normative statements under uncertainty are to be reliable.</jats:p>",

Although these exercises demonstrate the flexibility of the theory, few attempts have been made to relax more than one assumption at a time.

The mesoscale relates to land uses around single urban centres and to urban pressures on agricultural production at the urban fringe. The macroscale is an attempt to uncover land-use rings at continental and global scales. A major future challenge for the theory is the possible incorporation of Marxist notions. </jats:p>",

This comment is an attempt to show that the art of wording in that debate has been, above all, misleading. In the process of the controversy the original questions have been displaced by others, and discussion has been choked by ready answers quoted from classic authority. This comment is an attempt to penetrate behind the rhetorical veil and to reveal the important questions that deserve to be discussed in a sincere way. In order to make clear the main issue—the use and the relevance of the theory of land rent—the recent project of Ball is crystallized into a thesis: the received theory of rent should be rejected. Ball's attempts to justify this thesis are weighed, and it is concluded that Ball has not managed to justify the thesis. This means that the alleged alternative theory based on the criticism against the theory of land rent is rather a belief and an illusion than a properly justified stand. Therefore, apart from providing a short outline for an alternative approach, the main outcome of the comment is an invitation to further discussion. </jats:p>",

The determination of this multiplicative or exponential distribution can be accomplished by inverting a certain bijection—developed by Rothaus and by Bregman—of convex polytopes into themselves. An iterative algorithm is available for this procedure. The doubly stochastic matrix with a given set of transversals (generalized diagonal products) can be found by means of this method. Applications are discussed of the Rothaus -Bregman map to a proof of Birkhoff's theorem and to the calculation of trajectories of points leading to stationary or equilibrium values of the generalized permanent, in particular in spatial interaction modeling. </jats:p>",

Also, the effects of a supply push on the total outputs and on the final outputs are expressed, again for both models. In general, the assumption of fixed input coefficients in the demand-driven model does not hold, but computations are still based on it.

The model, first developed by Witten and Sander and referred to as the diffusion-limited aggregation or DLA model, generates highly ramified tree-like clusters of particles, or populations, with evident self-similarity about a fixed point. The extent to which such clusters fill space is measured by their fractal dimension which is estimated from scaling relationships linking population and density to distances within the cluster. We suggest that this model provides a suitable baseline for the development of models of urban structure and density which manifest similar scaling properties. A typical DLA simulation is presented and a variety of measures of its structure and dynamics are developed. These same measures are then applied to the urban growth and form of Taunton, a small market town in South West England, and important similarities and differences with the DLA simulation are discussed. We suggest there is much potential in extending analogies between DLA and urban form, and we also suggest future research directions involving variants of DLA and better measures of urban density. </jats:p>",

This switch corresponds to a ‘fold catastrophe’. In this paper, a catastrophe model of the onset and spread of modern economic growth is articulated and then tested by means of historical data. The results obtained support the notion that modern economic growth originated in England sometime during the eighteenth century and then spread throughout the rest of Europe by a process that had run its course by circa 1840. </jats:p>",

Our reanalysis, which is based on Aitkin's simultaneous test procedure, residual analysis, and logit models, gives greater precision to previously suggested relationships and reveals new findings.

With specific reference to the two districts of Aceh Utara and Aceh Tengah, the picture of dependency relationships is sketched for rural peripheries in the Third World. Development planning efforts have not successfully addressed persistent problems, either because they were based upon urban‐biased policy prescriptions wrongly transferred from the northern hemisphere, or because rational‐comprehensive planning procedures were too arbitrarily blueprinted. Focusing upon the latter misapplication, the paper presents a practical working procedure for managing, through five stages, a multi‐annual and rationalizing exercise, such as Dutch assistance to improving regional planning methods employed by low‐level administrative units in peripheral rural regions. There follows a critical review of nine years of Dutch regional planning assistance by comparing theory and practice of three approaches applied to the two districts of Aceh Utara/Tengah. The Dutch lessons learned underline inter‐sectoral programme preparation, institutionalization and training components. A 6‐7 years working procedure for future foreign‐assisted district planning projects is proposed.</jats:p>",

What must be questioned and recognized are the values of decision makers and the unwritten agendas of those involved in the planning process. Taking the example of some of the integrated rural development programmes (IRDPs) in Papua New Guinea, this paper looks at the way planners and others cast development and information ‘nets’. These nets abrogate indigenous development processes. The ‘nets’ make it easy for development professionals and others involved in planning to follow unwritten agendas and difficult for target groups to articulate their ‘needs’ and to understand what is going on. It is suggested that these problems are not unique to PNG and may well be relevant to ‘needs based planning’ in other situations.</jats:p>",
