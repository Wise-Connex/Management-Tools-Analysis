Such an exceptional event and the resulting behavior of the process are called a scenario in this article. Problem formulations for their rigorous incorporation into the optimization of dynamic systems are presented. They allow the determination of operational strategies that are economically optimal and that keep the plant within a chosen regime in the state space, even for a number of possible scenarios. The formulations are based on a unifying model framework containing both continuous and discrete dynamics. For a restricted class of problems a method for the numerical solution of the resulting scenario‐integrated dynamic optimization problems is introduced. The applicability of this technique is demonstrated with two examples of different complexity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a method for test scenario generation based on formal specifications and usage profiles. It is a major component of a framework for testing object-oriented programs. In this framework, the requirements of a software system are formally specified. The anticipated application of the system is expressed in a usage profile, which is a state model that indicates the dynamic behavior of the system and execution probabilities for the behaviors. The state model is used as a guide to derive the anticipated operation scenarios. An enhanced state transition diagram is used to represent the state model, which incorporates hierarchy, usage and parameter information. Since the number of feasible scenarios can be extremely large, probability and importance criteria are used to select the most probable and important scenarios. </jats:p>",
