      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the maturation of GIS technology, several planning scholars have turned their attention to the nature of the relationship between GIS technology and its “fit” into the planning process. Drawing various insights from the diverse fields of information systems, management information systems, and organizational theory, these scholars have started to assemble a theoretical framework from which to understand and manage the integration of GIS into the workplace. In this paper I will draw on these initial efforts to evaluate the relationship between “technology” and “process” in a Third World context. Using Nedović-Budić's conceptualization of the process of “mutual adaptation” as a conceptual starting point, I will provide an in-depth analysis of GIS implementation in the southwest Pacific nation of Papua New Guinea (PNG). PNG's experiences offer a unique insight into the dynamics of mutual adaptation and also point out the limitations of this concept. I conclude by extrapolating beyond the “particular localisms” of PNG to find that the broader political economy of the planning environment dictates the success of GIS integration. Moreover it also suggests that managing the phases of mutual adaptation in an effort to promote GIS implementation is only likely to succeed in circumstances where the broader political economy of planning is in itself conducive to the long-term integration needs of GIS. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous studies have shown that significant environmental changes are the result of human activities such as urbanization occurring at the spatial scale of landscapes. The challenge faced by many planners today is how to understand such relationships in order to support integrated watershed planning and management. Although many mathematical models have been developed to simulate the chemical transport process in a river, few are actually used in watershed assessment and management. Recently, incorporating analytical models into GIS platforms has emerged as a promising research area attracting planners and other resource managers. In this paper we present a GIS-based river water quality model (GIS-ROUT) to predict chemistry changes in river water as a result of sewage discharge changes in a watershed. Integration of spatial data, GIS, and analytical models in GIS-ROUT makes it possible to examine the dynamic linkages between water quality and human activities in a watershed. Furthermore, the user-friendly interface of the model allows its users to concentrate on the planning issues, such as examining the “What if…” questions related to different development scenarios. The study not only contributes to the application of GIS and water quality models in planning, but it also provides a comprehensive view of the watershed that can help government agencies and other stakeholders to make informed decisions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning, as a form of state intervention administered at the local level, is inevitably subject to the pressures and vagaries of governmental and societal change. The recent past has been a particularly turbulent period for local governance and this has inevitably impacted on the role of planning practitioners and the expectations placed upon them. As a consequence, fundamental value questions have arisen concerning the role and purpose of planning and, in addition, the hegemonic status of a unifying ethic of professional responsibility has been called into question. Our aim in this paper is to explore the different obligations which at various times influence the individual planner's behaviour or actions, with the further purpose of exploring the changing nature of planning and the consequent implications for contemporary conceptions of the public interest. The main body of the paper consists of an analysis of the competing tensions of contemporary practice as viewed from the perspective of the obligations owed to individual values, professionalism, employing organisations, politicians, and the public. In the course of this exploration we examine the ways in which these tensions have been influenced and heightened by the reconfiguration of the relationships between the state, society, and the individual which occurred during the 1980s and 1990s as part of the neoliberal agenda of successive Conservative governments in Britain. We conclude by considering the extent to which the notion of the public interest still has value as a legitimising frame of reference for public planning. </jats:p>",

In this paper I report on the residential and market-clearing components of the recently developed UrbanSim land-use model, which is currently being implemented in Hawaii, Oregon, and Utah. The model is based on parcel-level land-use data and simulates the interaction between demand and supply of real estate by using a dynamic behavioral approach that operates on an annual time schedule. The model system is now operational, and in this paper the design and calibration results for the Eugene-Springfield, Oregon metropolitan area are described. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the issues which are involved in shoreline management planning and the role of the planning system in achieving sustainable coastal defence. Using case studies from the Holderness coastline, it (a) reviews the options with respect to erosion control on a rapidly eroding coast, and (b) acknowledges the need to introduce change gradually if it is to be accepted. Specifically, it assesses the potential to use planning permission controls to prevent new development in areas where maintaining a hard defence line will interrupt longshore transport, with potentially significant down‐drift effects.</jats:p>",

Following a general introduction in which the basic approach is described, we develop a number of key principles, which build on our earlier work on velocity fields. Three theoretical case studies are described in which the authors show the expected patterns of quickest paths, isochrones, and catchment areas arising from alternative simple basic routing assumptions. We then elaborate the concepts of the hub, rim, and core of a city, showing how these features can be constructed and how they affect the pattern of travel. The results provide a number of insights that are then applied in a fourth case study to examine the effects of the M25 orbital on travel in London. Some policy implications are then explored before concluding with a discussion of potential applications and research. </jats:p>",

These discriminatory grants enabled Metro Toronto to provide a fine web of high-quality, rapid arterials and highways across its jurisdiction—accelerating suburbanization. The financing privileges granted to the outer Metro Toronto suburbs facilitated the development of an inefficient built form, realized with premature urban encroachment into undeveloped lands and building types characterized largely by land-extensive, single-family detached housing units. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Designing product lines with substitutable components and subassemblies permits companies to offer a broader variety of products while continuing to exploit economies of scale in production and inventory costs. Past research on models incorporating component substitutions focuses on the benefits from reduced safety-stock requirements. This paper addresses a dynamic requirements-planning problem for two-stage multi product manufacturing systems with bill-of-materials flexibility, i.e., with options to use substitute components or subassemblies produced by an upstream stage to meet demand in each period at the downstream stage. We model the problem as an integer program, and describe a dynamic-programming solution method to find the production and substitution quantities that satisfy given multi period downstream demands at minimum total setup, production, conversion, and holding cost. This methodology can serve as a module in requirements-planning systems to plan opportunistic component substitutions based on relative future demands and production costs. Computational results using real data from an aluminum-tube manufacturer show that substitution can save, on average, 8.7% of manufacturing cost. We also apply the model to random problems with a simple product structure to develop insights regarding substitution behavior and impacts. </jats:p>",

The model is based on the idea that, if the shapes of lots are similar, then the positions of associated houses may also be similar. To this effect, “similarity indices” of lots are devised and transformed into probabilities. The overlay of sample house positions weighted by the probabilities predicts the probability density for each point in the lot covered by a house. The model is tested empirically with data from Hiratsuka city in the Kanagawa prefecture in Japan. The results of its sensitivity analysis by gradually changing the lot shape reproduces the actual tendencies of allocation of houses and yards for lots of limited area. </jats:p>",

Estimation of the rank — size distribution functions for all the postwar census years shows that concentration trends were prevalent until the early 1980s. During the last decade, however, stabilisation or even deconcentration trends have appeared with the faster development of smaller cities. This finding should not be taken as an indication of a trend reversal towards more balanced spatial development, as further analysis shows that the faster growing smaller cities are largely satellite cities of the metropolitan centres of Athens and Thessaloniki. Based on the results of regression analysis, we conclude with a discussion on the factors contributing to differential urban growth performance and the policy implications of these findings for metropolitan regions and balanced growth in Greece. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban planning has played an increasing role in response to threats to health and safety, but this can create problematical conflicts with other planning priorities. The author examines how the UK planning system deals in practice with the safety implications of hazardous installations involving the storage and use of toxic, explosive, and flammable substances. The responses that have been made by local planning authorities to hazard – development conflicts in the vicinity of hazardous installations are evaluated. A distinction is made between those responses focused on development restraint through refusing permission for housing, community facilities, and other sensitive land uses, and those focused on the hazard source. It is argued that these last are becoming increasingly significant despite limitations in the statutory powers available. Through focusing on recent developments and drawing on a wide range of experience, the author adds to the existing research literature on planning and hazardous installations in which the evolution of policy and practice in this area has hitherto been rather sporadically examined. The implications of a recent policy focus on brownfield redevelopment, of new European regulations for hazardous sites, and of wider trends in relationships between industry, regulators, and communities at risk are considered. </jats:p>",

The author is Webmaster of the International Association of School Librarianship (IASL); using her own Web site as an example, she discusses a number of issues and tasks associated with creating and maintaining a professional Web site, within the context of a strategic planning approach to Web site development. Beginning with “Should we have a Web site?”, the stages of the process are outlined, including identification of aims and objectives, analysis of user needs, selection of content and services to be included, writing or developing the content, developing the information architecture, navigational aids, visual design of the site, HTML coding or use of page development software, metadata, mounting the completed pages on a Web server, testing and modifications, listing with search engines and directories, publicity and promotion, ongoing site maintenance, and ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the Web site. The strategic planning process provides a useful framework through which to view the many tasks associated with Web site development and maintenance and to conceptualise their relationship to one another.</jats:p>",

Empirically, I explore both the puzzle-solving of the engineers as they tried to ascertain what had gone wrong, and the way in which this led to substantial delay in a major aircraft project, and consequent large-scale political and economic repercussions. Theoretically, I use these events to reflect on and denaturalise notions of scale and size. Instead of social and technical phenomena being seen as intrinsically different in size (a Euclidean notion), scale and size are considered to be relational effects. The aeroengine explosion is thus treated as disrupting a mathematically transitive series which was producing scale and size—and the social and technical repair work is treated as an attempt to remake scale relations so that ‘small things’, such as pieces of metal in the interior of aeroengines, were again rendered smaller than ‘large things’, such as economic and political context. </jats:p>",

This will not be easy as—with a few exceptions—most academics nowadays still tend towards impoverished views of praxis which leave remarkably little room for creative exorbitance. Thus, for example, many modern social and cultural theorists would find it difficult to understand the import of Wittgenstein's famous question, “what remains over from the fact that I raise my arm when I subtract the fact that my arm goes up?” In effect, what I attempt to provide is the beginnings of an answer to this question. In the first part of the paper I am therefore concerned with an account of a style of thinking which I call nonrepresentationalist. In the second part of the paper I then broaden the discourse by considering the ways in which this style of work might be linked to other developments in the social sciences and humanities grouped around the notion and the motion of performance. In the third part I consider one particular mode of performance—dance—as illustration of some of the steps I have traced out. Some tentative conclusions follow. </jats:p>",

The state‐of‐the art of dedicated environmental information systems is briefly discussed. Essentials and peculiarities of environmental information are highlighted. The role of environmental management systems and their relationship with other dedicated management systems is positioned within this field. The need for information following from this is compared with the information available in current ERP systems. The common features of both information systems are discussed and the importance of physical relationships within them is demonstrated. A physical approach is argued as the very base of future extended ERP systems. An outline of the special character of physical information is presented for this purpose. Subsequently, some restrictions connected to the current approach in ERP are analysed. This results in a number of recommendations. The most crucial aspects are the integration of the process and discrete manufacturing orientation by applying a multiple‐input multiple‐output approach to all processes, and a similar consideration of co‐products, by‐products, wastes and emissions.</jats:p>",

Risk assessment is a key thread that runs through the process, from high level risks in a conceptual design to details of day-to-day execution. It is robustly linked to the process for estimating well times and contingency costs and provides a means of communicating risks to business delivery up to management.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A correct set of well objectives and design basis is the foundation of an effective detailed planning phase involving a large team of contractors. Integration of service suppliers and drilling contractor into a comprehensive planning effort is key to planning and execution success. Standard project-management techniques are combined with structuring of the organization around delivery of key elements of the well to ensure that a large project team is properly focused on achieving a world-class operational target. Detailed planning ensures flawless operation and efficient recovery from setbacks. The rig team is critical to getting the detail right. In the end, rigorous post-analysis is essential to ensure that lessons learned, not only about the technical aspects of the well, but also the process, are fed back into the planning of future operations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Development of the work described here coincided with many things happening throughout the industry during 1997-98. BP Norway was evolving into an organization that delivered its activities on a project basis, while an industry wide capital projects benchmarking study demonstrated a close correlation between the quality of preplanning (front-end loading) and efficiency of execution. Added to this, the deepwater drilling campaign in Norway was a cause for management concern. None of the wells drilled by early 1998 delivered within budget (Fig. 1). Seen in this context-as an issue of credibility for BP's Norwegian operation-continuation of the status quo was unacceptable. Consequently, in late 1997, we reviewed factors that contributed to previously successful projects and seemed to be common to these operations. From these factors and subsequent experience, we have developed a set of 10 principles.Commitment of project manager and full management support.Highly competent team members.Clear delivery-focused accountabilities.Early and effective planning.In-depth risk assessment and management.Efficient processes (cost, schedule, documentation, logistics).Alignment of the team to a world-class goal.Everyone involved and able to listen and speak openly.Performance assessed continuously vs. stretch targets.Seriousness about the principles rather than just lip service.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In addition, we concluded that the conventional plan needed to be extended and made the execute/evaluate cycle into a five-stage project.Prepare to plan.Plan the operation.Prepare to drill.Drill the well.Close the loop-learn.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The motivation here is that \"business-as-usual\" results follow from standard working practices. To do things differently, we had to spend time early in the project thinking about how to do the planning and execution rather than jumping straight into them like we normally do.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Earlier work1–3 indicated that critical attributes of the project team included its ability to learn, its sense of purpose, its structure, associated work processes, target setting, and performance measurement. This paper describes how we put that thinking into action, from the original well concept, through the planning phase, to execution and post-analysis; how the risk-assessment process is an integral part of the whole and the results achieved to date on the Norwegian operations; and how our approach is evolving as our experience grows.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conceptual Well Design</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Clearly defined well objectives are critical to an effective and efficient operation. In many instances, compromises are made during well operations for \"operational reasons,\" such as not running logs and not cutting cores. This is symptomatic of a defective objective-setting process. If the data from the missing logs really are required to fulfill well objectives, the drilling team must ensure that the proposed design guarantees delivery rather than leaving it to operational chance. Colocating an experienced drilling engineer with the exploration team (geologist, geophysicist, petroleum engineer, operations geologist, and petrophysicist) during prospect development seems to work.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The proposed inverse‐planning algorithm optimizes both the intensity‐modulated beam (IMB) and the normal tissue prescription. In the IMB optimization, we developed a fast‐monotonic‐descent (FMD) method that has the property of fast and monotonic convergence to the minimum for a constrained quadratic objective function. In addition, a fuzzy weight function is employed to express the vague knowledge about the importance of matching the calculated dose to the prescribed dose in the normal tissue. Then, a validity function is established to optimize the normal tissue prescription. The performance of this new fuzzy prescription algorithm has been compared to that based on hard prescription methods for two treatment geometries. The FMD method presented here both provides a full‐analytical solution to the optimization of intensity‐modulated beams, and guarantees fast and monotonic convergence to the minimum. It has been shown that the fuzzy inverse planning technique is capable of achieving an optimal balance between the objective of matching the calculated dose to the prescribed dose for the target volume and the objective of minimizing the normal tissue dose.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Our aim in this paper is to introduce the figure of the underdetermined ‘blank’ into issues of social and spatial order. We argue that forms of social order habitually make tacit use of blank figures. Beginning with examples of blank figures as they appear in games of cards and dominos, we show how the ‘joker’ and the ‘double-blank’ domino, respectively, allow for conditions of both stasis and change to develop within an order. Such blanks are underdetermined or ambiguous figures that are constitutionally indifferent to heterogeneity. Blanks have the capacity to figurally represent the presence of absence in a known social order. Through the indifference that absence has to order, blank figures are able to form links and coordinations within heterogeneity to produce what pass for homogeneous social orders. They are figures of topological complexity that allow for connections and spacings to be made that unsettle Euclidean geometric assumptions about order through its representation in terms of regions, scale, and boundedness. Furthermore, this same indifference ensures that any such coordination remains open to change. We describe blank figures' ability to provide the conditions of possibility of both stasis and change in terms of their motility. The blank figure allows us to build an account of social order as a switching between stasis and change which treats both as emergent effects of the same ordering practices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A number of relocatable head fixation systems have become commercially available or developed in‐house to perform fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) treatment. The uncertainty usually quoted for the target repositioning in SRT is over 2 mm, more than twice that of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) systems. This setup uncertainty is usually accounted for at treatment planning by outlining extra target margins to form the planning target volume (PTV). It was, however, shown by Lo et al. [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. <jats:bold>34</jats:bold>, 1113–1119 (1996)] that these extra margins partly offset the radiobiological advantages of SRT. The present paper considers dose calculations in SRT and shows that the dose predictions could be made at least as accurate as in SRS with no extra margins required. It is shown that the dose distribution from SRT can be calculated using the same algorithms as in SRS, with the measured off‐axis ratios (OARs) replaced by “effective” OARs. These are obtained by convolving the probability density distribution of the isocenter positions (assumed to be normal) and the original OARs. An additional output correction factor has also been introduced accounting for the isocenter dose reduction (2.4% for a 7 mm collimator) due to the OARs “blurring.” Another correction factor accommodates for the reduced (by 1% for 6 MV beam) dose rate at the isocenter due to x‐ray absorption in the relocatable mask. Mean dose profiles and the standard deviations of the dose (STD) were obtained through simulating SRT treatment by a combination of normally distributed isocenters. These dose distributions were compared with those calculated using the convolution approach. Agreement of the dose distributions was within 1%. Since standard deviation reduces with the number of fractions, <jats:italic>N</jats:italic>, as <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8930-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8930:mp8930-math-0001\" /> the planning predictions in fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy can be made more accurate than in SRS by increasing <jats:italic>N</jats:italic> and using “effective” OARs along with corrected dose output.</jats:p>",

The historian Robert Fishman noted in 1978 that while Le Corbusier and Frank Lloyd Wright had become legendary as visionary architects and urban planners, Howard, probably more influential in the evolution of urban planning than either of them, has remained relatively obscure. Howard, like his more famous contemporaries, has always been characterized as Utopian by some because he imagined that city planning could aid in the creation of an entirely new society. For Howard, this society was to be one in which social divisions would be eliminated and the standards of living of all citizens would be raised through participatory social democracy organized at the city level. Howard attempted to realize this new society through building experimental communities to serve as models to be emulated elsewhere.</jats:p>",

It describes the scale of poverty in Maputo, where more than half the population is poor, including 30 percent who are destitute. Most of the city’s population gets land for housing through the informal market. Access to formal ownership, often through illegal means, serves mainly the economic and political elites. The paper reviews the limitations of a programme that was meant to improve urban management; but with an emphasis that was inappropriate in the face of massive poverty and unrealistic in regard to the institutional and political realities. In conclusion, the paper argues that urban management improvements have to focus on demand-driven social improvements (in this instance improving informal land access for the majority) as much as on economic ones (for example, improving formal land access for the minority). It also notes the often under-estimated difficulties in improving urban management within countries with fragile local governments, especially where the adverse effects of structural adjustment and globalization are strong </jats:p>",

If we are to consider these multiple benefits at the level of the forest, the use of Leaf Area Density (LAD) provides some advantages over other often used measures. Since many factors in the urban landscape can limit leaf area, Potential Leaf Area Density (PLAD) can provide a measure of the upper limit to leaf area density. Using these two measures, urban forest planners and managers can integrate many of the issues associated with broader aspects of the structure and benefits of the forest under their jurisdiction. Some planning, policy, and educational applications of LAD and PLAD are discussed. Key words: urban forestry management and planning, leaf area density</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is no single surgical treatment of choice for aural cholesteatoma. The extent of the cholesteatoma, the amount of preoperative destruction, and the size of the mastoid pneumatization should guide the surgeon in choosing the type of operation for a particular ear — which may range from a simple extraction of the cholesteatoma (delivery) all the way to a radical mastoidectomy. It is the clinical acumen that will determine the type of surgery for a given cholesteatomatous ear, algorithms being of little use in the complex situation of a pathological condition with infinite variables. However, even when the most suitable surgical modality is chosen by the best of surgeons, the operated ear will still be left with the innate cause of the cholesteatoma, namely, its Physiopathologic background and its tendency to develop a negative gas balance in the middle ear. Because of this tendency to redevelop negative middle ear pressure, insertion and reinsertion of ventilation tubes are often necessary to prevent recurrent retractions and maintain aeration of the middle ear in posterior tympanotomies and modified radical mastoidectomies. Further, when the mastoid bowl is marsupialized, as in radical and modified radical mastoidectomies, the mastoid bowl is often not self-cleansing, thus periodically requiring the help of the otologist to keep it clean and dry. My study consisted of a long-term follow-up of 368 cholesteatomatous ears, which were operated on according to 6 different surgical modalities, ie, 112 radical mastoidectomies, 88 modified radicals, 72 posterior tympanotomies, 52 atticotomies, 36 deliveries, and 8 obliterations. Of the 368 ears, 11% did not require any postoperative toilet, whereas 89% required revisiting the surgeon periodically on an average of every 5 months, for cleansing of the mastoid cavity or securing the aeration of the middle ear by reinserting a ventilation tube. </jats:p>",

The notion of a spatial formation of wildlife exchange (SFWE) is deployed to trace the diverse modalities and spatialities of social networks in which such creatures are caught up and the ways in which these practical orderings work through the bodies of elephants, both in the sense of their energies being variously transduced and of their experiences being reconfigured in the process. These themes are pursued through two contemporary global networks of wildlife conservation/science. The first, characterised as a mode of ordering of foresight, is a network concerned with ‘captive breeding’ and configured through the coding and exchange of computerised information on the lineages and breeding properties of animals held in zoological collections worldwide. The second, characterised as a mode of ordering of authenticity, is a network concerned with ‘in-situ’ conservation projects and configured through the recruitment of paying volunteers, corporate donors, and field scientists to a global programme of research expeditions. Our account traces three simultaneous moments in the patterning of elephants in each network—as virtual bodies, as bodies in place, and as living spaces. </jats:p>",

We end with some examples of cases where the mode of delivery in Great Britain has changed, or is changing, from traditional local government provision to other forms. Our model suggests a rationale for these changes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The institution of the family is changing in complex and inscrutable ways. Ideally, it continues as a space of intimacy, love, and morality within which young children may find care and nurturing. This mythic conception of the institution belies the complex gendered realities of parenting. This paper focuses on the institution of fatherhood and the work of fathering. Much of our understanding of what it is to be a father hinges on an ‘idea’ that does not embrace the ‘fact’ of fathering as a daily emotional practice that is negotiated, contested and resisted differently in different spaces. Our enduring myths of social reproduction do not seem to support forms of masculinity that encompass a sense of self that is nurturing and domestically orientated. The paper derives from a series of discussions with new fathers and mothers in San Diego, California. I focus explicitly on constructions of fatherhood and the work of fathering with a focus on fathers who called themselves ‘househusbands’ and ‘Mr Moms’. Although many of the heterosexual parents in the San Diego study thought of motherhood and fatherhood as ‘natural’ categories that gave meaning to their emotions and behaviors, further scrutiny suggests that emotions and behaviors are complexly woven, unraveled and sometimes detached from the work of parenting. The paper's main contribution is to demonstrate that even the most active fathers tend to see their role as ‘helping out’ their partners rather than taking the main responsibility for child-care themselves. </jats:p>",

Although the spatial impacts of investments in transportation networks, electricity, water supply, sanitation, and telecommunications on development are assumed to be positive, there has been no clear consensus on their magnitude or scope. This article surveys the theoretical and empirical literature on sectoral and social development with respect to the availability of infrastructure. There are three main results. First, the developmental impacts of infrastructure investment turn out to be modest but positive on all aspects of development. Second, there needs to be a sufficient level of productive activity to take advantage of the complementary relationships, and no amount of investment in core infrastructure is capable of overcoming disadvantaged locations. Third, because the relationship between investment and growth is interdependent, development pressures may be efficient investment triggers. These findings suggest an analytical framework that can be used in planning infrastructure investments to advance interregional development goals. </jats:p>",

Personnel preparation is an ongoing part of the fabric of daily work. The driving force behind the content and specific personnel preparation activities is the basic question, \"What do we need to know and do to improve the outcomes for all young children?\" I suggest that currently we do not have the resources or the policies in place to support such a vision. I further suggest that grassroots public support for early childhood intervention could be achieved through the kind of \"learning communities\" envisioned in the opening vignette of this article. I suggest that there are three areas where changes are critical in order to create \"learning communities\": (1) increasing collaboration among multiple partners at multiple levels; (2) attending to diversity issues; and (3) promoting family involvement in personnel preparation. Without a shared vision and commitment to early childhood intervention at the community level, we will continue to operate with a massive gap between what we know from research and how we practice. We know what constitutes an effective personnel preparation system, just like we know what makes an effective early childhood intervention program. The question is can that information be shared in ways that make the need for changes in policies and practices undeniable? It will take a nation of informed \"learning communities\" to make my vision a reality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By North American standards Toronto is a concentrated agglomeration. Its downtown has enjoyed spectacular growth since the 1960s; most inner-city neighbourhoods are perceived as desirable; and public transit patronage is high relative to that of same-size North American metropolitan regions. Still, it is within dispersed, car-oriented, suburbs that most post-1950 development has taken place. This agglomeration is composed of two realms—a concentrated and a dispersed realm—differentiated by their respective land-use-transportation dynamic. The concentrated realm is defined by a considerable reliance on walking and public transportation, a mixing of land uses and overall higher employment and residential densities than elsewhere in the metropolitan region. Meanwhile, the dispersed realm is car dependent, dominated by large monofunctional zones and developed at a relatively low density. The author links the coexistence and respective importance of these two realms in the Toronto agglomeration both to the nature of urban policies implemented since 1950 and to the circumstances that have led to their adoption. The construction of expressways, suburban type land-use planning, and a generous provision of open space have abetted dispersion. By contrast, the construction of a subway system and measures encouraging the redevelopment of underused land have promoted growth within the concentrated portion of the agglomeration. It is noteworthy, however, that these measures have failed in their attempts to induce concentration beyond the prewar urbanized perimeter. The author examines the positive and negative aspects of the presence of these two realms within a given agglomeration and highlights the threat newly adopted policies represent for the concentrated realm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past 10 years studies conducted on the quality of family planning services have examined the strengths and weaknesses of family planning in many developing countries. China's national family planning programme in the past two decades has achieved extremely successful benchmarks, and accelerated the pace of fertility transi tion. It is one of the world's most closely watched family planning programmes, often sparking intense debates about reproductive behaviour and reproductive rights. This study evaluates a variety of elements on the quality of family planning services by analysing survey data and historically reviewing the development of China's national family planning programme. The author argues that the quality of family planning services in China is influenced greatly by the national family planning policy and its implementation at the grassroots level. In particular, quality of care refers to the ser vice network, service resources, service strategic interventions and provider-client relationships. China's family planning programme is undergoing a shift from tradi tional services to comprehensive services in reproductive health, and is gradually insti tutionalising the quality of care. Although the cost of personal freedom in reproductive behaviour should be taken into consideration, this study provides evidence that China's national family planning programme has exerted a relatively positive impact on the quality of care for the world's largest population. </jats:p>",

Three tribal groups-the Bhils, Garassias and Meenas-were selected for detailed investigations. The study was conducted using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. The respondents included, among others, community members, community leaders, eligi ble couples and the service providers of the area. The results of the study show that resistance to family planning is due to sociocultural and socioeconomic factors, the user's knowledge of and access to contraceptive methods and the attitude of the service providers towards the beneficiaries. The sociocultural factors include, among otbers, polygamy, the felt need for a large number of sons to defend and preserve family hon our, prevalence of nata system and the excessive use of alcohol among men. One socio economic factor is the huge amount of compensation to be paid to one's wife's parents in case of her sterilisation. One of the salient findings of the study is an almost non- existent client-provider relationship. Based on the findings of the study a plan has been suggested to address this weakness. This plan advocates basic changes in the state policy in order to make family planning acceptable to tribal groups. </jats:p>",

Obviously, small or less prestigious vendors have difficulty fulfilling their bottom line without tapping the Laggards market.

A case study was conducted within a large public sector university in Australasia during a major ERP-managed project utilizing the Diffusion of Innovations theory integrating it with the concepts of internationalization.

In and through dominant discourses and institutional practices they are constituted as vulnerable and as out of control in terms of sexual desire (their own as well as others' for them).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At the turn of the 20th century, children's play came under new and heightened scrutiny by urban reformers. As conditions in US cities threatened traditional notions of order, reformers sought new ways to direct urban-social development. In this paper I explore playground reform as an institutional response that aimed to produce and promote ideal gender identities in children. Supervised summer playgrounds were established across the United States as a means of drawing children off the street and into a corrective environment. Drawing from literature published by the Playground Association of America and a case study of playground management in Cambridge, MA, I explore playground training as a means of constructing gender identities in and through public space. Playground reformers asserted, drawing from child development theory, that the child's body was a conduit through which ‘inner’ identity surfaced. The child's body became a site through which gender identities could be both monitored and produced, compelling reformers to locate playgrounds in public, visible settings. Reformers' conviction that exposing girls to public vision threatened their development motivated a series of spatial restrictions. Whereas boys were unambiguously displayed to public audiences, girls' playgrounds were organised to accommodate this fear. Playground reformers' shrewd spatial tactics exemplify the ways in which institutional authorities conceive of and deploy space toward the construction of identity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers' renewed interest in institutions reflects traditional concerns with the way institutions can shape geographies and a more recent interest in the ways geographies are important in shaping institutions. In this paper the authors build on this second strand of work and are specifically concerned with children's use of new information and communications technologies in schools. The authors suggest that multilayered institutional cultures, which are shaped by official school policy, teacher practice, and pupil culture, are exceedingly important in shaping distinct cultures of computing in (and within) the case-study schools. The highly gendered character of these institutional cultures is reflected in the very different attitudes of male and female pupils to computers and in the patterns of use which generally favour boys rather than girls. These are negotiated through competing masculinities and femininities in the classroom context, gender identities which are played out through normative understandings of heterosexuality. The authors conclude that we may indeed characterise institutions as ‘precarious geographical achievements’, as suggested by Parr and Philo. Schools are embedded within wider places, are important sites for the negotiation of gender and sexual identities, and, as spaces, are in part shaped through our notions of gender and sexuality. This achievement is only precarious as institutions are not forever solidified in their current form but are open to change, both inadvertently and through the concerted actions of individuals. </jats:p>",

The author uses data from a unique survey of individuals, both management and nonmanagement, in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in England and Wales to ascertain whether the corporate perspective is equally supportive of such an empathetic balance. Multiple research methods including interviews, a questionnaire, and focus groups with individuals were used to explore management and nonmanagement attitudes to the importance of compliance with, and the effectiveness of, regulation. Compliance with regulation is viewed as morally right both by management and by nonmanagement; however, the effectiveness of regulation is questioned. Nonmanagement in particular demand strong enforcement and penalties; management demand consistent regulation to ensure a ‘level playing field’. Both question whether all regulation is relevant to environmental protection. Although self-regulation is supported in theory, this is because of the perceived weakness of reactive regulation. Individuals suggest that the majority of SMEs are not taking any, or only minimal, steps to self-regulate. The potential for a balance between command-and-control and self-regulation approaches receives only cautious support from management and nonmanagement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The volatility of commercial property markets in the United Kingdom has stimulated the development of explanatory models of ‘price’ determination. These models have tended to focus on the demand-side as the driver of change. A corollary of this is that, despite the fact that construction lags are known to exacerbate cyclical fluctuations, the supply-side adjustment mechanism has been subject to relatively little research effort. In this paper the authors develop a new model of commercial property markets in the United Kingdom. The model is adapted from Poterba's two-equation asset-market approach to modelling the housing market. The first equation is an arbitrage relationship where the return on property is made up of rent, as determined in the user market for property services, and the capital gain, which is dependent on the return on alternative assets. This can be interpreted as a ‘stock’ demand equation. The second equation explains that ‘flow’ supply is determined by real capital values. The long-run empirical generalisation of the two-equation model allows the authors to estimate two key behavioural parameters required in explaining supply-side adjustment to market change. First, the authors interpret the coefficient on the capital value variable in the supply equation as an estimate of the long-run ‘price’ elasticity of supply. Second, from the demand equation, they estimate the extent to which new supply can act as an ‘automatic stabiliser’ on property values. It is argued that although increases in demand drive up property values, new development is also initiated and will, in turn, dampen down the growth in real capital values. The equations are estimated for the office, industrial, and retail sectors. Although there are no comparable estimates of supply elasticities in the real estate economics literature, the results are generally consistent with prior knowledge. Estimates of the stabiliser effect are also plausible and, taken together, the supply-side parameters help provide insights required in understanding property market dynamics in the last twenty-five years. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the late 1980s, various scholars have concluded that a recovery from the Fordist crisis will require that rigid Fordist practices and structures in the industrial sector be replaced by flexible ones. The mode of development to follow, often referred to as a post-Fordist or after-Fordist mode, is often assumed to be characterized by flexibility in technologies, labor, and production processes. Aside from idealistic scenarios and limited empirical findings, relatively little is known about the product, process, and linkage structures which will lead to a new mode of development. The degree to which flexibility processes will be influential is also unclear. It is within this context that I try to provide new insights into the changing nature of industrial production and the social and technical division of labor, with the aid of results from a recent study of the German chemical industry (basic chemicals; pigments, dyes, paints, varnishes; and pharmaceuticals). Using a postal survey of 155 German chemical firms and 18 firm case studies, I investigate how firms have adjusted their product and process configurations and their supplier relations and customer relations to meet the changing technological, economic, and societal settings. According to my analysis, it seems unlikely that industrial development will follow a single growth trajectory towards flexibility. Increases in flexibility in products and processes are often only subordinate goals, or are not considered necessary. I describe how chemical firms benefit from spatial proximity to their supplier and customer bases. I also provide evidence that most firms rely on strategically important stable linkages within the short and middle distance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The pressures created by urban sprawl are leading to a reduction in forested land in Canada and North America. Poorly controlled land-use planning contributes to the haphazard urbanization of many small communities within commuting distance of major urban centres. Urban forests are largely ignored as an asset and the potential benefits they can offer to communities are often not acknowledged in the planning process. Relatively few communities across Canada have any form of urban forest management. A new definition of the urban forest is proposed that recognizes the need for an ecosystem approach to urban forest management and the integral role that humans play in that ecosystem. To facilitate the implementation of urban forest management plans in small communities, a simple strategic planning framework is presented. Using this approach, many small towns can maintain their rural character and benefit from a wealth of environmental, social and economic benefits. Key words: urban forestry, community planning, forest benefits, strategic planning, ecosystem approach, forest fragmentation </jats:p>",

Most notably, SAP R/3 has been widely implemented to create value‐oriented supply chains that enable a high level of integration, improve communication within internal and external business networks, and enhance the decision‐making process. Though many organizations have reported dramatic improvements from SAP R/3 implementation, others have experienced difficulties in getting the R/3 modules aligned with other business components and systems. Describes a case study of a failed implementation of SAP R/3 to re‐engineer the supply‐chain and business processes of a major manufacturer. Lessons, in terms of factors that led to failure and their future implications, are discussed in the light of the contrasting experiences of several best practice companies. Based on the overall analysis, a framework for effective implementation of SAP R/3 is proposed.</jats:p>",

The results reported here indicate that a greater number of EAB member hours spent on program activities was associated with a greater number of events implemented. Smaller work-site size was associated with greater employee awareness of the program and greater participation in project activities as reported on the employee survey. These results suggest that the number of hours employee representatives devote to project activities might be an important consideration in planning employee involvement in work-site health promotion programming. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Privatisation is one of the key elements of the package of neoliberal reforms in the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe which collectively constitute the ‘sharp shock’ strategy. In this, privatisation is ascribed the role of redistributing and clarifying property rights, which is an assumed precondition for efficiency improvements in individual firms. In practice, the transformation is characterised by path dependency, cultural and political legacies, and uneven and partial reform of market institutions and of regulation. We contribute to the debate on the link between property rights and firm-level performance in three main ways. First, we analyse the tourism sector as a counterbalance to the emphasis in the existing literature on manufacturing and financial services; particular emphasis is given to the roles of ‘operators’ and the ‘nomenklatura’, and to complex, nonlinear shifts in property rights. Second, we assess the performance of tourism firms created by different forms of creative and distributive privatisation; this emphasises the diversity of property rights, market segmentation, and the capital and debt structures of firms. Third, the value of the concept of ‘recombinant’ property for analysing the complex and changing forms of property rights is critiqued. These arguments are illustrated through a case study of tourism in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Issues relating to the governance of urban areas and regions have become of increasing interest to academics and policy analysts. In the global economy, urban and economic development matters are being interpreted within the governance framework. As a consequence of the lack of a formal statutory metropolitan political focus within the UK over the last 30 years, much of this debate has invariably focused on one scale: the city or the local. But the New Labour Government’s political and administrative restructuring of the institutions and regions of governance is reconfiguring the city development issue onto another level. In future, it will be possible to view the urban governance issue from the perspective of a much broader framework, involving issues relating to urban policies within institutions operating at the regional level. This article is intended to chart the development of a push towards city-region planning and governance in the UK. It focuses specifically on political and institutional restructuring as a catalyst to a reconceptualization of the urban problem, and assesses four key components that have engendered this sense of strategic policy making over the last few years: central government funding opportunities through partnerships; the emergence of regional planning; the creation of regional development agencies with an urban remit; and opportunities provided by European Union funding mechanisms. The article concludes by outlining possible future directions for city regions and identifies where future research is required. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Fertility in rural areas such as the Governorate of Menoufia in Egypt may be influenced both by spatial factors (including the diffusion of innovations) and by essentially nonspatial factors (such as the availability of education for women and the percentage of adult women who are currently married). The nonspatial variables are available directly from censuses but the spatial component requires an accurate location of the villages to which the census data refer and then appropriate decomposition of the data into spatial and nonspatial components. We use IRS satellite imagery to classify the built area in a rural governorate in Egypt and then assign village-level census data to the centroids of those polygons and incorporate the data into a GIS. We then employ measures of global and local spatial statistics to conclude that in 1976 the combination of female illiteracy, proportion married, and spatial clustering accounted for 39% of the variation in fertility in Menoufia. In 1986 those same factors explained 51% of the variation in fertility. In 1976 about one third and in 1986 about half of the explained variability was due to the spatial component (‘diffusion’) and the other half due to a combination of demographic characteristics. Furthermore, between 1976 and 1986 there was a clear north-to-south drift of fertility, with lower fertility being clustered in the north and higher fertility clustered in the south. </jats:p>",

But many people whose living standards have increased vote against the government. Analyses reported here, using specially constructed bespoke neighbourhoods around the homes of respondents to the 1997 British Election Study, show that the latter group mainly live in areas of high local unemployment. This suggests a pattern of altruistic voting, of people who are prospering personally, but whose neighbours are not, voting against the incumbent government—a pattern confirmed by statistical analyses of both egocentric and sociotropic voting. </jats:p>",
