The third part discusses urban policy, politics and their impact on the attainment of an optimum city. Finally, the fourth part begins with a question on the nature of optimal institutions and concludes with some laws that cities under such optimal institutions should obey. </jats:p>",

Proponents have claimed that planning will enhance economic growth, particularly when it relates to professional and skilled manpower.1 Opponents have claimed that such planning distorts the market and will lead to excess supply or excess demand and in either case is costly in terms of economic resources. Our objective in this paper is to outline the general issues in manpower planning, briefly look at what is being done today in Canada, and then offer some suggestions concerning directions manpower planning might take. This paper is not intended to be a comprehensive review of the subject since other studies have gone into far more depth.3 Instead, we want to raise what we consider to be the major questions concerning how and what manpower planning is done.</jats:p>"

In October, the Journal published a description of a humanistic competency-based training program which focused on the content of instruction. The present paper is concerned with the structure of teacher training, specifically, the practicum experience. This model is geared to providing the student with varied, yet intensive, experience in diagnosis and remediation. The author describes various aspects of the practicum model which distinguish it from university clinic-based practica and from traditional student teaching practica in the public schools. With the monies for special education under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142) earmarked for local and state control as opposed to university control, university programs must be structured to provide teacher training experiences more directly responsive to community needs. The practicum structure described in this article has the additional feature of involving university faculty directly with the practicum site staff and the university students. This arrangement enables greater quality control over practica as well as encourages university personnel to maintain their own applied capabilities. — G.M.S. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning-horizon literature has thus far focused on the analysis of deterministic lead-time inventory systems. We show that under certain conditions several planning-horizon theorems hold in the stochastic lead-time case as well. Specifically, demands are assumed non-interchangeable and deterministic; thus production runs are assigned to sets of specific demands and can only be used in the satisfaction of those demands. When holding, backlogging, setup (ordering), and variable production costs are stationary over time, and when the lead-time distribution is invariant over time, it is always optimal to produce for sets of consecutive integral demands. Production dates for specific shipments follow from convexity properties. Building upon these results, we prove several planning-horizon theorems (of the Wagner-Whitin and Zabel varieties). A forward dynamic programming recursion is given. These results are shown to generalize those of the basic dynamic lot-size model. We present a numerical example that illustrates the sensitivity of the optimal policy to changes in lead-time variance. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, though the average income <jats:italic>per capita</jats:italic> has risen by about 50 per cent since 1960 (with total income having almost doubled), these increases have been very unequally distributed both between and within countries. This has led to the conclusion, now widely held, that growth-oriented development strataegies are alone unlidely to solve the problem of poverty. Similarly, there has been a move away from the confidence placed upon the growth of national income <jats:italic>per capita</jats:italic> as an effective index of social welfare. There has therefore been a quickening interest, particularly on the part of multilateral and bilataeral donor agencies – notably the World Bank, I.L.O., O.D.M., and S.I.D.A. – in promoting changes in domestic policies within the Third World which would focus more upon increasing the welfare of the poorest groups.</jats:p>",

The technique employed in the modeling and simulation effort was GERT, which was used because of its capability to incorporate the probabilistic outcomes and feedback loops common to R&amp;D projects. The GERT (Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique) includes the modeling of systems in network form and analysis through simulation. It is an important example of technological spin-off from space science research. GERT provides the capability to model and analyze networks of a very general form. Some of the features included in GERT networking are probabilistic branching (stochastic models), network looping (feedback loops), multiple sink nodes (multiple outcomes), multiple node realizations (repeat events), and multiple probability distributions (assigned to activity times). GERT networks are typically analyzed using the GERTS IIIZ simulation package, which provides statistics on project times and cost. </jats:p><jats:p> Results of the simulation included statistical data on individual project duration and cost as well as overall network time and cost. These results were employed to provide management with an evaluation of different model configurations, prepare overall time and cost estimates as inputs to contract negotiations and to plan and schedule manpower, equipment and capital. Sensitivity analysts was employed to determine key stages in the R&amp;D process where changes in success-failing probabilities might reduce network time and cost. Implementation experiences validated the model as satisfactory with the exception of several minor problems. </jats:p>",

The program segment focuses on the cognitive aspects of the workshop, while the service segment provides suggestions for meeting the affective and psychomotor needs of the participants.

Instead of our normal assumption of ‘unchanged’ policies we have included a possible set of budget measures for next spring. These are a reduction in income tax amounting to £2 billion and a 10 per cent increase in those indirect taxes that do not automatically rise with inflation (e.g. specific duties on alcohol and tobacco).

A hypergeometric model of consumer choice, assuming a finite set of ranked alternatives and limited searching in random order, is then introduced and developed to model situations where tied ranks exist.

Present short range planning should consider more closely the basic needs of the inhabitants. These needs include piped water and sewer systems, more careful avoidance of sewage pollution of drinking water and the immediate environment, better cross cultural integration, greater emphasis on recreational facilities, awareness of the need for energy savings, less ice fogs, and relatively warm and sunny microclimates.The Scandinavians have been leaders in this field, and offer many examples of advanced planning of northern communities in Lapland, Iceland, and West Greenland. We should study their approach towards the solution of our common problems. Through dialogue with them a clearer understanding and possibly better solutions to existing problems will be found.A basic necessity in making the studies is a better understanding of the nature of the North and of the people. We must learn to work with both nature and the people.Now is the time for long range planning by considering climatic, environmental and cultural factors, and integrating them into a more harmonious system with the aim of a higher quality of life. </jats:p>",

First, community leaders have recognized that a larger geographic area gives a community a larger economic base for planning purposes and offers access to services and institutions that would be impossible in each and every town, thus enhancing potential for development. Second, a greater emphasis is now placed upon identification and use of regions for planning and development purposes under state and federal laws. Third, importance of regional planning has grown because of such factors as growing urbanization, increased demands for community services, pressure to reduce disparities among urban-rural areas, growing environmental concerns, and “spillover” effects of unplanned growth.</jats:p>",

The tests are replicated and a new group of tests are applied to a data set of individual household moves for the Milwaukee metropolitan region. The new tests attempt to distinguish between the effects of heterogeneity, cumulative inertia, and changes in the rates of mobility. The results emphasize that even when cumulative inertia exists it is a very weak influence on the probability of migrating and that duration of stay since the last move is an inadequate measure of residence history effects. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a specification for an access control mechanism. The mechanism is specified in a context for use with the GPLAN decision support system by a theoretical description consistent with the formal definition of GPLAN's query language.
