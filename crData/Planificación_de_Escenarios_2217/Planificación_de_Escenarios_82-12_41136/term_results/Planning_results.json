Over thirty five P&amp;D professions can be identified, yet everyone also engages in P&amp;D. Three objectives measure the success of P&amp;D: maximize the effectiveness of recommended solutions, maximize the likelihood of implemented solutions, and maximize the effectiveness of P&amp;D resources. Several predicaments in P&amp;D professions can be identified as a result of evaluating P&amp;D performance in terms of these objectives. Various approaches to achieving P&amp;D purposes are reviewed to identify points at which improvements can be made. Five intertwined factors along a timeline are identified to demonstrate a different and more effective approach: pursuing a P&amp;D strategy, specifying and presenting a solution, involving people, using information and knowledge, and arranging for continuing change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Full payout leasing, including leveraged leasing, is widely used to finance major capital investments. This is the type of leasing engaged in by banks and other financial institutions. From the lessor's perspective the profitability of a lease investment derives largely from the fact that the lease generates substantial tax shelter during the early years of the lease term. A given lease will be both a source as well as a use of tax shelter at different stages during the lease term, so careful planning is required to maximize profitability in a tax-constrained environment. </jats:p><jats:p> New England Merchants Leasing Corporation, a subsidiary of a bank holding company, recently completed developing a computer-based planning model to aid in the management of its overall portfolio, and to support the evaluation of specific investment proposals. The model has been successfully implemented and integrated into the management decision process, and is now the basis for all long range planning for a total portfolio in excess of $200 million. </jats:p>",

How city governments respond to the need for improved planning is crucial given a decision environment that is subject to shocks and surprises.

Improvements in the planning system must be reconciled with the concept of comprehensiveness. A number of tensions exist that must be resolved before a planning system may evolve. Resolutions are suggested that permit the evolution of a dynamic planning system that can function within the decentralized decision process of local government, yet remain comprehensive. </jats:p>",

The proposed management system follows the guidance of the Office of Management and Budget Circular A‐109 and the Chief of Naval Operations. A clear articulation of operational needs aids the task of prioritizing resource allocations and also promotes earlier integration of ship and subsystem design and development schedules. More precise resource allocation and earlier integration should decrease acquisition time and increase ship subsystem capabilities. The worth of the proposed concept has been demonstrated by a pilot program and can readily be implemented within the constraints of the current Planning, Programming, and Budget System.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In terms of theory, the study of industrial location is largely a derivative discipline. It is argued that industrial geographers have adopted concepts from the organisational sciences without sufficient consideration of their disciplinary context. A review of organisational science theory suggests that mainstream industrial location analysis is flawed from a political and methodological point of view. Industrial geography has adopted a model of the business organisation which has a managerial bias. More subjective approaches towards organisational theory which emphasise individual perceptions and behaviour and the importance of the strategic decisions made by senior managers have also been neglected. It is proposed that studies in industrial location should be more firmly grounded in social theory. A more qualitative analysis of the industrial enterprise is suggested which uses participant-observation techniques that focus on the potential for choice in organisational systems of control. </jats:p>",

Finally, it investigates the implications of migration for development planning in the Dominican Republic.

Previous approaches to this problem have been to (1) engineer the situation so that the errors are small or (2) let the programmer analyze the errors and take explicit account of them. This paper gives the mathe matical underpinnings for building programs (plan checkers) that carry out the second approach automatically. The plan checker uses a geometric, computer-aided design (CAD) type of data base to infer the effects of actions and the propa gation of errors. It does this symbolically rather than numerically, so that computations can be reversed and desired resultant tolerances can be used to infer required initial tolerances or the necessity for sensing. The checker modifies plans to include sensing and adds constraints to the plan that ensure its success. An implemented system is de scribed, and results of its execution are presented. The plan checker could be used as part of an automatic planning system or as an aid to a human robot programmer. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The basic challenge to industrial geographers is to construct a general theory of the interrelationships between the behavior of industrial organizations and the dynamic spatial structures of industrial systems. Three conceptual problems associated with this research are examined in terms of the transformation of manufacturing firms from intranational companies to international enterprises. The major conclusions from the discussion are that the interrelationships between the internationalization process and the spatial form of industrial systems must be viewed as the result of the strategic choices made by management; that the initial dependent variable of the transformation process should be an index measure of the financial performance of the firm over time; and that rigorous testing of the hypotheses already formulated by industrial geographers must assume the highest priority. Following a discussion of the three issues, the conceptual design of an experimental research project now in progress is described. The project is an investigation of the strategic responses of a sample of American firms to import competition and economic decline. </jats:p>",

This paper examines three control mechanisms behind these changes and concludes that: the interstate highway system was not a major determining factor in the spatial pattern of nonmetropolitan development, branch plants of manufacturing companies seemed to contribute to employment stability in these areas, and unearned income played an increasing role over time in the economic base of these rural areas. These conclusions, therefore, separate some of the realities from the myths that have surrounded the growth of nonmetropolitan America. </jats:p>",
