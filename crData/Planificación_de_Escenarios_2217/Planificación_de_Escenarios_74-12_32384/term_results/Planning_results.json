The links between a transport-model view of road pricing and a view based on models of a single road are demonstrated, and the differing impacts and benefits of a range of other—more limited—policies are compared. The special sensitivity of parking policies to the degree of enforcement of parking charges is demonstrated using the same type of equilibrium model, extended to handle two different types of traveller. </jats:p>",

The post of ‘information broker’ was devised and set up as a two‐year experimental project under a special grant; the broker working as a member of the planning team and charged with relating to existing information services and promoting information flows. The workload fell into two main categories: information support to specific planning projects, and information support in general to the planning team, the latter category comprising a current awareness service and the development of structures to provide communication. The broker's services were less effective in the area originally defined by the planners as of their greatest need and more effective in areas where information gaps had not been specially noted. The original concept is now being reshaped.</jats:p>",

One suspects that, at least in terms of speed and scale of its development, this outcome of reorganisation was an unexpected one. Nevertheless, policy decisions have encouraged the trend, none more so perhaps than the request made by the Department of Health and Social Security in August 1972 that local authorities should prepare plans covering their personal social service capital and revenue programmes for the period 1 April 1973 to 31 March 1983. In one sense the circular <jats:italic>Department of Health and Social Security 35/72</jats:italic> represents a resumption of the ten year planning processes for health and community care initiated in 1963, but it can equally be seen as a new milestone in the development of the post-Seebohm services. The new planning process offers an opportunity to exploit administrative changes that have taken place in both the local authorities and in the National Health Service: it marks a changing relationship between the Department of Health and Social Security (hereafter referred to as the Department) and local authority departments.</jats:p>",

Interspousal\n      communication has been shown to be an important variable in family\n      planning behaviour in relatively underdeveloped as well as developed\n      societies. Authors of the well-known Puerto Rican family study\n      attributed a great deal of importance to interspousal communication as\n      an explanatory factor in family planning and fertility behaviour [5 and\n      6]. Hill [6] described communi¬cation as the \"hub\" variable and\n      concluded that the principal factors in family planning adoption were\n      emphasis on planning, communication between spouses and the ability to\n      come to a joint decision. Using data from a survey in East Pakistan (now\n      Bangladesh), Green [3] showed that contraceptive use was correlated\n      directly with interspousal com¬munication. Among non-user couples, 75 %\n      of the husbands and 69 % of the wives said they had learned nothing from\n      their spouses, compared with only 45% and 17% of user husbands and wives\n      saying they had learned nothing from each other. Green feels that one of\n      the major barriers to diffusion of action-associated knowledge about\n      family planning is the lack of communication between spouses.</jats:p>"

Then, as an empirical analysis, commercial land use in downtown Denver from 1947 to 1971 is studied. Characteristics of succession are revealed first, by the description of succession by both first- and second-order probability transition matrices; and second, by an examination of the stability of succession via two different approaches. Not unexpectedly, one of the major characteristics found in the study area is the nonstationary process of land-use succession, cautioning against the danger of employing a transition matrix estimated from one time period to predict future land use. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents the application of a modified mixed-integer programming algorithm to plan menus in which the portion size of the menu items can vary over a specified positive range. Previous mathematical programming formulations of menu planning problems have either required the variables representing menu items to be bivalent, or have formulated the problem with food groups as decision variables and no integer requirements at all. The former gives rise to a zero-one programming problem and the latter to a “feed-mix” problem. In many instances, a more realistic formulation would require that if a menu item is offered, its portion size must be between a specified upper and lower bound. Although this paper addresses itself chiefly to menu planning, it is readily seen that problems in capital budgeting may be tractable with a similar formulation. It is shown how a branch-and-bound algorithm for mixed-integer programming of the type proposed by Beale and Tomlin can be modified to solve the quasi-integer programming problem resulting from a variable portion size formulation of menu planning problems. </jats:p>",

Examination of the studies, however, reveals that many organizational problems remain to be solved in preparing truly comprehensive plans that effectively integrate and balance the diverse values held by study participants and concerned citizens. Burgeoning changes in state and federal laws, in planning concepts, and in public attitudes influenced the studies. Increased interest in the environment and greater emphasis on a multiple objective approach to planning for example, had significant effect. The type of organization used for carrying out these studies was a coordinating committee with one of the agencies ‐ in most cases, the Corps of Engineers, ‐ serving as lead agency. Some of the observed weaknesses of this arrangement were the lack of an effective mechanism for screening individual agency project proposals; unbalanced participation of agencies ‐ for example, construction vs. non‐construction, state vs. federal; agency representatives without sufficient delegated authority; insufficient control of the planning organization over individual agency participation and punctuality; and lack of emphasis on plan formulation and public participation. Suggested improvements, some of which are already being implemented in more recent studies include centralized planning staff and funding, formalized work agreements, a dynamic and continuous planning process with mechanisms for monitoring technological and social changes and evaluating planning effectiveness, planning guidelines and evaluative criteria, and a formalized training program for planners.</jats:p>",
