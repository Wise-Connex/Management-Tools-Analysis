This scenario is\n shown to provide a plausible explanation of the trend of transition\n temperature with layering structure in the Ca-spaced compounds and to\n predict a spectacularly large decrease in the electron-energy-loss\n spectroscopy cross-section in the midinfrared region on transition to\n the superconducting state, as well as less spectacular but still\n surprisingly large changes in the optical behavior.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Temporal Orientalism provides a tool for analyzing the advertising of a genre of mass-marketed paperbacks, which is the literature of a women's religious social movement. Through it, the Goddess movement advertises its message as liberatory feminist revelation, with historical claims proved by archaeology. Cover copy advertises what the author calls the lost Eden scenario, in which an imagined savage male Other despoils an imagined ancient matriarchy. The identity of this villainous male Other is withheld in the advertising, but revealed, “who-dunit” style, in the books: it is a racial identity. Hence, the advertising, like the books, reflects in its monotheism, its reliance on authority, its blame of an Orientalized Other, and so on, a Goddess religion that in many ways mirrors characteristics the authors describe as patriarchal when they criticize other religions. </jats:p>",
