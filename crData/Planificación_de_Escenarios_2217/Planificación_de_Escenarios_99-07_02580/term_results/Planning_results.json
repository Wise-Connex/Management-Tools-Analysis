      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research (Crookes, 1989: Foster and Skehan, 1996) has focused on the role of planning when tasks are used within language instruction. These studies have indicated that pre-task planning can have beneficial effects upon the nature of task performance, consistently leading to greater fluency and complexity and, less dependably, greater accuracy. The present study examines different sources of planning (teacher-led, solitary, group-based) as well as different foci for planning (towards language or towards content). Using a decision-making task (a ‘balloon debate’), data was collected using a 2×2 research design contrasting source of planning (teacher-led, group) and focus of planning (language vs content). In addition, to ensure comparability with previous research, solitary planning and control groups were also used. Results indicate a number of statistically significant effects. The teacher-fronted condition generated significant accuracy effects, while the solitary planning condition had greater influence on complexity, fluency and turn length. Group-based planning did not lead to performance significantly different from the control group. Finally, there was little effect on performance as a result of the language vs content planning condition. The results are discussed in relation to how teachers may more effectively make pedagogic decisions on task implementation conditions linked to selective pedagogic goals. </jats:p>",

Tiu ci nova epoko, se anticipe prigojata de iuj partoj de la logantaro de Makao, tamen preskaŭ certe kaŭzos pliajn intemajn kontraŭdirojn kaj krizojn en la jam relative malsimpla multlingva kaj multkultura situacio en tiu ci teritorio, precipe en la sfero de la ling va edukado, kiun regas la Baza Lego 1991 de la Aparta Administra Regiono Makao de la Popola Respubliko de Cinio. Tiu lego dekretas la cinan unu el la oficialaj lingvoj de la teritorio, apud gia nun sola oficiala lingvo, la portugala. La situacion ankaŭ ne helpos, cetere, la fortostrecoj de la nuna registaro de Makao por antaûenigi la instruadon de la portugala. Tiu ci referaĵo prezentas perspektivon pri la aktualaj lingvopolitiko kaj lingvoplanado en Makao kaj pri la lingva situacio, precipe rilate al la lingvoj en la edukado. La staton pri la (laŭ instruilo-elekto) kvar cefaj specoj de lernejoj oni profilas por povi taksi, kun kiagrada efikeco ili kapablas proksimiĝi al siaj deklaritaj celoj, kaj kiajn problemojn starigas por ili la baldaûa reiro al la cinia regado. Oni reliefige diskutas ankaû la konstatojn de eta superrigardo farita en Makao surbaze de demandaroj kaj intervjuoj pri la lingvaj uzo, preferoj kaj sintenoj. La studo pricelis specimenan grupon da mezlernejaj lernantoj kaj instruistoj, da universitataj studentoj kaj lekciistoj, kaj da edukaj administrantoj. Oni finas per rekomendoj, surbaze de tiuj konstatoj, pri strategioj por taŭge trakti kelkajn el la problemoj versajne estigontaj el tiu konflikto-ebliga situacio kaj precipe el gia transira fazo.</jats:p>",

Consequently, in the century before us we can look forward to a continuation of the desuburbanisation process in urban regions. The effect of this is that rural areas now need to promote co-operative, network-based and process-orientated procedural models of regional planning. These will allow us to establish to what extent the municipalities in rural regions are pursuing the principle of poly-centric concentration and are displaying an orientation towards a mid-ranking regional centre, or are choosing for orientation the metropolitan centres of more distant urban regions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

As the next century draws closer, it is apparent that some marketing managers are basing their relationships with customers on policies and procedures called either “individualisation”, “mass‐customisation”, or as we prefer, “personalisation”. The core of this practice involves tailoring goods and services to the individual needs and wants of specific consumers, just the opposite of one‐size‐fits‐all. We propose that personalisation is so important to marketing strategy that it should become one of the featured elements of the marketing mix, alongside product, price, promotion, place, personnel, physical assets, and procedures, to form a new marketing mix, the 8Ps.</jats:p>",

Geometrically complex situations have complex robot and environment geometry, crowded environments, narrow passages and tight fits. They require complex robot motions with coupled degrees of freedom. The algorithm constructs a path by incrementally building \n\na graph of linearized convex configuration space cells and solving a series of linear optimization problems with varying objective functions. Its advantages are that it better exploits the local geometry of narrow passages in configuration space, and that its complexity does not significantly increase as the clearance of narrow passages decreases. We demonstrate the algorithm on examples which other planners could not solve.</jats:p>",

Ends planning is directed at making explicit exactly what is wanted. What an organization wants, its ends, is of three types: ideals, objectives, and goals. An ideal is an end that can never be attained, but that can be approached endlessly; the gap between an ideal and where we are can always be reduced.</jats:p>",

The gaps between what the organization is and is now doing and where it wants to be and to be doing, as revealed by its idealized redesign, constitute the problems to be solved independently by means planning. Therefore, the first step in means planning is to identify these gaps. Means planning determines how the gaps are to be closed or reduced. In architecture, this corresponds to preparation of working drawings once an acceptable design of the building has been prepared. These drawings constitute a set of instructions that enable a contractor to build the building. It makes possible realization of the vision or the closest possible approximation to it. Means planning is the preparation of the design’s “working drawings,” which provide the instructions required to close or reduce the gaps.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Planning under uncertainty is a central problem in the study of    automated sequential decision making, and has been addressed by    researchers in many different fields, including AI planning, decision    analysis, operations research, control theory and economics.  While    the assumptions and perspectives adopted in these areas often differ    in substantial ways, many planning problems of interest to researchers    in these fields can be modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs)    and analyzed using the techniques of decision theory.       This paper presents an overview and synthesis of MDP-related methods,    showing how they provide a unifying framework for modeling many    classes of planning problems studied in AI. It also describes    structural properties of MDPs that, when exhibited by particular    classes of problems, can be exploited in the construction of optimal    or approximately optimal policies or plans.  Planning problems    commonly possess structure in the reward and value functions used to    describe performance criteria, in the functions used to describe state    transitions and observations, and in the relationships among features    used to describe states, actions, rewards, and observations.       Specialized representations, and algorithms employing these    representations, can achieve computational leverage by exploiting    these various forms of structure.  Certain AI techniques -- in    particular those based on the use of structured, intensional    representations -- can be viewed in this way.  This paper surveys    several types of representations for both classical and    decision-theoretic planning problems, and planning algorithms that    exploit these representations in a number of different ways to ease    the computational burden of constructing policies or plans.  It focuses    primarily on abstraction, aggregation and decomposition techniques    based on AI-style representations.</jats:p>"

Computer “optimization” algorithms have been shown to improve treatment plans as they can explore much more of the search space in a relatively short time. This thesis examines beam‐orientation computer “optimization” in radiotherapy treatment planning. New techniques were developed and a comparison was performed between treatment plans with “standard,” fixed beam‐orientations and treatment plans with “optimized” beam‐orientations for patients with cancer of the prostate, esophagus, and brain. A cohort of patients was considered in each group to avoid bias from a specific patient geometry. In the case of the patient cohort with cancer of the prostate, a coplanar beam‐orientation “optimization” scheme led to an average increase in the tumor control probability (TCP) of (5.7±1.4)% compared to the standard plans after the dose to the isocenter had been scaled to produce a rectal normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of 1%. For the patient cohort with cancer of the esophagus, the beam‐orientation “optimization” scheme reduced the average lung NTCP by (0.7±0.2)% at the expense of a modest increase in the average spinal cord NTCP of (0.1±0.2)%. A noncoplanar beam‐orientation “optimization” scheme was tested using five patients with tumors of the brain. The scheme reduced the mean orbit doses by (19±4)%, when averaged over the patient cohort. The optic‐nerve mean and maximum doses were reduced by (11±5)% and (12±1)%, respectively. In conclusion, “optimization” of coplanar beam‐orientations led to improved treatment plans, but improvements were relatively modest compared to those from the “optimization” of noncoplanar beam‐orientations.</jats:p>",

Correlations between importance and knowledge scores suggest that cultural issues are perceived as less  important by those with a high degree of knowledge concerning trade relation intermediaries.  Larger firms are also found to rate an understanding of negotiation strategy as more important than small firms.</jats:p>",

Cette déviation est en train de conduire le pays dans la direction d'un multilinguisme à part entière dans la société, non moins que dans l'éducation. Ce papier discute les décrets et les règlements formulés par les différents gouvernements libanais, de même que les pratiques prédominantes, dans le but d'éclaircir les questions en litige telles, que l'identité nationale, l'ascendance sociale et l'égalité des opportunités éducatives.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tPolitiko pri lingvoelekto en edukado en Libano:\n\t\tDe dulingvismo al trilingvismo\n\t\tLa debato en Libano pri la politiko kaj praktiko de lingvoelekto en edukado gis antaûnelonge emfazis la kulturan kaj lingvan lukton inter la araba unuflanke kaj la franca kaj angla aliflanke, sed lastatempe oni komencis emfazi praktikan sintenon al lingva edukado, kiu kondukas la landon al plena multlingvismo ne nur en edukado sed ankaŭ en la socio generale.

In an experiment, audit partners and managers examined one of two cases where a material misstatement—error or irregularity—was discovered. The auditors assessed the elements of the audit risk model, assessed business risk and provided recommendations for the audit investment and fee. When the likelihood of an error was high, the audit risk model dominated business risk in the explanation of the audit investment, and the fee did not contain a risk premium. When the likelihood of an irregularity was high, business risk dominated the audit risk model in the explanation of the audit investment, and the fee contained a risk premium. These results suggest that the ability of the audit risk model to describe auditor behavior and the inclination of auditors to charge a risk premium depend upon the nature of the risks present in the audit. In the presence of errors, the audit risk model adequately described audit-planning decisions; in the presence of irregularities it did not.</jats:p>",

Some have touted these efforts as offering new ways to achieve effective, democratic, comprehensive planning. Others, however, have argued that they did not produce significant results. This article examines the history of state planning in New Jersey and its effects on local and state decision making. It concludes that the planning process was explicitly designed to produce weak results and, to date, has produced few significant changes in decision making by either state agencies or localities. However, it also finds that the plan has significantly changed public discourse about land use and infrastructure spending in New Jersey. Whether such changes will result in significant shifts in actual policy making remains to be seen. </jats:p>",

The problem of adaptive gait generation \n\ncan be viewed as one of finding a sequence of suitable foothold on rough terrain so that legged systems maintain static stability and motion continuity. Due to the limit of static stability, deadlock situation may occur in the process of searching for a suitable foothold, if terrain contains a large number of forbidden zones. In this paper, an improved method for adaptive gait planning is presented by active compensation of stability margin, through center of gravity (CG) adjustment in the longitudinal axis and/or body translation in the lateral direction. An algorithm for the proposed method is developed and embedded in a computer program. Simulation results show that the method provides legged machines with a much larger terrain adaptivity and better deadlock-avoidance ability.</jats:p>",

It is increasingly coming to be accepted that, in some form or other, natural resources have to be managed. Since the function of spatial planning consists in ordering and safeguarding types of land use, the contribution it might possibly make to resource management would appear initially to be negligible indeed.

Of importance here are the spatial configuration of the planned poles, the economic activity to be located within these, the spillover effects of a planned pole, and the presence of a pole within an existing urban system. Consideration is also given to the failure, abandonment and non-adoption of the strategy and to the reasons for this. It is argued that growth-pole strategy has never been evaluated in terms of an adequate conceptual framework, and the rudiments of one such framework are outlined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The question to be addressed in this paper is that of the agglomeration and dispersion forces that are likely to account for the location of people and jobs in rural areas and the way these forces explain spatial patterns in rural areas depending on urban influence. Economic geography models may provide suitable tools with which to investigate the organization of rural areas. We first review these models, focusing on dispersion forces, which rest on land consumption and transport costs. We then suggest a set of hypotheses concerning the main forces at work in rural areas. Intensity of agglomeration economies is hypothesized to be related to urban size, which in turn induces increasing land rents and finally agglomeration diseconomies. Such diseconomies encourage population spread around the city and in a second stage a possible partial decentralization of population-serving firms, which seek proximity to households because of shopping transport costs. The consequences in terms of spatial patterns are that beyond a certain threshold of city size, decentralization of population-serving firms occurs, giving rise to secondary service centers, whereas services remain concentrated in the center for smaller cities. Empirical results concerning population densities, labor-force exchanges, and distribution of residentiary services in labor-market areas surrounding cities in six French regions are presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An examination is made of how the development of the Internet in Japan is likely to affect civic rights and the relationship between citizens and their government. This was undertaken to determine if the trajectory of Internet development in Japan, with its distinct locational and corporate biases, has followed the predictions of two prominent Japanese commentators: the visionary Kumon Shumpei who espoused an expansive international perspective that citizens will be transformed into ‘netizens’ in a virtual community; and the media analyst Kogawa Tetsuo, whose pessimistic views were targeted primarily at a national audience and concerned the adaptability of the Japanese to the ‘permanent autonomous zones’ created by information technology. The observations of these commentators on the relationship between the Internet and civil society are tested in an examination of the degree to which the social and political uses of the Internet have followed their conjectures by means of two case studies: the protest movements over United States bases in Okinawa, and the Nibutani Dam in southern Hokkaido—an area with a predominantly indigenous Ainu population. Although the authors report evidence that the Internet has extended the sphere of grass-roots political activity, they believe its effect is likely to be limited until there is a restructuring of Japanese political organisations and attitudes. </jats:p>",

With the aid of an empirical case study of business associations and their environmental lobbying, the author shows how business associations both draw on and shore up a rhetoric of ‘expertise’ and ‘rationality’ in an attempt to legitimate their own ‘subpolitical’ role whilst evading the accountability attached to more politically visible groups. </jats:p>",

The proposed methodology employs mathematical programming models in which the traffic matrix is represented by means of fuzzy set concepts, its uncertainties considered due to the existence of various and sophisticated telecommunication services in its networks. The TN‐SDH planning is understood as a problem of multicommodity flow networks and the model obtained has a fuzzy linear programming characteristic. This procedure was applied in a large‐scale realistic network and the results show that it is a method which is more attractive than others and do not employ fuzzy set in modeling the knowledge of traffic matrix.</jats:p>",

The interdependencies in the problem are described and shown to be essential features. The problem is formulated as a multiple‐criteria integer program with interdependent actions. Because of the large number of potential actions and the nonconvexity of the decision space, it is quite difficult to find nondominated subsets of actions. Instead, a modified goal programming technique is suggested to identify promising subsets. The appropriateness of this technique is explained, and the lessons learned in applying it to the Waterloo water supply planning problem are described.</jats:p>",

The decision whether to construct facilities and branches leads to a mixed integer programming problem with a large number of decision variables. The great deal of uncertainty associated with data that cannot be modeled using probabilistic methods leads to the use of fuzzy models to capture the uncertainty. In addition, several criteria must be taken into account that is resulting in the problem being fuzzy multiobjective. The combinatorial nature of the problem limits the use of traditional mathematical tools to limited size problems. This contribution presents a methodology that generates a sample of efficient solutions for the fuzzy multiobjective problem, based on a meta‐heuristic, <jats:italic>simulated annealing</jats:italic> (SA). The results obtained with this approach are shown to be satisfactory compared to other methods under similar conditions.</jats:p>",

Specifically, we explore the connection between lay understandings of risk and the contexts of their development and application with regard to one industrial hazard site in northeast England. Rather than presenting local knowledges as fixed or separable from cultural practices and social worldviews, we examine the relational and active construction of environmental understandings—noting the significance of such factors as local memory, observation and evidence, definitions of expertise, risk and credibility, and moral discourses. The paper concludes with a discussion of the relationship between knowledge, understanding, and context. We also consider the wider significance of this case study both for environmental policy and for more theoretical treatments of science and its publics. </jats:p>",

Two broad sets of potential factors are considered: characteristics of\na woman which influence her desire for children and thus her propensity to\nuse contraception, and factors relating to the family planning service\nenvironment in which she lives. The results from a multivariate analysis show\nthat certain individual characteristics, such as family composition and\neducation, have a strong impact on the level of contraceptive use and on the\nproportion of total demand for spacing or limiting childbearing that is met\nby use of family planning. Unmet need, however, remains fairly constant\nacross demographic and socioeconomic subgroups of the population. The\nlargest variations in unmet need are regional, but elements of the family\nplanning services, namely the provision of a community-based nurse who\ndistributes family planning and female doctors at clinics, also play an\nimportant role.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Shifts in job accessibility reflect, in part, the degree to which land use and transportation decisions help bring job opportunities closer to labor forces. In this paper we argue for the wider use of accessibility indicators as part of the long-range transportation planning process. As a case example, changes in job accessibility indices are traced for the San Francisco Bay Area from 1980 to 1990, computed for 100 residential areas and the region's 22 largest employment centers. Indices are refined based on occupational match indicators that weigh the consistency between residents' employment roles and labor-force occupational characteristics at workplaces. The analysis reveals that peripheral areas tend to be the least job accessible. Moreover, employment centers that are home to highly skilled professional workers are generally the most accessible when occupational matching is accounted for. This is thought to reflect the existence of housing markets that are more responsive to the preferences of upper-income workers. Our analyses also show that residents of low-income, inner-city neighborhoods generally face the greatest occupational mismatches. Through a path analysis, the variable ‘race’ was found to be far more strongly associated with unemployment than was job accessibility, however, even after controlling for educational levels and other factors. We conclude that an important purpose of tracking changes in accessibility is to provide feedback on the degree to which resource allocation decisions in the urban transportation field are helping to redress serious inequities in accessibility to jobs, medical facilities, and other important destinations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has been argued in the feminist literature that the state often contributes to patriarchal constructions of women's subordinate positions by providing political space for women's incorporation into civil society not as individuals and citizens but as members of a family belonging to the private sphere. In this paper the authors explore this question in the broad context of international labour migration in the Asia Pacific region, where migrant women are moving as paid reproductive labour in large numbers from less-developed countries to rapidly industrialising urban nodes in the region. The authors ground the ensuing issues in the specific case of Singapore, a country currently engaged in constructing a sense of nationhood among its people. Even as there is now some debate on the emergence of civil society as part of the nation-building project and possibly a larger role for social agencies which lie outside the rubric of state parameters, there are groups of women who are excluded from this embryonic discourse. One such group is the more than 100 000 female migrant domestic workers (from the Philippines, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and a number of other South and Southeast Asian countries) who, as women, domestics, and noncitizens, are identified with the confines of the private sphere and proscribed from public space in the dominant (and emerging) discourses. With use of a questionnaire survey, as well as in-depth interviews with foreign domestic workers, their employers, and a number of social organisations, the authors examine the politics of exclusion at the margins of society. The aims are to explore the types of social organisations which have opened up some ‘space’ within their structures for foreign domestic workers, as well as interest groups which have certain claims to represent these women, and to clarify the roles these marginal spaces play. This helps illumine the way these women interact with mainstream Singaporean society beyond the confines of the domestic sphere and broadens the understanding of the boundaries of civil society in Singapore and the politics of being ‘inside’ and ‘outside’. </jats:p>",

In the past, the standard reply to a query about what had happened to an order was “It’s on the loading dock.” Information systems at apparel factories were primitive. If all the SKUs for an order were not in the warehouse, substitutions of the same style in a different size would be offered to the retailer. Or retailers might not even notice if an unplanned substitution had been made because their information systems were equally as primitive. If there were insufficient SKUs of the requested style, the order would be shorted or a phone call made to the retail buyer to negotiate a solution to the problem. If no SKUs of the order were in the finished goods warehouse, then the search of the factory floor-where there might be tens of thousands of partially completed items to look through-would begin.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Then along came lean retailing and the need for rapid replenishment-manufacturers are now expected to replenish products in less than a week. At first, only a few retailers required this, and apparel manufacturers tried to meet these needs with minimal changes in their internal practices. Often, this was done at the expense of a manufacturer’s non-lean retail customers. For example, the CEO of a men’s dress-shirt supplier reported to us in 1992 that its finished goods ware house was divided into two areas.</jats:p>",

Once the beam data is entered and modeled, a series of test cases are performed that isolate different aspects of the dose computational process. The computed values from the 3D‐RTP system are compared against the measured dosimetry data, included in the package, for a set of comparison points within each test case. Both of the treatment planning systems that were studied provided excellent agreement between computed and measured doses. The cumulative 4 and 18 MV TG‐23 test results for the convolution/superposition based planning system indicates that 96% of the dosimetric test points are within ±2%, and 98% are within ±3% of the tabulated TG‐23 values. The dosimetric TG‐23 test results for the pencil beam kernel based planning system are similar, with 96% of the test points falling within ±2%, and 99% falling within ±3% of the TG‐23 measurements.</jats:p>",

The aim is to gauge the extent to which a political rhetoric of community participation in the 1990s constituted an attempt to redefine the relationship between health authorities (responsible for planning and prioritising services) and local communities. Data from aninvestigation encompassing 75 interviews is used to chart the manner in which health authority managers have re‐articulated and given substance to the rhetoric of participation. The analysis appears to confirm a ‘democratic deficit’ with regard to decision‐making in health care planning but there is a significant qualification. A process of ‘professionalisation’ and the growth of ‘active management’ (rather than ‘active citizenship’) may in part be off‐setting the democratic deficit. This process is however highly contingent upon developments in health service policy and organisation.</jats:p>",

However, non‐users with previous computer experience had more favourable attitudes towards the introduction of computerized care planning than those with no previous experience.</jats:p><jats:p>• The preferred teaching method identified by both groups was training by technical staff in the clinical area.</jats:p>",
