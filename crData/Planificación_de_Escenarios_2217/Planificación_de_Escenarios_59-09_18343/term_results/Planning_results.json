The tentative paper they formulated was submitted for analysis and discussion by principals attending the 43rd Annual Convention in Philadelphia, February 7-11, 1959. In light of the comments and suggestions made by these principals, the statement was revised and then resubmitted to the Ad Hoc Committee. Thereafter, further revisions were made. The report now appears in completed form and is believed to represent the informed judgment of thousands of secondary-school leaders and modern language specialists throughout the nation.</jats:p><jats:p>The Committee on Curriculum Planning and Development officially adopted these recommendations and the Executive Committee officially approved them, May 7, 1959.</jats:p>",
