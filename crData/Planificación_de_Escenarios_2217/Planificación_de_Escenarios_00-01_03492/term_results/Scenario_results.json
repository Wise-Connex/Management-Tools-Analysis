      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter introduces the concept of an electronic trade scenario as an aid to the management of (global) supply chains, and other forms of international, business-to-business electronic commerce. The problem addressed is the following. Competition demands that trade transactions be handled efficiently and securely. However, the same competitive environment also demands flexibility, and the ability to redesign the supply chain as conditions change. Current EDI (electronic data interchange) technologies offer efficiencies, but tend to be quite inflexible, often requiring substantial reprogramming for each modification to the transaction. Furthermore, these revisions need to be made not just for a single company, but for every affected company in the supply chain. In cases where some of the companies in the chain are relatively small, with limited computing staff and skills, such changes are even more difficult and disruptive. Electronic trade scenarios are generic, reusable models of the entire trade transaction. They are stored in a on-line repository, where each member of the supply chain can download the transaction component for their role in the transaction. In our proposed solution, the procedural logic of the transaction is designed using a high level, graphical representation called Documentary Petri Nets (DPN). The InterProcs system is described as a prototyping environment to support the design and execution of such supply chain transaction models using this DPN representation. A key concern will be the development of trustworthy trade scenarios that have sufficient controls and evidentiary documentation. Various directions of further work are described to improve the quality and flexibility of trade scenario designs.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Uncertainty in long-term timber production analyses usually focus success of regeneration, growth/mortality of trees and future fluctuations of timber prices/harvest costs, while uncertainty related to inventory data is paid less attention. At the same time, evaluations of inventory methods usually stop when the error level is stated, while the uncertainty accompanied by using the data is seldom considered. The present work addresses uncertain inventory data in long-term timber production analyses. Final harvest decisions, i.e. possible outcome intervals with respect to timing and expected net present value-losses due to incorrect timing, were considered. A case study was presented where inventory data errors according to different error levels were generated randomly. The selected error levels were based on observations from practical forest inventories in Norway. The analysis tool was GAYA-JLP. The impact of errors on decisions was derived through repeated computations of management strategies maximising net present value without harvest path constraints. A real rate of discount of 3% and an error level of 15% resulted in expected net present value-losses of 1 NOK haâ1 for basal area, 63 NOK haâ1 for mean height, 210 NOK haâ1 for site quality, 240 NOK haâ1 for stand age, and 499 NOK haâ1 when random errors occurred simultaneously for all these variables. The expected net present value-losses varied considerably. The largest losses appeared for stands with ages around optimal economical rotation ages. The losses were also relatively large for young stands, while they were relatively low for overmature stands. The experiences from the case study along with considerations related to other sources of uncertainty may help us to get a more realistic attitude to the reliability of long-term timber production analyses. The results of the study may also serve as a starting point in a decision oriented inventory planning concept, in which alternatives for inventory design and intensity are based on considerations with respect to inventory costs as well as net present value-losses.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>In forest management planning, deterministic timber prices are typically  assumed. However, real-life timber prices vary in the course of time,  and also price peaks, i.e. exceptionally high timber prices, might  occur. If land-owners can utilise the price variation by selling timber  with the high prices, they are able to increase their net revenues  correspondingly. In this study, an approach is presented to study the  timber price variation and its significance in the optimization of  forest management. The approach utilizes stochastic timber price  scenario modelling, simulation of forest development, and optimization  of forest management. The approach is presented and illustrated by means  of a case study. It is shown how the degree of uncertainty due to  variation in timber prices can be analyzed in tactical forest planning  of private forestry, and how the potential benefits of adaptive  timber-selling behaviour for a forest landowner can be computed by using  the approach. The effects of stochastic timber prices on the choice of  forest plan are studied at the forest holding level considering also the  spacing and type of cuttings and the optimal cutting order. A forest  plan prepared under the assumption of constant timber price very seldom  results in optimal forest management. Through studying the effects of  stochastic timber prices, forest landowners and other decision makers  obtain valuable information about the significance of adaptive timber  selling behaviour. The presented methodology can also be used in  analysing the land-ownersâ economic risks as a function of time-price  structure.</ja:p>"

Within Europe, such projections have been done for 11 countries at the individual national scale, most often to foresee the long-term implications of the ongoing forest management. However, the validity of the models has rarely been tested. The aim of this study was 1. to validate the European Forest Information SCENario model (EFISCEN) by running it on historic Finnish forest inventory data, 2. to improve the model based on the validation, and 3. to project the Finnish forest development till 2050 with the improved model under alternative scenarios. The results of the validation showed that EFISCEN is capable of making reliable large-scale projections of forest resources for periods up to 50â60 years. Based on the validation, the model was improved concerning simulation of age development, thinning regimes and regrowth after thinning. The projection of the Finnish forests till 2050 with the improved model presented a maximum sustainable felling level of around 70 million m3 per year. That provides an average growing stock of 106 m3 haâ1 in 2050 and a net annual increment of 3.6 m3 haâ1 yâ1. If the current trend towards more nature oriented forest management continues and 1.39 million ha of forests have been set aside additionally for nature reserves by 2050, the felling level could meet a realistic demand of 57 million m3 per year in 2050. Under the latter regime the average growing stock will have grown to 160 m3 haâ1 in 2050.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Using the Finnish MELA model, a set of scenarios were produced and used  to map the possibilities and risks surrounding the utilisation of  peatlands in wood production in Finland. One of the scenarios was an  estimate of allowable-cut calculated by maximising the net present value  of the future revenues using a four per cent interest rate subject to  non-decreasing flow of wood, saw logs and net income over a 50-year  period, and net present value after the 50 year period greater or equal  than in the beginning. The estimate for maximum regionally sustained  removal in 1996â2005 was 68 million m3 per year â approaching 74 million  m3 during the next decades. In this scenario, 14 per cent of all  cuttings during the period 1996â2005 would be made on peatlands, which  comprise ca. 31 per cent of the total area of forestry land. By the year  2025, the proportion of peatland cuttings would increase to over 20 per  cent. The increase in future cutting possibilities on peatlands  compensated for a temporary decrease in cuttings and growing stock on  mineral soils. The allowable-cut effect was especially pronounced in  northern Finland, where peatlands play an important role in wood  production. In addition, the sensitivity of cutting possibilities for  assumptions related to growth and price were analysed. The estimate of  maximum sustainable yield as defined here seems to be fairly robust on  the whole, except in northern Finland where the cutting scenarios were  sensitive to the changes in the price of birch pulpwood. The proportion  of peatland stands that are profitable for timber production depends on  the interest rate: the higher the rate of interest the less peatland  stands are thinned. The effect of cutting profile on future logging  conditions and resulting costs were analysed in two forestry centres. If  clear cuttings on mineral soils are to be cut first, an increase in  future logging costs is inevitable.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The information society is approaching; everything will change. New technology could enable commuters to decrease their number of physical trips. As a result of all kinds of new information and communication technology (ICT) services, it will be possible to live in the countryside and remain working in the city, 200 km (124 mi) away. The literature, especially scientific and empirical sources, however, tempers these expectations. The effects are limited, and there could be substantial side effects in the opposite direction, which could nullify the substitution effect. Given the discrepancies between expectations, one of the most important aspects of forecasting teleservices is uncertainty. This high uncertainty combined with high expectations often results in quasiaccurate forecasts or oversimplified speculation. The most important restriction in the many forecasts is the lack of complete and consistent future scenarios. A study that tried to address these restrictions by developing a scenario approach is reported. The approach is elaborated, using telecommuting as a case study. The study’s main conclusion is the confirmation that it is possible and useful to incorporate ICT services such as telecommuting into a scenario approach. The outcomes have additional value compared with estimates from literature because the magnitude of possible effects is considered instead of quasiaccurate predictions, the estimates are based on realistic and consistent societal scenarios, and the use of an operational transport model makes it possible to include second-order effects such as induced travel. </jats:p>",

The objective of the method is to assist the public sector in identifying the attractiveness of a transportation infrastructure project for private financing, highlighting the factors that tend to reduce such attractiveness and providing the means to examine the viability of alternative risk-allocation scenarios related to risks undertaken by the state or private sector. The method allows for the simulation of the private sector’s attitude toward risk, employing practices of risk assessment in investments. Its innovation lies in how the whole process is structured so that participants understand beforehand whether an agreement can be concluded and which factors involved are critical. A key property of the method is the ease by which priorities of different risk components are synthesized into a hierarchical form through pairwise comparisons. This method, although targeted primarily for the public sector, could assist both private and public stakeholders investing in transport infrastructure projects (termed private-public partnerships) to reach an agreement. Basically, it is an interactive process characterized by the conflicting objectives and judgments of both public and private sectors. </jats:p>",
