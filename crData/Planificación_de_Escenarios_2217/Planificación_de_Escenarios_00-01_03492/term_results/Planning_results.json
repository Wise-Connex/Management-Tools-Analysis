For community planning to be effective, planners must first recognize and acknowledge that community culture influences how people live in, use, and organize space. They must then base their designs on the respective community culture and avoid the trap of planning based on their own values and cultural background. Thus urban planning must take on a futuristic, multi-dimensional vision for the 21st century.</JATS1:p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<JATS1:p>The contributions in this book address these issues and suggest ways in which the planner can incorporate the cultural differences and avoid conflict. The book examines the inadequacy of current theoretical and philosophical paradigms in planning in a multicultural society, how planners can increase planning's effectiveness with ethnic and cultural communities, and how we might reshape institutions to better address the needs of a diverse, global, and multicultural society. This book will be of interest to both academic and professional audiences in multicultural studies and urban planning.</JATS1:p>"

I map the networks of social relations within which stakeholders act and the links and energy flows between them. I examine stakeholders' utterances and questions of who networks and acts informally; why, when, and how they do so, and with what implications. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Kenya, more than one in three women hospitalized for gynecological problems has complications from miscarriage or unsafe abortion. These women generally receive no information or services for family planning (FP) or other reproductive health needs. During 1996–97, the Kenya Ministry of Health, the Population Council, and Ipas tested three models for providing postabortion care (PAC) and FP information and services in two areas of the hospital. Researchers compared model effectiveness by using surveys before and after the intervention. As concluded in this brief, the most effective way to ensure that women being treated for incomplete abortion obtain FP is to offer services in hospital gynecological wards. Having ward staff provide contraceptives on the ward is more convenient than having regular FP providers visit the ward or having patients go to a separate clinic. Findings have been key in informing expansion plans for PAC in Kenya.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We describe three challenges for biodiversity planning, which arise from a study in Papua New Guinea, but apply equally to biodiversity planning in general. These are 1) the best use of available data for providing biodiversity surrogate information, 2) the integration of representativeness and persistence goals into the area prioritization process, and 3) implications for the implementation of a conservation plan over time. Each of these problems is linked to the effective use of complementarity. Further, we find that a probabilistic framework for calculating persistence-based complementarity values over time can contribute to resolving each challenge. Probabilities allow for the exploration of a range of possible complementarity values over different planning scenarios, and provide a way to evalua!e biodiversity surrogates. The integration of representativeness and persistence goals, via estimated probabilities of persistence, facilitates the crediting of partial protection provided by sympathetic management. For the selection of priority areas and land use allocation, partial protection may be a \"given\" or implied by an allocated land use. Such an integration also allows the incorporation of vulnerability/threat information at the level of attributes or areas, incorporating persistence values that may depend on reserve design. As an example of the use of persistence probabilities, we derive an alternative proposed priority area set for PNG. This is based on 1) a goal of 0.99 probability of persistence of all biodiversity surrogate attributes used in the study, 2) an assumption of a 0.10 probability of persistence in the absence of any form of formal protection, and 3) a 0.90 probability of persistence for surrogate attributes in proposed priority areas, assuming formal protection is afforded to them. The calculus of persistence also leads to a proposed system of environmental levies based on biodiversity complementarity values. The assigned levy for an area may change to reflect its changing complementarity value in light of changes to protection status of other areas. We also propose a number of complementarity-based options for a carbon credits framework. These address required principles of additionality and collateral benefits from biodiversity protection. A related biodiversity credits scheme, also based on complementarity, encourages investments in those areas that make greatest ongoing contributions to regional biodiversity representation and persistence. All these new methods point to a new \"systematic conservation planning\" that is not focused only on selecting sets of areas but utilizes complementarity values and changes in probabilities of persistence for a range of decision making processes. The cornerstone of biodiversity planning, complementarity, no longer reflects only relative amounts of biodiversity but also relative probabilities of persistence.</jats:p>"

The article espouses a five-phase transformation process: • Developing the Knowledge Future State Vision, Knowledge Strategy and Value Propositions • Developing the Knowledge Architecture and Determining its Content • Developing the Knowledge Infrastructure, Service Model and Network Support Mechanisms • Developing a Knowledge Culture Transformation Program • Leveraging Knowledge into Innovation The author identifies possible strategies, leading practices, and pitfalls to avoid in each phase. He also explores the challenges involved in identifying and measuring intellectual capital, encouraging new knowledge creation, capturing human knowledge in structural form, and enabling virtual workgroup collaboration.</jats:p>"

The Alma Ata Declaration announced that people have the right and duty to participate and most community health planning models agree that community involvement is essential if significant, lasting, and appropriate progress is to be made in health promotion and disease prevention. Progress toward this goal, however, has not been remarkable. This article argues that the slow progress is attributable to the way community has been defined and to deficiencies in the traditional community development models used by health planners. It advances a radical alternative to conventional methods of involving community in health planning and sets forth steps through which masses can become involved in meaningful planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<ja:p>The purpose of forest scenario modelling is to evaluate multiple  management options and to answer what if questions relating to a  particular development path of a given forest. Forest scenario planning  can reduce uncertainty in management outcomes by anticipating the future  in a systematic way, thus reducing the likelihood of unexpected events.  It can also improve the chance that future developments will agree with  specified objectives. Numerous techniques have been proposed for  generating and evaluating scenarios of forest development. Some of the  techniques are limited to applications in simple forest production  systems while others are suitable for any type of forest management,  including individual tree selection systems. Risk is defined as the  expected loss due to a particular hazard for a given area and reference  period. An expected loss may be calculated as the product of the damage  and its probability. Risk analysis, risk evaluation and risk management  are formal procedures for quantifying, evaluating and managing risk  within a given hazard domain. Applications of risk analysis in forest  scenario planning are rare and greater emphasis needs to be placed on  hazard prediction. The aim of this contribution is to discuss some  aspects of risk analysis, including examples of specific modelling  tools. In a forest planning model risk can be considered in the form of  specific constraints limiting the total risk in a given time period.  Expected hazards can be used to exclude certain risky alternatives and  finally, risk can be calculated and used to reduce the value of an  objective function coefficient.</ja:p>"

Conducted by the Population Council in collaboration with the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP), the study took place in four MOHP clinics and two affiliated private clinics. Nurses and physicians at all six clinics attended a two-day training session on contraceptives with an emphasis on barrier methods. Providers in the three clinics that had been randomly chosen as intervention sites also received three days of training on sexuality, gender, and counseling skills. To assess the acceptability of sexuality counseling as well as the impact of training, researchers interviewed 25 providers and 503 clients, held five focus group discussions, and debriefed seven women who posed as clients. As detailed in this brief, both clients and providers welcomed the inclusion of discussions on sexuality during FP counseling, providers who were trained in sexuality counseling were more likely to discuss sexual matters with clients, and clients preferred to have the provider initiate the discussion.</jats:p>"

Intended as a companion document to EPA SW-846, they feature the step-by-step process for completing a sampling investigation associated with data collection activities for waste identification purposes under RCRA. Included are standards that were jointly developed by several ASTM committees and EPA.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The printed manual also includes several appendices, one of which illustrates a practical waste pile example to clearly demonstrate the planning, implementation, and assessment process of a data collection activity. It examines five case studies with varying waste pile characteristics and alternate sampling designs. The four chapters in the printed manual cover: Introduction • Sampling for Waste Management Activities: Planning Phase • Sampling for Waste Management Activities: Implementation • and Sampling for Waste Management Activities: Data Assessment Phase</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Manual 42 and the supporting CD-ROM compilation serve as a valuable guide for: Engineers; Environmental Managers; Waste Managers; and Regulatory Staff</jats:p>",

In December 1974 Allen visited his high school friend Gates, then a sophmore at Harvard. Allen spotted an issue of Popular Electronics featuring the Altair 8080 on the cover at a kiosk in Harvard Square. “I bought a copy, read it, and raced back to Bill’s dorm to talk to him,” Allen recalled. “I told Bill, ‘Well here’s our opportunity to do something with BASIC.” ‘ Allen and Gates did not write a business plan; they started working on a version of BASIC for the Altair right away. Gates writes that they “were like the characters in those Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney movies: “Let’s put on a show in the barn!” We thought there was no time to waste, and we set right to it.” Gates and Allen “didn’t sleep much and lost track of night and day” to complete their BASIC in four weeks.</jats:p>",

Five major stages of the process are illustrated with multiple examples from the social and behavioral sciences, humanities, and such allied fields as education, social work, and business administration. The first stage, Preparing the Way, describes problems and alternative solutions in working with faculty advisors and in searching the professional literature. Stage 2 explains how to find good research topics and define them clearly for presentation to faculty advisors. Stage 3 describes problems often encountered in data collection and suggests solutions for those problems. At Stage 4, students learn ways of organizing and interpreting information, including classification schemes, verbal and statistical summaries, and methods of deriving meaning from data. The final stage, Presenting the Finished Product, offers guidelines for thesis and dissertation writing and for publishing the results in such media as books, journal articles, and popular periodicals. Stage 5 also includes a chapter about how students can mount a convincing defense of their work during a faculty committee's final oral examination session.</JATS1:p>"

The paucity of the information currently available on projects currently in the planning stage in Germany provided the starting point for a diploma dissertation submitted to the Faculty of Spatial Planning at the University of Dortmund with the title “Prospects of Factory Outlet Centres in Germany”. At the centre of this study was an empirical analysis (completed in March 1999) of the centres currently in planning. The findings of this study are reported in this article; however, in view of the rapid pace of developments in this field, in some respects the study has to be seen as no more than a snap-shot.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

This article provides a brief history of the events leading to the formationof AMWAC and of the work of this committee, particularly its approach to medical workforce planning and the outcomesof some of its research. The paper concludes that the forces leading to and maintaining workforce geographic andstructural maldistribution are better understood as a result of AMWAC studies and the work of other stakeholders.Further research is required to improve understanding of the hospital medical workforce and the factors influencing thecareer decisions of young doctors and to monitor the impact of strategies to improve workforce distribution.</jats:p>"

The relationships between the intra and extra organisational factors that ensure the success or failure of the electronic commerce projects in New Zealand are discussed. The investment risks for electronic commerce projects may rest on the planning, development, implementation and post-implementation phase. This study analyses the success criteria that are to be considered critical for electronic commerce projects in New Zealand. By using the CSFs criteria for investing in electronic commerce, this study suggests an e-strategy planning framework for New Zealand firms involved in electronic commerce. Future directions identifying the need for this proposed e-strategic framework and the need for empirical validation is also discussed.</jats:p>"

Despite continuous development of the field, aspects of language policy and planning need to be developed further. One of the key areas where policy can be enhanced considerably is in the area of policy and planning evaluation.

The number of dentists on the Dentists Register aged under 60 years may well fall over the 40 years between 1996–2036, while the proportion of female dentists is likely to grow from under 30% to almost 50%. If the present gender differences in dentists’ output persist, the effective ‘whole-time equivalent’ (WTE) size of the dentist workforce could fall by 15%. While future patterns of disease and the efficacy of future treatments are difficult to predict, the demand for dentistry is very likely to increase, given the forecast ageing of the UK population. The number of people aged 65–74 years could increase by 50% to eight million and those over 75 years by 70% towards seven million. Further, almost of all of this greatly increased older population will have retained some of their own teeth. The edentulous adult population was 37% in 1968 and might fall to less than 5% by 2036. These trends taken together could increase the number of courses of treatment per WTE dentist by as much as 40% over these 40 years. Such modelling can help to reduce the degree of uncertainty in future workforce planning. </jats:p>",

The forest owner may not be able to identify precise  management goals, as required in numerical optimization, for his forest.  The owner may also think that it is impossible to express  forest-management goals numerically. Due to these reasons, thematic  interview was tested as an introductory method in interactive planning  in several actual planning cases. It was observed that these interviews  helped the owners in outlining their forest-management goals, and they  offered an appropriate framework for defining these goals. It was also  noticed that the goals defined in the course of the interviews could be  included in the planning model in a way understood and accepted by the  owners, and the goals defined could be fulfilled.</ja:p>"

Overall PNG is sparsely populated with some 700 distinct cultural/ language groups. Economic growth over the past two decades has been spurred by large-scale mining, petroleum and logging operations though the majority of the population continues to rely upon subsistence agriculture (swidden) and collection and utilization of forest products. Some 15 million hectares of forests are accessible for logging, of which 1.5 million hectares have already been logged, generally in an unsustainable manner. Of the over 6 million ha of approved timber blocks more than 1.5 million hectares have been located in areas of high biological value. Forest loss and degradation is now becoming a serious problem.</jats:p>"

An assortment of expert reports — in some cases conflicting in their findings and reflecting the goals and interests of the clients who commissioned them — have come to be a bone of contention both in public debate and before the courts. It is against this background that expert reports on FOCs have to be subjected to critical scrutiny. The main differences between these reports emerge in connection with the statements they contain on the evaluation of the range of goods on offer in FOCs and the potential for adjustment, on the definition of catchment areas, and on assessing the impacts of FOCs on existing shopping centres in the surrounding area.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The planning process begins with an extensive situation analysis. The factors identified in the situation analysis are woven into the economic webs surrounding the new product. The webs are mapped into Bayesian networks that can be updated as events unfold and used to simulate the impact that changes in assumptions underlying the web have on the prospects for the new product. The author illustrates this method using a historical case regarding the introduction of videotape recorders by Sony and JVC and a contemporary case of the introduction of electric vehicles. The author provides a complete, numerical example pertaining to a software development project in the Appendix. </jats:p>",

Hand in hand with the dissolution of localities as socially integrated communities, there has also been a dissolution of the traditional scope for action. This disintegration is heightened by current processes of socioeconomic and political restructuring. Scope for local action still has to be developed by linking the global and the local, the municipality and the civil society. Regime theory provides valuable assistance in helping us to comprehend this challenge. It shows that through establishing strategic exclusion mechanisms it is possible to co-ordinate productively the actions of a number of different protagonists, even in the absence of formal agreements or social integration.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The interpretation could not be absolutely representative since the information supply was very different. Nevertheless, some topics can be regarded as “big issues”: Implementation and design of sustainability, spatial development in the context of globalization of economy, politics and society, world wide connected cities and agglomerations, the effect of scientific progress, especially in information technology, transport and the changing role of the state and its institutions. Finally some conclusions are drawn concerning the investigation methods and how to deal with these big issues.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Using the example of the regional plan for Munich, which is currently in the process of revision and updating, the article demonstrates that the argument of deregulation puts the previously clear statements on the admissibility of golf courses into question. The contribution develops regional planning criteria for the evaluation of potential golf course locations with reference to the broader regional context. In this respect the compatibility of golf courses with the character of the landscape and the recreational interests of the public is discussed, and criteria are suggested according to which certain macro-locations should be classified as being unsuitable for golf.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The question should be: Can food alone, in the absence of improved practices, improve nutritional status outside a rehabilitative, structured feeding situation? Projects discussed in this paper demonstrate that there can be biological impacts from improved practices. Helping families use their own resources better is an important first step, not a last step, in programme development. The lessons that have been learned over the years for improving young child feeding are as follows: science is not enough; knowledge is not enough; the focus should be on improving practices; mothers are not a homogeneous group; and the solution is seldom singular. Processed complementary food is really a small piece of a larger picture that needs to be thought about strategically on the basis of practices and the barriers to improving them. It is important to work with governments to help them formulate and think through the options that present themselves to improve the nutritional intake of young children. Rather than using a zoom lens, which often magnifies the food component, we need to use a panoramic lens to see other options when helping countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<ja:p>In forest management planning, deterministic timber prices are typically  assumed. However, real-life timber prices vary in the course of time,  and also price peaks, i.e. exceptionally high timber prices, might  occur. If land-owners can utilise the price variation by selling timber  with the high prices, they are able to increase their net revenues  correspondingly. In this study, an approach is presented to study the  timber price variation and its significance in the optimization of  forest management. The approach utilizes stochastic timber price  scenario modelling, simulation of forest development, and optimization  of forest management. The approach is presented and illustrated by means  of a case study. It is shown how the degree of uncertainty due to  variation in timber prices can be analyzed in tactical forest planning  of private forestry, and how the potential benefits of adaptive  timber-selling behaviour for a forest landowner can be computed by using  the approach. The effects of stochastic timber prices on the choice of  forest plan are studied at the forest holding level considering also the  spacing and type of cuttings and the optimal cutting order. A forest  plan prepared under the assumption of constant timber price very seldom  results in optimal forest management. Through studying the effects of  stochastic timber prices, forest landowners and other decision makers  obtain valuable information about the significance of adaptive timber  selling behaviour. The presented methodology can also be used in  analysing the land-ownersâ economic risks as a function of time-price  structure.</ja:p>"

First we will examine ideals concerning family size and the spacing of children. We will then focus on the conditions necessary for families to realize these ideals, which will include an examination of what families know about birth control and what contraceptive methods are available to them. Finally we will assess how family size ideals were realized - did the final number of children correspond to the family size set as a goal. ln the 1960s and the  1970s Finns were already considering a relatively small family as ideal, and essentially there has been no change in this ideal. The realization of family size ideals was still hindered in the early 1970s by the scarcity of information about sexual matters and the use of unreliable birth control methods. Couples ended up with a larger family than what they had considered ideal. With the spread of reliable contraceptive methods and the increase in knowledge about sexual matters starting in the 1970s, the final number of children in a family started to correspond to the ideal at the end of the decade. At the end of the 1980s the final number of children was already smaller than the ideal. Because there are deficiencies in the comparability of the studies made at different points of time, the results presented in the article should be examined with reservations, and seen mainly as demonstrating trends at the group level.</jats:p>"

With the growing need and call for coordination at regional level, more and more importance is coming to be placed, in particular, on sound methods for identifying and assessing potential commercial sites as a basis for regional planning concepts. In considering the example of Saarland's “Commercial Site Potential Model”, this article outlines the development and application of such a model and discusses the experience gained in its application within the framework of this Land-wide study, paying special attention to GIS support.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A multi‐period model is formulated that combines network topology design and capacity expansion. The ability to determine network expansion schedules of this type becomes increasingly important to the telecommunications industry and to its customers. The solution technique consists of a Genetic Algorithm that allows to generate several network alternatives for each time period simultaneously and shortest‐path techniques to deduce from these alternatives a least‐cost network expansion plan over all time periods. The multi‐period planning approach is illustrated on a realistic network example. Extensive simulations on a wide range of problem instances are carried out to assess the cost savings that can be expected by choosing a multi‐period planning approach instead of an iterative network expansion design method.</jats:p>",

Using visualization technology the system reconstructs and displays a 3D model of the interior structure of the patient's brain. Thus the surgeons can plan for surgery using a computer model. Marker registration is used to create the mapping between the patient's head and the brain model reconstructed in the computer. During the operation a robot arm is used as a navigator to locate the pre-defined incision site and the orientation of incision route. When the robot arm locates at the pre-defined site on the patient's head, it is fixed. Various medical instruments can be installed on the tip of the robot arm. The surgeon can insert a medical instrument into the pre-defined site of the patient's head, and the surgery can be implemented successfully with the help of this system. Using a virtual environment his system can also be used to teach and train new surgeons.</jats:p>"

However, empirical reality tells a different story. Fiscal federalism is not able to deploy its full argument because of the existence of various spatial externalities; this provides justification for politics to provide redistribution measures to assist disadvantaged regions. However, redistribution should be organised efficiently. The multitude of interdependencies and spillovers between urban and rural spaces makes it almost impossible to make a clear-cut distinction in cost-benefit terms between favoured and disadvantaged areas and regions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

While risk consideration is well developed in finance through efficient market theory and the capital asset pricing model, operations management models do not generally adopt these principles. One reason for this apparent inconsistency may be that analysis of an operational model does not reveal the level of risk until the model is solved. Using results from option pricing theory, we show that this inconsistency can be avoided in a wide range of planning models. By assuming the availability of market hedges, we show that risk can be incorporated into planning models by adjusting capacity and resource levels. The result resolves some possible inconsistencies between finance and operations and provides a financial basis for many planning problems. We illustrate the proposed approach using a capacity-planning example.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A hybrid approach for commissioning electron beam Monte Carlo treatment planning systems has been studied. The approach is based on the assumption that accelerators of the same type have very similar electron beam characteristics and the major difference comes from the on‐site tuning of the electron incident energy at the exit window. For one type of accelerator, a reference machine can be selected and simulated with the Monte Carlo method. A multiple source model can be built on the full Monte Carlo simulation of the reference beam. When commissioning electron beams from other accelerators of the same type, the energy spectra in the source model are tuned to match the measured dose distributions. A Varian Clinac 2100C accelerator was chosen as the reference machine and a four‐source beam model was established based on the Monte Carlo simulations. This simplified beam model can be used to generate Monte Carlo dose distributions accurately (within 2%/2 mm compared to those calculated with full phase space data) for electron beams from the reference machine with various nominal energies, applicator sizes, and SSDs. Three electron beams were commissioned by adjusting the energy spectra in the source model. The dose distributions calculated with the adjusted source model were compared with the dose distributions calculated using the phase space data for these beams. The agreement is within 1% in most of cases and 2% in all situations. This preliminary study has shown the capability of the commissioning approach for handling large variation in the electron incident energy. The possibility of making the approach more versatile is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Although such concepts have salience in relatively resource rich countries such as Australia, it is in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health policy that they have become pivotal. A growing national focus on the development of Aboriginal primary health care capacity followed the release of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy (NAHS) in 1989 (Anderson, 1997). This focus consolidated further, following the evaluation of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy implementation in 1994 which preceded the transfer of administrative responsibility for the Commonwealth Aboriginal health program from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) to the Commonwealth Health portfolio (DHFS, 1994). Within the strategic framework provided by federal state agreements, the development of primary health care services is a priority. In the current national policy framework domains of policy and strategy development have been identified as key developmental themes.</jats:p>"

Driven by the need to increase productivity, quality, and access while meeting the challenges of competition, universities, especially state-assisted institutions, are seeking ways to do more with less governmental support. Information Technology (IT) is perhaps the enabling tool that will bring transformative change (Oblinger &amp; Rush, 1997). The organizations that have had primary managerial responsibility for IT implementation on many campuses need to change and be restructured if the technology is to live up to its potential. This case study provides an overview of the process utilized in implementing a broad-based strategy to address the information technology needs of a large public university, the University of Memphis. It deals at length with the planning and creation of an IT governance structure and a strategic planning and management model. In this case, modern theories of organizational change and strategic planning were applied to the creation and improvement of the University’s IT structure.</jats:p>"

Today, the agronomic and economic requirements of nutrient management remain central, but in addition, the process must consider the potential impact of these nutrients on environmental quality. The nutrient‐management process is critical for maximizing the economic benefit from nutrients while minimizing the environmental impact. This process includes assessment, analysis, decision making, evaluation and refinement. A tactical nutrient‐management plan developed from this process must be based on a firm set of strategic objectives agreed upon by the farmers and society. The nutrient‐management process must also be practical to implement, if the performance goals are to be met. While nutrient‐management plans have resulted in benefits to farmers and society, implementation has not been as great as desired. Several factors have been identified as key to the successful implementation of nutrient‐management planning: the full participation of a broad range of stakeholders, the use of established infrastructure, targeted nutrient‐management planning efforts, voluntary vs. mandatory programs, and the economics of nutrient management. Experiences in Pennsylvania, the Republic of Ireland, and Northern Ireland illustrate aspects of the implementation of the nutrient management process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I investigate an institution which combines two forms of risk regulation commonly regarded as antithetical. In the governmental mode, associated with the rise of capitalism, the welfare state, and commercial insurance, regulation is centralised and spatially removed from the risk itself, and involves the surveillance, prediction, and control of risks posed by large-scale populations of atomised individuals or companies. This is in contrast to the older mutual form, in which social relations within communities allocate and minimise risks, evident in the moral economy of the peasantry, friendly societies, and the resurgence of discourses of community responsibility in the 1990s. Protection and Indemnity (P&amp;I) Clubs are mutual associations of the world's shipowners, which insure marine liabilities (including environmental risks). Their communal structure and self-interest in minimising risks means that they could, and to an extent do, play an important role in regulating marine safety and environmental performance. However, their global scale means that social relations between shipowners are not simply analogous to those within a local community. The P&amp;I Clubs do, in practice, employ centralised managers responsible for determining entry standards, setting premiums, handling claims, and engaging in loss prevention. These activities rest upon the ‘scientific’ calculation, allocation, and management of risks. At the same time the aim is to ‘maintain mutuality’ amongst members, and tacit knowledge and actively produced trust are essential to this end. I argue that the combination of a mutual structure and a global scale produces a hybrid style of regulation, and the successful application of rules, incentives, sanctions, and surveillance depends as much on the construction of specific sociospatial relations as on organisational form, with implications for new regulatory designs. </jats:p>",

The patients were 4 children (4–14 years, mean age: 9 years) and 5 adults (21–38 years, mean age: 29 years). The aim of the study was to preoperatively evaluate the individual intraventricular and vascular endoscopic anatomy at the floor of the third ventricle based on virtual endoscopic images. The virtual views were correlated with the real endoscopic images, intraoperatively obtained by a standard ventriculoscope (Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany) during endoscopic third ventriculostomy procedures. Contrast-medium-enhanced MR images (3D-MPRAGE; Siemens, Germany) were semiautomatically segmented with a surface-rendering technique (‘Navigator’ software; General Electric Medical, Buc, France) to produce the virtual endoluminal views. The virtual endoscopic images were comparable with the real intraoperative endoscopic view in 8 of 9 patients. Virtual endoscopy can display the position of the basilar artery, the posterior cerebral arteries and the posterior communicating arteries in their relationship to the mammillary bodies and the clivus. Preoperative virtual endoscopy planning can intraoperatively assist the neurosurgeon to find a safe location for third ventriculostomy.</jats:p>"

Pain relief and functional improvement are predictable clinical results. But the accuracy of the alignment affects the surgical outcome and the longevity of the prosthesis. Hence, current total knee implantation systems attempt to align the knee joint in the mechanical axis for placement of the total knee components. These approaches use templates and plain radiographs for preoperative planning and alignment devices for bone cuts. To overcome the inherent inaccuracy of the presently used systems a computer-assisted planning system has been developed delivering the necessary control data for the intraoperative surgical robot system.</jats:p>"

Regional collection planning is well advanced in Australasia, North America and Europe with high‐level co‐ordinated breeding programmes and regional studbooks. A few regional studbooks are also maintained by zoos in Africa, Brazil and Japan. Within Australasia most programmes are for indigenous parrots and some are linked closely to species‐recovery projects involving local wildlife agencies. In Europe and North America the majority of breeding programmes and studbooks are for exotic species of larger macaws, cockatoos and amazons. Some of these breeding programmes in zoos assist field conservation through active fundraising and participation of staff in field projects. Zoos also support conservation projects for species not maintained at their institutions. The role that private aviculture may play in conservation breeding programmes is discussed.</jats:p>",

Pre-operative planning and intra-operative realization relies on lower limb X-rays and extra- or intramedullary devices. This may lead to implant displacements. We generated virtual models of the distal femur for 10 knee joints. In a free-hand sweep we recorded 3-D US image volumes, which typically took 90 sec. The bony structures were detected automatically in the US-images and then appeared as curvilinear lines. Spatially arranged these lines formed femur models, which were used for the placement of a femoral prosthesis in an interactive computer-based 3-D planning. The automatic image segmentation took about 45 minutes. Its analysis showed correct detection of the bone surface. The interactive planning took 5-10 minutes. The investigation demonstrates that 3-D US can provide data of position and size of bony structures. Bone models created by analysis of 3-D US image volumes are useable for simulation of TKA implantations.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Gamma Knife (Elekta Instruments, Inc., Norcross, GA), a neurosurgical, highly focused radiation delivery device, is used to eradicate deep‐seated anomalous tissue within the human brain by delivering a lethal dose of radiation to target tissue. This dose is the accumulated result of delivering sequential “shots” of radiation to the target, where each shot is approximately three‐dimensional (3‐D) Gaussian in shape. The size and intensity of each shot can be adjusted by varying the time of radiation exposure and by using one of four collimator sizes ranging from 4–18 mm. Current dose planning requires that the dose plan be developed manually to cover the target, and only the target, with a desired minimum radiation intensity using a minimum number of shots. This is a laborious and subjective process that typically leads to suboptimal conformal target coverage by the dose. We have previously presented a forward—direct—method, which, using adaptive simulated annealing and Nelder–Mead simplex optimizers, automates the selection and placement of generic Gaussian‐based kernels or “shots” to form a simulated dose plan. In order to make the computation of the problem tractable, the algorithm exploits 2‐D contouring and polygon clipping and takes a 2 <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8879-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8879:mp8879-math-0001\" />‐D approach to defining the problem. In the current paper we present the results of four experiments on two historical clinical datasets, where the generic kernels have been replaced by patient specific kernels calculated by Elekta's Leksell Gamma Plan software. For these experiments the user only selects the maximum number of shots to use and the optimizers are then given the freedom to vary the number of shots as well as the weight, collimator size, and 3‐D location of each shot. Highly conformal and competitive dose plans were generated for these two difficult cases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the interaction between the university and the community is addressed. Whilst previous work has concentrated on the economic roles of universities in the community, insufficient attention has been paid to their cultural roles. Drawing upon fieldwork undertaken in Bristol, United Kingdom, I highlight a number of cultural roles which universities undertake in the community. In particular I outline the historical development of the cultural role of the university through a shift from the high-cultural role of the elite university to a broader cultural role for the contemporary mass university. A new environment for universities, including the declining influence of national structures, the interplay of processes of localisation and globalisation, and the emergence of new regional governance structures in Britain, is reshaping the cultural relationship between the university and the community and is opening up new possibilities for the creation of a closer, and more equal, relationship between them. This in turn could open up new possibilities for a greater sense of a shared public culture and address the evolving idea of the university. However, concerns are raised in relation to how these are affected by the introduction of globalisation practices and discourses into the university. </jats:p>",

Methodologies for IS planning usually involve the training and participation of individual employees—but only in so far as they contribute to furthering the pre-set organisational agenda. These methodologies also tend to assume a ‘standard’ role for IS experts: providing expertise in IT/IS management. Most of the literature and the practice of IT/IS development in organisations seem to be focused upon technical issues (Davies and Wood-Harper, 1989), where computer science experts play an important role (Winograd and Flores, 1987). They are expected to provide knowledge to solve problems.</jats:p>"

Attention is directed to a variety of factors that combine to reduce the visibility or even deny the presence of homelessness in rural spaces. We suggest that the complexities of rural homelessness are such that it may only become visible in particular spaces; spaces that tend to be constructed as nonrural. The paper begins with a critical discussion of spatialised representations of homelessness and privileged constructions of rural spaces in England which together act to obscure visibilities of rural homelessness in a range of discursive environments. We then move on to examine the ways in which such representations and constructions impact on and connect with local experiences of rural homelessness by drawing on some key findings from recent research. Here we consider three main issues concerning visibilities and invisibilities of homelessness in rural spaces: first, visibilities accorded to certain manifestations of rural homelessness through discourses of official statistics; second, a series of invisibilities associated with localised representations and experiences of homelessness in rural areas; and, finally, the ways in which rural homelessness emerges and becomes obvious in spaces that may be described as nonrural. </jats:p>",

This paper develops a methodology to break down the various tasks required in planning a job for production in the book manufacturing industry and to apply time measurement to these activities. These time measurements can then be used to individually cost the planning process of any book manufacturing company. The methodology is tested and justified through extensive data collection and application in a major book manufacturing firm. Thus, this industry can now effectively apply cost to activities of the planning process for each individual job as a direct cost, rather than an indirect one.</jats:p>",

When the hand grasps an object, neither the hand nor the \narm should collide with obstacles. However, it is very difficult to generate a collision-free grasp configuration of the hand-arm robot due to its abundant degrees of freedom of motion. To overcome this difficulty, we first decompose the hand-arm robot into \nthe multifingered hand part and the arm part. We develop two methods of the grasp planning. In one method, a collision-free configuration of the hand part is planned first. Then, \nthe arm configuration is planned so as to enable the hand configuration. In the other method, the collision-free configuration of the arm part is planned first and the multi-fingered hand \nconfiguration second. The best method is selected according to the space structure of the environment. Various heuristics are developed to improve the efficiency of the planning and implementation of the system. Simulation results are presented.</jats:p>",

With the advent of high‐throughput screening, it has now become possible to rapidly screen large sample collections. In addition to seeking greater diversity from natural product sources (micro‐organisms, plants, etc.), fractionation of the crude extracts prior to screening is becoming a more important part of our efforts. As sample preparation protocols become more involved, automation can help to achieve and maintain a desired sample throughput. To address the needs of our screening program, two robotic systems were designed. The first system processes crude extracts all the way to 96‐well plates, containing solutions suitable for screening in biological and biochemical assays. The system can dissolve crude extracts, fractionate them on solid‐phase extraction cartridges, dry and weigh each fraction, re‐dissolve them to a known concentration, and prepare mother plates. The second system replicates mother plates into a number of daughter plates.</jats:p>",

Although small units with high spatial accuracy can present unreliable rates, large spatial units may remove relevant geographical variation. Regarding mapping as a kind of statistical modelling, this author proposes a new methodology to select appropriate areal units using the Akaike information criterion and two search methods for an informative geographical aggregation in map construction. The optimal zoning of similarity is suitable for finding spatial anomalies but presents a biased overall pattern. An alternative approach is to cluster areal units according to explanatory variables: this shows clear spatial patterns of elderly men's mortality matching the ecological structure in the Tokyo metropolitan area. </jats:p>",

An integral part of this R&amp;D development is the planning and management of validations of potential technology projects. These validations are necessary to determine the technical, financial and organizational feasibility of the projects and to develop data for benefits measurement for further funding of selected projects. This paper describes a methodology for validation planning of new process technologies and practices. The methodology allows for the explicit linkage of a validation to the identification of its financial and strategic benefits. These often diverse measures of worth are integrated using a proven multi‐attribute justification approach within the planning methodology. The methodology and the multi‐attribute approach also support the comparison of dissimilar projects having different benefits. The methodology acts as an organizational planning tool integrating the needs of the diverse constituencies involved in R&amp;D planning. It also acts as a tool to aid engineers and scientists identify and present the benefits of the proposed technology.</jats:p>",

In fact, it is foolhardy to make any ecological interpretation of modern landscapes or environments or to formulate policy in conservation or natural resource management without an historical context that extends back decades, at least, but preferably centuries or millennia. Oftentimes, the ecological and conservation communities, in their search for more detail on the present and simulation of the future, appear to have forgotten the value of a deep historical perspective in research and application. However, the willingness of the geographical sciences to embrace broad temporal and spatial perspectives and to consider cultural as well as natural processes is worth emulating as we address environmental subjects in the new millennium.</jats:p>",

At the beginning of the 1950's, this natural richness beneficied environmental protection politics (creation of parcs and natural reserves). At the same time, this area became a very popular touristic region and was concerned by cheap recreativ equipments for a collectiv tourism according to the conception of tourism in socialist countries. Since the fall of the Wall of Berlin, the polish society and economy evolution and the opening to the West, tourism appears like a strong factor of local and regional development, above all in this poor border region. So today, Mazuria is in transformation. The analysis of this evolution will be done on the Great Lakes Region, situated in the heart of Mazury.</jats:p>"

Exemplary, planning a Frontal Orbital Advancement (FOA) operation the cutting trajectories, their depth and orientation in each point, the drill hole, the position, orientation and deformation of bones, etc. are the point of interest. Especially for intraoperative execution supported by navigation systems or robots. In order to be able to plan such complex interventions with the help of computers, geometrical and haptical models must be generated from the image-slices. On the one hand these models represent the anatomical structures exactly, on the other hand they are needed for the simulation of the different activities, which have to be performed during the surgical intervention like drilling, milling, deforming, positioning, etc. Beside the geometrical and haptical models methods for interactions must be supplied to the physician for an accurate and intuitive planning of the surgical intervention.

Beside the anatomical labeling of bone structures the determination of orthopedic measures, like angles, distances or sizes of contact areas, is important for the planning of hip operations. Thus, each atlas consists of labeled reference CT data sets, a set of landmarks as well as definitions of orthopedic measures and methods for their automatic computation. Furthermore, methods for the automatic transfer of anatomical labels from the atlas to an individual data set are presented resulting in three-dimensional models of the patient&amp;rsquo;s bone structures. The anatomical atlases are designed to replace the interactive, time-consuming pre-processing steps for the virtual 3D operation planning.</jats:p>"

In opposite to commercial systems our goal was, that the system considers the complete surgical intervention and not only a single procedure of it. A second goal was, that the system enables managing of complex operations, independent of which way the intervention will be intraoperatively performed (without technical support, with passive navigation support or active support by robots). Our system supports the surgeon during the preoperative planning as well as during the intraoperative execution phase. Therefore we developed a course model by which the managing of surgical interventions is possible. The focus of this paper is on this course model. At first we introduce instruction graphs and describe the structure of each activity observing its attributes and their context. Additionally, various surgical scopes will be presented which enable the surgeon to select one view among different ones of the individual operation procedures in accordance to medical and technical knowledge as well as in accordance to different degrees of abstraction. At last we demonstrate operation patterns, used as expert knowledge.</jats:p>"

Empirical evidence from two demand-side surveys suggests that close proximity between vendors and clients is required for contracts that involve frequent buyer–seller interaction (face-to-face linkages). These types of contracts are shown to be relatively low duration and/or low cost in nature. Specific activity classes that exhibit these characteristics include data processing, computer software development, product testing, and equipment repair services. In contrast, more advanced (and often more expensive) services such as management consulting and industrial design exhibit lower levels of contact sensitivity. The paper concludes with a discussion of forthcoming prospects for the development of a contact-based model of producer service location. </jats:p>",

Parents and alternative carers of HIV‐affected children in follow‐up in 10 paediatric centres from seven European countries were surveyed. A total of 182 questionnaires were returned: most (73%) were completed by parents, of whom 92% were HIV‐infected. Of the 226 children cared for by the respondents, most (62%) were HIV‐infected. Disclosure of both the child’s and the parent’s infection status was rare and found to be associated with child’s age in both cases. Infected children living with their parents were less likely to know their diagnosis than those living in alternative care. Uninfected parents and carers were significantly more likely to want professional help with disclosing to an infected child than infected parents. Infected parents also face difficult decisions regarding the issue of who will care for their children when they are unable to. Half of the infected parents had made long‐term plans for their children’s future social care. European parents were more likely to have made such plans than those from elsewhere (mainly Africa) and parents with plans had known about their HIV infection for significantly longer than those without. Increasing numbers of vertically infected children are reaching adolescence as a result of improvements in the management of paediatric HIV infection. As both disclosure and planning for the future social care of HIV‐affected children have been found to be strongly associated with child’s age, the changing epidemiology of paediatric HIV highlights the need for more information on these issues in order to support families more effectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a way of exploring spatial nonstationarity by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. Nevertheless, formal testing procedures for spatial nonstationarity have not been developed since the inception of the model. In this paper the authors focus mainly on the development of statistical testing methods relating to this model. Some appropriate statistics for testing the goodness of fit of the GWR model and for testing variation of the parameters in the model are proposed and their approximated distributions are investigated. The work makes it possible to test spatial nonstationarity in a conventional statistical manner. To substantiate the theoretical arguments, some simulations are run to examine the power of the statistics for exploring spatial nonstationarity and the results are encouraging. To streamline the model, a stepwise procedure for choosing important independent variables is also formulated. In the last section, a prediction problem based on the GWR model is studied, and a confidence interval for the true value of the dependent variable at a new location is also established. The study paves the path for formal analysis of spatial nonstationarity on the basis of the GWR model. </jats:p>",

This case study demonstrated child and family outcomes related to two distinct treatment approaches for challenging behavior (prescriptive vs. contextualized) in a family raising a child with autism. The processes of behavior change directed either solely by the interventionist (prescriptive) and in collaboration with the family (contextualized) were compared. The family-directed intervention involved an assessment of family context (i.e., via discussion of daily routines) to inform the design of a behavioral support plan. Information gathered from the assessment of family routines was used to (a) help select specific behavioral strategies that were compatible with family characteristics and preferences, and (b) construct teaching methods that fit with the family's ongoing practices, routines, and interaction goals. More favorable results (i.e., reductions in challenging behavior, an increase in on-task behavior) were observed within the contextualized treatment-planning phase than were observed within the prescriptive treatment-planning phase. The procedures and results are discussed in relation to the emerging literature documenting the importance of contextualizing behavioral supports applied within family settings. </jats:p>",

Yet, during the 1980s, with support from the administration, the business community, and the innovations of a small group of dedicated urban planners, the CIP was restructured and hundreds of millions were systematically invested in public infrastructure. By the 1990s, most of the innovative changes of the 1980s seemed to be institutionalized, but there were ominous clouds on the horizon.</jats:p>",

The research that is described examined approaches to measuring the performance of the aviation system that have been adopted at a national level and in other states, as well as general principles for measurement of transportation system performance that emerged from a conference held in 1997 as part of the CTP update process. The range of considerations that arise in measuring the performance of the aviation system is discussed, and potential performance measures that have been proposed to address the requirements of the CTP framework are identified. Finally, issues that will need to be addressed in implementing any comprehensive set of performance measures for the aviation component of the transportation system are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The promotion of cities as tourism destinations is seen as a way to enable growth. This promotion involves the projection of selective imagery to specific target groups and often includes the physical reshaping of places to fit a promotable image. Attempts to understand these processes have often focused on one of two approaches: a global perspective stressing the consumptive nature of the tourist gaze and the resultant commodification of place at the local level; and a local perspective emphasising difference and uniqueness. In this paper the authors outline an investigation into the promotion of the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. They found that local place-promotional messages are a product both of global economic forces, which stimulate the growth of tourism, and of a local search for identity. The local ‘sense of place’, as constructed in place-promotional imagery, is constantly reviewed and reflects changing social relationships in place and through time. Christchurch, therefore, is not simply promoted in the image of tourism with, as it is often claimed, the inevitable commodification of place and destruction of meaning. Local claims to uniqueness are an expression of the current social relationships in place, which construct selective histories of the past based on ideas of the present that are linked to a search for identity both at the local and at the national level. </jats:p>",

The model consists of a set of equations in which ridership is predicted as a function of service and then service is predicted as a function of demand. In addition, the model accounts for interroute relationships by considering the competing or complementary nature of various routes within a transit system. The model proceeds through a series of iterative demand-and-supply computations to determine the appropriate service parameters and corresponding ridership levels for individual transit routes. The input variables include socioeconomic, demographic, and transit system data. The model has been implemented within a userfriendly, menu-driven software environment and has been applied on a test-case basis in the Volusia County area of Florida. The case-study results are very encouraging—the model predicted ridership on individual routes with an average absolute percent error of 24 percent despite the lack of high-quality data. Further refinements and validation tests of the model are planned for the future. </jats:p>",

In such cases, a post-operative neck-shaft angle of 110–120° is desirable as well as 0–15° anteversion. Standard techniques of planning a femoral osteotomy require accurate knowledge of proximal femoral deformity, but in cerebral palsy this may be difficult to measure owing to excessive anteversion and difficulties with positioning for radiographs. </jats:p><jats:p> We have developed and used a method that does not rely on preoperative radiographic measurements or the use of the femoral diaphysis for reference. Our method is focused on achieving the desired postoperative neck-shaft and anteversion angles mentioned above. The centre of the femoral neck is used as a reference and the chisel for a blade plate is applied 20–30° varus to this neutral axis. Osteotomy cuts are then made parallel to the chisel and perpendicular to the femoral shaft. The chisel is replaced with a 90° blade plate and the osteotomy is reduced, derotated and fixed to the femoral shaft. The final neck-shaft angle is therefore 90° plus 20–30°, ie the desirable 110–120°. This position is achieved without knowledge of the angle of the wedge of bone removed by the osteotomy. </jats:p><jats:p> This technique has been performed in 16 hips in 10 patients with cerebral palsy during one year. The final neck shaft angle fell within the desired range in 12 hips (75%). We have found this technique to be a simple and reliable means of achieving correction in patients in whom accurate preoperative estimate of the femoral neck shaft angle is not possible. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The applicability of the real-options approach to risk management to the metropolitan transportation planning process is described. The options approach to risk analysis brings to investment decisions the insight that there is an inherent value in option-creating actions (by resolving uncertainty, enabling flexibility, or uncovering new and relevant information) and a cost associated with exercising options (irreversible commitments of resources and time). The options approach moves investment decision making from simply choosing whether to build a project to a regime that considers a range of possible decisions, with the potential value of each decision measured in terms of its option-creation value and irreversible commitment cost. This approach is specifically designed to maximize the value of investments having the characteristics of transportation projects that are subject to uncertainty and risk in their outcomes. Also described is the new options approach; examples that illustrate the value of different kinds of options are given. By recognizing the value of improved information—and actions to obtain it—the options approach can give real impetus to improved planning methods. Because the analysis tools provided by the options approach make it possible to value the additional information that improved planning can provide, recommendations are provided on how—and in what parts of the metropolitan transportation planning process—the new tools of risk analysis can most appropriately be applied. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Utility cuts are made in city street pavements either to install new facilities or to maintain existing ones. Controlling the quality of pavement restoration is a challenge because of the large number of cuts made annually. Although utility companies restore the pavement sections after the cuts according to available guidelines, it is often observed that the pavement within and adjacent to the cuts fails prematurely. The resulting condition has a direct influence on pavement integrity and life, maintenance cost, aesthetic value, and safety of motorists. Because existing pavement management systems do not consider the effect of utility cuts on pavement performance, municipalities such as the city of Cincinnati are currently seeking specific guidelines in the form of a utility cut management system (UCMS). The results of a study on the development of a UCMS are reported in this paper. The UCMS is a synthesis of field evaluation procedures and cost management and policy issues related to street pavement sections affected by utility cuts. The goals of the UCMS are to ( a) identify the factors most useful for evaluating performance of utility cuts; ( b) differentiate between the quality of restoration by different utilities or subcontractors; ( c) address issues related to planning, investments, and maintenance activities; and ( d) be compatible with existing pavement management systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent work on ‘collaborative planning’ has concentrated on applying Habermas's work on communicative action to the realm of urban and regional governance. This work has its parallels in other disciplines, notably geography, where institutional capacity building has been considered as part of local systems of governance. Both bodies of work are premised to a degree on the rationality of communication. Habermas contrasted his ideas on the possibilities for communicative action with the widespread presence of ‘strategic behaviour’ in social relations. The dual nature of governance as both an institutional and a political activity means that consideration of such strategic forms of behaviour is essential to a deeper understanding of the nature of collaborative and associative forms of governance and their outcomes. What social scientists refer to as ‘teleological/strategic action’, ‘normatively regulated action’, and ‘dramaturgical action’ together with communicative action are all integral to collaborative governance. In this paper, we consider examples of the manner in which institutional capacity has been exercised in attempts to attract a major inward investment project into the United Kingdom. The example illustrates the range of social actions that are present beneath the surface of collaborative and associative governance. More specifically, our example highlights the structuring of institutional and organisational interactions through the strategic behaviour of a dominant local organisation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Australian rail freight operations, railway track maintenance makes up between 25 and 35 percent of total train operating costs. Models have shown that track maintenance costs can be reduced by 5 to 10 percent through improved planning. The Track Maintenance Planning Model (TMPM) has been developed to deal with the track maintenance planning function in the medium to long term. In contrast to traditional models, which mainly use expert systems, TMPM simulates the impacts of railway track conditions and related maintenance work by using an existing track degradation model. Track condition data from that model are used to determine whether safety-related speed restrictions are needed and what immediate maintenance work may be required for safe train operation. TMPM outputs the net present value of the financial benefits of undertaking a given maintenance strategy compared with a base-case maintenance scenario. This approach has an advantage over current models in investigating what-if scenarios. The track engineer can assess the possible benefits of reduced operating costs from upgrading track infrastructure or from improving maintenance equipment. Track maintenance and train operating costs also can be simulated over time. The results of applying the model to a test track section using several different maintenance strategies are presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the summer and autumn of 1998, the National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board (TPB) sponsored an independent study by a team led by ICF Kaiser (now ICF Consulting) to assess its public involvement program for transportation planning carried out in the Washington, D.C., region. The Washington region’s metropolitan planning organization was one of the first to commission an assessment of its public involvement efforts as required under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. The purpose was to provide an overall assessment of TPB’s public involvement program and recommend options for improvement. The assessment was conducted in three phases. The first phase was to review public involvement efforts in the Washington region and, for comparative purposes, other selected metropolitan regions across the United States. The second phase was to interview knowledgeable stakeholders on public involvement in the Washington region. The final phase was to prepare a report presenting findings and recommendations to the TPB based on the efforts from the first two phases. The final report was organized under the umbrella of four overarching themes: ( a) strengthen outreach to stakeholders and the public; ( b) enhance access to information; ( c) improve the public’s understanding of TPB responsibilities; and ( d) either discontinue or enhance the citizens’ advisory committee. Although the first three themes are familiar to strengthening many public involvement programs, the fourth is somewhat new and surprising, especially given the prevalence of such bodies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new Australian bridge design traffic loading standard for design and construction of Australian bridges was developed. The loading model is expected to set the bridge design standard for the next 25 years. This is an important visionary task, an investment for future improvements in transport efficiency, and an investment for our grandchildren, which was motivated by the increased transport efficiency that this generation has been able to achieve because of the investment of our grandparents. The challenge is to appropriately and effectively provide for the future in a manner that is consistent with the potential benefits and costs. The complexities of a range of traffic and vehicle loading scenarios, vehicle loading practices and enforcement, an infinite variety of bridge spans and forms of construction, and future unknown vehicle and bridge technologies are combined to develop, in collaboration with AUSTROADS and other interested bodies, a recommended bridge design load. The load model represents a substantial increase from the current design load to be one of the heaviest in the world. The load model’s features include a moving load model (M1600) that forms the basis for the application of dynamic load allowances, centrifugal and braking forces, and a stationary load model (S1600). The load model is designed to represent the traffic of the future and hence ensure the future productivity of Australia’s road transport industry. It is a bridge engineering contribution to Australia’s international competitiveness. </jats:p>",

By adaptive stochastic path planning and control (ASPPC), i.e. by incorporating the available a priori and statistical information on the unknown model parameters of the dynamic system and its working environment into the off‐line and on‐line control process by means of stochastic optimization methods, the deviation between the actual and prescribed trajectory can be reduced to a large extent.</jats:p>",

This merging of technologies is termed magnetic source (MS) imaging. The present study was undertaken to assess the role of MS imaging for the guidance of presurgical planning and intraoperative neurosurgical technique used in patients with intracranial mass lesions.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic> Twenty-six patients with intracranial mass lesions underwent a medical evaluation consisting of MS imaging, a clinical history, a neurological examination, and assessment with the Karnofsky Performance Scale. Magnetic source imaging was used to locate the somatosensory cortex in 25 patients, the visual cortex in six, and the auditory cortex in four. The distance between the lesion and the functional cortex was determined for each patient.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">Twenty-one patients underwent a neurosurgical procedure. As a surgical adjunct, a frameless stereotactic navigational system was used in 17 cases and a standard stereotactic apparatus in four cases. Because of the results of their MS imaging examination, two patients were not offered surgery, four underwent a stereotactic biopsy procedure, 10 were treated with a subtotal surgical resection, and seven were treated with complete surgical resection. One patient deteriorated before a procedure could be scheduled and, therefore, was not offered surgery, and two patients were offered surgery but declined. Three patients experienced surgery-related complications.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> Magnetic source imaging is an important noninvasive neurodiagnostic tool that provides critical information regarding the spatial relationship of a brain lesion to functional cortex. By providing this information, MS imaging facilitates a minimum-risk management strategy and helps guide operative neurosurgical technique in patients with intracranial mass lesions.</jats:p>",

Although this is generally recognized, the integration of life-cycle cost analysis with bridge reliability analysis has been very limited. Moreover, this has been formulated and illustrated only for individual bridges. A framework for optimal network-level bridge maintenance planning based on minimum expected cost is presented. The goal is the minimization of the expected maintenance cost of a bridge stock with maintenance of the lifetime reliability of each bridge above an acceptable (target) level. The approach is illustrated for a stock of realistic highway bridges. Individual bridges in this stock have different ages, and their reliabilities are time dependent. The framework offers a rational basis for optimizing the resource allocation for management of a stock of gradually deteriorating bridges based on balancing life-cycle maintenance cost and lifetime reliability. This has important practical implications in the development of the optimal management strategy for the bridge stock. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Papua New Guinea (PNG) has an incredible variety of land and marine ecosystems, including many components of biodiversity that are unique in the world. PNG's land mass constitutes less than one percent of the world's land area, yet estimates suggest that the country has more than 5% of the world's biodiversity. PNG has been recognized therefore as an important region for biodiversity conservation (see Alcorn 1993; Beehler 1993 and references within). Recently, Conservation International (CI) has recognized PNG as one of the small number of critical tropical forest areas for conservation efforts. That priority reflects not just PNG's unique biodiversity but also the fact that sustainable use of PNG's natural resources has become an important issue, particularly relating to its large mineral deposits, oil and natural gas reserves, agricultural potential, and forestry production potential. CI's perspective highlights important principles of conservation priority. PNG, like the other tropical wilderness areas on its priority list, is regarded as an opportunity for effective conservation at relatively low cost, given that these wilderness regions are still largely intact and have low human population density. In our view, realizing such opportunities requires good planning. Biodiversity conservation in PNG can imply low realized opportunity costs or quite high realized opportunity costs, depending on whether biodiversity planning is used to find a balance among society's competing needs through tradeoffs. PNG is a region worthy of urgent conservation planning attention because potential high net benefits for society may be needlessly foreclosed through inefficient planning that does not address conflicts among various needs of society. The risk of losing those potential net benefits is a strong argument for conservation investment in PNG.</jats:p>"

In the course of that work, 56 communities were surveyed about their utilization and opinions of local health systems. This database allows the following generalizations to be made about rural Northwest communities: (1) People think highly of their local hospitals, physicians and other key components of the acute medical care system and want their hospitals to remain open. Older respondents are more satisfied than younger respondents; (2) the typical hospital market share is 36 percent, the typical physician market share is 50 percent (3) satisfaction with discrete, well‐funded services such as pharmacy, ambulance and dentistry is quite high, whereas satisfaction with mental health and substance abuse treatment is significantly lower; (4) the most commonly cited serious problems in surveyed communities were “too few physicians or‐services” and “care is too expensive”; and (5) there is great variation between communities in both satisfaction and utilization.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At metropolitan planning organizations such as the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA), planning investments to support pedestrian trips for a large and diverse metropolitan area would be an intractable challenge without an open, coordinated, and cooperative approach and a strong information foundation. To address this challenge, NJTPA has adopted an innovative approach using regional analysis and priority setting to guide planning activity for a very local scale. The design and initial applications of this approach are described. Areas with proximity and connectivity features supporting pedestrian activity were identified using data available at the regional level. The data were analyzed within a pedestrian potential index (PPI) comprising four key indicators: population densities, employment densities, land use mix, and street network density, all analyzed at the census tract level. Thresholds were set to begin to find priority areas in which investment in pedestrian strategies would be more likely to generate a high return in terms of walking trips generated. The analysis also allows local planners to understand how their communities compare in relative levels of density, land use mix, and network connectivity. This information can help planners identify areas for planning activities that would address these factors and encourage walking trips. With the first results from application of the PPI, NJTPA has solicited feedback from state and local planning partners. With subsequent refinement, this analysis will be finalized for the region and incorporated in the next update of the NJTPA Regional Transportation Plan. </jats:p>",
