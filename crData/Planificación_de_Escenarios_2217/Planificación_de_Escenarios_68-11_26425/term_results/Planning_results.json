Planning for the early years should encourage development of technical proficiency. Later planning can then be directed either toward development of a highly qualified specialist or toward development of an administrator.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>During the last decade two factors have tended to emphasize the importance of career planning for engineers. The first of these is the growing dependence of companies upon engineering and research for economic success. The second is the shortage of engineering talent. These two factors make it imperative that the talent of each engineer be developed and used in an optimum manner optimum from the standpoint of both the individual and the company. The aims and goals of both the individual and the company must be compatible. Successful career planning strives to satisfy the need and desires of both.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To develop and use staff in an optimum manner, career planning is necessary. Career planning may be thought of as the providing of an environment conducive to the growth of an individual, and with his growth, the growth of the company. Provision of this environment the challenges, training, responsibilities, recognition and reward is the duty of the career planners. Other than to provide this environment and to provide motivation through recognition and reward, there is little the career planners can do to aid the development of an individual. The responsibility for this development rests solely on that individual. He alone can provide the necessary motivation and effort for his own growth. These two aspects then, career planning and self development, go hand in hand, and each is equally important in development of a successful career.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Helpful advice in planning the career of the young engineer has been given by Sands and Brown. Danielson has given insight into how engineers view themselves and their careers in his \"Characteristics of Engineers and Scientists\". This insight was gained through interviews with scientists and engineers and thus is of considerable value to the career planner. Much has been written about preparing the engineer to manage. Miller has discussed the training of engineers for management and Wilson has discussed the selection of candidates for management from the engineering ranks. From the viewpoint of aiding self-development of an engineer Douma points out what management expects of an engineer and suggests methods for achieving these expectations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Many of the thoughts given in the sections to follow can be found in these cited references. In addition, I have drawn heavily on the thoughts of colleagues in my own and in other companies. To them must go the credit for most of the ideas that will be discussed. These ideas are directed specifically toward career planning in an exploration and production organization of large to medium size. However, many of the ideas will apply to career planning in any organization.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The recent literature on the development of such models is reviewed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most issues in foreign affairs can only be resolved by intuitive judgments based on knowledge and experience. Some problems, however, are susceptible of more rational, objective treatment, and application of such methods can only be helpful. New methods, including systems analysis and new mathematical techniques, can be usefully employed, in the areas of prediction, factor analysis, and what might be described as prescriptive analysis, in search of the optimum course. Such methods help to sort out the interacting variables with which foreign affairs is replete. Application of these methods will not be easy, partly because of the subject's complexity, partly because of practitioners' resistance to such innovations. In the Planning-Programming-Budgeting System (PPBS), a useful beginning has been made. Its application, however, to the traditional diplomatic functions— representation, negotiation—will take time and experimentation. State Department foreign affairs planners now direct their work toward analysis of special problems and country studies. In addition, planners fulfill a limited adversary role, offering \"alternatives\" to recommendations before the decision-makers. These functions can all be strengthened. PPBS should also be pursued, despite very real limitations on its full application. Additionally, changes are needed in organization, method, personnel, and, particularly, commitment if planning is to meet the needs of the new diplomacy. </jats:p>",

In addition, the girls expressed more certainty about their educational plans at the conclusion of the course than at its outset and had lowered their expected life earnings. The girls also scored higher than the boys on the Vocational Maturity scale of the Vocational Development Inventory both before and after the experiment.</jats:p>",
