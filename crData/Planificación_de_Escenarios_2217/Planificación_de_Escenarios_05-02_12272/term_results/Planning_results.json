Based on legislation passed in 1968 and 1970, the federal government provided financial assistance for the construction of thirteen new towns around the country. Although architects and planners situated most of these new communities just outside of major metropolitan areas, Soul City was designed to be the only “free-standing” new town. Conceived by Floyd B. McKissick, the former national director of the Congress on Racial Equality, as an example of black capitalism, the daring experiment struggled from the outset. Beset throughout its brief existence by financial problems, plagued by scandal, and hounded by political enemies, Soul City failed to attract the capital and population necessary to survive. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Scenario-based investigations of possible futures have been used since the middle of the 20th century to help decisionmakers cope with alternative courses of action and elements of uncertainty. Since the early 1970s, they have been increasingly used for landscape planning. Each scenario-based study is founded on assumptions of possible change. Often these beliefs are only implicit among scenario creators and scenario users. I discuss the beliefs and perceptions about the future of scenario creators and scenario users, and argue that they should be explicitly addressed before an investigation is undertaken in order to avoid methodological biases in the creation of the scenarios and misunderstanding of the results. As part of this discussion, the basic features of a scenario-based study are reviewed, and applications to landscape and environmental planning are considered, with examples drawn from two studies that were focused on the same concerns and in the same region but which employed different kinds of scenarios. </jats:p>",

The label thus may have lost any clear-cut meaning due to the divergent perceptions and agendas of organizations using the term. Some appear to have adopted it as a form of political cover, whether for antigrowth or antiregulation positions. In other cases, the principles seem to be reformulated in response to the realities of local planning. This article first reviews smart growth statements from ten national organizations with divergent land use agendas. Despite their differing agendas, their broad conceptual definitions are found to converge. Turning to implementation efforts, the article then reviews forty-nine documents from two states: Georgia and Kentucky. The documents exhibit extreme variety in the meanings ascribed to smart growth. Moreover, few of the plans and policies incorporate multiple interventions, which is a key dimension of the smart growth approach as described by the national groups. </jats:p>",

Both the general public and nonprofit organizations have been willing to spend billions of dollars on land preservation because of a perception that traditional land use planning and regulation are not successfully accommodating growth or protecting valuable natural resources. The literature on smart growth has largely overlooked the potential of land preservation to curb sprawl and to foster livable communities. The literature on land preservation has focused on the mechanics of conservation easements and land purchases rather than on how land preservation can fit in the comprehensive planning process to achieve community smart growth goals. More research needs to be done on the strategic use of land preservation in shaping and directing growth as part of a comprehensive planning effort. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sustainable housing has been a major topic of national policy in the Netherlands for fifteen years. The author argues that sustainable housing is a badly defined concept, both in scientific literature and in policy documents. The Dutch government has never indicated how the sustainability of housing could be measured, or realized a zero measurement, which would enable researchers to evaluate environmental policies to promote sustainable housing properly. A narrow definition of sustainability is adopted, whereby the author concentrates on the ecological dimensions of the concept of ‘sustainability’: the environmental impact on the greenhouse effect; the quality of air, water, and soil; noise nuisance; stench; the stock of nonrenewable materials; and biodiversity. An overview of ways in which the sustainability of housing can be measured is given and the use of a multivariate yardstick advocated. A set of recommendations is presented for politicians and public officials about the way in which sustainable housing can be promoted, and a research agenda on sustainability in housing presented. The author concludes by pointing out the analogy between the Dutch government's policy to promote sustainable housing and the story of the emperor's new clothes. The moral is that it is better to acknowledge that we do not know essential things about sustainable housing than simply to ‘believe’ in it. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the issue of the deterioration of the inner ring suburbs has only recently received significant consideration by urban scholars and policy makers. In this article, the authors review the literature on metropolitan formation and the smart growth movement to critically assess how well it characterizes and explains the evolution of inner ring suburbs, as well as to emphasize the role that inner ring suburbs can play in metropolitan smart growth strategies. They next characterize the literature specifically focused on inner ring suburbs in terms of what it has to offer on defining such areas. After identifying the gaps in the literature, the authors offer a methodology for accurately defining inner ring suburbs and conclude with a discussion of policy for effectively addressing the socioeconomic needs of the inner ring suburbs within the context of metropolitan smart growth. </jats:p>",

The chances of successful governance increase when governance arrangements are better tuned to the environment that it tries to change. However, a better fit leaves less room for change. Governance arrangements supporting sustainable development are more prone to failure, as they aim at changing that environment. Radical institutional change is at the core of sustainable development, but without the help of external factors, such as major crises like the oil crisis in the 1970s, the sense of urgency for such radical change is lacking, and incremental change seems to be the only road available. The authors explore how governance arrangements deal with this recurring barrier to institutional change. Their conclusion is that the more governance arrangements respect the institutional context in which they are used, the higher their quality. To speed up the incremental track, the design of governance arrangements should include positive incentives for actors to cooperate.</jats:p>",

This article uses the plans of Harland Bartholomew and Robert Moses to illustrate these competing visions of the freeway and to assess the implications of these visions on the development of the freeway and its long-term influence on our cities. The traffic-service vision of the engineers emerged victorious through the creation of the interstate highway system, but this victory has carried with it a high price for many American cities. </jats:p>",

Changes in urban form have implications for the environmental sustainability, integration and cohesion, and longer term quality of life in and around cities. Britain has a comprehensive planning system with a strong rhetoric of policies towards these goals. In this paper the authors draw on evidence from recent research, primarily in central Scotland, to assess how far planning actually does make a difference to urban form rather than simply passively responding to demand. They consider some of the systematic tendencies in decentralised planning decisionmaking, some selected evidence of development outcomes, and some insights from major development case studies. The conclusions highlight the differential influence of planning between different development sectors and the obstacles to achieving a more sustainable pattern. </jats:p>",

The models are estimated with the aid of data from Hong Kong during the period 1980–2002—a total of twenty-three yearly observations. It is hoped that empirical results will shed light on the adjustment mechanism of the local office market. In line with the existing literature, the author shows that, on the one hand, office rent is positively related to office employment, but inversely related to office stock. On the other hand, the demand for office space is inversely related to rent, but positively related to office employment. Moreover, the elasticity of space consumption with respect to rent is estimated to be inelastic. Historical simulations of the model are performed, and it is suggested that the equations simulate reasonably well as indicated by Theil's inequality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of exploring and monitoring housing-market fundamentals (prices, dwelling features, area density, residents, and so on) on a macrolocational level relates to both public and private sector policymaking. Housing market segmentation (that is, the emergence of housing submarkets), a concept with increasing relevance, is defined as the differentiation of housing in terms of the income and preferences of the residents and in terms of administrative circumstances. In order to capture such segmentation empirically, the author applies a fairly new and emerging technique known as the ‘self-organising’ map (SOM), or ‘Kohonen map’. The SOM is a type of (artificial) neural network—a nonlinear and flexible (that is, nonparametric or semiparametric) regression and ‘machine learning’ technique. By utilising the ability of the SOM to visualise patterns, one can analyse various dimensions within the variation of the dataset. Segmentation may then be detected depending on the resulting patterns across the map layers, each of which represents the data variation for one input variable. Utilising an inductive modelling strategy, the author runs cross-sectional and nationwide data on the owner-occupied housing markets of Finland (documentation presented elsewhere), the Netherlands, and Hungary with the SOM technique. On the basis of the resulting configurations certain regularities (similarities and differences) across the three national contexts are identified. In all three cases the segments are determined by physical and institutional differences between the housing bundles and localities. The exercise demonstrates how the inductive SOM-based approach is well-suited for illustrating the contextual factors that determine housing market structure. </jats:p>",

The study is based on a corpus of eight hayat houses designed in the classic Ottoman style in the 18th and 19th centuries in Sarajevo. In this paper, the emphasis is on the generation of new houses. The informal grammar does not explain the designs in detail but rather generates new house designs by transferring some knowledge embedded in original designs. The generation of a new house type within the grammar proceeds in three steps: (1) primitive hayat house generation, (2) subhouse generation, and (3) house variations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 2003 the European Commission introduced the EC Directive on the energy performance of buildings in recognition of the importance of energy savings in the urban housing stock. The Directive gives the member states freedom to design the different elements in practice. The energy certificate for existing buildings demanded by the EC Directive can be used as a communicative instrument, or combined with economic or regulatory principles. The authors discuss the anticipated efficiency and effectiveness of different policy approaches in the application of the EC energy certificate for the urban housing stock. They argue that, although energy certificates as a communication instrument for household appliances have appeared to be relatively successful, the different nature of the building sector may mean that their effectiveness here will be rather limited. The combination of energy certificates with tax schemes seems promising, but will have to be coupled with general income taxes or in housing-related taxes in order to prevent regressive social effects. Combination of the energy certificate with subsidies should be limited, because of the ‘free-rider effect’, and subsidies should only cover innovative products at the beginning of their ‘learning curve’. Effective results can probably be expected from the introduction of regulations combined with energy-certificate standards, but this requires a rather drastic approach and needs time to receive sufficient commitment, as has been the case for new buildings where there has been a gradual development of energy regulations over the last thirty years. However, an introduction of energy standards for the existing urban housing stock through the EC energy certificate offers great potential in the realisation of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> reductions. The introduction of an energy standard, by means of the energy certificate in combination with progressive taxes or other economic measures to reward better and punish worse energy-performance levels, seems an interesting approach that needs further research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Assumptions about the effects of various land-use characteristics on travel patterns have found their way into diverse concepts of planning and design, such as the compact city and neighbourhood-design principles. In general, these concepts aim at reducing travel distances and reducing car-travel speed, as it is assumed that as travel distances are shorter, individuals will travel less, and the relative competitive position of slower modes is increased. Although some literature supports the link between land use and travel behaviour, for the greater part limited effects have been concluded, whereas in others it has been concluded that there is virtually no effect. We argue that the effects fall short of the expectations advocated by the land-use concepts, because of shortcomings behind assumptions concerning the relationships between land use and travel behaviour. We argue that utility-based and activity-based theories add some extra insights. Various behavioural responses in terms of travel-time changes are possible, depending on whether travel time is minimised, benefits maximised, or activity patterns optimised. It is concluded that the contribution of compact urban designs to reduction on travel may not be as straightforward as is suggested by their advocates. In any case, a simplified distance-oriented and trip-oriented approach is unable to examine complex behaviour, and a broader framework of space and time is needed. </jats:p>",

We investigate a new model and solution technique that is designed to aid in optimizing the process of assigning sailors to jobs. This procedure attempts to achieve an increased level of sailor satisfaction by providing a list of possible jobs from which a sailor may choose. We show that the optimal partition provided by an interior-point algorithm is particularly useful when designing the job lists. This follows because a strictly complementary solution to the linear programming relaxation observes all possible optimal solutions to the original binary problem. The techniques developed rely on a continuous parametric analysis, and we show that the parameterization provides meaningful information about the structure of the optimal assignments. </jats:p>",

In today's business environment, proper well design and flawless execution are essential as our investments increasingly rely on fewer, more complex, very large volume wells. To achieve success, ExxonMobil has always treated drilling as a core business. This means we value this area of expertise and hire, train, and retain this job skill to contribute to the success of what we do to provide value for our shareholders. We focus on a disciplined approach to drilling and completion investments, full leveraging of our global knowledge, development and deployment of people, technical solutions that balance minimum cost/appropriate risk and full-life-cycle capability, and flawless execution.</jats:p>",

I concentrate on eurhythmics, a practice that emerged in Geneva in the late 19th century and early 20th century as an effort to improve musical appreciation through rhythmic movement. Drawing on work in cultural and architectural theory, I argue that the historical and cultural geographies of eurhythmics can best be apprehended diagrammatically. Specifically, I situate eurhythmics in diagrammatic relation to the corporeal kinaesthetics of rhythmic movement, to practices of social and cultural transformation, and to architectures of performative potential. By apprehending the geographies of eurhythmics in this way, I not only work to demonstrate that nonrepresentational styles of thinking and working multiply rather than undermine the field of power in which geographers move, but also present a sense of how these powers can become implicated in the very practice and performance of geographical research. </jats:p>",

As such, I continue traditions of writing in cultural geography exemplified by David Bell and Gill Valentine's [1997 Consuming Geographies (Routledge, London)] focus on connecting cultures of food and place, Jon May's (1996a, “‘A little taste of something more exotic’” Geography81 57–64; 1996b, “Globalization and the politics of place” Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, New Series21 194–215) nuanced explorations of ‘exotic’ eating in North London, and by Ian Cook, Phil Crang, and Mark Thorpe's [1999, “Eating into Britishness”, in Practising Identities Eds S Roseneil, J Seymour (Macmillan, London) pp 223–248] reflections on British culinary imaginaries and their ‘multicultural’ inscriptions. Specifically, this paper is concerned with ways that conceptions of ethnicity delineate and divide everyday spaces: how meanings of Britishness and Australianness, based in the primacy of ‘tradition’, ‘the West’, and Anglo-Celtic belongings, permeate everyday life in London and Sydney and shape their food cultures. The paper traces moments in the culinary biographies of two women, one English and one Australian of British descent, living in London and Sydney, respectively, and close to shopping streets known for the diversity of their ‘ethnic’ communities. The women's narratives are instructive in their continuities, as much as in their disjunctions. The argument follows some of these, including unexpected engagements with ‘Asia’ and ‘Europe’ and ‘cosmopolitan identity’. Resonances from these engagements contribute to a more complex and ambivalent sense of belonging than first supposed. This is still the region of ‘mainstream’, ‘Anglo’-identity, yet it is one marked by constant spatial redefinition and by occasional porosity of boundary.</jats:p>",

Although in theory a common set of ideas underpins neoliberal ideology and policy, in practice the way in which neoliberal projects are materialized in specific locations is differentiated, segmented, and highly uneven. Reflecting this, neoliberalism appears to have exacerbated regional differences in Mexico. An emphasis on topography draws attention to the political–economic processes that produce such difference. This destabilizes commonsensical representations of regional difference in Mexico, which pit a modern, industrialized, and increasingly democratic North against an impoverished, traditional, and authoritarian South. Furthermore, drawing analytical linkages across place allows the production of situated political responses to neoliberalism to be brought into coalition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite an increasing interest in the geographies of childhood, geographical research has given little attention to issues concerning young people from traditionally semi-nomadic groups, such as Gypsies and other Travellers. In this paper I explore the discursive construction of Traveller childhood within contemporary Britain, with an emphasis on the ways in which state educational discourse constructs young Travellers as needing greater involvement with the ‘mainstream’ education system. I draw on a range of sources, including documents, participant observation, and interviews with practitioners in Traveller education conducted between 1998 and 2001. I argue that contemporary discourse often continues to reflect long-standing notions of cultural disadvantage and deficit which have often been applied to Travellers, although more subtly expressed than in the past. I also argue that children's rights discourses are often employed to construct Traveller parents as obstacles to their children's development and well-being, and that these discourses can be used to legitimise various exertions of power (such as legal measures to prosecute parents). The evidence of the research highlights the need for more nuanced, empirically informed theorisations of the interface between Traveller children and state institutions than has generally been the case to date. </jats:p>",

Der vorliegende Artikel zeigt auf, inwiefern und mit welchen Methoden dieses Ziel erreicht wurde. Dabei werden folgende Fragestellungen diskutiert: ▪ Welche Methoden der Umweltplanung wurden bei der Organisation der Ski WM 2003 angewandt ? ▪ Welche Landschaftsveränderungen wurden durch die WM 2003 verursacht? ▪ Welche Teilaspekte der Umweltplanung bewährten sich und welche Optimierungen wären noch möglich?

An important goal was to minimize encroachments on nature and the landscape, and to realize the project in a sustainable way. This article describes to what extent and by which methods the goals were attained. The following questions are discussed: ▪ What environmental planning methods were used by the WSC 2003 organisers? ▪ What landscape changes were caused by the WSC 2003? ▪ Which aspects of the environmental planning were satisfying, and what improvements could be made in future projects?</jats:p>",

These reforms have deeply affected the lives of indigenous peoples and their relationship with extralocal actors. Today, in the Ecuadorian Amazon, some indigenous peoples participate in oil-extraction negotiations, tourism, and intensive cattle ranching and agriculture as part of increased market integration. In the midst of these changes, questions about what ‘indigeneity’ means, both in integrating into and in resisting neoliberal reforms, are increasingly important for understanding social justice and environmental conservation issues in the Amazon region. The author explores how engagement with neoliberal practices and ways of knowing the world has opened up spaces for questioning fixed notions of indigenous identities and their role in representing, imagining, and developing indigenous alliances and rights claims in the Ecuadorian Amazon. </jats:p>",

Noir has been drawn, often usefully but also unfortunately, away from its referents, from the terrain that it most directly summons but also from the spaces in which its contradictions are most apparent. Moving from a discussion of the distractions of Chinatown to contextual themes such as mobility and ruin, the paper links noir criticism and noir texts with broader debates in postwar urbanism and modernism. As just part of these discourses, noir not only is irreducible to certain essences, but can potentially perform the opposite role, challenging conventions of urban understanding and practice. The result would be a more detailed and subtle account of modernism's American geographies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Companies spend millions of dollars on advertising to boost a brand's image and simultaneously spend millions of dollars on promotion that many believe calls attention to price and erodes brand equity. We believe this paradoxical situation exists because both advertising and promotion are necessary to compete effectively in dynamic markets. Consequently, brand managers need to account for interactions between marketing activities and interactions among competing brands. By recognizing interaction effects between activities, managers can consider interactivity trade-offs in planning the marketing-mix strategies. On the other hand, by recognizing interactions with competitors, managers can incorporate strategic foresight in their planning, which requires them to look forward and reason backward in making optimal decisions. Looking forward means that each brand manager anticipates how other competing brands are likely to make future decisions, and then by reasoning backward deduces one's own optimal decisions in response to the best decisions to be made by all other brands. The joint consideration of interaction effects and strategic foresight in planning marketing-mix strategies is a challenging and unsolved marketing problem, which motivates this paper. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper investigates the problem of planning marketing mix in dynamic competitive markets. We extend the Lanchester model by incorporating interaction effects, constructing the marketing-mix algorithm that yields marketing-mix plans with strategic foresight, and developing the continuous-discrete estimation method to calibrate dynamic models of oligopoly using market data. Both the marketing-mix algorithm and the estimation method are general, so they can be applied to any other alternative model specifications for dynamic oligopoly markets. Thus, this dual methodology augments the decision-making toolkit of managers, empowering them to tackle realistic marketing problems in dynamic oligopoly markets. </jats:p><jats:p> We illustrate the application of this dual methodology by studying the dynamic Lanchester competition across five brands in the detergents market, where each brand uses advertising and promotion to influence its own market share and the shares of competing brands. Empirically, we find that advertising and promotion not only affect the brand shares (own and competitors') but also exert interaction effects, i.e., each activity amplifies or attenuates the effectiveness of the other activity. Normatively, we find that large brands underadvertise and overspend on promotion, while small brands underadvertise and underpromote. Finally, comparative statics reveal managerial insights into how a specific brand should respond optimally to the changes in a competing brand's situation; more generally, we find evidence that competitive responsiveness is asymmetric. </jats:p>",

A series of logistic and ordinary least squares regression models are used to analyze the effect of individual demographic and socioeconomic characteristics on the likelihood of participation in community development.

Like other Latin American states, Bolivia has enacted sweeping neoliberal reforms during the past two decades, including privatization of public sector industries, reduction of state services, and administrative decentralization. These reforms have been accompanied by constitutional reforms that recognized certain resource and political rights on the part of Bolivia's indigenous and campesino peoples. This paper examines the reregulation and rescaling of rural water management in Bolivia, and associated processes of mobilization on the part of peasant irrigators aimed at countering state reforms. Although traditional resource rights of peasant irrigators are strengthened by cultural aspects of constitutional reforms, rural livelihoods are undermined by economic liberalization. The paper examines the implications and contradictions of neoliberal reforms for rural water management in highland Bolivia. These processes are illustrated through a brief analysis of current organizational efforts on the part of peasant irrigators. </jats:p>",

This appeal cannot be attributed to Peronist mass politics alone; rather, the regime's ideal of macro-level national planning also reinforced pre-existing practices of social activism in Argentine local communities.</jats:p>",

It assesses the impact of changes in land use and irrigation water availability on the distribution of crop water consumption in space and time, as well as on the groundwater resources. A distributed, integrated surface water-groundwater simulation system was implemented and applied to the study area. The system is based on the coupling of a conceptual vadose zone model with the groundwater model MODFLOW. To assess the impact of land use and irrigation water availability on water deficit for crops as well as on groundwater system in the area, a number of management scenarios were identified and compared with a base scenario, reflecting the present conditions. Changes in land use may alter significantly both total crop water requirement and aquifer recharge. Water supply is sufficient to meet demand under present conditions and, from the crop water use viewpoint, a reduction of water availability has a positive effect on the overall irrigation system efficiency; however, evapotranspiration deficit increases, concentrated in July and August, when it may be critical for maize crops.</jats:p>",

He then illustrates how, both through privatization and through transnationalization, the mining sector has become a key element for future development opportunities. This discussion is then contextualised by an examination of how mining activities are affecting land-tenure patterns and livelihoods in the Cajamarca region of Peru. In particular, drawing upon case-study research, the author evaluates how Minera Yanacocha's transnational gold-mining operations are transforming land-tenure institutions, land values, and the spatial distribution of land-use patterns throughout the region. In addition, he evaluates how livelihoods are being transformed in response to Minera Yanacocha's activities through an examination of changing household access to natural, human, social, and economic resources. </jats:p>",

Planning practice in food processing industries is often not able to make the most of the available flexibility in the production processes, and our analysis shows that existing production planning approaches, ERP systems, and advanced planning systems can only partly resolve this. We propose a planning framework that can help to analyze the flexibility of the planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Surface manufacturing is a process of adding material to or removing material from the surfaces of a part. Spray painting, spray forming, rapid tooling, spray coating, and polishing are some of the typical applications of surface manufacturing, where industrial robots are usually used. Tool planning for industrial robots in surface manufacturing is a challenging research topic. Typical teaching methods are not affordable any more because products are subject to a shorter product life, frequent design changes, small lot sizes, and small in-process inventory restrictions. An automatic tool trajectory planning process is hence desirable for tool trajectory planning of industrial robots. Based on the computer-aided design model of a part, the tool model, task constraints, and optimization criteria, a general framework of optimal tool trajectory planning in surface manufacturing is developed. Optimal tool trajectories are generated by approximately solving a multiobjective optimization problem. To test if the generated trajectory satisfies the given constraints, a trajectory verification model is developed. Simulations are performed to determine if the given constraints are satisfied. Simulation results show that the optimal tool trajectory planning framework can be applied to generate trajectories for a variety of applications in surface manufacturing. This general framework can also be extended to other applications such as dimensional inspection and demining.</jats:p>",

Mosque opponents are both limited and empowered by this discourse of nationalism. The official recognition of Australia's multicultural composition and the shift in rhetoric on national identity have provided a counterideology to the still hegemonic constructions of an Anglo-Celtic Australia. Muslim associations and their supporters have drawn on these symbolic tools in their arguments with planning-consent authorities, and in other local political forums. Through the repetition of their claims to local and national citizenship, and by evoking the rhetoric of multiculturalism, they challenged the hegemony of Anglo-Celtic culture.

During the successive administrations of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso (1995–2003), public enterprises were privatized, import tariffs were slashed, regional free-trade markets were established, and fiscal discipline was prioritized in an attempt to control a massive public debt. As his first term progressed, however, Cardoso was forced to respond to the insistent popular demand for reform of the country's inequitable land-tenure structure. The issue became increasingly visible in the 1990s because of the strength of a grassroots social movement, the Movement of Landless Workers (MST). In response to the demands for agrarian reform, the government offered its support for an essentially neoliberal, market-based alternative to state-led distribution—an alternative favored by official development organizations throughout the Third World at this time. In this paper, I argue that the support for a market-led agrarian reform privileged the agrarian elite in Brazil and delegitimated the MST's struggle, not only because it reinforced the elite's claim to land but also because it legitimated the elite's particular interpretation of productivity and property rights. The claims put forward both by the agrarian elite and by the MST members in the southern state of Santa Catarina derive from what can usefully be considered ‘agrarian moral economies’. </jats:p>",

However, although this reevaluation of ethnic differences has proved to be a useful defence of the presence of ethnic minorities, the types of contributions and their significance have been left unexplored. In this paper I closely examine one such contribution, a Chinese pagoda, which was given to the City of Birmingham by an ethnic entrepreneur. By carefully analysing the views of the gift giver, planning documents, and public discourse on the pagoda, I argue that the different narratives—which encompass the themes of representing an ethnic community, hospitality, and gift giving—are discontinuous. In doing so, I illustrate some of the limits to Birmingham's hospitality and mark out a series of informal obligations of citizenship that are written into Birmingham's public space. I conclude by suggesting that if a gift of hospitality is to be given it is necessary to consider the other of the ethnic minority as an asset, citizenship, and presence. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on qualitative research conducted in 1999 and 2001 with a group of single mothers in Matagalpa, Nicaragua, this paper examines the contradictory impacts of neoliberalism on work, based on the understanding that economic restructuring can generate both crisis and a space for changes in gender identities. By focusing on the broader picture of women's work and on the intersections between paid and unpaid work, it discusses what happens to these intersections in times of intense political and economic change. Despite the hardships caused by neoliberalism, it appears that work is a site in which gender ideologies can be challenged. The paper has four main sections. First, it explores the ways in which certain cultural processes are intensified under neoliberalism which affects the relationship between constructions of masculinity and femininity. Second, it assesses the impact of neoliberalism on domestic work and the implications of this for GAD (gender and development) understandings of the double burden and of how the balance of women's paid and unpaid work changes under neoliberalism. Third, it examines the ways in which hegemonic understandings of femininities and motherhood and revolutionary legacies can be resistant to the neoliberal present. Finally, it discusses how work under neoliberalism can be a site of female empowerment or self-esteem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been a long tradition, dating back to the 1930s, of promoting regional development in the assisted areas of the United Kingdom through the provision of industrial units. At the end of the 1980s the government decided that the time was then ripe to sell off the publicly owned portfolio of industrial and commercial property, which was predominantly to be found in the peripheral regions of the United Kingdom. The author charts the privatisation process in England and Scotland. It had been envisaged that the sale would lead to higher rents and invigorate private sector investment. More than a decade on, the author seeks to assess whether this forecast/hypothesis proved correct. The Scottish experience is used as a case study of the UK privatisation programme operating in a peripheral region, and the impact is assessed at two levels: on the Scottish market as a whole; and in the postprivatisation experience of the former publicly owned industrial estates. The original forecasts of the Conservative government prove to be naïve. No evidence of a wide-scale rise in rents, or speculative development, was found, nor has there been an increase in institutional investment in industrial property; the public sector has begun to intervene again—albeit in a different guise. </jats:p>",

The finding is not compatible with explanations of the efficiency benefits of greater decentralisation. An investigation of the impacts of fiscal decentralisation on economic growth by utilising time series in a framework of the production function for the period 1982–2000 and cross-section analyses on sixty-seven provinces indicates that there is a negative relationship between fiscal decentralisation and economic growth. </jats:p>",

This study of manufacturing industry clusters in three Indian metropolises suggests instead that industry location decisions are guided by market imperfections, specifically rigidities in the land market caused by state action (segregationist or environmental policies, the absence of exit policies, and activist industrial promotion policies). For the investigation the authors use geographically disaggregated industry location and size data from Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai, to analyze eight industrial sectors (food and beverages, textiles, leather, printing and publishing, chemicals, metals, machinery, and electrical and electronics). The authors test for evidence of global and local clustering and distinguish between and test for coclustering and colocation of industries. The results are indicative rather than absolute and suggest that for location decisions general urbanization economies are more important than are localization economies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Within public policy discourse on health care restructuring and voluntarism, the nonprofit sector is now expected to play an active and direct role in the provision of health care services. The viability of the nonprofit sector to take up this role, however, remains unclear. This paper explores the changing role of nonprofit organisations with respect to the provision of long-term care in Ontario, Canada, where extensive restructuring of public services occurred during the 1990s. Drawing on a critical review of legislation, government policies and documents, and stakeholder reports, the authors present a comparative study of two distinct long-term care reform models, featuring public and private provision, respectively, which were developed by ideologically opposed provincial governments. The results indicate that despite unanimous promotion of voluntarism (and the attendant ascendancy of the nonprofit sector) as a central feature of health care restructuring, the divergent reform models actually trap nonprofit organisations between direct incorporation within public provision on the one hand, and direct free-market competition on the other. The findings suggest that underscoring long-term care reform in Ontario, and elsewhere, is the co-option of the nonprofit sector, which resonates with concern for its ability to replace effectively the public provision of health care services. The results also point to the need to conceptualise the consequent actions taken by nonprofit organisations in order to inform current debates surrounding health care restructuring and voluntarism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, using event-related functional MRI (fMRI), we located a bilateral region in the human posterior parietal cortex (retIPS) that topographically represents and updates targets for saccades and pointing movements in eye-centered coordinates. To generate movements, this spatial information must be integrated with the selected effector. We now tested whether the activation in retIPS is dependent on the hand selected. Using 4-T fMRI, we compared the activation produced by movements, using either eyes or the left or right hand, to targets presented either leftward or rightward of central fixation. The majority of the regions activated during saccades were also activated during pointing movements, including occipital, posterior parietal, and premotor cortex. The topographic retIPS region was activated more strongly for saccades than for pointing. The activation associated with pointing was significantly greater when pointing with the unseen hand to targets ipsilateral to the hand. For example, although there was activation in the left retIPS when pointing to targets on the right with the left hand, the activation was significantly greater when using the right hand. The mirror symmetric effect was observed in the right retIPS. Similar hand preferences were observed in a nearby anterior occipital region. This effector specificity is consistent with previous clinical and behavioral studies showing that each hand is more effective in directing movements to targets in ipsilateral visual space. We conclude that not only do these regions code target location, but they also appear to integrate target selection with effector selection. </jats:p>",

Chronic pain robs older people of their quality of life.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design. </jats:bold> This was a descriptive qualitative study.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold> Forty‐four older people (37 female and seven male) who were residents of a nursing home in Hong Kong took part in this study. Their ages ranged from 65 to 82 years, median age was 75 years. Almost 80% had experienced moderate to severe pain during the previous three months. The most common sites of pain were muscles and joints; 35% of subjects reported continuous pain, 27% reported pain associated with activities of daily living, and 38% reported pain during exercise but not at rest. Only a few of the study group had taken prescribed medication to relieve pain, and only two of the 44 subjects studied had used a combination of drug and non‐prescription intervention for pain relief. The majority of participants used non‐prescription intervention only and the most commonly used were topical analgesics with massage. The majority (58%) of the subjects perceived the used of non‐prescription intervention to be very effective in pain relief.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions. </jats:bold> The prevalence of pain was found to be high among older people in this study. Yet, they were taking a pro‐active and responsible role in treating their chronic pain by using non‐pharmacological patient‐initiated intervention; also older people perceive themselves to have control over their pain status.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Relevance to clinical practice. </jats:bold> This active role of older people in their pain relief is likely to enhance the effect of education seminars and workshops aimed at novel, non‐pharmacological pain relief strategies for older people with chronic pain.</jats:p>",

Over 45% reported that they use manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) for the management of abortion in the first trimester, while 25% use dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C). Nearly 28% reported the use of MVA followed by D&amp;C in the first trimester. Fifty‐seven percent reported their lack of expertise in managing second‐trimester abortions, while those admitting that they manage second‐trimester abortions reported nonstandard methods and procedures. In addition, there was evidence of inadequate counseling of women, lack of institutional protocols and poor use of postabortion family planning by the doctors.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions. </jats:bold> These results suggest the need for a program of retraining of private practitioners on the principles and practices of safe abortion, postabortion care and family planning in Nigeria and the integration of these topics into medical training curricula in the country.</jats:p>",
