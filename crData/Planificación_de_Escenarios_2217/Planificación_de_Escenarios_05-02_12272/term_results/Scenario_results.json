It assesses the impact of changes in land use and irrigation water availability on the distribution of crop water consumption in space and time, as well as on the groundwater resources. A distributed, integrated surface water-groundwater simulation system was implemented and applied to the study area. The system is based on the coupling of a conceptual vadose zone model with the groundwater model MODFLOW. To assess the impact of land use and irrigation water availability on water deficit for crops as well as on groundwater system in the area, a number of management scenarios were identified and compared with a base scenario, reflecting the present conditions. Changes in land use may alter significantly both total crop water requirement and aquifer recharge. Water supply is sufficient to meet demand under present conditions and, from the crop water use viewpoint, a reduction of water availability has a positive effect on the overall irrigation system efficiency; however, evapotranspiration deficit increases, concentrated in July and August, when it may be critical for maize crops.</jats:p>",

Since the early 1970s, they have been increasingly used for landscape planning. Each scenario-based study is founded on assumptions of possible change. Often these beliefs are only implicit among scenario creators and scenario users. I discuss the beliefs and perceptions about the future of scenario creators and scenario users, and argue that they should be explicitly addressed before an investigation is undertaken in order to avoid methodological biases in the creation of the scenarios and misunderstanding of the results. As part of this discussion, the basic features of a scenario-based study are reviewed, and applications to landscape and environmental planning are considered, with examples drawn from two studies that were focused on the same concerns and in the same region but which employed different kinds of scenarios. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The SHETRAN model for determining the sediment yield arising from shallow landsliding at the scale of a river catchment was applied to the 180-km2 Valsassina basin in the Italian Southern Alps, with the aim of demonstrating that the model can simulate long term patterns of landsliding and the associated sediment yields and that it can be used to explore the sensitivity of the landslide sediment supply system to changes in catchment characteristics. The model was found to reproduce the observed spatial distribution of landslides from a 50-year record very well but probably with an overestimate of the annual rate of landsliding. Simulated sediment yields were within the range observed in a wider region of northern Italy. However, the results suggest that the supply of shallow landslide material to the channel network contributes relatively little to the overall long term sediment yield compared with other sources. The model was applied for scenarios of possible future climate (drier and warmer) and land use (fully forested hillslopes). For both scenarios, there is a modest reduction in shallow landslide occurrence and the overall sediment yield. This suggests that any current schemes for mitigating sediment yield impact in Valsassina remain valid. The application highlights the need for further research in eliminating the large number of unconditionally unsafe landslide sites typically predicted by the model and in avoiding large overestimates of landslide occurrence.\n                    </jats:p>"

The National Center for Atmospheric Research coupled atmosphere‐ocean climate system model (CSM) simulation is compared to long‐term observations and National Centers for Environmental Prediction reanalysis with an emphasis on the wet season during the late 20th century. While there are significant improvements in the simulation of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and African easterly waves relative to the uncoupled Community Climate Model, version 3, biases still exist. These biases are related to a poor simulation of the Azores high, which extends into eastern Europe, allowing for cold air advection into North Africa. There is also little improvement in the upper troposphere Tropical Easterly Jet in the CSM, which is too weak and does not extend westward over the Atlantic Ocean. In the late 21st century, JJA summer temperatures in West Africa have warmed 1.5°–2.5°C relative to the 1951–1980 period. Moreover, the Sahelian region is wetter in the late 21st century in association with an increase in atmospheric moisture, stronger meridional winds from the Gulf of Guinea, and a slightly stronger AEJ.</jats:p>",
