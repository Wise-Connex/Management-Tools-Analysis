The question is raised as to whether town planners have become concerned with specific social benefits. An analysis of the preoccupations of planners is made, using data available in Royal Town Planning Institute literature. From branch meetings data, conclusions are drawn as to changing areas of interest. It is noted that planners did not develop a very strong preoccupation with specific social issues over the 1947–71 period. Factors that may have influenced the evolution of professional thought are then examined. In particular, a hypothesis is put forward that the nature of the planning machinery has been such as to deter discussion about specific welfare implications. Other factors have included traditions, alternative preoccupations, and a lack of coherent attempts to link theoretical analyses with implementation. The paper comments briefly upon the town planning approaches that would be necessary if a more definite welfare outcome were desired. Town and country planners have thought in terms of physical development standards mainly because of the character of the land use planning system.</jats:p>",

The status quo in family planning does not have to be maintained.

Its increased safety compared to first trimester abortion establishes menstrual regulation by vacuum aspiration for treatment of up to 14 days missed menstrual period as probably better medical practice than waiting to confirm the presence of a pregnancy. Because it is a postcontraceptive method, menstrual regulation has potential in family planning services both as a recruitment service and for the treatment of contraceptive failures. Its use as an only method of fertility control is being studied. The acceptance of this new family planning service will primarily depend on its availability, dissemination of information about the service, and the ability of women freely to avail themselves of the service without delay. Although long term effects of single and repeated use of menstrual regulation are not known, its immediate complications are few and it can be recommended as a useful addition to present fertility control methods in family planning programs. </jats:p>",

The more recent new towns have been the object of better social planning and, at the same time, the National Health Service has been substantially unified, at first functionally and, in 1974, administratively. In consequence, attempts have been made to use the opportunities which such towns present for planning health services in a comprehensive and integrated manner. The evolution of a planning and implementation structure for health services in Milton Keynes, a new town with a target population of 250,000, is described, together with some of the implications for the administratively unified National Health Service which came into being in 1974. </jats:p>",

The Act was designed to overcome some of the weaknesses in earlier planning legislation. More complete coverage and more functional local jurisdictions for planning should result. The Act provides better financial support, and more effective incentives and inducements to assure adherence to plans. Concern is expressed about aspects of the legislation which the authors feel may deserve consideration. The principle of delegating responsibility to voluntary agencies for disbursement of public funds is questioned, and the authors suggest that local public health authorities apply for designation as planning agencies. Reservation is expressed about the adequacy of regional organization as provided by the Act to accomplish its purposes, and the authors recommend demonstrations of regional administrative agencies to implement plans developed by Health Systems Agencies. Failure to incorporate the provision of the House planning bill to set up a national health policy council in the Act is considered unfortunate. Persistence in pursuing the course outlined in the Act is urged. </jats:p>",

These concepts are viewed as embedded in the social context of welfare department attempts to influence welfare mothers to use family planning and the related criticisms which welfare rights protagonists have recently voiced. Structured interviews with 58 welfare workqrs and 300 welfare mothers in one metropolitan Tennessee county reveal that heterophily characterizes these two groups in social and demographic characteristics, birth control attitudes, family size norms, and abortion attitudes. It is further suggested that this heterophily may partially account for welfare workers' limited conformity to the change agent role in family planning counseling with their clients.

Program continuation is a measurement of maintenance of clinic attendance, while use continuation is related to actual use of effective contraceptives regardless of clinic activity status. Program continuation rates ranged from 0.77 at 12 months to 0.48 at 36 months. Contraceptive use continuation rates were 0.78 at 12 months and 0.58 at 36 months. Women who moved or were otherwise lost to follow-up formed the largest category of discontinuation. The highest rate of discontinuation from clinic attendance occurred after the first visit with secondary peaks around the time of scheduled annual checkups. Women who were younger and had fewer living children had a greater likelihood of discontinuing clinic attendance and contraceptive use. The reasons for and timing of discontinuation from clinic attendance suggest that clinic personnel should place special emphasis on the first visits, arrange referral for women who might have plans to leave the service area before the scheduled return visit, send reminders before first revisits, and follow up patients soon after missed visits. Priority might be assigned to the younger women of low parity who have been shown to be at higher risk of discontinuation. Other factors which might influence continuation include method of contraception, marital status, and race. Program continuation can be determined by analysis of clinic records alone while contraceptive use continuation often requires follow-up of patients. Although the two continuation rates were not equivalent, program and use continuation were roughly parallel through much of the study period. This suggests that a simple review of records in the clinic or on computer tape, when available, to determine program continuation may give an estimate of actual contraceptive use in the population. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article examines the conceptual problems of measuring agricultural land values for taxation purposes and for land use planning. It is shown that prevailing market prices are often deficient. One alternative method of measuring these values is by means of the soil productivity points currently used by the Ministry of Revenue in Ontario. It is shown that the foundations on which this method is based are weak, and that many problems arise in attributing a dollar value to these points. Finally, a shadow pricing technique is suggested. It has its weaknesses in land assessment for taxation, but it has great merit in evaluating land for land use planning.</jats:p><jats:p>Cet article étudie les problémes possibles qui se présentent dans l'évaluation des terres agricoles pour les fins de l'im pôt et de la planification de leur utilisation. L' article indique que les prix courant ne reflètent pas la valeur réelle de ces terres. Le Ministère tin Revenu de l'Ontario propose line autre méthode de valorisation: cette d' évaleur le terrain selon sa produclivilé. L' article démontre que les raisons sur lesquelles cette methode est fondée sont faibles et que de nombreux problèmes surgissent lors de l'attribution d'une valuer monétaire à ces points d'évaltialion. Enfin, on suggère tine technique utilisant les “shadow prices', qui a des faiblesses quand il s'agit ďévaleur les terrains pour raison d'impot mais qui a de grands mérites pour leur évaluation en rue de la planification de leur utilisation.</jats:p>",
