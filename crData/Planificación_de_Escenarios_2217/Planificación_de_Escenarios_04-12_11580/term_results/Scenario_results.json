Quantitative support, however, for the role of emotions in general is scarce, whereas quantitative support for the role of enthusiasm is lacking. In this paper a model of leadership emotions is presented, which focuses on the effects of enthusiasm of the leader on the perceptions of the followers ,as well as on the process underlying these effects. </jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A scenario experiment showed that enthusiastic leaders are perceived as being more charismatic than relaxed leaders and this effect was mediated by translation of (self reported) arousal. Charisma was found to function as a mediator in the relationship between arousal and perceived leader effectiveniss. The model therefore implies that an enthusiastic leader transfers more arousal tot followers than a relaxed leader. This transfer of arousal leads to higher perceived charisma of the leader and therefore implies that an enthusiastic leade transfers more arousal to followers than a relaxed leader. This transfer of arousal leads to higher perceived charisma of the leader and therefore, ultimately, to a higher perceived leader effectiveness.</jats:p>",

This paper considers a dynamic VRPTW with stochastic customers, where the goal is to maximize the number of serviced customers. It presents a multiple scenario approach (MSA) that continuously generates routing plans for scenarios including known and future requests. Decisions during execution use a distinguished plan chosen, at each decision, by a consensus function. The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30% and 80%. They indicate that MSA exhibits dramatic improvements over approaches not exploiting stochastic information, that the use of consensus function improves the quality of the solutions significantly, and that the benefits of MSA increase with the (effective) degree of dynamism. </jats:p>",

Two distinct approaches have progressively emerged: mass screening using DXA and prescreening strategies using user-friendly risk indices. This study was designed to compare the efficiency of these approaches.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Materials and Methods: A database of 4035 medical records from postmenopausal women above 45 years was analyzed. In the first scenario, women were systematically referred to DXA if above 45, 50, or 65 years of age. The second scenario involved the validated prescreening tools SCORE, ORAI, OST, and OSIRIS and assessed two separate ways of handling their results (theoretical and pragmatic). The cost of a DXA test was set as the median Belgian value: 40.14£. All strategies were compared in terms of cost exposed per osteoporotic patient detected and in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results: In the systematic DXA strategies, the cost per patient detected ranged from 123£ when measuring all women &amp;gt;45 years of age to 91£ when focusing on women &amp;gt;65 years of age. The corresponding percentage of cases detected ranged from 100% (age &amp;gt; 45 years) to 50% (age &amp;gt; 65 years). When considering prescreening under the theoretical and pragmatic scenarios, the OSIRIS index provided the best efficiency, with costs of 74£ (theoretical) to 85£ (pragmatic) per case detected, followed by ORAI (75£ and 96£), OST (84£ and 94£), and SCORE (96£ and 103£). The corresponding percentage of cases detected ranged from 89% (SCORE) to 75% (OSIRIS). The cost-effectiveness analysis showed that mass screening strategies over 50 and 65 years of age and using ORAI were best.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions: Our study sets the grounds for considering, in a health economics perspective, prescreening tools as valuable, cost-effective, approaches to significantly reduce the economic burden of osteoporosis screening.</jats:p>",

Data abstraction and data mining are based on the management of three key concepts, data, information and knowledge, which are instantiated via an ontology specific of our medical domain application. After a detailed description of the proposed methodology, we apply it to the supervision of patients hospitalized in intensive care units.

The method permits evaluations by various stakeholder groups of future urban mobility scenarios by means of multiattribute utility analyses. In order to illustrate the method, key results from a Swedish case study are presented, demonstrating that all interest groups—with the exception of business representatives—were aware of the importance of environmental factors and gave these factors greater weight than economic factors. Discussion focuses upon issues relevant to policy analysis, strategic planning including stakeholders, and upon issues relevant to the policy process, such as how the method can support and meaningfully engage the citizen in strategic planning. </jats:p>",

This study deals specifically with Australian general practice. A two‐step procedure is used in the scenario analysis, which involves identifying opportunities for detection, intervention, effectiveness and assigning probabilities to outcomes. The results suggest that increasing rates of GP intervention achieves greatest benefit and return on resource use. For every 5% point increase in the rate of GP intervention, an additional 26 754 at‐risk drinkers modify their drinking behaviour at a cost of $231.45 per patient. This compares with a cost per patient modifying drinking behaviour of $232.60 and $208.31 for every 5% point increase in the rates of detection and effectiveness, respectively. The knowledge, skill and attitude of practitioners toward drinking are significant, and they can be the prime motivators in persuading their patients to modify drinking behaviour.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>A<jats:sc>bstract</jats:sc>: </jats:bold> Police trainees who were ready to graduate from the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) volunteered to participate in an exercise designed to evaluate their survivability. In a highly stressful interactive scenario, which included a hostage situation, performance was evaluated for a range of responses, including: shooting judgment and accuracy, communications, and coping with a weapon malfunction. Nineteen percent of subjects shot the hostage, a failure rate that falls in the reported range of friendly fire casualties in military combat. The Spielberger Trait Anger Scale showed an association with shot placement and performance during the gunfight as well as with overall performance scores.</jats:p>",
