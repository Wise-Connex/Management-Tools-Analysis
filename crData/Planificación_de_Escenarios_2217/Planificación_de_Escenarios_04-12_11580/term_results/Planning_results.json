Studies of discourses have become an important way of understanding how power is mediated in planning, but the methods through which discourses are identified and evaluated is as yet unclear in the literature. Here, we describe our attempt—with still only limited success—to map discourses using a method that extends the work of Toulmin and Gasper and George. Our method consists of a tabular representation of argument structure to depict the content and structure of a discourse, and a graphical index to the discourse table to reveal higher order patterns in the discourse. Using discourse pertaining to a real-life design-review case, we demonstrate how our approach allows us to understand the internal structure of that discourse better. We conclude with suggestions for how the method might be further improved. </jats:p>",

It uses the case study of an urban renewal project in Antwerp to explore the ways that workshop participants made sense of the planning situation. Analysis of the “talks” identified shared interpretive “frames” employed by the lay participants. The article goes on to discuss how distinctive these were from the professionals’ perspectives and what the consequences were for the material outcomes of the planning process. It was concluded that the public input was used to making adjustments to planning solutions rather than formulating new interpretations of the planning situation itself. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Using data from in‐depth interviews conducted between March and June 2002 in a rural district of Malawi, this study explores how family planning attitudes and practices spread among members of social groups. Gender differentials are found in how people determine other group members’ practices: Men “knew” about such practices from their observations of others’ family size and child spacing, whereas women's knowledge was based on their conversations with other women. The discussion topics relating to family planning also varied by sex: Men spoke about the pros and cons of limiting family size, whereas women spoke in detail about types of contraceptive methods, where to get them, their side effects, and covert contraceptive use. For men and women, the main trigger for family planning discussions was gossip. Whereas, generally, women first heard about family planning at the hospital, men stated that their first source of information was the radio or health‐drama group.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper uses 1372 sets of cross-sectional data to evaluate empirically the probit estimates for five hypotheses regarding planning applications for the conversion of leasehold land lying fallow or under active agriculture to nonagricultural uses in agriculture zones in Hong Kong. Though the agriculture zones occupy just 5.6% of all zoned land and the agricultural sector generates 0.1% of GDP and 0.9% of jobs, they attract a disproportionate 17.6% of planning applications. It is established that the Town Planning Board prefers to release development rights to indigenous villagers to construct ‘small houses’ than to container storage operators, though open storage of containers is a derived demand generated by an international container port. However, the fact that the Hong Kong government announced a major housing supply programme in July 1997 has not affected the pattern of decisions for agriculture zones. Indeed, for all nonagricultural use applications, the board has shown a dislike for large-scale development and been particularly more restrictive as regards applications arising in Sai Kung. This discussion is made with reference to the potential contribution of the modelling approach to planning research in general and the rural land-use policies and law of Hong Kong in particular. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade the planning literature has reflected growing interest in the topic of gated communities. To date, this relatively new field of research has generated limited theoretical development. Although recent literature has begun to elucidate the social and economic contexts that make gated enclaves a global phenomenon, few works offer an overview of the physical features of gated communities. The key source articulating a framework for understanding gated communities is Blakely and Snyder's, Fortress America. Although Blakely and Snyder provide detailed findings on the form of gated projects in the US context, they say little about gating elsewhere. This paper draws on a range of literature on gated enclaves to examine and augment the typology created by Blakely and Snyder. Building theory to explain the form and character of gated communities requires the consideration of a range of historical experiences and international differences in practice. Although classification alone does not constitute theory, it provides an important foundation for those seeking to generate premises and principles for further theoretical development. It also offers useful tools for case studies of practice. </jats:p>",

Data from a survey of 863 adolescent and unmarried young adults, in‐depth interviews, and participant observation are combined in this study to explain some of this discrepancy. Young migrants appear to make sexual and contraceptive decisions in relation to gender norms and attitudes concerning procreation at least as much as in relation to fear of disease. Assessments of current and potential partners, choices about whether or not to have sex, and decisions about whether or not to use condoms are influenced by shared cultural values regarding the importance of parenthood. These cultural conceptions of parenthood are gender‐specific and put men and women in different negotiating positions with regard to sex and contraception.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Prevalence rates for condom use are low across the Middle East despite limited alternate contraceptive options and growing awareness of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS. Virtually no research exists to explain this situation and to guide policy development or effective interventions. An analysis of 25 focus‐group discussions with married women and men, interviews with service providers, and a survey of 589 women of childbearing age in a rural district of southern Lebanon reveal that a broad and complex set of Sociocultural factors influence condom use. In the study area, 7 percent of married women currently use condoms, 24 percent reported ever use, and inconsistent use is common. Condoms are preferred primarily for their lack of physiological side effects, five factors were found to impede method adoption and sustained use. These include various encumbering beliefs, reduced sexual pleasure, adverse experiences, gender‐related fears and tensions, and a residual social stigma attached to condoms. Several strategies are suggested to increase and improve condom use. These issues will assume greater importance as fertility declines further in the region, demand for contraception continues to increase, and STDs and HIV/AIDS become more deeply rooted, as has occurred in other parts of the world.</jats:p>",

Past research focused on the dynamics of individuals’ and partners’ sexual decisionmaking without accounting for the larger context in which such decisions are made. Do adolescents’ opportunities for schooling, work, and other community activities make a difference? This study uses data collected from a representative sample of young people living in KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa, to explore these questions. Logit analyses show that for girls, higher levels of education reduced the probability of having had sex in the 12 months prior to the survey, and average wages were positively associated with condom use. Greater participation in community sports increased risk‐taking behaviors among boys but decreased them among girls. Within the household, education of adults had a positive effect on condom use for both boys and girls.</jats:p>",

Little evidence is found that this decrease infertility signals the beginning of a sustained decline. Rather, the results indicate that one of the outcomes of the military mobilization and displacement associated with the 1998–2000 border conflict with Ethiopia was a steep reduction in the proportion of women exposed to the risk of pregnancy. Part of this reduction was due to delayed age at marriage, but it came about largely because married women were less likely to be living with their husbands in 2002 than in 1995. Projections of the number of births that could occur if women implement their stated reproductive intentions and a postwar “baby boom” results show that the health system may be facing an increased demand for child health services over the next several years.</jats:p>",

In this article, the author focuses on the supply side story of New Urbanism to examine its implications for public policy. Specifically, the author evaluates where designers, developers, and planners involved with New Urbanist projects differ (or concur) in their endorsement of New Urbanist principles and in their satisfaction with the implementation of these ideas. Research reveals that in general, these designers, developers, and planners are endorsing New Urbanist ideas as a tool for achieving sustainable growth. The study shows that New Urbanist principles that focus on neighborhood design are most likely to be promoted and are expected to influence public policy, while principles that focus on regional planning may not generate enough support and are least likely to be implemented. The article concludes with policy recommendations. </jats:p>",

It is vital that citizen preferences are assessed, and the ‘area development negotiation’ method for obtaining such preferences is detailed within a case study framework. The method permits evaluations by various stakeholder groups of future urban mobility scenarios by means of multiattribute utility analyses. In order to illustrate the method, key results from a Swedish case study are presented, demonstrating that all interest groups—with the exception of business representatives—were aware of the importance of environmental factors and gave these factors greater weight than economic factors. Discussion focuses upon issues relevant to policy analysis, strategic planning including stakeholders, and upon issues relevant to the policy process, such as how the method can support and meaningfully engage the citizen in strategic planning. </jats:p>",

As opposed to reserving parcels of the forest for general habitat purposes, as most published works do, the model we present, and its several variants, concentrate on the preservation status of each one of the species living in the forest under study. Thus, all of the formulations we propose trade off harvested timber volume against the weighted number of preserved species. Each formulation represents a different management policy. Casting the models in a static setting allows us to analyze the effect of several management policies through computational experience with different forest-stucture — species relationships. </jats:p>",

Green developments will reach their potential only if residents understand the design, support the goals, and act as responsible land managers. However, studies by psychologists, anthropologists, environmental educators, and economists show that even knowledgeable, well-intentioned people frequently fail to adopt proenvironmental behaviors. This article identifies three categories of potential barriers to better individual land management: barriers to recognizing environmental problems, internal barriers to action, and external barriers to action. Two case studies show that unless barriers are addressed through education or design, individuals probably will not adopt more ecologically sensitive practices. Both cases are in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion. </jats:p>",

In aspiring for a new position in this global market, cities utilize new urban practices that lead them to rediscover and reinvent identities and traditions. In Rio de Janeiro, the mythical dimension of the South Zone is inseparably incorporated to its identity. In evaluating the history of the imagery linked to the beaches and the projects for the waterfront, one may observe a social construction of a reality that is marked by a continuous redesigning of symbols but also by a discontinuity in the history of urban interventions. Although tourism and marketing continually praise the waterfront as a fundamental factor in the image of the city, a continuous public management process never really existed. The city managers must understand the beaches, the waterfront, and development along the shoreline as important resources in a continuous process of social construction of a reality that should not only address their images as commodities but should treat them as inseparable from the city’s daily public and social lives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A city and its transportation network are both complicated systems. Fractal geometry provides an effective way to describe the complex property of geographical features. This paper uses a modified box-counting method to describe the fractal property of urban transportation networks. Assuming that human settlements of different sizes are all operated by the same growth procedure, this paper investigates the relationship between the mass size of cities and the complexity of their road systems. The results confirm that, as cities grow from small to large, their transportation networks generally become more complicated—the urban spaces are filled up more densely by city roads and the locations within a city are more accessible. The quantitative relationship identified between the complexity of urban transportation network and city size provides an empirical guide for the planning and policymaking of urban development and road construction. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite a burgeoning research effort directed at the design and modelling of effective urban spaces for pedestrians, remarkably little is known about how pedestrians actually negotiate urban spaces. This paper reports the results of a video-based observational study aimed at exploring: (1) individuals' movement preferences within uncluttered environments, in particular: (a) desired walking speed, (b) microscopic position preferences, and (c) interpersonal distances between companions while walking; and (2) the ways in which these variables might be influenced by the various personal, situational, and environmental factors that characterise the context in which pedestrians move. The microscopic movement trajectories of 2613 participants were investigated in a covert, video-based observational study of three mixed-use (residential/retail) urban environments close to the city centres of Edinburgh and York, United Kingdom. Age, gender, level of mobility, group size, time of day, and location were found to have significant effects on movement preferences across the range of locations studied. We concluded that a number of influential factors affect how humans negotiate urban spaces, and suggested how these factors may be taken into account in attempts to design and model effective urban spaces for pedestrians. </jats:p>",

Data on individual health is obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III study in 29 primary metropolitan statistical areas, and data on sprawl are from Ewing et al. Using hierarchical modeling, the results indicate that even with strong controls for individual variables, residents of areas with more highly accessible and gridded street networks have higher health ratings. At the same time, residents of more densely populated urban areas have lower rated health, net of individual-level measures. Measures of sprawl have no significant relationship to frequency of walking, body mass index, or diagnosis of various chronic diseases. However, among those with chronic conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and lung disease, those who live in areas with more highly connected street networks have higher rated health. </jats:p>",

This was the time when the country was moving in a natural progression from solving the basic problems of establishing new settlements, through extensive infrastructural works (construction of roads and railroads; introduction of electricity and tramways, etc), to the point of early re-evaluations and criticisms of the achieved results. Concurrently the British town planning concepts were, for the first time, discussed among New Zealand architectural professionals and other interested parties as the New Zealand cities and towns were actively being constructed with new and improved infrastructure. This period provided ample opportunity to set up models that could influence future urban developments.&#x0D;\nThis paper will discuss the professional town planning developments in relation to the broader context of urban improvements of the same period. It will explore the concepts that underpinned the developments and evaluate the lasting effects they have had on the development of New Zealand towns and cities.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article predicts that strategic planners in organisations of the future need to consider the potential benefits of collaborating, co‐operating and co‐ordinating with others serving the same markets, rather than pursuing conventional “competition”. The author defines this new mindset as “co‐opetition”. It has been observed that the competitive psychology represents oneself as being better than others, and stresses the winning of more resources at their expense. The antithesis is active co‐operation, wherein one embraces competitors in partnership to the benefit of all. It is argued that the new business environment demands new kinds of business relationships, and that “co‐opetitive” partnerships have emerged as a more effective response to changed environmental threats and opportunities. Co‐opetition can deliver synergy if carefully planned, managed and controlled, and preconditions for achieving this outcome are examined. Equally, weak management of a relationship can produce the opposite effect, so preconditions for survival are also discussed. The conclusion is that, on balance, co‐opetition deserves marketing planners' close attention.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Karachi being a metropolitan city of population, more than 13 million, is usually seen and known to many of its inhabitants and visitors as a modern mega polis, which lacks an identity and a culturally rich historic background. Many who do not know the city too well would often exclaim “Does Karachi have a historic core?”; “Does Karachi have a history worth preserving?”. Surprising answers to these questions emerge when one tries to look into the historic background of the city and discover that there were times when Karachi scintillated with its richness of tradition and culture. Karachi certainly does not have a very long history to boast about, but its short colonial history does not lack anything that can be desired, thus making it comparable to many other colonized cities of the world that are today celebrated for their glory and richness.   Much has been written about Karachi and its rapidly vanishing historic fabric. Several reasons have been identified as the cause for the ruthless destruction of its historic core. Piecemeal efforts are made from time to time to give the city’s historic fabric a protective cover. Yet the disturbing questions still lurk in the minds of those who really care for the city, “Why is our historic core constantly on the decline? Why are we loosing old buildings every day? Why are the existing masterpieces of architecture so badly maintained and mutilated? In spite of the existing legislation, how can people get away with the implacable destruction of heritage property?”. This paper aims at looking into some facts related with the listed heritage of Karachi, attempting at an analysis of the existing ground realities and their implication on the whole process of heritage conservation and issues related to it.</jats:p>",

Triad work strategies act to limit decision uncertainty, expedite schedules to meet project milestones, and reduce costs associated with cleanup activities. As a result, the Triad approach is rapidly increasing in popularity. Good project planning has always been seen as the cornerstone of successful Triad projects. However, the specific steps in the systematic planning process have not been extensively published. Demands of Triad projects, which attempt to make maximum use of innovative technologies and sequencing of activities in a learn‐ as‐you‐go framework, put new demands on regulators and project managers alike. Specific activities and relationships are identified to assist project managers with dynamic work strategies and real‐time measurements to support improved decision making. These include: assembly of stakeholders, a core technical team, and key decisions; development and refinement of a site model; use of demonstrations of methods applicability; development of dynamic work strategies and project sequencing; real‐time data management assessment and presentation; and unitized procurement of technologies and services. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

In India, the need to deliver superior value to consumers has assumed paramount importance, as globalization increases at a fast pace and local consumers become more demanding day by day. This empirical study of 22 Indian firms is based on the antecedents and determinants of market orientation, and hence of continuous superior performance, proposed by Narver and Slater. It finds that they exhibit some key features of market orientation, but fall short on others, notably internal communication and senior management's attitude to risk. The overall outcome is a commitment to intelligence gathering and dissemination, but a comparative lack of responsiveness to the market environment.</jats:p>",

While most organisations equate disaster preparedness to business continuity, the aftermath of 9/11 brought forth some startling realisations about business survival and business crisis. Boeing, a global company that was affected in a number of unexpected ways, embarked on an approach that separated, yet integrated the Disaster Preparedness Community with the Business Community. The result was a Business Continuity Model that fostered further development of robust Business Continuity Plans to serve employees, customers, stakeholders and community. Facilities professionals, equipped with an understanding of today’s business crisis and the Business Continuity Model, can serve as a partner to their Business Continuity Representative to educate, develop and execute a Business Continuity Plan that ensures business continuance through any unforeseen event.</jats:p>",

An agent‐based supply chain network is decomposed into multiple ANNs in a way that the actual customer requirements and the agents' goals and constraints are matched in different stages. An error‐minimising algorithm which models the agents' collaboration mechanism is used to train three ANNs, namely the supply net, the production net and the delivery net, for pursuing complete order fulfilment across the supply chain. In the example problem, the collaborative SCP paradigm is applied to determine the supply plan of an alliance of small firms, which provides assemble‐to‐order goods with short delivery lead‐time to a regional market. The calculation results showed that the ANN approach achieved complete order fulfilment and significantly increased the resource utilisation of all supply chain agents.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper treats the evolution of the use of authenticity as an important factor in assessing the suitability of nominations for inscription on the World Heritage List. It treats in sequence a number of major questions linked to authenticity:  • Is authenticity a heritage value in itself or a qualifier of heritage values?  • Is authenticity linked exclusively to authenticity of surviving material fabric or to other factors as well? • What relation exists between authenticity and integrity?  • Is it possible to apply authenticity as a universal concept, or must assessments be modified in relation to context?  • How is it possible to use this concept in practical ways in conservation decision making?  The above questions are examined in detail in the context of the ICOMOS-UNESCO-Japan Government 1994 Nara meeting on Authenticity held in Japan. The purpose of this meeting was to assess conservation practices (and “authenticity”) in various regional contexts, and subsequent follow up meetings at international, regional and national levels, including the “Authenticity and Monitoring” meeting held in Cesky Krumlov in the Czech Republic in 1995, the “InterAmerican Symposium on Authenticity in the Conservation and Management of the Cultural Heritage” held in San Antonio, in 1996, and the “Authenticity and Integrity in an African Context” meeting held in Great Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe in 2000.  This paper aims to provide administrators and professionals, a greater understanding of the principal issues in the application of the authenticity analysis in conservation decision-making, and their relevance in the context of World Heritage inscriptions.</jats:p>",

Suppose that the subjects are randomized into a usual care and a study group.

Early detection clinical trials differ from therapeutic trials in that power is affected by: i) the number of exams, ii) the time between exams and iii) the ages at which exams will be given. These design options do not exist in therapeutic trials. Furthermore; long-term follow-up may result in a reduction of power. In general, power increases with number of examinations, and the optimal follow-up time is dependent on the spacing between examinations. Clinical trials in which the usual care group receives benefit are also discussed. Two designs are discussed, for example the ‘up-front design’ in which all subjects receive an initial exam and then are randomized to the usual care and study groups and the ‘close-out design’ in which the usual care group receives an exam which is timed to be given at the same time as the last exam in the study group. Both families of designs significantly reduce the power. Power calculations are made for two clinical trials, which actually used these two designs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An emergent heterodox approach is challenging the prevailing orthodoxy of thinking, doing, and governing economic development, particularly at the subnational, regional, and local levels. Looking at underlying debates concerning institutionalism and a ‘new centrism’, the author draws together the theoretical and conceptual threads of the heterodox agenda. Several critical issues are outlined: the historical evolution of economic development approaches; the lack of coherency and consensus in conceptual, theoretical, and policy terms; the underdeveloped empirical base and; the translation into policy and institutional practice. This discussion informs an analytical framework based upon the central dimensions of heterodoxy, experimentation, context specificity, and governance. Empirical analysis of the substance of the new heterodoxy is undertaken by focusing upon a new institutional experiment for organising economic development—the task force—and drawing upon evidence from the national (UK), regional (North East of England), and local (South Tyneside) levels. The argument is that there is a mixed picture with patchy evidence of the emergence of the heterodox agenda, comprising genuine experimentation and innovation, coexisting and interrelating with substantial continuities and the extension and reinforcement of established practices. It is concluded that the currently dominant narrative and technocratic mode of ‘quasi-governance’ of economic development requires a renewed and democratised politics to open up discussion of alternative responses to the fundamental questions of what kind of economic development is desired and for whom. Strengthened democratic structures as part of the devolution process in the UK nations and regions may offer the potential to begin this debate. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research has been devised as a critical analysis of the aspects of conservation in the urban environment for any study of conservation. It is necessary to thoroughly investigate the changing socio-cultural dynamics of the society, which seeks to reveal the changing social and cultural meanings and ideologies in the production of the physical environment. In that sense, any conservation process needs to be a conceptual exercise concerned with both spatial and social processes. In other words, a conservation process is made up of a complex dynamic system in which spatial form and social processes are in continuous interaction with each other. To neglect one of these two processes would change the progressive angle of conservation, which aims to emphasize the conveying of significant messages from past to present.  Lefebvre defines the complex and contradictory nature of space in terms of social relations: space is not only supported by social relations but it is also producing and produced by social relations, every society in history shapes its distinctive social space and spatial environment (Lefebvre, 1993). Since the urban landscape is a social construct, it follows that understanding the man-landscape interaction is also a cultural bond. This meaning also helps as a constituent element in changing the cultural practice in the urbanization of cities. Therefore, for an accurate a proper conceptualization of space, we must look back at human practice with respect to it. In this way, spatial forms are seen not as inanimate objects within which social processes unfold, but as things which “contain” social processes in the same manner that social processes are spatial (Harvey, 1973: 10-11).  To understand the spatial form of any place or site to be conserved it is necessary to define the architectural quality of that space the social processes with reference to some social activity as well as the symbolic qualities of that form. Any successful strategy must appreciate that spatial form and social process are different ways of thinking about the same thing (Harvey, 1973: 26). Architecture, with a specific function, defines and arranges spatial units in terms of actual spatial relationships interwoven with the social identity and culture of the people. In addition, there is an aesthetic quality of that spatial form: something creative, conceptual, imaginary and artistic carrying various symbolic meanings. According to Harvey, the shaping of space which goes on in architecture and, therefore in the city, is symbolic of our culture, symbolic of the existing social order, symbolic of our aspirations, our needs, and our fears. Therefore, if we are to evaluate the spatial form of any urban landscape we must understand its creative meaning as well as its mere physical dimensions (Harvey, 1973: 31). This creative–symbolic meaning and its complex impact upon behaviour, as it is mediated by a cognitive process, helps construct a \"public memory\".  The urban landscape has a specific power to enhance the social meaning of public places, to develop new public relations / processes and nurture citizens’ public memory. Identity is intimately linked to memory: both our personal memories and collective or social memories are interconnected with the histories of our families, neighbours and communities. Urban landscapes are storehouses for these social memories (Hayden, 1997: 9). It follows that the urban landscape is a social and spatial arena that stimulates visual memory to enhance urban consciousness and public history, like a museum of public culture.  In that sense, the meaning of conservation should cover not only the preservation of the material substance of the ground (that is, the material substance of the physical environment) but also the social and symbolic meaning of it. This paper will attempt to explore some of the ways that social history is embedded in urban landscape and within this conceptual framework, the conservation of a specific urban landscape also re-constructs public history and re-builds an urban consciousness.</jats:p>",

The Supply‐Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model developed by the Supply Chain Council provides a framework for characterizing supply‐chain management practices and processes that result in best‐in‐class performance. However, which of these practices have the most influence on supply chain performance? This exploratory study investigates the relationship between supply‐chain management planning practices and supply chain performance based on the four decision areas provided in SCOR Model Version 4.0 (PLAN, SOURCE, MAKE, DELIVER) and nine key supply‐chain management planning practices derived from supply‐chain management experts and practitioners. The results show that planning processes are important in all SCOR supply chain planning decision areas. Collaboration was found to be most important in the Plan, Source and Make planning decision areas, while teaming was most important in supporting the Plan and Source planning decision areas. Process measures, process credibility, process integration, and information technology were found to be most critical in supporting the Deliver planning decision area. Using these results, the study discusses the implications of the findings and suggests several avenues for future research.</jats:p>",

For Zaireen, it is a place of blessings of saint, point of power for political authorities and source of income for Waqf administration.  In first part of this paper, three types of influences acting at Muslim shrines have been studied to explore the charisma of life and institutional arrangement at Khanaqah. Ideological influences are purely concerned with Shaykh and his cult, devotees and their beliefs. Political influences deal with Waqf administration at government as well as private level and third, the Economic influences deal with sources and management of income from all sources at Dargah. The manner in which these three types of influences affect the building form and spatial configuration at shrine complex is focused in second part of the study.</jats:p>",

I argue that linear, teleological forms of history are employed by courts to continually reiterate the myth of a legitimate assertion of colonial sovereignty. By doing so, any potential for political transformation that lies in the objective of reconciliation is stunted; political challenges brought in the form of aboriginal rights claims are folded back into the existing political, economic, and juridical structures of the nation-state. I conclude with an examination of how spatializing history in a nonlinear, nonteleological way could open up possibilities for political change and transformation. </jats:p>",

Family planning approval is addressed both from individual and couple perspectives. Analysis of BDHS data shows that about 85% of the wives report that their husbands approve of family planning, which is lower than the wives’ own approval rate (95%). Using the couple data set, husbands’ characteristics were matched to the wives’ responses on family planning approval. Regression analyses show that age, education, access to TV, inter-spousal communication, current use of family planning and the number of living children significantly determine family planning approval among both men as well as couples. Family planning approval was found to be much lower in Sylhet than in the other administrative divisions. Multilevel modelling analysis suggests almost negligible variation at the community level. The findings indicate the need for careful evaluation of the DHS questions in order to measure appropriately men’s family planning attitudes.</jats:p>",

This paper considers a dynamic VRPTW with stochastic customers, where the goal is to maximize the number of serviced customers. It presents a multiple scenario approach (MSA) that continuously generates routing plans for scenarios including known and future requests. Decisions during execution use a distinguished plan chosen, at each decision, by a consensus function. The approach was evaluated on vehicle routing problems adapted from the Solomon benchmarks with a degree of dynamism varying between 30% and 80%. They indicate that MSA exhibits dramatic improvements over approaches not exploiting stochastic information, that the use of consensus function improves the quality of the solutions significantly, and that the benefits of MSA increase with the (effective) degree of dynamism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study examined the performance of four different landscape metrics in a landscape ecological forest planning situation in Catalonia: (1) proportion of suitable habitat (non-spatial) (%H); (2) spatial autocorrelation; (3) the proportion of habitat-habitat boundary of the total compartment boundary (H-H) and (4) the proportion of habitat-non-habitat boundary (H-nonH). They were analysed in a case study problem that aimed at the maintenance and improvement of capercaillie habitats in two simulated forests of 14,400 hectares consisting mainly of Pinus uncinata, P. sylvestris and P. nigra stands. The habitats were determined by using a stand-level habitat suitability index (HSI). Stands in which the HSI exceed a specified threshold value were considered as habitats. Then, four different planning problems were formulated to test the four landscape metrics as one of the management objectives. The objective functions of the problems were written in the form of an additive utility model, and the problems were solved using heuristic optimization techniques. Before this, five different heuristic optimization techniques: random ascent; Hero, simulated annealing (SA), tabu search and genetic algorithms (GA), were compared in a non-spatial and a spatial planning problem. Based on these comparisons, GA was selected for solving the spatial planning problems while SA was used for non-spatial problems. The spatial pattern of habitat patches was comparable when using the %H, H-H or spatial autocorrelation as a management objective. However, the limitations of using the non-spatial %H objective were clear in the second forest landscape with lacking trends in forest features. H-H and spatial autocorrelation yielded a more clustered landscape with larger habitat patches. The largest proportions of habitat and habitat–habitat boundaries were created when using the H-H as the ecological management objective. The use of spatial autocorrelation as a management objective resulted in a smaller habitat area and shorter habitat-habitat boundary than when %H and H-H were used as objectives, but the proportion of large habitat patches was rather high. H-H was very suitable for connecting habitat patches. When H-nonH was used as the ecological management objective a very fragmented landscape was generated.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ensuring sustainability of interventions undertaken as part of post disaster reconstruction is one of the crucial challenges confronting the developing world. There are enough examples to show that in many cases, reconstruction serves to reinforce and sometimes-even increase the vulnerability of local communities. This is well exemplified in India by the case of reconstruction following Latur earthquake in 1993, Orissa super cyclone in 1999 and Gujarat earthquake of January 2001.   In the light of these challenges, the paper will elaborate on the methodology, tools and techniques for integrated risk management, which is readdressed from a holistic and dynamic perspective. The term ‘risk’ is redefined in an integrated manner with respect to exposure to one or more hazards as well as other factors determining vulnerability in developing countries. The term ‘vulnerability’ is assessed not only as product of hazard exposure but in a progressive manner resulting from social, economic and underdevelopment processes, before, during and after disaster situations.   The paper will further attempt to redefine disasters as a continuum where actions taken during various phases have an impact on each other, thereby emphasizing the need for establishing various backward and forward linkages while deciding different actions and interventions at various stages.   The paper will conclude by elaborating on the proactive tools, techniques, strategies and actions for risk assessment and control at various stages with respect to a disaster situation and thus address various types of risks in an integrated and dynamic manner.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine struggles over space, mobility, and indigenous human geographies that centred on the reducciones (reductions), colonial towns that were created for the purpose of controlling indigenous populations in 16th-century Spanish Peru. Drawing on recent geographical debates about ‘domination’ and ‘resistance’, I question assumptions, encountered in many studies of the reducciones, about the homogeneity and coherence of Spanish concepts of colonial spatial order, and seek to demonstrate that these settlements were located at the centre of complex struggles that went far beyond binary oppositions between Andeans and Spaniards. Rather than emphasising the manner in which the reducciones were implemented by colonial authorities as instruments of spatial and behavioural control, I draw attention to the ambivalence and diversity of Spanish reactions to the reducciones and the ways in which indigenous spatial practices were closely entwined with those of the colonisers. By reinserting the reducciones into the messy matrix of everyday colonial life, I aim to contribute to current efforts to question and dismantle the dualisms upon which colonialism was itself founded. </jats:p>",

It encompasses land of unique natural beauty, some of which is occupied by Arab‐Israeli families. Statutory plans defining the park's boundaries were enacted more than twenty years ago. Despite ongoing preparation, however, the park has not yet opened to the public, in part because of continuous conflict between the Israeli government authorities and the resident families over property rights affecting construction, land use, and nature preservation.</jats:p><jats:p>In 2000, after a long period of stagnation and discord, the Joint Environmental Mediation Service ( JEMS), guided by its founding organizations — the Consensus Building Institute and the Israel–Palestine Center for Research and Information — led a mediation process in the region. This was the first such process in the history of Israeli land‐use planning. The mediation resulted in a settlement that was agreed to and signed by nearly all parties on July 8, 2004. The agreement allows residents to remain on their land and it includes incentives, such as park employment, to ensure that they help preserve the natural environment. Plans based on this agreement are currently undergoing state ratification, although several implementation challenges are yet to be resolved.</jats:p><jats:p>This case points to the importance of having a mediation team knowledgeable about and sensitive to local cultural norms and the difficulties of ensuring appropriate representation in the absence of a strong civic culture and organized advocacy groups.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author's aim is to construct and validate empirically a theoretical model that allows performance and competitiveness in firms located in industrial districts to be explained. From the strategic perspective adopted, economic revenues are explained by three types of advantage: shared advantages, competitive advantages, and comparative advantages. Neither integration in the district, nor its attraction due to the shared competences within it, are significant predictors of performance. Empirical results indicate that organisational performance is largely explained by the joint effect of firm distinctive competences and cluster-shared competences. It was also found that the greater the degree of a firm's embeddedness in an industrial district, the greater the effect of its distinctive competences on organisational performance. This evidence suggests that firms which are better endowed with resources and capabilities find the development of sustainable competitive advantages easier when they locate in industrial clusters, as they are more capable of capitalising on the potential for economic rents that these clusters offer. Therefore, the internal heterogeneity of the cluster stems from the different patterns of appropriation of shared competences. In addition, firm embeddedness in an industrial district is also revealed as a moderating variable in the relationship between shared competences and global performance/average return on assets, explained by the positive effects of the participation in models, values, and knowledge flows circulating within the cluster. </jats:p>",

Five online staff development modules were beta tested by members of the state teams as a strategy for ensuring that all participants in the planning process possessed a common understanding of online staff development. The project was organized around 2 two-day planning retreats supplemented by a series of planning tasks. In addition, two studies were conducted as a way to inform the planning process: (a) a study of barriers to online staff development and (b) a study of the conditions or parameters of online staff development.

When the responsibility and resource-based facets of decentralisation are taken together a marked congruency is evident between the two trends. Various spatial economic forces promote the emergence of core and peripheral regions, and devolution, by establishing the autonomy of these regions, allows these forces a greater impact. We argue that this is because decentralisation initiatives carry with them implicit fiscal, political, and administrative costs, which fall more heavily upon those regions with limited adjustment capacities, resulting in differential rates at which regions can capitalise upon the opportunities offered by devolution. The global tendency towards devolution therefore reflects a subtle, but profound, renunciation of the traditional equalisation role of national government in favour of conditions fostering economic and public competition and leading to greater development of initially rich and powerful regions to the detriment of poorer areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At the Rio Earth Summit of 1992 governments undertook to develop and adopt national sustainable development strategies as a key component of implementing the goals of Agenda 21. Only partial progress was reported at the 2002 World Summit in Johannesburg, with uncertainty as to the effectiveness of those strategies that had been introduced. This paper describes a methodology for assessing a country's progress in implementing a national sustainable development strategy (NSDS) and for identifying potential areas for improvement. Five key principles of sustainable development and strategic planning are identified, and a set of assessment criteria are proposed for testing their implementation. The results of applying the methodology in two Eastern European countries, Belarus and Slovakia, are reported. These case studies suggest that the proposed NSDS assessment methodology has considerable potential for strengthening sustainability planning at the national level. The effectiveness of the NSDS assessment methodology in strengthening national processes for sustainable development and strategic planning will also require greater transparency and accountability in governance practices. This suggests that progress in improving the quality of NSDS processes is likely to be conditional on broader considerations of institution building and governance reform. </jats:p>",

The new spatial possibilities of internet‐based technologies provide a powerful route to innovative marketing strategies. Consequently, organisations of all sizes are finding it necessary to establish a web presence to increase their ability to survive in an increasingly dynamic and competitive business environment. Strategically, firms need to be creative and innovative in order to deal effectively with the e‐marketing opportunities the internet can deliver. The findings of a comparative study conducted in Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and New Zealand provide evidence of primitive and localised exploitation of the technology, a general lack of enthusiasm about its possibilities, and a perception that there are many barriers to successfully adding value at the customer interface. It is hoped that the somewhat pessimistic tone of the analysis will be taken as an opportunity to win competitive advantage in the knowledge‐intensive service sector, rather than a reason to postpone adoption of internet‐enabled technology.</jats:p>",

The available statistical evidence for women's participation in business ownership in the United Kingdom is reviewed against comparative data from the USA that is promoted by the UK government as a potential benchmark. We argue that programming and resource-issue problems are evidenced in new policies that are a direct consequence of lack of data. Next, policy is tested against various paradigmatic stances in women's enterprise support, and problematic areas in poverty alleviation, social inclusion, advocacy, access to finance, and gender mainstreaming are discussed. Selected literature that addresses barriers identified to women's enterprise is reviewed, and issues of confidence, risk, motivation to business start-up, and childcare are discussed in terms of programming. We conclude that, although the Department of Trade and Industry/Small Business Service Strategic Framework for Women's Enterprise in England is flawed, the framework has assembled a broad church of opinions and approaches to women's enterprise support in a democratic, participative, and cross-cutting fashion. </jats:p>",

Microsoft, ICI, UBS and Procter &amp; Gamble are a few of the firms that have claimed it has changed the way they work (Gartner, 2002). Indeed, substantial claims are made about the software's capabilities. A complete system could take several years and several hundred million dollars to deploy. SAP, Oracle, Baan and PeopleSoft are the market leaders and SAP has over 20,000 R/3 products installed worldwide; Oracle has installed databases in nearly every one of the world's top 500 companies. This paper surveys the literature and identifies that there is increasing evidence that firms fail to obtain the benefits of these investments within the anticipated timeframes (Pollock et al., 2003). Moreover, and more worrying for senior managers is the extent to which these fully integrated systems using on-line transactional processing are affecting the firm's innovative ability. We argue in this paper that there is a fundamental clash of underlying principles between ERP systems requirements and the success factors of innovative organisations that lie at the heart of the innovation dilemma caused by the introduction of ERP systems into organisations.</jats:p>",

This paper assesses the vulnerability to erosion of the soils in the upper Torysa catchment down to the planned drinking water reservoir at Tichy Potok (Slovakia). Experimental observations in the Torysa catchment, together with the outputs of the AGricultural Non-Point Source pollution model (AGNPS), have been used to select optimal sites for small sediment-trapping dams on the Torysa tributaries. The rainfall scenario for the upper Torysa was determined from records at the Plavec climate station from 1980–1998. In addition, an extreme rainfall event scenario was envisaged (100 mm rainfall in three hours); AGNPS model simulations suggest that such an event might produce as much as half or even the total amount of sediment generated by all the rainfalls over the whole period of simulation, 1980–1998.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses upon a comparison of the experiences of regionalisation in Spain and the United Kingdom. Spain's process of devolution, initiated in the late 1980s, has led to an asymmetrical structure of devolution with certain regions, such as Catalonia and the Basque Country, acquiring more autonomy than others. However, the slogan ‘ café para todos’ (coffee for everyone) has in recent years been employed by Catalan and other nationalists to argue that the State of Autonomies has not respected the special status of Spain's historic communities and has diluted their claims for greater levels of self-government. It is precisely such a model of asymmetrical autonomy that has been adopted in the United Kingdom since 1997, the implications of which remain to be seen. As this paper explores, however, there are already signs emerging that the United Kingdom is following a similar trajectory to that in Spain, which is why the comparisons are particularly important and timely. Indeed, the authors argue that adopting a model of asymmetrical autonomy can lead, even at an early stage, to the emergence of regional identities in regions with no previous manifestations of regional consciousness, the rise in territorial tension after devolution, and the backlash by the historic regions against a ‘one size fits all’ or uniform approach towards devolution. </jats:p>",

Using an ℓ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-penalty formulation and the theory of extended saddle points, we propose a global-search strategy that looks for local minima in the original-variable space of the ℓ<jats:sub>1</jats:sub>-penalty function and for local maxima in the penalty space. Our approach improves over a previous scheme that partitions constraints along the temporal horizon. The previous scheme leads to many global constraints that relate states in adjacent stages, which means that an incorrect assignment of states in an earlier stage of the horizon may violate a global constraint in a later stage of the horizon. To resolve the violated global constraint in this case, state changes will need to propagate sequentially through multiple stages, often leading to a search that gets stuck in an infeasible point for an extended period of time. In this paper, we propose to partition all the constraints by subgoals and to add new global constraints in order to ensure that state assignments of a subgoal are consistent with those in other subgoals. Such an approach allows the information on incorrect state assignments in one subgoal to propagate quickly to other subgoals. Using MIPS as the basic planner in a partitioned implementation, we demonstrate significant improvements in time and quality in solving some PDDL2.1 benchmark problems. </jats:p>",

Using a large-sample, quantitative methodology, we examine three broad sets of determinants hypothesised to influence geographic patterns of policy convergence: (1) cross-national market integration; (2) compatibility between the domestic regulatory context and European policy requirements; and (3) bottom-up pressure from market and societal actors. Our analysis provides empirical support for all three hypothesised determinants. Measures of import–export ties, regulatory burden, past policy adoptions, environmental demand from civil society, and levels of economic productivity are all found to be statistically significant predictors of national EMAS counts. Against a backdrop of geographically diverse regulatory institutions, societal conditions, and trading relationships, we conclude that unevenness is an inevitable feature of Europeanisation. </jats:p>",

It was realized that the conservation of traditional architecture is a fundamental issue as it is in developed countries.   This has resulted in setting up policies, organizations and legal arrangements in accordance with our national conditions, to transfer our cultural and natural wealth to coming generations through conserving, revitalizing and renewing them.   The law of 1973 marks the beginning of contemporary and scientific conservation activities, which is quite late when compared to European countries. But since that period due to increasing awareness of issues to do with conservation and the renewal of the historic / traditional environment, with the implementation of law 2863 and article about the execution of the Conservation and renewal plans, the Ministry of Culture accelerated the planning process by commissioning the preparation of conservation and renewal plans for traditional urban sites, to be prepared by multi disciplinary teams. Since then about thirty conservation and renewal plans have been realised by the Ministry of Culture. One of these is the Mardin Conservation Plan approved by the relevant regional committee in 1993.   This paper discusses the legal and organisational aspects of conservation and the renewal of cultural and natural entities in Turkey, the related responsible bodies and the approaches to the application of building regulations of the Mardin Conservation and Development Plan.

We review the recent work on state restructuring/rescaling and the associated work on the new regionalism, on the one hand, and that on ‘global’ city-regions, on the other. We identify key points of overlap and divergence between these two literatures and suggest that each understates the role of class interests, political alliance formation, and conflicts around the management of collective consumption and social reproduction. We proceed to outline the framework of an alternative and complementary approach in which causal emphasis is placed on the shaping of subnational state geographies by actually existing struggles and strategies developed around particular geographies of public and private investment and collective consumption, and their associated state fiscal, electoral, and regulatory arrangements. We argue that working from this position we are better able to understand why the city-region continues to constitute a strategically vital arena for managing conflict and struggle in contemporary capitalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Business Link is a government-financed support body for small firms in England in which local franchisees provide a range of business advice services. Franchisees must act as independent bodies with the franchise as their ‘only line of business’. Yet franchisees are of various types: some are de facto partnerships, some are linked to chambers of commerce, some are linked to other bodies, and some are private sector companies. Although all are arm's length of any related organisation, and work to a standardised contract and target regime, it is possible that the type of franchisee makes a difference to the management of the franchise, how the targets are prioritised, and how this affects referrals and links to other service providers. This in turn could be reflected in the level of market penetration and user experiences. This paper assesses, using analysis of variance, the relationship of the type of franchisee with propensity to charge fees, market penetration, impact, and customer satisfaction. It shows that there are significant effects of the franchise on client impact and satisfaction, but not on market penetration. In general, chambers of commerce and private sector franchisees perform best. But there is immense variability of all measures of performance, with all franchise types providing both high performing and poorly performing Business Links. This variability, which is of long standing, provides one of the strongest challenges to the credibility and justification for providing a government-financed support system. Within this pattern, fees in general have little statistical relationship with client satisfaction. </jats:p>",

We analyzed neuronal activity while monkeys performed a behavioral task in which two visual instruction cues were given successively with a delay: one cue instructed the location of the reach target, and the other instructed arm use (right or left). After a second delay, the monkey received a motor-set cue to be prepared to make the reaching movement as instructed. Finally, after a GO signal, it reached for the instructed target with the instructed arm. We found the following apparent differences in activity: 1) neuronal activity preceding the appearance of visual cues was more frequent in the pre-SMA; 2) a majority of pre-SMA neurons, but many fewer SMA neurons, responded to the first or second cue, reflecting what was shown or instructed; 3) in addition, pre-SMA neurons often reflected information combining the instructions in the first and second cues; 4) during the motor-set period, pre-SMA neurons preferentially reflected the location of the target, while SMA neurons mainly reflected which arm to use; and 5) when executing the movement, a majority of SMA neurons increased their activity and were largely selective for the use of either the ipsilateral or contralateral arm. In contrast, the activity of pre-SMA neurons tended to be suppressed. These findings point to the functional specialization of the two areas, with respect to receiving associative cues, information processing, motor behavior planning, and movement execution. </jats:p>",

This paper examines the impact of grant assistance to Northern Ireland small firms delivered over the period 1994–97 by the former Local Enterprise Development Unit through its Growth Business Support Programme (GBSP). Previous work by the authors showed that there was some tentative evidence to suggest a link between employment growth and grant aid provided to very small firms (fewer than 10 employees) assisted under the GBSP. The central objective of the empirical work reported in this paper is to extend the previous analysis by understanding the extent to which the value of financial assistance influences growth (employment, turnover, and productivity measures) and if differential impacts arise depending on the nature and timing (lag structures) of the grant assistance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I analyze questions of displacement and exclusion through the lens of sexual commerce and its regulation. Using three frames of analysis, including a historical reading of the figure of the prostitute in Western law and culture, an analysis of a model exclusionary zoning law, the ‘Prostitution-free Zone Ordinance’, and a reflection upon the changing position of sex workers within heavily mediated contemporary networks of global e-rotic commerce, I argue that the prostitute is an originary figure of exclusion relative to homo sacer, the masculine sacred outlaw, who is an originary figure of displacement. I bracket popular themes of agency, resistance, and performance to interrogate a disturbing reactionary trend: just as important strides have been made in constituting sex workers and performers as rights-bearing legal subjects and workers, we see a reconfiguration of sexual labor through globalization and technology that renders incomprehensible any traditional subject of labor and rights, and a resurgence of legal and regulatory strategies of total exclusion or banishment. I conclude by positing a theory of ‘differential exclusion’ to describe the positioning of similarly situated sex workers relative to constructions of legality. In contrast to the theory of differential inclusion, which argues that groups are organized differentially and hierarchically through the notion of biopower, according to the relative value of their labor at any given historical moment, the theory of differential exclusion focuses on those groups whose labor is disacknowledged entirely, and who are consequently organized relative to categories of criminality and to their exclusion as subjects of labor and biopower. The work emphasizes both the critical importance and the difficulty of conceiving novel discourses and strategies for achieving worker status and human rights for women and men working in all segments of the sex industry. </jats:p>",

Despite the widespread consensus regarding the need for evaluation, the issue of how to evaluate, and the associated methodological considerations, continue to be issues of considerable debate. The authors develop an approach to estimate the net additionally of financial assistance from Enterprise Ireland to indigenously owned firms in Ireland for the period 2000 to 2002. With a sample of Enterprise Ireland assisted firms, an innovative, self-assessment, in-depth, face-to-face, interview methodology was adopted. The authors also explore a way of incorporating the indirect benefits of assistance into derived deadweight estimates—an issue which is seldom discussed in the context of deadweight estimates. They conclude by reflecting on the key methodological lessons learned from the evaluation process, and highlight some pertinent evaluation issues which should form the focus of much future discussion in this field of research. </jats:p>",

The robot-sensor system is required to explore the environment for obstacles and free space. We present an information theoretical approach in which the sensing action is viewed as reducing ignorance of the planning space, the C-space of the robot. The concept of C-space entropy is introduced as a measure of this ignorance. The next view in the planning process is so chosen that it maximizes the expected reduction of C-space entropy, called the maximal (expected) entropy reduction (MER) criterion. We derive closed-form expressions for expected entropy reduction for an idealized point field-of-view sensor under a Poisson point process model of the environment. We show via simulations and real experiments that the MER criterion is significantly more efficient in sensor-based path planning and exploration tasks than other purely physical space based criteria previously used in the literature. </jats:p>",

Among the regions that have established reliable evaluation systems, some have tried to incorporate issues relating to sustainable development, thereby complying with European and national demands. But an overview of experiments made in the different French regions shows a wide variety of situations, with no single coordinated procedure allowing comparisons to be drawn. By way of example, the way this integration is implemented in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region is presented. In this region, political backing, due largely to the presence of green representatives in the regional council, enabled considerable upstream work to be carried out, notably concerning strategic environmental evaluation and policy evaluation with regard to sustainable development. Finally, the paper presents the outcomes of the evaluation process with regard to sustainable regional development: an effect of inter-institutional decompartmentalisation leading to greater transversality have been noticed, as well as a process of an active awareness-raising. But a gap between technical and political levels is still noticeable. </jats:p>",

This legal transformation facilitated the expropriation and reallocation of formerly Arab land to primarily Jewish hands and was therefore a central component of the legal reordering of space within Israel after 1948. Based on close examination of Israeli legislation, archival documents, Knesset proceedings, and other sources we delineate a 12-year legislative process consisting of four phases, each concluding with the enactment of major legislation. The process was led by senior and second-tier Israeli officials, and the result was the construction of a new Israeli legal geography. The culmination of the process was the integration of appropriated Arab land into the country's new system of Jewish-Israeli ‘national land’ known as ‘Israel Lands’. </jats:p>",

In this paper, a new chain-code representation is developed to record the motion path when forward and backward movements are allowed. By placing the smooth turning-angle constraint, we can obtain more realistic results to the actual motion of cars. Meanwhile, by combining rotational mathematical morphology and distance transformation, we can obtain the shortest collision-free path. As soon as the distance map and the collision-free codes have been established offline, the shortest paths of cars starting from any location toward the destination can be promptly obtained online. Experimental results show that our algorithm works successfully in different conditions. We also extend our algorithm to the automated parallel parking and three-dimensional path planning. </jats:p>",

Study participants in three Midwestern nursing homes included residents and family members, MDS coordinators, direct care staff, administrators, directors of nursing, and medical directors. Data were collected via semi-structured interview, observation, and resident record audit. The care-planning process differed among the three facilities despite the common MDS system structure. Care planning and the MDS system were linked to the care provided to residents through documentation in residents' records, translation of the MDS care plan to the documents used for daily care, and ongoing communication through end-of-shift report and other venues.</jats:p>",

One such technique uses cross‐linking (chemical or by cysteine oxidation) to confirm or select among proposed structural models (e.g., from fold recognition, ab initio prediction, or docking) by testing the consistency between cross‐linking data and model geometry. This paper develops a probabilistic framework for analyzing the information content in cross‐linking experiments, accounting for anticipated experimental error. This framework supports a mechanism for planning experiments to optimize the information gained. We evaluate potential experiment plans using explicit trade‐offs among key properties of practical importance: discriminability, coverage, balance, ambiguity, and cost. We devise a greedy algorithm that considers those properties and, from a large number of combinatorial possibilities, rapidly selects sets of experiments expected to discriminate pairs of models efficiently. In an application to residue‐specific chemical cross‐linking, we demonstrate the ability of our approach to plan experiments effectively involving combinations of cross‐linkers and introduced mutations. We also describe an experiment plan for the bacteriophage λ Tfa chaperone protein in which we plan dicysteine mutants for discriminating threading models by disulfide formation. Preliminary results from a subset of the planned experiments are consistent and demonstrate the practicality of planning. Our methods provide the experimenter with a valuable tool (available from the authors) for understanding and optimizing cross‐linking experiments.</jats:p>",
