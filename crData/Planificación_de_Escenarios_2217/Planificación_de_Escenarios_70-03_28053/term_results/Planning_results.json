June, <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic> conducted a survey of the leading industries in the United States and reported on some of the problems that would have to be solved before an automatic factory could become a reality. Diebold wrote on the problems of automation and its implications for the businessman and his future decisions. He cites what was perhaps the first automatic factory: a continuous process flour mill, built in 1784, near Philadelphia, by Oliver Evans. No human labour was required after the grain was received at the mill until the finished product, flour, was removed. It is also interesting to note that in the early 1800's there were thousands of programmed looms operating in France, controlled by punched paper cards.</jats:p>",

The formal structure of the model is presented first, and this provides the background to a discussion of the problems involved in estimating the model's parameter values, and in choosing sensitive and meaningful statistics to measure the model's goodness of fit. It is shown that statistics such as R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> measuring the fit of the distributions of population and employment, are extremely insensitive to changes in the parameter values, and that the most sensitive and useful statistic for calibration is the mean trip length. Certain shortcuts in calibrating the model are also suggested by these results and these can be used to get good first approximations of the parameter values. </jats:p>",

Secondly, it illustrates the feasibility of generalizing these quality measurements of sample dwellings to all city blocks using widely available explanatory variables. The analysis finds strong inferential evidence of an important, but elusive, relationship among the level of public services provided to particular dwelling units (police protection and schools), measures of residential quality, and the market's valuation of these units. The models described in this paper relate to an important range of urban renewal questions. For example, they can be used to obtain lower bound estimates of the potential benefits of urban renewal programs. </jats:p>",

This policy is thought to increase the immediate response to local mobilisation efforts and make initiatives more lasting. The establishment of supporting institutions will require the direction of a great part of the developmental efforts to reforming the government apparatus at regional and national level. However, because it will seldom be possible to make many successful reforms at higher levels at the same time, concentration of development efforts on a few sectors is in most cases the only realistic policy. This is apparently incompatible with a very comprehensive, multi‐sectoral approach to local development. With regard to local communities, a policy which concentrates on a limited number of activities at a time is also likely to create better chances of active popular participation in and some local diversification of the development process, as opposed to pressing overall transformation efforts which may well result in apathy and a tendency to increased dependence on the government.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p>Cet essai met en évidence le besoin qu'il y a à soutenir, en priorité, les institutions qui tentent de mobiliser les initiatives locales en vue du développement. Une telle politique devrait accélérer la réponse à la mobilisation des efforts au niveau local et rendre ces initiatives plus durables. L'institution d'une telle politique exigerait qu'une part importante des efforts de développement soit orientée vers une réforme des structures gouvernementales aux niveaux national et régional. Cependant, et parce qu'il est rarement possible de réaliser en même temps plusieurs réformes aux niveauxles plus élevés, la concentration des efforts de développement dans quelques secteurs est, dans la plupart des cas, la seule politique réaliste. Ceci est, en apparence, incompatible avec une approche globale, multi‐sectorielle, du développement local. Si l'on se réfère à la situation des communautés locales, une politique concentrée sur un nombre limité d'activités, créera probablement des conditions plus favorables à une participation populaire active et une diversification du processus de développement, qu'un effort en vue d'une transformation globale, rapide, qui peut engendrer l'apathie et une dépendance croissante vis‐à‐vis du gouvernment.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Der Artikel unterstreicht die Notwendigkeit, bei den Bemühungen zur Mobilisierung der lokalen Initiative für die Entwicklungsarbeit der unterstützenden Institution Vorrang zu geben. Es wird angenommen, daß eine solche Politik das unmittelbare Echo auf die örtliche Mobilisierung und Bemühungen erhöht und die Initiative dauerhafter macht. Die Bildung von unterstützenden Institutionen erfordert, daß ein großer Teil der Entwicklungsanstrengungen darauf gerichtet wird, den Regierungsapparat auf regionaler und nationaler Ebene zu reformieren. Es wird jedoch selten möglich sein, viele erfolgreiche Reformen auf höheren Ebenen gleichzeitig zu machen. Daher ist es in den meisten Fällen am realistischsten, die Entwicklungsarbeit auf einige wenige Sektoren zu konzentrieren. Dieses verträgt sich offenbar nicht mit einem umfassenden vielsektoralen Angriff auf die lokale Entwicklung. Bei den dörflichen Gemeinschaften wird eine Politik, die sich auf eine begrenzte Zahl von Aktivitäten konzentriert, wahrscheinlich bessere Chancen aktiver Teilnahme der Bevölkerung haben und dadurch den Entwicklungsprozeß etwas vielfältiger gestalten. Dagegen könnte der Versuch, eine allgemeine Transformation mit Druck durchzusetzen, sehr wohl zur Apathie führen und zu einer Tendenz wachsender Abhängigkeit von der Regierung.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Some of the main characteristics of these four activities are identified, and it is argued that a basis for predicting the effectiveness of alternative organisational patterns can be developed through the analysis of different sources of uncertainty as perceived by those actually involved in the decision process. </jats:p>",

The main conclusion is that a projection of the trend of recent years could hardly be expected in spite of the fact that this is what most forecasts for retailing and centres are based upon. What is more likely to happen is a development in the form of a spiral movement which consequently makes it necessary to try other forecasting methods and other forms of mathematical models, different from the traditional ones. Such improved methods provide the basis also for an improved planning technique which in turn not only gives a split-second picture of the future situation, but also indicates how this situation is reached through extensive use of stage-planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The emphasis upon comprehensive regional water resources planning in the past decade has encouraged the hydrologic engineer to take advantage of improvements in technology to develop new hydrologic engineering techniques for use in regional planning studies. The new techniques are necessary because the traditional hydro‐logic engineering techniques are not always consistent with the increased scope and diversified objectives of regional planning studies.</jats:p><jats:p>The Hydrologic Engineering Center has been involved in aiding in the development of some of these new techniques as the result of studies that have been made in cooperation with other Corps of Engineers offices. Most of the new techniques being developed emphasize computational procedures developed specifically for use with electronic computers. Applications of new techniques range from framework studies to planning of day‐to‐day operation criteria. Studies recently completed or in progress include: (1) development of a regional flood control site screening plan for the North Atlantic Region study; (2) use of streamflow simulation for planning and operation of the Missouri River mainstem projects; (3) development of an operation plan for the Arkansas‐White‐Red Rivers Reservoir System; (4) standard project flood and flood frequency estimates for the Colorado River Basin Framework Study; and several other projects which are described in more detail in the following paragraphs.</jats:p><jats:p>One of the initial efforts in regional analysis was the formulation of procedures for determining standard project flood estimates for southern California coastal streams using generalized criteria. Techniques were developed that were readily adaptable to the computer and which would determine representative unit hydrographs, losses and standard project precipitation for any location in the study area. The resulting standard project flood estimates were consistent with the accuracy required for framework studies; however, they could be refined easily for design studies.</jats:p><jats:p>As a result of the recent drought in the Northeastern United States, a study was made to evaluate both present and future water supply reservoirs in that region. The study consisted of computerized studies of the hypothetical operation of a large number of reservoirs as a system. The reservoirs were on many different streams throughout the region and had varying constraints, depending upon the stream and the state in which the reservoir was located. Since only preliminary data was available on the proposed reservoirs, it was not possible to refine the studies to a large degree. However, the models of each system can be easily refined as more accurate design data become available.</jats:p><jats:p>The development of a computer‐aided screening procedure for use in evaluating several hundred potential reservoir sites for the Missouri River Basin Comprehensive Framework Study is a third example of regional analysis. The adopted procedures used available physical, hydrologic, and climatologic data in estimating reservoir storage requirements throughout the basin. Because the procedure is based upon the techniques often used in more refined studies, it is expected that the results of the screening study will be very useful in future planning and design work.</jats:p><jats:p>Shortcomings of some of the traditional techniques have helped in the development of new techniques. For maximum usefulness the new techniques should: (1) be consistent with the scope, objectives, and requirements of the overall study; (2) use all available physical, hydrologic, and climatologic data without requiring extensive data which may not be available; (3) take full advantage of the capabilities of the computer and associated data processing systems; and (4) produce results which form a firm basis for future, more detailed, planning and design studies instead of being limited in usefulness largely to the study at hand.</jats:p>",
