Offering a multiuniversity studio and study abroad course in Mexico, in conjunction with the World Congress in 2006, provided an opportunity to collaboratively address this need. The synergies that accrued are worth considering. An argument is made for adopting similar studio efforts as an integral component of future World Planning Congresses. </jats:p>",

It outlines the key contributions of the pragmatist and “neo-pragmatist” philosophers and identifies the influence of pragmatism on early concepts of planning as a rational process; on the perspectives of Friedmann, Lindblom, and Schon; on the development of Forester's “critical pragmatism”; and on other planning theory contributions in the 1980s and 1990s. The article concludes by identifying the importance of pragmatist ideas in emphasizing the dimensions of planning as a practically situated, social learning activity, which should draw on the full range of human capacities and promote the ability for critical, transformative systemic framing work in the public sphere. </jats:p>",

It traces the social and economic paths that led Buenos Aires from an industrial hub to a sprawling city that juxtaposes gated communities and informal settlements. After a brief review that places this research within the literature on gated communities, the organization of the article follows the chronology of Argentina's national governments from 1976 until 1999. The article links the changes in national industrialization policies with the allocation of land for the development of gated communities in Buenos Aires's suburbs. The article concludes with an assessment of the effects these spatial changes had on the suburban polity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The San Francisco freeway revolt was not just the first but the longest 1960s protest against superhighway construction in urban areas. Most accounts attribute this to the city's dramatic natural setting, which fostered an early and insistent aesthetic critique. This article identifies the critical condition in not the city but the state. In 1947, the California legislature reoriented its entire highway program from multipurpose roads to limited-access freeways designed to go directly into cities. Resituating the revolt in this context explains not just its precocity but its duration and intensity. What began as a reasonable assertion of local jurisdiction was transformed into a protracted standoff with the state by the vast new funding of the Interstate and Defense Highway Act of 1956. It also reveals how close the city came to losing the revolt, despite the legitimacy of its claims, and identifies a direct impact of this narrow victory on the emerging environmental movement. </jats:p>",

Advocates of CBR have mostly called not for regional governments, but for collaborative regional governance processes. This article examines the efforts of (CBOs) to form regional governance processes that target jobs from federally funded transportation projects to disadvantaged communities. Transportation policy has long been dominated by a policy monopoly centered on state departments of transportation and their highway engineers. By balancing conflict and collaboration, entrepreneurial CBOs have been able to penetrate this policy monopoly and negotiate successful local hiring agreements using collaborative regional governance processes. We conclude that success will be limited, however, without supportive federal and state policies. </jats:p>",

The planning literature has given considerable attention to participation in theory and practice, discussing its benefits for democratic governance, its multiple goals and criteria for assessing success. Although planning academics and practitioners understand the importance of participation and know that participatory processes often fail, the field of participation evaluation lags behind. This paper explores how often, why and how planners evaluate participation in practice. It builds on data collected through a nationally representative survey of 761 AICP-certified planners. We find that they rarely evaluate participation formally. Informal evaluations rely on a wide range of criteria about participation processes and outcomes consistent with the criteria identified by planning theory. The paper presents these evaluation criteria and the practices and recommendation of the planners with most experience in participation evaluation. </jats:p>",

This report explores the breadth and depth of advice currently offered to the European non-health sector. It describes independent advisory organisations and the national strategic plans of the 27 European Union member states, plus Turkey, Norway and Switzerland. It uses an analytical framework based on ‘areas’ of preparedness that emerged from the guidelines, and which encompass relatively broad conceptual issues, and ‘themes’ which capture more detailed issues covered in each area. The study identifies nine areas of preparedness and 65 themes across both sectors. It shows that substantial gaps, incoherence and inconsistencies exist in the guidance offered. Substantial challenges and opportunities remain for governments to improve the advice they provide to the non-health sector. Advisory organisations also need to improve the advice they offer to the non-health sector and ensure that it is coherent with government advice.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. This study presents a new methodology not only to evaluate willingness to pays (WTPs) for the improvement of hydrological vulnerability using a choice experiment (CE) method but also to do a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of some feasible alternatives combing the derived WTPs with an alternative evaluation index (AEI). The hydrological vulnerability consists of potential streamflow depletion (PSD), and potential water quality deterioration (PWQD) and can be quantified using a multi-criteria decision making technique and pressure-state-response (PSR) framework. PSD and PWQD not only provide survey respondents with sufficient site-specific information to avoid scope sensitivity in a choice experiment but also support the standard of dividing the study watershed into six sub-regions for site-fitted management. Therefore CE was applied to six regions one after the other, in order to determine WTPs for improvements on hydrological vulnerability considering the characteristics which are vulnerability, location, and preferences with regard to management objectives. The AEI was developed to prioritize the feasible alternatives using a continuous water quantity/quality simulation model as well as multi-criteria decision making techniques. All criteria for alternative performance were selected based on a driver-pressures-state-impact-response (DPSIR) framework, and their weights were estimated using an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In addition, the AEI that reflects on residents' preference with regard to management objectives was proposed in order to incite the stakeholder to participate in the decision making process. Finally, the economic values of each alternative are estimated by a newly developed method which combines the WTPs for improvements on hydrologic vulnerability with the AEI. This social-economic-engineering combined framework can provide the decision makers with more specific information as well as decrease the uncertainty of the CBA.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">This paper argues that most post-exercise or incident debriefs suggest that communications could have been better. It explores some of the difficulties of communicating in a crisis and suggests that if organisational culture does not allow for good communications in ‘peacetime’, then they are unlikely to be any better in a crisis situation. It is therefore suggested that crisis communications should be treated as a risk management issue and given a place on the corporate risk register so that the issue can be managed through an appropriate risk management action plan. The paper mainly focuses on internal communications although it also refers to the importance of media and external communications as part of an overall communications plan. Reference is made to the report following the Virginia Tech disaster in 2007 and the problems associated with communications in a university environment. The paper aims to provide the reader with a clearer understanding of some of the reasons why communications often fail in an incident and suggests some ways in which things may be improved in the future.</jats:p>"

Carl C. Taylor, who led the sociological research unit in the USDA’s Bureau of Agricultural Economics, and other rural sociologists shared a two-handed commitment to democracy. They merged social science with local knowledge and integrated federal action with citizen participation. These activist principles were best exemplified in a Third New Deal program called county land-use planning, within which sociologists played two roles. First, they \"delineated\" the boundaries of rural neighborhoods and communities so that the best representation of citizens on the local planning committees was obtained. With local citizen-researchers, Taylor’s sociologists delineated eleven thousand rural neighborhoods and nearly two thousand communities in thirty-two states. Second, they evaluated the planning program in a few select counties. The richest assessment was Arthur F. Raper’s study of Greene County, Georgia, \"Tenants of the Almighty.\" He found that, despite racism, the program made tremendous physical, economic, and psychological gains among the county’s poor blacks and whites. However, a conservative Congress aborted the federal democratic-planning program in 1942; soon thereafter these anti-New Dealers banished critical social science from the USDA. The likes of which have not been seen since, at least not in the United States.</jats:p>",

Healthcare administrative personnel and other emergency management professionals should begin their preparation by asking specific questions related to organisational readiness.

It is thanks to these people that SPE is what it is today: the largest and most inter-nationally diverse professional society serving our industry.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Like Bill and other presidents, my primary goal will be to give direction to the Long Range Plan, a plan that has been made and is owned by the entire Board of Directors. However, all presidents—and I am not different—also set out on their journey with personal aims, and have only 12 months to start to make them a reality. As I said in my JPT interview last month, one of my main objectives is to continue the drive for true globalization. We will be truly global when every member feels that SPE is not only the local section or a loosely connected group of national or regional organizations, but rather a single organization of professionals, united for a common purpose, that belongs to each and every one of us. \"Your SPE\" means it does not matter what job you do, where you are located, or what nationality you are—SPE is yours.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>My priority will be to interact with our members by visiting as many regions and sections as possible to listen and report back to both all of you and the SPE Board of Directors. My monthly column will take the form of a \"paper blog\" in which I will describe my visits to sections around the world, share their good ideas, and seek solutions to local challenges. In support of this, I asked staff to set up a \"debating forum\" on SPE's home page: the President's Forum. Your feedback through this new forum will provide invaluable support to this effort. It is my vision that all members can debate and react to my column on this platform and I can join in to learn more about your needs and issues. I don't know whether this will work, but we will give it a try!</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>With 170 local sections worldwide and regional offices in London, Kuala Lumpur, Dubai, and Moscow, I have a hectic schedule ahead of me. In the next few months I will be visiting Russia, Australia and New Zealand, the U.S., the Middle East, and Malaysia. My first blog will feature a recent trip to China, which offered many fascinating insights.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Suivant une discussion des processus théoriques concernés, ce chapitre examine les mesures d’aménagement linguistique particulières pour lesquelles le Québec est devenu réputé et qui cherchent à y améliorer le statut du français (aménagement du statut), à assurer son adoption comme langue publique commune par tous les Québécois (aménagement de l’acquisition), ainsi qu’à enrichir la langue et à s’occuper de sa qualité (aménagement du corpus). Dans tous ces domaines, la politique et l’aménagement linguistiques du Québec sont aujourd’hui façonnés par les nouveaux défis posés par l’immigration et la mondialisation, ce qui témoigne d’une créativité et d’une capacité à s’adapter au changement qui font souvent défaut à la politique et à l’aménagement linguistiques d’autres contextes francophones.</jats:italic>\n                    </jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>As a French-speaking island in a predominantly English-speaking North America, Québec is often considered as a model in questions of language policy and planning.

In all these areas, Québec’s language policy and planning is today shaped by the new challenges presented by immigration and globalisation, demonstrating a creativity and an ability to adapt to change that are often lacking in the language policy and planning of other French-speaking contexts.</jats:p>",

Whole optimization and the partial purification of the assembly craft will all have the huge economic efficiency, and obviously strengthen the emulative power of automobile production enterprise in the market. In order to optimize the result of craft planning, enhance the quality and efficiency of computer aided assembly process planning and reach expected output and efficiency, the optimizing of automobile ALB (Assembly Line Balancing) problem is deeply analyzed with linear programming theory. Besides, linear programming mathematical model of ALB problem is established. Based on the mathematical process modeling and the generation of assembly sequence and considered the relative factors between production line and process planning, basing chart of process for assembly line (PAL Chart) a modeling method is put forward.

The paper examines the planning framework in which private sector planners operate to effectively design, train, equip and exercise for ‘enterprise resilience’. Lessons learned in the past decade of disasters demonstrate the vital role that the private sector plays in recovery, restoration and continuity of communities. Enormous resources have been applied to improve public safety, however, the private sector has benefited less significantly from these coordinated efforts. The paper focuses on the preparedness challenges in the commercial facilities sector, which operates on the principle of ‘open public access’. The reader will take away a better understanding of the mission, roles, responsibilities, equipment and technologies supporting various types of private sector command centres. They will recognise the emerging need for a technology test and evaluation capability, ie a strategic enterprise resilience centre, as a resource to enable better informed, cost-effective decisions that guide specification, acquisition and integration of technologies for infrastructure security.</jats:p>"

CPPs are intended to ensure that local authorities, other local public agencies, the voluntary, community and private sectors develop a shared vision for their area and work in partnership to implement this. CPPs therefore have much in common with similar initiatives in other parts of the UK, such as communities strategies, Local Strategic Partnerships, and proposals contained in the 2007 Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill in England. This article discusses how the development of CPPs relates to devolution in Scotland. It identifies systemic dilemmas, if not contradictions, encountered in implementing community planning in Scotland. Tensions exist reconciling partnership working with local authority leadership; between community planning as an additional or core duty of public agencies; between community engagement and the practical demands of policy making; and between central government direction and local partnership autonomy. </jats:p>",

Following Pluto appraisal and the discovery of a satellite field in Xena, the best estimate recoverable resource is approximately 5 Tcf dry gas. With an initial 100% equity interest, Woodside was able to quickly reach agreement on foundation LNG sales with two customers, with planned first gas in late 2010. This development will represent the first deepwater gas production from the Carnarvon Basin. The 27 months (Table 1) from discovery to project approval represents a rapid maturation cycle for a reservoir to market greenfield LNG development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The high quality reservoirs in the Pluto Field are expected to behave as well-connected gas depletion systems. The two main formations of the reservoir are fluvio-estuarine and with excellent flow properties are well understood in the offset North West Shelf Venture (NWSV) fields. Seismic data is reasonable to good, complicated by the field location under the slope down from the continental shelf. Offshore, which will be the focus of this paper, the physical setting on and under the shelf slope provides significant development challenges. The development calls for designing and laying pipelines up part of the continental slope, a riser platform in a challenging geotechnical area and directional drilling of big bore wells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will describe the challenges faced in the offshore development planning process, particularly given the preferred schedule.

The Project is on track to be developed from discovery to first gas in around five and a half years. This rapid project maturation can be attributed, at least in part to the effective use of Woodside's field development planning process to quickly and efficiently select the best development concept.</jats:p>",

Development of this block is complicated by the large areal extent, gas residing in up to fifteen different major reservoir sequences, large depth range with the deeper sequences being HPHT intervals, and CO2 contents varying from 1 to 60%. An optimised field development plan has to maximise economic value from a volume based gas sales agreement which generates a heating value based revenue stream linked to CO2 level, and prioritises condensate production. The interplay between gas and liquids considerations and a myriad of potential platform and development drilling options within a PSC environment makes the selection of an optimum development scenario difficult.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper describes how a decision framework was used to maximise the economic value of the asset. This custom built software automatically generates possible development scenarios, and then uses branch-and-bound and outer approximation solution techniques to analyze and efficiently \"prune\" the scenario tree to eliminate sub-optimal candidates. The results illustrate the effectiveness of applying optimisation technology to this complex asset, as development plans can be quickly and robustly constructed for different GIIP and recovery scenarios and for different objectives such as maximising sales gas volume or NPV.</jats:p>",

Several thousand additional healthcare workers are expected to complete the courses outside of the pilot sites through YNH-CEPDR’s extensive national network of partners and collaborators. NATHCER will deliver courses that (1) address competencies needed for critical tasks in the Target Capabilities List, compliance with the National Incident Management System and other regulatory requirements, (2) consider local regional uniqueness, and (3) incorporate distance- learning strategies and other appropriate delivery modalities. Training will be evaluated across five key programme components: course content, delivery method and knowledge acquisition, retention and application.</jats:p>"

The main criteria used are: reliability-based network performance; present value of construction, upgrading, failure and repair costs; and social and environmental issues. The AHP has been applied elsewhere on various problems, but not on the long-term upgrading of water distribution networks as proposed in this paper. The pipes are sized to carry maximum entropy flows using linear programming while the best upgrading sequence is identified using dynamic programming. The example demonstrates the effectiveness of the AHP as a systematic tool for assessing pareto-optimal designs based on the trade-offs between multiple criteria. The results demonstrate that the cheapest option is not necessarily the best when other factors e.g. performance and socio-environmental concerns are considered in an explicit way.</jats:p>",

This project in southern Sudan plans to by-pass, and thus drain, part of the wetlands of the Bahr al-Jabal and Bahr az-Zaraf rivers into the White Nile. While this would increase the Nile waters flowing northwards, it would almost inevitably have negative side-effects on the local, and maybe the regional, environment. The canal's benefits would be shared by Egypt and the Sudan, but with the expected damage falling on southern Sudan. The canal project, launched in 1978, was brought to a halt by rebels in 1984, and the moves to revive it began after the peace agreement of January 2005. This paper argues against the implementation of the project until it is justified by reliable scientific evidence. It outlines the nature of the project, the disputes around its implementation and the advantages and probable hazards of the project. It also argues for regional development in southern Sudan that recognizes the wetlands as a valuable resource and protects the ecosystem. </jats:p>",

Although large number of papers have been published in this area, the efforts to tackle the above mentioned security and uncertainty issues have been relatively very few, due to the formidable complexity involved. This paper tries to bridge this gap by proposing a technique to tackle these problems. Boundary DC power flow is used to ascertain the worst power flows on the lines. A simple basic binary Genetic algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem as an illustration.

This research focuses on treatment of flood risk within the English local planning system and discovers that there is a seeming failure to capture strategic, collective flood management opportunities, resulting in an implementation deficit between the aims of planning policy and its practical application. Improvements to local planning policy frameworks are needed therefore, to enable the use of more strategic solutions without compromising local development needs.</jats:p>"

The long development timeframes and the limitations in the data available to project service utilisation may negatively impact upon the service planning processes, and in some cases newly developed hospitals have not been sufficiently planned to meet community needs. This paper suggests that service utilisation forecasts derived from administrative databases require a more detailed verification process than currently exists. The process requires consideration of the drivers of demand to document the core assumptions about the future drivers, benchmarks with other jurisdictions, epidemiological, comparative and corporate needs assessment to explain the differences in utilisation rates, and sensitivity analysis. Given the cost of hospital construction and the rate of change in the healthcare sector, it is important that future hospital planning processes do not accept current utilisation trends as valid for future planning without this level of verification. </jats:p>",

However, many organization leaders report low levels of confidence in their succession planning systems and processes. Best succession and talent management practices can help organizations achieve significant benefits, including improved financial performance. A practical, five-step approach to succession planning is proposed that incorporates both best practices and an innovative application of role theory. The approach should help organizations look to and prepare for the future more effectively, including better specifying the future requirements they will have for their leaders. Implications for human resource development (HRD) professionals and recommendations for further research are discussed. </jats:p>",

These functions are normally handled by a sophisticated IT system — the Integrated Cargo System — and through industry IT systems provided by software developers. The business continuity plan (BCP) is designed to meet the loss of normal processes across the total cargo reporting process. This includes the partial or full loss of the Customs IT system and/or industry IT systems plus any failure of internet and communication lines. It also provides an avenue for ‘Urgent Customs Clearance’ and other ad-hoc reporting transactions. The BCP was developed following the disastrous implementation of the Integrated Cargo System in 2005 and the failure of the previous BCP, resulting in significant loss of public and government confidence in the Customs service. Since its implementation in December 2006, the new BCP has on all occasions successfully facilitated the reporting and clearance of legitimate cargo until normal services have been restored. Australian industry is very happy with the flexibility and workability of the BCP and with the additional support material available.</jats:p>"

This paper examines how the Bordeaux wine territories of St-Emilion and Blaye construct self-governance to achieve that balance, and looks at the extent to which their efforts influence the regulatory and supply chain structures of the industry. I adapt common pool resource theory (CPR) as a framework for analysis because it posits a collectively generated asset that must be maintained through mutually agreed rules. I extend CPR by focusing on reputation rather than physical assets and by incorporating the need for differentiation. The co-evolution of collectivity and differentiation is traced to establish differing institutional structures. The mechanisms of cooperation—democracy, legitimacy, fairness, monitoring, enforcement, cost reduction—are analyzed and compared for effectiveness in integrating collectivity and differentiation and for achieving territorial ambitions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The domain of New Product Development (NPD) is subject to considerable uncertainties. Aside from market‐related sources of uncertainty, the degree of innovativeness of the underlying product concept is a significant source of uncertainty, as unclear goals and specifications like, e.g. product specifications may lead to substantial delays in the project. However, companies are required to manage the innovation process as efficiently as possible. The resulting conflicting demands often leave companies struggling to achieve both efficiency as well as flexibility due to their often opposing implications for organizing and managing NPD projects. In this context, planning plays a central role; however, its usefulness for NPD project success is perceived quite differently. While there are reports about a positive influence of initial planning on various success measures, others have questioned the effectiveness of elaborated initial planning and contend that the ability to rapidly react to changes later in the process and to improvise may lead to success in NPD. This study aims at achieving a better understanding of planning in NPD by investigating a sample of 475 Research &amp; Development projects in Japanese electrical and mechanical engineering companies. Regression analysis is used to shed more light on the interplay of planning intensity, changes, and the degree of technological newness of the NPD project and their influence on project success. Our results indicate planning to be of value for different types of innovation projects. Furthermore, the influences of the variables in question vary with the success measures that are taken into account, indicating that a more detailed and contingent understanding of planning in NPD needs to be developed.</jats:p>",

Looking to debates within social psychology and cultural studies we suggest that emotions permeate the materiality and meaning of housing markets as well as the experience of individuals acting within them. Drawing on qualitative interviews conducted in Edinburgh, with households who bought in a rising market, we argue that housing transactions are emotional as well as economic affairs. We reconsider the fears that underpin what might appear to be ‘irrational exuberance’ and we argue that housing markets are propelled by a search for returns on emotional as well as financial investments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the increasing use of geographic information systems (GIS) to support the project of ‘collaborative’ planning. Specifically, I explore the ways in which the use of GIS in collaborative planning programs works to counteract and/or reproduce patterns of marginalization always present in local political struggles. Through a review of the literature and an analysis of a case study of the use of GIS in rural water resource management, I argue that the discourse and practices of collaboration can often lead to a problematic depoliticization of GIS. Furthermore, I show how this depoliticization can normalize both uneven power dynamics and the marginalization of alternative and oppositional perspectives. I employ this case study as a backdrop to propose an alternative practice of participatory GIS motivated by Mouffe's notion of ‘agonistic pluralism’. This practice of agonistic participatory GIS is designed to foreground, rather than obscure, the politics of spatial knowledge production by explicitly juxtaposing alternative understandings of space and spatial problems. I conclude by discussing the importance of this work to the critical and participatory GIS research agendas. </jats:p>",

This paper integrates MODSIM, a generalized river basin network flow model, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and artificial neural networks into a modeling framework for optimum water allocations at basin scale. MODSIM is called in the PSO model to simulate a river basin system operation and to evaluate the fitness of each set of selected design and operational variables with respect to the model's objective function, which is the minimization of the system's design and operational cost. Since the direct incorporation of MODSIM into a PSO algorithm is computationally prohibitive, an ANN model as a meta-model is trained to approximate the MODSIM modeling tool. The resulting model is used in the problem of optimal design and operation of the upstream Sirvan river basin in Iran as a case study. The computational efficiency of the model makes it possible to analyze the model performance through changing its parameters so that better solutions are obtained compared to those of the original PSO–MODSIM model.</jats:p>",

In a first‐/second‐grade classroom in an innovative public school, we videotaped 11 sessions in which children volunteered to develop a play with small groups of classmates and seven sessions in which adult volunteers (parents and a grandparent) developed plays with small groups of children. The plays were crafted in one session of about an hour, and then usually performed for the class.</jats:p><jats:p>More planning took place during child‐ than adult‐directed sessions (averaging 92 vs. 35 percent of the session's duration). The groups led by children were more frequently involved in planning of themes, planning of details of the themes, and especially in improvisationally mindstorming ideas than were the groups led by adults. In adult‐directed sessions, the adults often planned the play before the children joined the activity, and the children spent most of the session in non‐playplanning activities such as gluing and coloring puppets or rehearsal of lines designed by the adult in advance. We argue that opportunities to observe and participate in planning—which occurred more frequently in child‐directed than adult‐directed sessions—are important to the development of planning skills and of co‐ordination of plans with others.</jats:p>",

However, when an airport gets involved in disaster or catastrophe response, its business and operational continuity can be seriously disrupted. As such, the success of aid missions depends on the airport’s preparedness, coordination, cooperation and interoperability. However, the key in every case is the relationship, or lack of relationship, between the airport and adjoining, regional and national emergency management agencies. This paper uses case studies of the incident command context for airports in pre-Katrina New Orleans, Memphis, Dallas-Fort Worth and London Heathrow to illustrate key issues and apply theory to practical concerns.</jats:p>"

He develops a critique not so much of the plan to move, but of the specific proposals for that move (particularly as advanced by local parties in Salford) and of the economic-geographical claims assembled around them. To make these arguments, the author first identifies parallels between the proposals and Richard Florida's ‘creative class’ formulations. He then draws on a range of critiques of the ‘creative class’ concept to contest the substance of the BBC-Salford plan—which, he argues, reproduces an entrenched neoliberal urban development agenda—and to question the premise that the move will create regional economic value more broadly. Framed against international research into creativity-led development agendas which has typically privileged metropolitan or regional actors, the author argues that, ultimately, the BBC's proposals, while locally situated, are tightly bound up with national economics and politics. </jats:p>",

Based on these results we suggest a distinction between an urban-attraction effect and a labor-market accessibility effect. Quantitatively, the two distinct effects are found to contribute about equally to intraregional variation in housing prices. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper provides a new discussion of the emerging governance regime for marine and coastal environments. It examines the evolution from a non‐statutory to a statutory planning regulatory regime for marine aquaculture in Scotland. Specifically, the definition of development, which underpins the statutory operation of the terrestrial planning system, has been extended to include aquaculture developments within 12 nautical miles of the coast. This effectively expands the geographical territory over which land use planning controls operate in Scotland, and coincides with an emerging interest in the governance, planning and management of the marine environment. Taking into account the various controls put in place over time, the paper identifies the changing state–market–civil relations involved in this shift. Notably, over time, the state has progressively intervened in different ways to correct the perceived market failures associated with aquaculture and its environment. The analysis presented here illustrates the deliberate transition to a statutory planning context through a review of the steps taken by the stakeholders involved to devise a regulatory regime that better serves a contemporary social construction of the public interest. It provides evidence of an explicit attempt within the wider modernisation project to design an appropriate form of governance that is open, participative, accountable, coherent and effective. The paper suggests that the elaboration of such contemporary forms of active mediation remain iterative, partial and dysfunctional and points to an important research agenda to inform the emerging marine environmental planning and governance debates.</jats:p>",

The Eisenhower administration was seeking to rely more heavily on nuclear weapons in East Asia. Important differences of opinion emerged during intra- and interagency debates on the matter. The Air Force's preference for nuclear operations aimed at the total destruction of the PRC's military-industrial potential clashed with the State Department's desire to retain allied support by avoiding mass civilian casualties through selective targeting. The expansive nuclear planning that was eventually undertaken was an Asian counterpart to the “overkill” usually associated with SAC's plans for general war with the Soviet Union during this era. </jats:p>",

Eighty in‐depth interviews with individuals committed to different faiths (Muslim and Christian), disabled people, gays, lesbians and bisexuals, and members of black and minority ethnic groups (black and Asian) were conducted in 2005/2006. Mainstream cultural reference points were dominant in respondents’ accounts; however, difference was also found to be more determining in some areas than has previously been documented.

Newly democratized regimes have instituted mechanisms of environmental governance with varying degrees of success. This paper analyzes the process in which pollution disputes are channeled through legal procedures, by looking at Taiwan's Public Nuisance Disputes Mediation Act (PNDM). This system was enacted in 1992 to reduce the disruptiveness and politicization of protests after the failure of preemption and repression strategies. Contrary to the official claims, I find the PNDM produced limited absorption because its restrictive design was unfavorable to pollution victims. The institutional failure led to the widespread implementation of good-neighbor policies by business. With this undemocratic system of material payoffs to affected communities, business succeeded in reducing protest potentials by co-opting community leadership.</jats:p>",

Cross-sectional probit analysis of the 2006 HRS and longitudinal conditional fixed-effects logistic analysis of the 1995-2006 HRS indicated that charitable estate planning was positively associated with age, wealth, education, religious attendance, volunteering, charitable giving, and the absence of children or grandchildren.

The course provides forest stewardship education and assists private forest landowners in writing their own forest stewardship management plans with guidance and “coaching” by natural resource professionals. A survey of past course participants conducted in 2006 had a 60% response rate. As a result of the course, 96% of the respondents believed they had a better understanding about management options, and 73% had implemented a practice they would not have done otherwise. Management planning is prevalent among the respondents, with nearly 70% having some type of management plan. Implementation of new management practices through the FSCP approach in Washington exceeds the rates reported in the national Forest Stewardship Program national survey.</jats:p>",

The practices of individuals are interpreted, through Michel de Certeau's language of ‘tactics’, as struggles or a series of opportunistic actions which can often reforge these codes of living, precisely because the house ‘rules' are not fixed or deterministic in practice. In these tactical performances of self, the use of media is enmeshed in a host of situated and symbolic action, reaffirming how media and face-to-face interactions are multiply and closely entwined in everyday living room life. This video ethnographic work examines such instances of teenagers appealing to ‘house’ rules and demonstrating domestic helpfulness in order to gain access to media, and the tethering of media to objects through the routine practice of ‘markers' and ‘stalls’. </jats:p>",

From the use of longitudinal individual data (1990–2002), controlling for factors such as age, sex, income, and social relations, the results show that the composition of regional economies influences labour-market dynamism. We identify two cases of intraregional agglomeration mobility, that is, positive effects on job mobility, due to the concentration of similar activities (localisation economies) and the size of the labour market (urbanisation economies). The results also show that localisation economies compensate for regional structural disadvantages connected to small population numbers, as localisation effects in small regions have a significantly positive effect on intraregional job-mobility rates, even compared with localisation effects in large and diversified metropolitan areas. The results indicate that the concentration of similar activities may be useful for small regions, if high levels of job mobility are crucial for the transfer of knowledge and the performance of firms. </jats:p>",

This paper fills this gap in the existing literature by focusing on whether workers in the furniture cluster in Metro Cebu (the Philippines) have access to upward mobility within employment in the cluster, based on their formal and informal learning. This paper demonstrates that their ‘embodied expertise’ is rewarded only to a small extent and labour movements are more the result of job insecurity than of pursuing opportunities for upward mobility within employment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The purpose of this work is to evaluate the modeling of carbon fiber couch attenuation properties with a commercial treatment planning system (TPS, Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, v8.0d). A carbon fiber couch (BrainLab) was incorporated into the TPS by automatic contouring of all transverse CT slices. The couch shape and dimensions were set according to the vendor specifications. The couch composition was realized by assigning appropriate densities to the delineated contours. The couch modeling by the TPS was validated by absolute dosimetric measurements. A phantom consisting of several solid water slabs was CT scanned, the CT data set was imported into the TPS, and the carbon fiber couch was auto‐contoured. Open (unblocked) field plans for different gantry angles and field sizes were generated. The doses to a point at <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0001\" /> depth, placed at the linac isocenter, were computed. The phantom was irradiated according to the dose calculation setup and doses were measured with an ion chamber. In addition, percent depth dose (PDD) curves were computed as well as measured with radiographic film. The calculated and measured doses, transmissions, and PDDs were cross‐compared. Doses for several posterior fields (0°, 30°, 50°, 75°, 83°) were calculated for 6 and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0002\" /> photon beams. For model validation a nominal field size of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0003\" /> was chosen and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0004\" /> were delivered for each portal. The largest difference between computed and measured doses for those posterior fields was within 1.7%. A comparison between computed and measured transmissions for the aforementioned fields was performed and the results were found to agree within 1.1%. The differences between computed and measured doses for different field sizes, ranging from <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0005\" /> in <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0006\" /> increments, were within 2%. Measured and computed PDD curves with and without the couch agree from the surface up to <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2135-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2135:mp2135-math-0007\" /> depth. The PDDs indicate a surface dose increase resulting from the carbon fiber couch field modification. The carbon fiber couch attenuation for individual posterior oblique fields (75°) can be in excess of 8% depending on the beam energy and field size. When the couch is contoured in Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> its attenuation properties are modeled to within 1.7% with respect to measurements. These results demonstrate that appropriate contouring together with relevant density information for the contours is sufficient for adequate modeling of carbon fiber supporting devices by modern commercial treatment planning systems.</jats:p>",

This paper presents a DG planning strategy based on multi‐objective optimization approaches. The main goal of this paper is to determine a Pareto set of locations and sizes of the new DG units by minimizing different cost functions considering the technical constraints, and then determining the best planning strategy. The Pareto set will help the DG planner make a better decision in choosing the best plan from the Pareto set. The best scheme is chosen by the benefit–cost ratio (BCR). The objectives of a DG planner in this paper are assumed to be the cost of investment and operation, cost of energy purchased, cost of energy losses and the cost of energy not supplied. Two market scenarios for the planner are considered: (1) electricity auctions and (2) bilateral contracts of energy. Several case studies are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

By taking advantage of newly available public transport timetable data, a software tool is developed for the analysis of bus travel times under specified journey scenarios. The example of population access to Derriford Hospital in Devon, England, is used to illustrate the application of these methods, and the social and spatial pattern of accessibility by bus is explored. The analysis reveals substantial differences between access by public and private transport, and highlights the difficulty of combining conventional drive-time analysis with the discontinuous accessibility provided by public transport. There is a need for more attention to be paid to the incorporation of public transport in accessibility modelling. </jats:p>",

This approach allows us to incorporate and test more information on spatial dependence and offers more flexibility than the representation in terms of Wy or Wx. Furthermore, we adapt the ML estimator included in the software package Mx to estimate SEMs with spatial dependence.

The impact of compromised public health infrastructure and systems on health consequences defines and greatly influences the manner in which disasters are observed, planned for, and managed, especially those that are geographically widespread, population dense, and prolonged. What may first result in direct injuries and death may rapidly change to excess indirect illness and subsequent death as essential public health resources are destroyed, deteriorate, or are systematically denied to vulnerable populations. Public health and public health infrastructure and systems in developed and developing countries must be seen as strategic and security issues that deserve international public health resource monitoring attention from disaster managers, urban planners, the global humanitarian community, World Health Organization authorities, and participating parties to war and conflict. We posit here that disaster frameworks be reformed to emphasize and clarify the relation of public health emergencies and modern disasters.

It is shown that medical physicists have played a vital role in the creation of innovative treatment planning techniques throughout the past century, most significantly since the advent of computerized tomography for three‐dimensional (3D) imaging and high‐powered computers capable of 3D planning and optimization. Some early advances in 3D planning made by physicists include development of novel planning algorithms, beam's‐eye‐view, virtual simulation, dose‐volume histogram analysis tools, and bioeffect modeling. Most of the recent developments have been driven by the need to develop treatment planning for conformal radiotherapy, especially intensity modulated radiation therapy. These advances include inverse planning, handling the effects of motion and uncertainty, biological planning, and multicriteria optimization.</jats:p>",

Level 2 care for general medical patients is provided in the 16-bed adult intensive care unit (ICU). We performed a prospective study to allow for planning of a level 2 medical unit, by collecting data on candidates for level 2 care over a 57-day period. We identified 157 medical patients who required a total of 222 bed-days. We calculated that a six-bedded unit would run at full capacity for 88% of the time.

The main objective of the proposed RPP problem is to minimize the investment cost through balanced installation of SCs and SVCs while keeping a specified security level and minimizing the amount of load shedding. The problem is formulated as a large scale mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, which is a nonsmooth and nondifferentiable optimization problem using conventional optimization techniques and induces lots of local minima. Among the metaheuristic techniques, genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and evolutionary particle swarm optimization (EPSO) are applied to solve the RPP problem. To investigate the effectiveness of the metaheuristic techniques, the proposed approaches have been successfully tested on IEEE‐14 buses, as well as IEEE‐57 buses test system. The results obtained are compared and the effectiveness of each technique has been illustrated. Copyright © 2008 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nowadays magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been profoundly used in radiotherapy (RT) planning to aid the contouring of targets and critical organs in brain and intracranial cases, which is attributable to its excellent soft tissue contrast and multi-planar imaging capability. However, the lack of electron density information in MRI, together with the image distortion issues, precludes its use as the sole image set for RT planning and dose calculation. The purpose of this preliminary study is to probe the feasibility and evaluate an MRI-based radiation dose calculation process by providing MR images the necessary electron density (ED) information from a patient's readily available diagnostic/staging computed tomography (CT) images using an image registration model. To evaluate the dosimetric accuracy of the proposed approach, three brain and three intracranial cases were selected retrospectively for this study. For each patient, the MR images were registered to the CT images, and the ED information was then mapped onto the MR images by in-house developed software generating a modified set of MR images. Another set of MR images with voxel values assigned with the density of water was also generated. The original intensity modulated radiation treatment (IMRT) plan was then applied to the two sets of MR images and the doses were calculated. The dose distributions from the MRI-based calculations were compared to that of the original CT-based calculation. In all cases, the MRI-based calculations with mapped ED yielded dose values very close (within 2%) to that of the CT-based calculations. The MRI-based calculations with voxel values assigned with water density indicated a dosimetric error of 3–5%, depending on the treatment site. The present approach offers a means of utilizing MR images for accurate dose calculation and affords a potential to eliminate the redundant simulation CT by planning a patient's treatment with only simulation MRI and any available diagnostic/staging CT data. </jats:p>",

However, the benefits of additional data have seldom been evaluated by analyzing the return on investment. If there are diminishing returns in terms of improved planning, then resources might be better directed toward other actions, depending on their relative costs and benefits. Our aim was to determine the return on investment from spending different amounts on survey data before undertaking a program of implementing new protected areas. We estimated how much protea data is obtained as a function of dollars invested in surveying. We then simulated incremental protection and loss of habitat to determine the benefit of investment in that data on the protection of proteas. We found that, after an investment of only US$100,000 (∼780,000 South Africa Rand [ZAR]), there was little increase in the effectiveness of conservation prioritizations, despite the full data set costing at least 25 times that amount.</jats:p>",

With respect to audit committee quality, internal auditors in both roles were sensitive to variations in quality, but the responses to quality variations depended on whether they were in a due diligence or self‐assessment role. With respect to the former, they linked the variation in quality to fraud risk, but did not alter the scope of their planned audit effort.

For an NSSE, the US Secret Service (USSS) serves as the lead agency for all security operations and coordinates with relevant partners to provide for the safety and welfare of participants. For the 2004 Democratic National Convention (DNC), designated an NSSE, the USSS tasked the Boston Emergency Medical Services (BEMS) of the Boston Public Health Commission with the design and implementation of health services related to the Convention. In this article, we describe the planning and development of BEMS’ robust 2004 DNC Medical Consequence Management Plan, addressing the following activities: public health surveillance, on-site medical care, surge capacity in the event of a mass casualty incident, and management of federal response assets. Lessons learned from enhanced medical planning for the 2004 DNC may serve as an effective model for future mass gathering events.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Lack of a management framework on which to base silviculture options has plagued the forest management planning process in Ontario. The Forest Management Planning Manual for Ontario’s Crown Forests directs that strategic silvicultural options be developed and identified in terms of the (i) applicable forest unit, (ii) associated assumptions, and (iii) extent to which they can be used on a forest management unit. In this paper, we describe a framework for classifying management (or silviculture) intensity and propose definitions for extensive, basic, intensive, and elite intensities of silviculture to support the framework’s use in planning and application. We outline how the Canadian Ecology Centre – Forestry Research Partnership, a research partnership between Tembec Inc., the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources, and Natural Resources Canada, is considering applying these in the forest management planning process. The framework and definitions can be used to develop strategic silviculture options within an active adaptive management approach. This framework should help to reduce uncertainties associated with forest development, treatment costs, response to treatments, and success rates provided appropriate monitoring. The framework and definitions described were specifically developed for silviculture related to reforestation of even-aged boreal forests. Key words: intensive silviculture, adaptive management, forest management </jats:p>",

In this paper we describe how we have produced a detailed, high‐resolution map of current changes in land levels for the Thames region, and carried out a new assessment of the changes in sea level relative to the land along the Thames Estuary over the past few decades/past century. We conclude the paper by considering the potential benefits of extended monitoring for the long‐term planning of flood and coastal defences in that region.</jats:p>",
