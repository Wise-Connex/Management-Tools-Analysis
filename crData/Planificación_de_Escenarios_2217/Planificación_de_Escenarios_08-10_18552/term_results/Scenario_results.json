      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Probabilistic assessment of reserves is commonly performed through a series of reservoir simulations over the range of field parameters. In most cases, an exhaustive study of parameter combinations is unfeasible because the number of parameters to be investigated is usually large. Statistical design of experiments (DOE) can be used to select a small number of reservoir simulation runs. The choice of design, especially its ability to capture complex interactions in field parameters, is crucial for DOE to be successful. To this end, we have developed a Scenario Analysis Tool (SAT) using DOE methodology for selecting scenarios to run in 3-D modelling and analyse the resulting reserves values to estimate the ultimate recovery.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The primary goal of SAT is to minimise experimental effort (and cost) by recommending the minimum number of reservoir simulation runs required to accurately estimate uncertainty in hydrocarbon reserves for a given set of uncertainty parameters. The process has three main steps: specify the uncertainty framework to generate appropriate scenarios;model scenarios in 3-D simulators and input the response into SAT; anduse SAT to perform the analysis and generate the probabilistic response curve.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>SAT is implemented within the Microsoft Excel environment, making it user friendly with simple and intuitive data entry and minimal training requirements. The user is guided by menus and dialog boxes through a few simple sequential steps. SAT output includes reserves estimates, probabilistic response curves, tornado charts, and a comprehensive statistical output. Efficient designs results in a significant reduction in simulation effort for generating the reserves value. Usually, less than 0.1% of possible models need to be simulated and confidence levels are beyond exploration teams' expectations. The capability of SAT will be demonstrated through a number of examples.</jats:p>",

MDG describes reliability of module in different application environment, module dependency and structure of software with establishing maps among modules, execution scenarios and reliability. According to the information shown in MDG, an algorithm based on the idea of traversing directed graph in graph theory was proposed. The algorithm calculates the reliability of scenario with breadth-first principle. The reliability of system could be obtained from reliability and running frequency of scenario. The scheme eliminates the defects of the conventional methods which ignore module correlation. Case study proves the scheme could evaluate the reliability of NC software effectively.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Organized retailing is currently in a nascent stage in India. Although Organized retailing, contributes only 4% of total retail at present, will grow by 25–30% every year and become Rs.100,000 crore sector (Rs.1000 billion) by 2010, the organized retailing sector evaluation passes through the four important phases. In India, a number of barriers are found in the way of the development of organized retail market. FDI restrictions on the entry of international retailers in the country, different sales tax rates exists in different states of the country, implementation of VAT, complex cities in the tax structure, problem of funding from the banks, lack of proper infrastructure are constraints on the way of organized retailing. The three biggest challenges of the organized retail industry will be managing manpower, real estate and supply chain. This paper discusses, how Retail sector growth will help various sections of the society and country as whole and what kind of measures government should take for the growth of organized retailing in India? </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the current scenario, mobile internet applications enable consumers to access a variety of services: Web information search, SMS (short message service), MMS (multimedia message service), banking, payment, gaming, e-mailing, chat, weather forecast, GPS (global positioning service), and so forth. Collectively, we denominate this wide array of services as “mcommerce.” These digital media are considered to potentially improve the possibilities to reach consumers by allowing personalization of the content and context of the message. Combining customer's user profile and the context situation, advertising companies can provide the target customers exactly the advertisement information they desire, not just “spam” them with irrelevant advertisements. </jats:p><jats:p> Drawing from Nysveen, Pedersen, and Thorbjornsen's (2005) grid of mobile internet services classification, this study attempts to critically analyse “person interactive” (goal-oriented) information and “person interactive” (experiential) messaging, targeting both utilitarian and hedonic benefits from the consumers' perspective. It analyses the effectiveness of mobile advertising in its current format (as prevalent in India). ‘Effectiveness’ for the purpose of this study has been concretized in terms of impact of mobile advertising on the purchase decision of the consumer. However, results of binary logistic regression indicate that mobile advertising in its current format does not have a significant impact on the purchase decision of a consumer, and that there might be other significant factors like a firm's marketing efforts (marketing mix), a consumers' socio-cultural environment (family, informal sources, non-commercial sources, social class, culture and sub-culture), and an individual's psychological field (motivation, perception, learning, personality, and attitudes) that affect his purchase decision. Mobile advertising in its current format is very generic in its approach, as substantiated by factor analysis performed on the data — marketing communication through mobiles primarily lacked in contextualization and perceived usefulness (for the target customers), and were disruptive in nature. Although mobiles are a powerful mode of marketing communication, the important issues at stake here are— what to say, how to say it, to whom, and how often. Communications get more and more difficult, as a large number of companies clamour for getting the consumers' increasingly divided attention through various means. Hence the challenge lies in customizing the marketing communication to suit individual needs (Customerization), i.e., reaching the right target market with the right message at the right time. Also, variations in consumer responsiveness towards mobile advertising have been examined using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Finally, some features enhancing the utilitarian and hedonic benefits drawn (or expected) from mobile advertising are prioritized. This enhancement of benefits can be implemented by incorporating Intelligent Software Agents, which make customerization of marketing messages a reality—delivering all the desired benefits (utilitarian⁄hedonic) to the consumers. Software Agents are programmes which fulfill a task independently on behalf of the user and can be adapted to the individual preferences and parameters of its instructor; software agents operate without intervention of the user at a specific problem definition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Detailed mechanistic studies on the ligand hydroxylation reaction mediated by a copper bis(imine) complex are presented. Starting from a structural analysis of the Cu<jats:sup>I</jats:sup> complex and the Cu<jats:sup>II</jats:sup> product with a hydroxylated ligand, the optical absorption and vibrational spectra of starting material and product are analyzed. Kinetic analysis of the ligand hydroxylation reaction shows that O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> binding is the rate‐limiting step. The reaction proceeds much faster in methanol than in acetonitrile. Moreover, an inverse kinetic isotope effect (KIE) is evidenced for the reaction in acetonitrile, which is attributed to a sterically congested transition state leading to the peroxo adduct. In methanol, however, no KIE is observed. A DFT analysis of the oxygenation reaction mediated by the μ‐η<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>:η<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> peroxo core demonstrates that the major barrier after O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> binding corresponds to electrophilic attack on the arene ring. The relevant orbital interaction occurs between the σ* orbital of the Cu<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> unit and the HOMO of the ligand. On the basis of the activation energy for the rate‐limiting step (18.3 kcal mol<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) this reaction is thermally allowed, in agreement with the experimental observation. The calculations also predict the presence of a stable dienone intermediate which, however, escaped experimental detection so far. Reasons for these findings are considered. The implications of the results for the mechanism of tyrosinase are discussed.</jats:p>",
