Experience has demonstrated that successful redevelopment requires the collection,\nanalysis, and interpretation of environmental data in a timely and cost‐effective manner in order to allow\ndevelopers and lenders to efficiently use cleanup resources, develop response strategies that integrate cleanup\nwith redevelopment, and support meaningful outreach to involved stakeholders. Recent advances in the science and\ntechnology of site characterization hold the promise of improved site characterization outcomes while saving time\nand money. One such advancement, the Triad Approach, combines systematic up‐front planning with the use of\na dynamic field investigation process and the generation of real time data to allow in‐field decision\nmaking on sample location selection.</jats:p><jats:p>This article describes an application of the Triad Approach to redevelopment of an urban greenway in Trenton,\nNew Jersey. The Triad Approach, initiated through a partnership between the City of Trenton, New Jersey Department\nof Environmental Protection, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,\ndemonstrated that this approach could accelerate the characterization of the 60‐acre, 11‐parcel\nproject area. Environmental issues that were solved using the Triad Approach included the delineation of the\nextent of historic fill, determination of no further action for several areas of concern, detailed investigation\nof specific impacted areas and the acquisition of sufficient data to allow the city to make important decisions\nregarding remediation costs and property acquisition. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

This paper describes an holistic methodology, DRIFT (Downstream Response to Imposed Flow Transformation), for advising on environmental flows for rivers targetted for water‐management activities. DRIFT's basic philosophy is that all major abiotic and biotic components constitute the ecosystem to be managed; and within that, the full spectrum of flows, and their temporal and spatial variability, constitute the flows to be managed. The methodology employs experienced scientists from the following biophysical disciplines: hydrology, hydraulics, fluvial geomorphology, sedimentology, chemistry, botany and zoology. Where there are subsistence users of the river, the following socio‐economic disciplines are also employed: sociology, anthropology, water supply, public health, livestock health and resource economics.</jats:p><jats:p>DRIFT is a structured process for combining data and knowledge from all the disciplines to produce flow‐related scenarios for water managers to consider. It consists of four modules. In the first, or biophysical module, the river ecosystem is described and predictive capacity developed on how it would change with flow changes. In the second, or socio‐economic module, links are described between riparian people who are subsistence users of river resources, the resources they use, and their health. The objective is to develop predictive capacity of how river changes would impact their lives. In the third module, scenarios are built of potential future flows and the impacts of these on the river and the riparian people. The fourth, or economic module, lists compensation and mitigation costs.</jats:p><jats:p>DRIFT should run in parallel with two other exercises which are external to it: a macro‐economic assessment of the wider implications of each scenario, and a Public Participation Process whereby people other than subsistence users can indicate the level of acceptability of each scenario.</jats:p><jats:p>DRIFT has been developed in a semi‐arid, developing region, where water‐supply problems are pressing, and uncertainties about river‐linked ecological and social processes high. The use of DRIFT in this context is discussed. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This might affect the productivity of medium and higher trophic levels with potential consequences on marine resources such as tropical tuna. Here we combine the projections of up‐to‐date climate and ocean biogeochemical models with recent concepts of representation of fish habitat based on prey abundance and ambient temperature to gain some insight into the impact of climate change on skipjack tuna (<jats:italic>Katsuwonus pelamis</jats:italic>), the species that dominates present‐day tuna catch. For a world with doubled atmospheric CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> concentration, our results suggest significant large‐scale changes of skipjack habitat in the equatorial Pacific. East of the date line, conditions could be improved by an extension of the present favourable habitat zones of the western equatorial Pacific, a feature reminiscent of warming conditions associated with El Niño events. Despite its simplicity and the associated underlying hypothesis, this first simulation is used to stress future research directions and key issues for modelling developments associated to global change.</jats:p>",
