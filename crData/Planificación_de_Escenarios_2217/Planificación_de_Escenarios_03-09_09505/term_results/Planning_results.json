      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article argues that environmental racism should be broadened to include the maldistribution of beneficial environmental conditions and proposes that advocacy planning may be an effective way to address the spatial absence of beneficial environmental services and amenities. The article examines advocacy in the context of neighborhood improvement, specifically around the placement of a streetlight and stop sign. Neighborhood infrastructure and transportation planning are vital for safety and quality of life, especially for communities of color, yet planning at this level often revolves around physical aspects of the neighborhood with minimal attention paid to planning processes and outcomes likely to marginalize and even endanger communities. Through an examination of one municipality's neighborhood-based advocacy approach to neighborhood improvement, this article considers the opportunities and challenges in using advocacy planning as a strategy to promote environmental justice on the streets and sidewalks of distressed urban neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

The various kinds of development under this label claim to replace the traditional auto-dependent suburb with pedestrian-oriented mixed-use development that builds sense of community. The present study tests two claims of neotraditional plans. In a community having a traditional suburb and nearby a traditional small-town center, on which neotraditional development is modeled, interviewers surveyed 120 residents—60 from each area. The analyses compared measures of sense of community, auto use, and reasons the residents chose to live in each area. The results support the claim that higher density mixed-use developments have lower auto use, but they failed to show that this form of development or the reduced use of autos translates into in-creased sense of community. </jats:p>",

Unmarried women's contraceptive decisionmaking was not primarily driven by a current need to limit fertility, but rather by a future need to maximize it in order to gain status through childbearing in their marital households. Further interviews explored notions of conception, menstruation, and the perceived action of hormonal methods on the reproductive system. Findings revealed that menstrual disruption (in the form of amenorrhea or prolonged bleeding) appeared to have dire repercussions, including accusations of witchcraft and immoral behavior that could result in a woman's being divorced or in her husband's acquiring an additional wife. The social consequences of side effects were perceived to be more important than their biological manifestations, and together with the fear of sterility, resulted in a preference for the condom.</jats:p>",

New Urbanism relies on an ideal of “community” that makes its suitability for these contexts questionable. This article examines the use of New Urbanism to revitalize neighborhoods with diverse populations, investigating the following concerns: (1) physical changes may not be the best solutions for the social problems that often face such neighborhoods, (2) New Urbanist ideas may have different meanings to different groups of neighborhood residents, (3) New Urbanist neighborhood renovation may displace low-income residents, and (4) New Urbanist participatory design processes may not accommodate diversity. The article presents findings from a case study of the Westside of the city of Costa Mesa, California. Recommendations suggest alternative planning and design strategies to support and reinvigorate diverse, urban neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

The analysis, based on two‐level multinomial regression models, shows that, over time, the use of modern contraceptive methods, especially long‐term methods, is higher in urban than in rural areas, whereas the pattern is reversed for traditional methods. Use of barrier methods among unmarried women is steadily rising, but the levels remain disappointingly low, particularly in view of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Kenya. One striking result from this analysis is the dramatic rise in the use of injectables. Of particular program relevance is the notably higher levels of use of injectables among rural women, women whose partners disapprove of family planning, uneducated women, and those less frequently exposed to family planning media messages, compared with their counterparts who have better access to services and greater exposure to family planning information.</jats:p>",

This article examines links between gender ideology or gender roles and the social impact of adolescent childbearing in the lives of rural and urban adolescents in KwaZulu/Natal, South Africa. It employs a triangulated research methodology (focus‐group discussions, narrative role playing and discussions, and questionnaires and in‐depth interviews) to inform an analysis of adolescents' notions of male and female gender ideals. This analysis forms the basis for an exploration of the potential influence of adolescent childbearing on young peoples' lives and factors that shape their sexual and reproductive well‐being. Results indicate that gender ideals are grounded in traits that reinforce poor sexual negotiation dynamics and behavioral double standards and that place adolescents at risk for early pregnancy and other sexual and reproductive health complications. Overall, adolescent parenthood is viewed negatively by participants of both sexes because it compromises personal, professional, and financial aspirations. Compared with its effect on boys, parenthood has a disproportionate (and highly negative) impact on girls that is directly linked to gender‐based inequities. The article addresses the research and policy implications of these findings.</jats:p>",

Of the symptomatic women surveyed, 31 percent sought care, overwhelmingly from private providers (70 percent). Only 8 percent of women consulted frontline paramedical health workers. Care‐seeking behavior and type of providers consulted varied significantly across different Indian states. Significant differentials in care‐seeking by age, caste, religion, education, household wealth, and women' autonomy suggest the existence of multiple cultural, economic, and demand‐side barriers to care‐seeking. Although socially disadvantaged women were less likely than better‐off women to consult private providers, the majority of even the poorest, uneducated, and lower‐caste women consulted private providers. Geographical access to public health facilities had no significant association with choice of provider, whereas access to private providers had only a moderately significant association with that choice. The predominance of use of private services for self‐perceived gynecological morbidity warrants the inclusion of private providers in the national reproductive health strategy to enhance its effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Using data from the 1994 Household Activity and Travel Behavior Survey conducted in Portland, Oregon, these findings suggest New Urbanist concepts serve to increase walking substitution; transit is not affected.

The authors want to know whether planners” perceptions of significant skills are different from other professions, whether the context within which planners operate makes a difference, and whether the perceived importance of skills evolves with career experience. They find communication skills to be valued more than technical and quantitative skills across all three groups. However, planners value certain types of communication—report writing and writing for the public—more than planning-related and non-planning professionals. Professional planning con-text matters; public-sector planners value written communication more than private-sector planners. And, planners” valuation of skills changes with length of planning experience, implying an evolutionary model. The authors discuss implications for graduate education and training curricula. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although many cross‐sectional social surveys have included questions about female genital cutting status and correlated personal characteristics, no longitudinal studies have been launched that permit investigation of response biases associated with such surveys. This study draws upon the findings of a longitudinal study of women aged 15 to 49 in rural northern Ghana. The self‐reported circumcision status of women interviewed in 1995 was compared with the status they reported when they were interviewed again in 2000 after the government began enforcing a law banning the practice and public information campaigns against it were launched. In all, 13 percent of respondents who reported in 1995 that they had been circumcised stated that they had not been circumcised in the 2000 reinterview; this inconsistency reached 50 percent for the youngest age group. Analysis shows that women who said they had not been circumcised are significantly younger, more likely to be educated, and less likely to practice traditional religion than are women who reported that they were circumcised. Factors that may explain these correlates of denial are discussed, and implications for research are reviewed.</jats:p>",

Into this scenario arrived the Internet – another radical technological innovation with the potential to change the structure and nature of banking. Many banks have adopted the Internet as a delivery channel (indeed, some banks have set up as Internet‐only delivery). This paper reports a Delphi study of the Internet momentum in banking. Informed by diffusion of innovation theory, the study sought to discern the key issues and to explore the future of Internet banking. The results show that Internet banking is a very important issue in retail banking. However, the Internet will contribute as part of a multi‐channel (bricks and clicks) strategy, rather than as a stand‐alone (clicks only) strategy. The developing functionality of Internet banking may enable some banks to achieve competitive advantage through delivering higher perceived customer value.</jats:p>",

The\n      objective of present study is to examine the changes in knowledge and\n      attitude of men about family planning, and also to estimate the extent\n      to which it affects their contraceptive use behaviour. The findings show\n      that men’s knowledge and contraceptive use has increased three times\n      during the period from 1968-69 to 1990. The important factors that\n      determine men’s contraceptive use behaviour are the approval of family\n      planning, the communication with wife on family planning matters, and\n      the desire for children. The multivariate analysis shows that men living\n      in urban areas, with greater knowledge and a positive attitude towards\n      family planning, are more likely to use contraception. In addition,\n      wife’s autonomy is also important in explaining men’s involvement in the\n      use of family planning. The study reveals that most Pakistani men\n      approve of family planning and suggests that men should receive an equal\n      focus together with women in the population welfare programme\n      activities.</jats:p>"

I can understand this sentiment where research proceeds rather automatically and largely without concern for possible social censure, but where societal forces directly complicate the agenda involved, there is reason for proceeding with a more open mind. Ignorance of the past invites reinventing the wheel; not only with respect to specific theories or models that were designed in some past era but never fully tested, but also to more general points of view that may extend beyond the immediate science of the question. Meanwhile, within most fields of knowledge there are constant attempts at reinvention; in many of these theory or research paradigms may become stale or stagnant. But just as often societal evolution may produce new agenda, including ones that require wholly new perspectives. The biodiversity movement of the past fifteen years is a good example of such forces in action. Human population pressures increasingly test the planet's ability to renew itself, a momentum that has caused conservationists and planners to move away from single-species and intra-national forms of management and toward larger-scale, interdisciplinary, understandings of the socio-natural processes at work.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The catastrophic flooding of recent years has revealed the inadequacy of formally defined flood-protection areas as a means of guaranteeing the necessary levels of containment in water meadows. If we are to effectively alleviate the gravity of such critical cases of flooding, it will be necessary both to restore the water-retention spaces previously maintained, and also to create additional flood plains. As a precautionary measure, where land has already been earmarked (including for development) to serve these purposes, it will be particularly vital to ensure that this intention is not thwarted by permitting conflicting land uses. This is the prime task of regional planning, and, in the form of what are termed „area development plans”, it has at its disposal in North Rhine-Westphalia a sophisticated and effective array of planning instruments capable of meeting the key requirement of precautionary flood protection, namely that of securing the spaces required, initially by indicating them as „flood areas”, and subsequently by designating them specifically for this purpose within legally-binding land-use plans. This article describes the scope for action available in spatial planning as reflected in regional planning in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Up to the 1980s, urban property development and management in Western Europe was structured by local conditions and actors. This has changed due to strengthened demand for office space, new forms of real estate financing and an increased market transparency as a consequence of political deregulation. At present, these changes go along with a mobilization of the urban property market and a shift from an use value perspective to an exchange value orientation. What kind of challenges and possibilities arise from these transformations for the urban property development? Does an increased importance of supraregional and shareholder value oriented property developers and investors imply a dependency of urban (property) development on mobile investments? In this article these questions will be answered by analyzing the effects of the reorganization of the real estate industry and the restructuring of urban policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>There remains today little in common between the concept underlying the phenomenon we refer to as “the city”, on the one hand, and the actual reality we can observe and experience. One reason for this is the apparently insatiable desire on the part of large groups in society for a home of their own in a leafy environment; for distance from the hectic, noisy, polluted and increasingly hazardous city centre; for greater closeness to nature; for a sense of belonging to a community, which is seen to guarantee greater security, peace and quiet and social homogeneity; for an environment more child-friendly than that found in the inner city. In stark contrast to any discourse on the subject of urbanity — and reaffirmed impressively yet again just recently in both surveys and empirical studies — for many people a home of their own, with garden, is now well established as the very epitome of how they would ideally like to live. And it is this — admittedly among other factors — which generates suburbanisation. Even accepting that sprawling settlement development by no means represents a lack of planning, but is rather the result of conflicting and — over the course of time — mutually neutralising values with regard to what we think cities can and should be; and granting too that every municipality thinks first and foremost — as indeed it is required to — of its own best interests: nonetheless, what we refer to as “urban sprawl” should not simply be stigmatised or accepted as an unalterable fact of life. On the contrary: suburbanisation needs to be seen, to a much greater degree than has previously been the case, as a challenge for urban development, as a sign of a need to envision spatial concepts which take into account both the housing market and individual aspirations with regard to housing.</jats:p>"

The field was put on production in May 1976. The field achieved a peak production of about 400,000 BOPD during year 1984. To maintain reservoir pressure, suitable water injection scheme was put in place in 1984-85. The field is currently operating on gas lift mode of artificial lift. The field is in now matured stage.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>There is a vast gap in demand and supply of hydrocarbons in India. Country import about 66% of its crude oil requirements. Current high rise in prices of crude oil necessitated increased efforts by National Oil Company (ONGC) to enhance production by about 0.5 MMT from the committed targets. Indian offshore being the 70% contributor of domestic crude oil, special focus was accorded to these fields.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Mumbai High being largest field in Offshore, a systematic planning and monitoring of action plan were adhered. To augment the production from this matured field, as a short-term measure, a multi-disciplinary team (MDT) was formed. The team brought out the action plan in August-2000 and implementation started in September-2000. The four types of jobs were planned for Bombay High field viz. Drilling of new development wells, diversion of existing well location to new location by long-drift side-track (LDST), cost effective innovative stimulation jobs, additional perforations in some of the existing producers. All these four types of jobs were carried out within the available resources like drilling rig, stimulation vessel and marine survey unit (MSU). The systematic monitoring of these actions has led to a learning curve for future. In addition to this, some of the wells were taken up for other remedial jobs like surface modifications to reduce backpressure in some well platforms, work-over jobs, scale removal jobs etc. By close monitoring of each well and associated action, the planned additional targets of 0.5 MMT up to March-2001 were achieved.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The present paper describes the details of new development wells drilled using non-damaging drilling mud, diversion of existing well location to new location using the existing slot using LDST, innovative stimulation technique and additional perforations. For each of these activities, a detailed analysis has been made and learning curve drawn for future.</jats:p>",

Swansea's initiative in social planning led to the creation of the University's Centre for Development Studies (CDS), and it broadened development studies as an academic and policy field. Social planning is a controversial term because it has sometimes been associated with social engineering and totalitarianism. Nevertheless, it has a very important intellectual and policy agenda, and if the word ‘planning’ proves a liability it can be replaced by ‘policy’ or ‘strategy’. The major questions reviewed at CDS‐Swansea in the 1970s are still pertinent, and new dimensions have been added through growing concerns for nation‐building, sustainability, democracy, gender equity and human rights.

One is a mobile self-dispatch system with which service technicians monitor a list of customers' requests to repair machines in their service area. The other is a knowledge system. Particular attention is paid to investigating how these systems are embedded in a specific sociotechnological organization and work in service technicians' daily activities. Through the analysis of service technicians' activities, and interviews, the authors show that service technicians organize and make their workspace and activities visible with these technologies. </jats:p>",

The policy impacts of urban associations and shared central places that have been tested in spatial planning practice in this respect suffer from the lack of a binding agreement on the distribution of functions.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of the thesis is to develop methods for improving accuracy in dose calculations for photon brachytherapy treatment planning. This is achieved by separating the total dose into its primary and scatter components and through the use of three‐dimensional integration methods to calculate the scatter dose. The collapsed‐cone kernel‐superposition algorithm, used clinically for treatment planning with external photon beams, was adapted for scatter‐dose calculations in brachytherapy. A successive‐scattering approach was developed to minimize the artifacts from the method's angular discretization of energy transport, which are otherwise a problem for the steep fluence gradients around brachytherapy sources. Methods for scaling kernels for heterogeneities, accounting for both photoelectric absorption and the emission of characteristic x rays, were derived. It is shown how data from a source‐characterization formalism, that separates the total dose into its primary and scatter components, can support the collapsed cone algorithm with the input required to model clinical sources. With the methods developed in this work, the collapsed cone algorithm can be used for three‐dimensional scatter dose calculations over the brachytherapy energy range, handle all heterogeneous materials and model clinical sources. An application in which this might be of particular importance is in designing individualized patient shields for intermediate energy isotopes such as <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8671-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8671:mp8671-math-0001\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8671-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8671:mp8671-math-0002\" /> In this energy range (60–100 keV), thin foils of high atomic number effectively protect sensitive organs, however without three‐dimensional scatter‐dose calculations, errors as large as 10–20 % can occur within distances of therapeutic interest on the side targeted for treatment. Through use of the collapsed cone algorithm for scatter dose calculations, these dose reductions are predicted within 3% compared to the results of full‐scale Monte Carlo simulations.</jats:p>",

In the year 2001, 40ha/year/100,000 residents were consumed in Germany (not considering recreational areas). In contrast, the corresponding statistic in England was merely 12.7 ha. The essential reasons for the success of the English system in this area of policy making seems to lie in: the English planning system, the emphasis of recycling unused plots of land within towns and the preservation of “Green Belts” as well as the English taxation system. The English example gives reason to once again contemplate the relatively high strength of community planning interests in German spatial planning. Also without major changes in the planning system, measures such as the reduction of economic incentives that promote land consumption and the further development of concepts for tradable land use permits in connection/cooperation/combination with spatial planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> EDEN, a famous garden, is also an acronym for the Electronic Democracy European Network, a project involving a consortium of public administrations (local authorities), academic institutions and technology companies. The thirty-month project aims to improve communication between the administrations and citizens in decision-making processes to do with urban planning, and at time of writing is in the transition from ‘requirements analysis’ to implementation of a software toolkit. The EDEN project is concerned, amongst other things, with the mobility of messages to and from urban planning officers in public administrations. Mobility, that is, from people ‘outside’ a city administration to people ‘inside’ it via a website, a virtual place from where messages are to be routed to a correct destination. The planning of virtual urban places is a new concern for both urban planners and systems designers working to implement ‘information society’ initiatives. These two occupations and research fields share similar methodologies, models, and artifacts used to intervene in the practices of their clients. This paper describes how the practices through which planning is made political have been represented in the ‘requirements analysis’ of the EDEN toolkit. The politics of the project do not just lie in its objective, the reconfiguring of ‘virtual’ political geographies in parallel with the ‘real’. The distinctions made between virtual and real politics are themselves political. Setting aside any essential differences between the two, we will look instead at the politics of representation and representations embedded in the EDEN project and software. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Harvesting old-growth forest is one of the activities that has strongly shaped the economic, social, and ecological landscapes of Clayoquot Sound on the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia. Clearcutting, which has been the dominant harvesting method, has changed the distribution and natural age classes of forests, altered drainage systems, and affected the visual appearance of the landscape. Growing discontent over the effects of harvesting old-growth forests came to a head in 1993 with widespread public opposition to the Clayoquot Land Use Decision. The provincial government sought an alternative approach to resolving these issues, and so convened the Clayoquot Sound Scientific Panel. The Panel's recommendations for forest planning and practices—including the protection of wetland areas—were adopted, along with British Columbia's Forest Practices Code in 1995. The latter was applied province-wide, whereas the Scientific Panel's recommendations for the protection of coastal ecosystems and First Nations' values were specific to Clayoquot Sound.In 1999, Iisaak Forest Resources Ltd. undertook planning to harvest timber in Clayoquot Sound. In keeping with the Scientific Panel's principles, Iisaak voluntarily took steps to protect six small, unclassified, temperate rainforest wetlands in one of four cutblocks. The main objectives in protecting the wetlands were to maintain their ecosystem functions and to maintain linkages within and between the wetland areas. To achieve these and other objectives, Iisaak used variable retention and aerial harvesting methods in the summer of 2000.This paper describes Iisaak's landscape-planning and site-planning procedures, including how planning accounted for drainage patterns, wildlife needs, and habitat connectivity. Spatial maps demonstrate that a continuous reserve network of hydroriparian and wildlife reserves determined the harvesting pattern. Over 75% of the original old-growth forest was retained across the cutblock. This effort is one of the first examples of how the Scientific Panel's guidelines were incorporated into a timber-harvesting regime. The ecological benefits of doing so remain to be seen through effectiveness monitoring.</jats:p>"

While generally true that safety stocks will be lower, regular stocks, on the other hand, may rise with such cross filling of demand.

We find that, consistent with archival evidence from KPMG in Elliott (1983), planning materiality is not a constant percentage of a base, but increases at a decreasing rate with client size. In addition, we find that planning materiality values increase with the quality of the client's control environment and the magnitude of the client's rate of return on assets, while decreasing with the complexity of the client. We also find that Big 5 firms use lower planning materiality values than non-Big 5 firms, ceteris paribus, which is consistent with the production of relatively higher audit quality levels by the Big 5. Finally, we find that auditors use lower materiality values in situations where earnings might be managed to show a small profit or a small loss.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we examine the spatial practices of mobile workers—how mobile workers manage their use of technology and place. Data from interviews with highly mobile workers and ‘hot-deskers’ are used to explore the reciprocal relationship between practice and place: how places change work, but also how work changes places. Mobile workers often need to configure their activities to take account of the different places in which they find themselves. This can involve considerable ‘juggling’ of their plans, humble office equipment, and their coworkers. In turn mobile workers change places, as they appropriate different sites for their work. Specifically, technology allows for the limited reappropriation of travel and leisure sites as places for work (such as trains and cafés). Time is also an important practical concern for mobile workers. Although mobile work may be seen as relatively flexible, fixed temporal structures allow mobile workers to ‘accomplish synchronicity’ with others. Although this paper focuses on the specific practices of mobile workers, it also explores how ‘grand social theory’ can help us understand the practical details of mobile work, yet how practice cannot be simply reduced to theory. </jats:p>",

Four motive factors for the willingness to pay for online music were found and subsequent cluster analysis identified three meaningful and distinct downloader groups who are willing to pay for online music: demanding downloaders; general download approvers; procurement autonomous. Consumer price sensitivity for two different commercial online‐music distribution models was very similar and the majority of users had similar ideas as to how much a commercial download service should cost.

Preparing for and responding to such manmade emergencies, however, threatens the ethical underpinnings of routine, individualized, patient-centered, emergency healthcare. The exigency of a critical incident can instantly transform resource rich environs, to those of austerity. Healthcare workers, who only moments earlier may have been seeing two to three patients per hour, are instantly thrust into a sea of casualties and more basic lifeboat issues of quarantine, system overload and the thornier determinations of who will be given every chance to live and who will be allowed to die. Beyond the tribulations of triage, surge capacity, and the allocation of scarce resources, terrorism creates a parallel need for a host of virtues not commonly required in daily medical practice, including prudence, courage, justice, stewardship, vigilance, resilience, and charity. As a polyvalent counterpoint to the vices of apathy, cowardice, profligacy, recklessness, inflexibility, and narcissism, the virtues empower providers at all levels to vertically integrate principles of safety, public health, utility, and medical ethics at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Over time, virtuous behavior can be modeled, mentored, practiced, and institutionalized to become one of our more useful vaccines against the threat of terrorism in the new millennium.</jats:p>",

This way of understanding the local character of mobility has two advantages: one is that it allows us to understand the notion in terms of the social organization of activities as part of which it is managed by relevant members, rather than understanding it in a purely theoretical manner. The other advantage is that it offers us a detailed and concrete understanding of the environment in relation to people's activities that potentially can be used as a basis for some sensitive tools for designing or redesigning the environment in terms of its specific arrangement of mobility. Detailed observations are made on the emergency medical system to illustrate the complex temporal and spatial arrangements involved in moving a patient from one place to another, providing necessary medical treatment on the way, and coordinating different expertise in organizationally and geographically different locations. </jats:p>",

While the neighbourhood has experienced deepening poverty, widening disadvantage, the entrenchment of an open air drug market, epidemic levels of HIV/AIDS and rising crime rates, it has also undergone extensive residential and commercial revitalisation. This paper explores, qualitatively, the City of Vancouver's policy and planning role in the spatial and temporal collision of both upgrading and downgrading within this single urban neighbourhood. Particular attention is paid to the unintended geographic and social impacts of municipal policy and the challenges faced by the city in attempting to address the conflicting expectations of community interests and the possibility of diametrically opposed, yet equally possible, neigh‐bourhood futures. The paper points to the necessity of continued research on the local dynamics, policy implications and scale of intra‐urban socio‐spatial polarisation.</jats:p>",

Business process reengineering (BPR) is applied to migrate the business processes of the supply chain onto the Web. Such migration may cause some of the processes merged together, minimized or transformed into other processes within a supply chain. Therefore, careful planning for such migration with technical requirements is necessary. This paper starts with the review of related research on BPR, migration of supply chain onto the Internet, and the impact analysis of the migration. A thorough overview of how BPR can change each process of the supply chain onto the Internet is discussed. The main contribution of this paper is a framework of the electronic commerce (EC) impact on the supply chain and the measurement of impact. An industrial example is used to illustrate the evaluation as a result of EC deployment.</jats:p>",

However, many previous approaches have limited themselves to an essentially descriptive or reporting function. The fact that many concepts fail to go beyond enumerating desirable indicators has meant that in most cases these indicators do not end up being properly integrated within the planning and decision-making processes of regional and state-level spatial planning. This article discusses a number of possible ways of refining sustainability indicators as demonstrated by a monitoring and controlling system for the land-use type “commercial space”. Whereas other studies on the topic of regional sustainability indicators have tended to concentrate primarily on the goal of regional comparisons and rankings, the approach discussed here aims to show how indicators may be put to use as tools within the planning process. Consequently, the monitoring- and controlling-based approach is not presented simply in abstract or theoretical terms, but is rather underpinned by a review of the results of its application in the Eastern Thuringia region as an illustration of the benefits it promises for planning practice.</jats:p>"

The metropolitan areas examined are Boston, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Two essential components of the analysis are the calculation of refined job-access measures that take into account travel modes as well as the supply and demand of the labor market, and the incorporation of job-access measures into multinomial logit models. The results indicate that improved transit-based job accessibility significantly augments both the probability of being employed and the probability of working 30 hours or more per week for autoless workers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Further, in these two areas, job accessibility has a greater effect for autoless workers than for auto-owning workers. Job accessibility plays a more significant role in employment outcomes for autoless workers in San Francisco and Los Angeles, highly auto-dependent areas, than it does in Boston, a more compact area with relatively well-developed transit systems. The empirical findings hold important implications for the theory and policy debate surrounding spatial mismatch. </jats:p>",

Current quantitative research on the deployment of employment across metropolitan areas tends to assume that it is governed by market forces (as expressed through a variety of location factors). However,there are also calls for a form of metropolitan regionalism, for a consistent metropolitan policy framework to guide development and avoid sprawl. In the context of these methodological,interpretative,and policy debates,the authors examine whether the deployment of jobs across the Paris region,which has had a clear and consistent regional planning framework over the past 30 years,has been influenced by this policy. They conclude that over the 1978 to 1994 period,the suburbanization of jobs has been effectively channeled by the policy framework put in place in 1965. Hence, policy matters. </jats:p>",

Our initial focus is on simple roadway driving scenarios where the controlled vehicle encounters objects in its path. Our approach is to develop an ontology of objects in the environment, in conjunction with rules for estimating the damage that would be incurred by collisions with the different objects in different situations. Automated reasoning is used to estimate collision damage; this information is fed to the route planner to help it decide whether to avoid the object.

Our main purpose is the automatic synthesis of collision‐free reaching motions for both arms, with automatic column control and leg flexion. Generated motions are collision‐free, in equilibrium, and respect articulation range limits. In order to deal with the high (22) dimension of our configuration space, we bias the random distribution of configurations to favor postures most useful for reaching and grasping. In addition, extensions are presented in order to interactively generate object manipulation sequences: a probabilistic inverse kinematics solver for proposing goal postures matching pre‐designed grasps; dynamic update of roadmaps when obstacles change position; online planning of object location transfer; and an automatic stepping control to enlarge the character's reachable space. This is, to our knowledge, the first time probabilistic planning techniques are used to automatically generate collision‐free reaching motions involving the entire body of a human‐like character at interactive frame rates.</jats:italic> </jats:p><jats:p>Categories and Subject Descriptors (according to ACM CCS): I.3.7 [Computer Graphics]: Three‐Dimensional Graphics and Realism</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sample-size planning historically has been approached from a power analytic perspective in order to have some reasonable probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis. Another approach that is not as well-known is one that emphasizes accuracy in parameter estimation (AIPE). From the AIPE perspective, sample size is chosen such that the expected width of a confidence interval will be sufficiently narrow. The rationales of both approaches are delineated and two procedures are given for estimating the sample size from the AIPE perspective for a two-group mean comparison. One method yields the required sample size, such that the expected width of the computed confidence interval will be the value specified. A modification allows for a defined degree of probabilistic assurance that the width of the computed confidence interval will be no larger than specified. The authors emphasize that the correct conceptualization of sample-size planning depends on the research questions and particular goals of the study. </jats:p>",

Effective use of these systems requires parallel actuation and planning, both for efficiency and independence from a central controller. In this paper we present the PacMan algorithm, a technique for distributed actuation and planning for systems with two- or three-dimensional unit-compressible modules. We give two versions of the algorithm along with correctness analysis. We also analyze the parallel actuation capability of the algorithm, showing that it will not deadlock and will avoid disconnecting the robot. We have implemented PacMan on the Crystal robot, a hardware system developed in our lab, and we present experiments and discuss the feasibility of large-scale implementation. </jats:p>",

Findings were based on data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Study-Nursing Home Component (MEPSNHC), a survey using a two-stage stratified probability sample of nursing homes and residents to produce valid national estimates of the nursing home population in the United States. The two types of advance directives included basic, i.e., living will or do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order, and progressive (do-not-hospitalize order or orders restricting feeding, medication, or other treatment). Approximately 59 percent of long-term care residents had a basic advance directive, 9 percent have a progressive directive, and 60 percent have some type of directive. Logistic regression results indicate that the factors associated with the likelihood of each type of directive differ considerably, and only two variables (African American ethnicity and less time in the facility) were associated with a reduced likelihood of having either type of directive. Our results indicate that the two proposed types of advance directives are distinct with regard to the variables predicting each. </jats:p>",

Food provisioned stingray tourism, for example, now attracts some 100 000 visitors a year to ‘tingray city’ in the Caymen Islands. At Hamelin Bay in southwest Western Australia, up to 16 large stingrays (<jats:italic>Dasyatis brevicaudata</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Dasyatis thetidis</jats:italic>) and numerous eaglerays (<jats:italic>Myliobatis australis</jats:italic>) are fed by visitors from the waters edge. This study reports on stakeholder perspectives relating to tourism development and potential management of the Hamelin Bay site. From the results of this study it is clear that there is sufficient interest in stingray tourism (by all the stakeholders surveyed) to develop Hamelin Bay as a permanent feeding site. Visitors on average gave their experience with the rays a satisfaction value of 8.9 out of 10. Twenty‐five per cent of visitors surveyed did not want commercialisation, tour groups or excessive visitor numbers. Their main concern was that the health and safety of the rays may deteriorate with an increase of visitors if the situation is not managed correctly. Visitors desire to be educated about the rays, and how to best interact with them safely. Visitors also acknowledged that the site needs management through more signs, information and a management plan. Management for the site is therefore likely to be best implemented through the application of signage, development of guidelines/codes of conduct, protection of the rays and zoning the beach according to specific recreational purposes. Management regimes should also use various indicators to monitor the impacts of stingray tourism at Hamelin Bay. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

By looking at data from recorded mobile-phone conversations, I use a conversation analytic approach to make initial observations on the character of mobile-phone conversations. I found that the frequent question “what are you doing?” sometimes caused a location to be given as part of the answer which shows how location, activity, and availability are strongly related. The participants thus obtained information about location, when this was considered relevant, through asking about activity. Location seemed especially relevant if it provided information about a future meeting. In some of the conversations where it seemed there was something going on where the ‘called party’ was located, the ‘caller’ reacted by initiating the conversation with a strategy which gave the called party a chance to end the conversation. </jats:p>",

The first group identified was children who possessed a non-routine or unpredictable pathway of post-hospital treatment. The second group encompassed those with multifaceted, complex post-hospital care needs, requiring extensive internal hospital department coordination and involvement of community-based care providers in the discharge planning process. It was found that discharge risk factors reflecting objective and easily observable illness and treatment criteria were the most reliable predictors of need for social work discharge planning. It is recommended that a discharge risk tool be completed in partnership with unit nursing staff, and that it be subjected to further review in other organizational settings. </jats:p>",

Engaging both with the ‘relevance’ and the ‘culture–economy’ debates in human geography, and with wider feminist political theory, I argue that the recognition of issues of ‘cultural justice’ is crucial to an effective engagement with social justice issues. I suggest a new approach to the cultural economy debate that neither forces a choice between culture and economy, nor only ‘transcends’ their division. Instead, the concept of ‘revaluing’ is introduced, which encompasses both the cultural and the economic but allows one or the other, or both, to be asserted—depending on the spatial and political context. These points are developed through a qualitative case study of the Single Regeneration Budget, a policy which attempts to address social exclusion, inequality, and deprivation. This case study suggests that a lack of attention to cultural justice issues, such as recognition and respect, leads to a policy that fails to remedy, and even perpetuates, the exclusionary mechanisms it seeks to address. Instead, a more fundamental revaluing of socially excluded people and places needs to be carried out in order to achieve greater inclusion. Indeed, reflecting on these issues through cultural and feminist lenses, I suggest a wider remit than policy for human geographers to engage effectively with major social justice issues. </jats:p>",

Yet, researchers in this field must recognise the importance of complementing these technical advances with improved understanding of the patterns of classroom activity that most need support. The approach taken in the work reported in this paper has been to create conceptual tools that help thinking and talking about technology‐supported collaborative learning. A particularly powerful tool is <jats:italic>Collaborative Design Patterns,</jats:italic> which captures common learning situations and benefits in written form. This paper uses four classroom scenarios to describe eight patterns. These patterns fall into two categories: whole‐activity patterns, which suggest ways to organise one or more class periods, and smaller‐grained support patterns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Issues of regional innovation and learning have attracted growing interest from economic geographers and related specialists in recent years. The advantages to be gained from localised networks and learning are claimed to be particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in helping offset the size-related advantages of larger firms. Such claims are part of a wider rediscovery of the benefits of clustering and agglomeration in economic geography. Yet, to date, theoretical speculation about the renewed importance of geographical clustering for SMEs has run ahead of detailed empirical research. Beyond a few well-known case studies of high-technology clusters, there have been few attempts systematically to ‘test’ assertions made about the links between innovation, collaboration, and learning. The authors' purpose in this paper is to contribute new empirical evidence to this debate through a case study of SMEs in the Aberdeen oil complex. Although they find some evidence to support the role of localised forms of collaboration among the most innovative SMEs, the authors' results also indicate the importance of extralocal networks of knowledge transfer and the unequal power relations that underpin interfirm relations. These findings reinforce recent calls for a shift of focus from ‘regions’ to ‘networks’, raising some fundamental questions about the substantive basis of clusters policy. </jats:p>",

A sample of 45 fourth-grade general education children was sorted into three groups based on each PASS scale profile from the Cognitive Assessment System (CAS). The groups did not differ by CAS Full Scale standard score, chronological age, gender, or pretest reading comprehension scores. After each child's pretest reading comprehension instructional level was determined, a cognitive strategy instruction intervention was conducted. The children completed a reading comprehension posttest at their respective instructional levels after the intervention. Results showed that children with a Planning weakness (n = 13) benefited substantially (effect size of 1.52) from the instruction designed to facilitate planning. Children with no weakness (n = 21; effect size = .52) or a Successive weakness (n = 11; effect size of .06) did not benefit as much. These results support previous research suggesting that PASS profiles are relevant to instruction. </jats:p>",

Z97 found weak evidence that this requirement would impact auditors' planning judgments. However, because Z97 was conducted before SAS No. 82 was issued, that study was unable to capture the full effect of SAS No. 82 on the audit environment (e.g., related guidance and training, audit policy, and implementation experience). In this study, we compare pre- and post-SAS No. 82 planning judgments and find that post-SAS No. 82 judgments are more sensitive to fraud risk factors. Specifically, we find that post-SAS No. 82 participants are more aware of the need to modify audit plans and are more likely to increase the extent of their audit tests in response to increased fraud risk when compared with the pre-SAS No. 82 participants in Z97. However, we do not find evidence that auditors modify the nature of their planned tests in response to fraud risk either before or after SAS No. 82.</jats:p>",

The research reported here was undertaken by Linda Ward, Professor of Disability and Social Policy at the University of Bristol, where she is director of the Norah Fry Research Centre; Robina Mallett, Carer Support Officer at the Home Farm Trust; Pauline Heslop, Research Fellow at the Norah Fry Research Centre; and Ken Simons, Senior Research Fellow at the Norah Fry Research Centre until his untimely death in January 2003, to find out how well this legislation and guidance works in practice from the perspective of young people with learning disabilities and their families. Based on information from questionnaires completed by parents and separate in‐depth interviews with youngsters with learning disabilities and their parents, this article reveals that many young people in the study left school without any transition planning, as far as their parents were aware. Where transition planning had occurred, there was a stark mismatch between the topics families wanted to cover and those addressed by the professionals involved. Many of the youngsters who did receive transition planning had little if any involvement in the process; parental involvement was also significantly less than it should have been. In drawing conclusions from their research, the authors review the most positive aspects of the process from the perspective of the young people and their parents; parents' ideas for improving transition planning; and messages from the research for professionals, including those working in education.</jats:p>",

Research questions are then proposed to determine the extent to which negotiation is part of the integrated sourcing process. To answer the research questions, the strategic sourcing process and negotiation plan are evaluated in 29 cases. In 14 of the 29 cases, strategic sourcing was completed and integrated into the negotiation plan. This is just under half of the cases, which led to the general conclusion that negotiation is not well integrated with the other strategic sourcing processes. Additional findings indicated the appropriate negotiation style was used in only 64 percent of the cases, with most mismatches occurring when an integrative style was used instead of the more appropriate distributive style. Managerial and research implications of the findings are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

We have developed a high‐resolution map of population‐to‐service access in four districts of Kenya. Theoretical physical access, based upon national targets, developed as part of the Kenyan health sector reform agenda, was compared with actual health service usage data among 1668 paediatric patients attending 81 sampled government health facilities. Actual and theoretical use were highly correlated. Patients in the larger districts of Kwale and Makueni, where access to government health facilities was relatively poor, travelled greater mean distances than those in Greater Kisii and Bondo. More than 60% of the patients in the four districts attended health facilities within a 5‐km range. Interpolated physical access surfaces across districts highlighted areas of poor access and large differences between urban and rural settings. Users from rural communities travelled greater distances to health facilities than those in urban communities. The implications of planning and monitoring equitable delivery of clinical services at national and international levels are discussed.</jats:p>",

Prostate, bladder, and rectum were outlined on all scans. Prostate isocenter coordinates, maximum dimensions, and volumes were compared along with bladder and rectal volumes. Bladder volumes and maximum diameters were further investigated using a second observer. A comparative analysis of DRR quality was conducted as well as a dosimetric analysis using DVH. <jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> The differences in measurements of prostate volume, isocenter coordinates and maximum dimensions between the 3 and 5 mm scans, were small and not statistically significant. Similar finding was seen for rectal volume. However, bladder volume was always larger on the 3 mm scan <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20365-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20365:equation:acm20365-math-0001\" /> and the findings were reproduced with the second observer <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20365-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20365:equation:acm20365-math-0002\" />. The differences in volume are caused by a slight increase in (1) the measurement of the longitudinal dimensions on the 3 mm scans, and (2) the slice by slice measured bladder area on the 3 mm scans. The latter is due to partial volume effect. The 3 mm DRR were slightly better than the 5 mm DRR. The bladder DVH differed significantly in some patients. <jats:italic>Conclusion:</jats:italic> Bladder volume is significantly larger on the 3 mm scans. Differences in contoured areas may be accounted for, in part, by the partial volume effect.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.57.–s, 87.53.–j</jats:p>",

This paper begins by reviewing the motivations for stakeholder participation in water resources planning &amp; governance and highlighting some of the methodological and technical problems associated with the design and deployment of suitable ICT platforms. It then goes on to report the design and field testing of a specific Multi-Media based ICT platform for use in stakeholder debates, drawing on case study material from a catchment in Southern France. Specifically, we focus our comments on the issues of content structuring, information presentation, knowledge quality and tool functionality, seen as the major determinants of the tool's ability to support dialogue among non-scientific stakeholders. Finally, we draw conclusions about the experimental deployment of the tool, draw out lessons for future design and implementation activities, and comment on some of the limitations emergent from the use of the tool. </jats:p>",
