As stated in the letter of promulgation, the document provides for cooperative measures for dealing with accidental and unauthorized releases of pollutants that may cause damage to the environment and that may constitute a threat to the public health, property, or welfare along the shared inland boundary of the two nations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The plan divided the international boundary into five regional planning areas and mandated regional annexes that define the jurisdiction, roles, and response procedures of the regulatory and support agencies within each planning area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In our work on this project it is being made clear again and again that responders on both sides of our countries’ land border do not want to have their efforts hampered by what in an emergency could be arbitrary borders. We are committed to ensuring that the regulatory agencies in both countries are truly supportive of the on-scene responders, and that these annexes will only serve to enhance this support.</jats:p>",

For new oil field developments the integration of water management with oil production planning is vital to avoid environmental damage and bottlenecks to production. For mature oil fields the harmonization of topsides and downhole water control is critical to extending their economic life and continued compliance with environmental regulations, The multidisciplinary and inter-departmental nature of oil field water management, combined with rapidly evolving technology and environmental regulations, makes effective planning and communication vital. An oil field water management system using the latest information technology is described which has the objective to improve design, operation, profitability and environmental compliance. A suite of computer programs, amalgamated by a relational database can be installed on the office network to improve inter-department communication and data accessibility. The software provides expert system step-by-step guidelines for water management through out the oil field life cycle. After existing information on the field is inputted into the database, deficiencies in the data-set are highlighted along with guidance to rectify the shortfalls. Once an adequate data-set is compiled, sub-routines investigate, for example, water compatibilities, reservoir souring, thermal fracturing, water injection and production rates, environmental regulations, water quality requirements, downhole water control and topsides process design. A water handling strategy for the oil field life-cycle is then defined.</jats:p>",

Argues that if this is the case, then arguably the vast amounts of effort and expenditure invested in brands within many grocery and fast‐moving consumer goods is potentially misplaced. Discusses the nature of high and low level involvement decision making for brands. Presents research which shows that the level of involvement is largely determined at the category level not the brand level. It is therefore beyond the scope of brand management to alter these involvement perceptions, unless they are able to create new categories or sub‐categories for their brands. Argues that this is the real challenge of brand management.</jats:p>",

The performance measure traditionally used in the QC planning process is the probability of rejecting an analytical run when a critical out-of-control error condition exists. Another performance measure that naturally fits within the total allowable error paradigm is the probability that a reported test result contains an analytical error that exceeds the total allowable error specification. In general, the out-of-control error conditions associated with the greatest chance of reporting an unacceptable test result are unrelated to the traditionally defined “critical” error conditions. If the probability of reporting an unacceptable test result is used as the primary performance measure, worst-case QC performance can be determined irrespective of the magnitude of any out-of-control error condition that may exist, thus eliminating the need for the concept of a “critical” out-of-control error.</jats:p>",

Indeed, certain academics claim that MPR may evolve into a new marketing or PR discipline separate from corporate public relations. The research is compared with the findings from a review of pertinent literature. Exploratory findings indicate that what MPR represents is merely a new term for PR applied to marketing promotion. However, the fact that a new label has been applied does not amount to the emergence of a new marketing discipline.

The specification of effective oil spill equipment is often a difficult task because of the wide array of commercially produced goods available to the end user. In addition, in various countries there exists little or no framework legislation that quantifies the equipment component in practical terms. This paper attests to the usefulness of the new Canada Shipping Act guidelines for the purposes of planning the equipment requirements for a predetermined potential spill quantity. Through the elaboration of a case history, it presents the development of an integrated 2500-ton oil spill response capability. Since response organizations under the new Canada Shipping Act regime are in effect commercial ventures rather than simply oil spill cooperatives, innovative and cost-effective solutions are necessary to maintain capital costs at a minimum.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although the equipment in the case history was commissioned directly as a response to the new Canadian standards, the important planning principles can be applied to any geographical region.</jats:p>",

A survey of conceptual issues, of three environmental economists' proposals to achieve sustainability, and of initial practical experience in the industrialised countries suggest that planning for environmentally sustainable development involves an ambitious attempt to reconcile environmental and development objectives. It is argued that to the extent that this proves possible it will be a radically disjointed process involving interaction of many agencies and actors. At the heart of the challenge of planning for sustainable development is an issue of institutional design to which political science, despite the hesitancy it has so far displayed to engage with the issue, could yet make a meaningful contribution. </jats:p>",

The NRT is composed of 15 federal agencies identified in Subpart ? of the National Contingency Plan as having responsibility for federal environmental emergency response. The “One Plan” format avoids unnecessary duplication of effort and offers significant time, paper, and dollar savings. It also promotes an all-incident approach to response planning across facility divisions.</jats:p>",

The reservoir contains a relatively lean gas-condensate whose tested condensate to gas ratio (CGR) is 60 bbls/MMscf. Laboratory testing indicates 2.4% liquid dropout. The gas-water contact (GWC) in all wells is located at 10197 ft subsea. Although large faults creating the possibility for several fault blocks are apparent in all of the seismic interpretations, the faults have not led to differing fluid compositions or contacts. The reservoir is comprised of a series of sandstone and shale intervals. In general, the upper part of the reservoir contains sands of lower net-to-gross and lower quality, while the lower part of the reservoir contains sands of higher quality with higher net-to-gross values. Core and drill stem testing has shown large variability in reservoir quality. Permeabilities from both core and drill stem tests range from less than 1 millidarcy to over 1 darcy.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Bayu-Undan Field was one of the most significant discoveries in 1995 in terms of total reserves of oil and gas. The field, located in the offshore Timor Gap Zone of cooperation Area A between Australia and Indonesia, is 280 miles northwest of Darwin, Australia (Fig. 1). The nearest landfall is approximately 130 miles north on Timor Island, Indonesia. The major part of the field lies in water depth between 230 to 300 feet. The field straddles two adjacent Production Sharing Contracts - ZOCA 91–12 operated by a group led by BHP Petroleum and designated Undan and ZOCA 91–13 operated by a group led by Phillips Petroleum Company and designated Bayu (Fig. 2).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The appraisal and development planning of the field is being carried out to commercialize the field at the earliest opportunity. The discovery well, Bayu #1, drilled by Phillips Petroleum Company intersected 575 feet of hydrocarbon column and the confirmation well, Undan #1, drilled by BHP Petroleum intersected 410 feet of hydrocarbon column. Both wells have the same GWC of 10197 feet subsea. To date, eight additional wells have been drilled, thus accomplishing a successful appraisal campaign. In the last twelve months, extensive subsurface and feasibility studies to finalize and optimize the development plan have been undertaken.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Geology</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Bayu-Undan Field is part of the greater Flamingo High within the northern Bonaparte Basin.

Currently, most spill planning tends to focus on more rural river and coastal environments. However, lessons learned from a spill in the greater Los Angeles area provide several unique opportunities to improve contingency planning, area plans, and response operations in a very practical sense. In this case, an underground pipeline was punctured by excavation equipment, and the spill entered a 96-inch underground storm sewer and traveled approximately 2 miles. It then continued another 12 miles through creeks and rivers and was eventually stopped approximately one-half mile before it reached the Pacific Ocean. The following lessons were learned from this incident:The designation of a responsible party and the allocation of response costs should address third parties in an equitable way.Initial responders must communicate all pertinent facts to the spill management team.Response plans should address methods to prevent oil from entering storm sewers and response procedures to clean them if it does occur.Response plans should address the special safety requirements of confined space entry, in the unlikely event that oil must be removed and cleaned up in these areas.The area contingency plan should identify and address the response requirements of noxious weeds that may be present in oiled vegetation.The impact of oil spill response operations on communities, such as noise and traffic, becomes a major factor in metropolitan areas and must be addressed by the responsible party.</jats:p>",

While positivism has been particularly guilty of ignoring the interests of lesbians and gay men, the new cultural geography, and feminist geography, though enabling a limited amount of work on the geography of lesbians and gay men, may also reproduce heterosexism. This raises the question of which methodological and epistemological frameworks work best in promoting the interests of sexual dissidents within the discipline, and the academy more generally.

For this analysis, 7 years of oil spill data collected in the Emergency Response Notification System were used to measure the impact that OPA 90 has had on preventing large spills. Furthermore, relationships among the types, sources, and location of spilled oil are characterized. A comparison of the number of reported 10,000-gallon oil spills for the years 1992-1995 to that number for the years 1989-1991 indicates a decline, not only for vessels but also for pipelines and fixed facilities. The decline in large oil spills to water from various sources appears to indicate that the efforts of government and industry have had a measurable impact on environmental protection.</jats:p>",

The National Response Team (NRT), in cooperation with the Region 6 Response Team (RRT), has developed a contingency plan format that simplifies existing federal regulatory requirements into a single integrated contingency plan (ICP). This format, which was developed by a working group chaired by the EPA Region 6, with representatives from government, industry, labor, and environmental groups, can be used as a model for cooperative projects involving the public and private sectors. The purpose of the ICP is to simplify emergency response plans at facilities. A facility using the ICP format would benefit from the reduced costs of maintaining and updating plans and from the simplified training for responders. Use of the ICP format should also reduce confusion about which plan to use during a response and should improve coordination between facilities and state and federal response agencies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>“No two spills are alike” is an important maxim in oil spill response that requires planners and responders alike to remain adaptable in their thinking regarding response actions. The majority of oil spills are small and can usually be addressed adequately within the confines of a rigid response management system. However, a large spill is not simply a “scaling up” of a routine, small spill. Large spills require input from many more stakeholders, public outrage is intensified, and often difficult decisions on environmental, economic, and emotional tradeoffs are necessary. As a result, a catastrophic spill requires responders to have more than the equipment-focused organizational skills that are satisfactory during routine spills. Complex spills require responders to have advanced interpersonal skills such as team building, risk communication, and organizational problem solving. It is very difficult, however, to evaluate the responder's grasp of these skills and ability to implement them, even though these skills are so critical to the success of a large spill response. The skills that often ensure success for small, frequently occurring spills are not the only skills required for success in a large, complex spill incident.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>On the federal level, the area contingency planning process was established to plan for, respond to, and evaluate the adequacy of response capability in a given area. Currently, area contingency plans consist primarily of boiler-plate language, reference materials such as lists of resources, notification procedures, and general incident command system information, all written to satisfy the format required by the guidelines (U.S. Coast Guard, 1992). What is usually missing, however, is a useful discussion by the area committee on how responders might work together to solve problems and on detailed “how to” strategies for preventing a bad situation from getting worse. As a result, the requirement that there be an “assessment of the effectiveness of the plan” (Public Law 101-380, 1990 and 1992) may not be able to take into account an evaluation of the problem-solving and communications skills of the response organization, which is necessary for both the public perception and the reality of a successful complex spill response.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our objective is to demonstrate how a four-step, scenario-based approach to training, contingency planning, and exercises can improve the response management system's (RMS) performance and ability to succeed. If the area committee is trained with an outward focus on stakeholder needs, develops a scenario-based contingency plan with its stakeholders, and exercises its response organization using these scenario-based processes, it will improve the effectiveness of a response to a major, complex spill.</jats:p>",

Rising costs and flat oil prices have made conventional development uneconomic or marginal at best. The success of future development efforts relies heavily upon improving the key development drivers including well reserves, production rates and development costs. These are often challenging tasks, especially in Brunei Offshore Fields, where reservoirs are located in areas of significant stratigraphic and structural complexity. Development opportunities are also constrained by limited conductor slots from fixed platform locations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes the current initiatives in BSP to mature the remaining undeveloped oil reserves in the shallow reservoirs of the Champion Field, Offshore Brunei, into robust profitable projects through a focussed approach of improving the key development drivers. We describe the application of state-of-the-art technology in 3D reservoir modelling to provide better infill development locations and improved production forecast estimates, together with the use of more innovative development options. The aim is to maximise well reserves and production rates, and minimise development costs. This will significantly improve the economics of subsequent development projects which would otherwise be uneconomic if the historical norm of conventional development would continue.</jats:p>",

The urban built environment is assumed to be a passive adapter to structural change. However, given the complexity of property market process—in particular the disparate nature of market actors, decision rules, and institutions, the immutable characteristics of property, and the obvious constraints imposed by the existing built environment—simple adaptive adjustment is unlikely to take place. These factors can themselves be expected to play an important part in shaping urban growth and development outcomes. In response to these concerns, we propose a property market paradigm of urban change and examine its relevance in the context of six major European urban regions. The results suggest that this approach can provide a more holistic understanding of contemporary urban change than that offered by conventional analysis. </jats:p>",

In this paper I address debates in the field of colonial discourse analysis in order to explore the connections between particular conceptions of language and particular models of politics to which oppositional academics consider themselves responsible, The rhetorical representation of empowerment and disempowerment through figures of ‘speech’ and ‘silence’, respectively, is critically examined in order to expose the limits of this representation of power relations. Through a reading of Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's account of the dilemmas of subaltern representation, contrasted to that of Benita Parry, and staged via an account of their different interpretations of the exemplary postcolonial fictions of J M Coetzee, it is argued that the deconstruction of the conventional metaphories of speech and silence calls into view the irreducible textuality of the work of representation. This implies that questions about institutional positionality and academic authority be kept squarely in sight when discussing the problems of representing the struggles and agency of marginalised social groups. It is suggested that the continuing suspicion of literary and cultural theory amongst social scientists for being insufficiently ‘materialist’ and/or ‘political’ may serve to reproduce certain forms of institutionally sanctioned disciplinary authority. </jats:p>",

In the months leading up to the passing of this legislation, a debate emerged which focused on the spaces of the modern metropolis, the production of modern forms of visual culture, and the possibility of transgressive forms of cultural consumption. One street in London became the symbol for this definition of obscenity—Holywell Street in Westminster, which ran parallel to the Strand from St Clement Danes to St Mary-le-Strand. The narrow contours and crumbling buildings of this Elizabethan alley signified physical, moral, and cultural impurity, in contrast to the modernising ambitions of the city in this period. The display of obscene images in the shop windows enabled a new form of cultural consumption based on looking while moving through the street.

This consistency is crucial if personnel are brought in from different regions during a drill or spill, since they can then become instantly familiar with the process and terminology. The same sets of standard terms and conditions are applied to prespill database development, sensitivity and prespill mapping, shoreline cleanup assessment technique (SCAT) data generation, and the response management decision process. This concept is very powerful because it provides a consistent terminology for the entire range of prespill planning, preparedness, and response activities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper briefly describes the scope, objectives, and status of this mapping initiative and highlights recent developments in the effort to combine the full range of prespill activities, from data generation and decision development to sensitivity mapping. The scheme addresses the requirements of decision makers, planning managers, and operation managers. The program in place for Atlantic Canada integrates the following:A single pollution reporting and alerting system covering the four eastern Canadian provincesPartnerships in the environmental emergency field, particularly with respect to the provision of comprehensive environmental adviceEnvironment Canada's SCAT methodology in prespill data generationShoreline segmentationResponse management by objectivesEnvironment Canada's Sensitivity Mapping ProgramEnvironment Canada's Field Guides for the Documentation and the Protection and Treatment of Oiled Shorelines</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The desktop mapping package and spill trends database that have been adapted provide an easy-to-use approach to the manipulation and display of the wide range of technical and support data and information stored in the databases.

In this way response managers have access to a wide range of information that normally would be difficult to collate and present in map form, particularly under the pressures at the time of a response.</jats:p>",

In this paper, focusing upon historical changes in Muslim women's access to and occupation of different kinds of space in the Sahelian city of Maradi, Niger, the author shifts attention away from the spaces themselves and towards women's active movement through and transformation of the spaces of the body, the home, and the city. Women define themselves, their social status, and their economic possibilities by acquiring and transforming what the author calls ‘internal spaces’ and by entering into previously inaccessible ‘external spaces’. More concretely, they locate themselves socially and economically through the decoration of their rooms in their marital homes, through the acquisition of urban property, and through the adoption of veiling. By renegotiating their spatial position women reconfigure their economic and social options. In so doing they subtly and unconsciously alter the character of the urban terrain, the nature of local marriage, and the configuration of local gender relations. Women's attempts to reposition themselves have had complex and contradictory implications. They nevertheless make clear that gender analyses fixing upon reified spaces or scales are inadequate and that common Western assumptions about Muslim women's experience of internal spaces and veiling need to be rethought. </jats:p>",

I also suggest that although music hall songs and sketches purveyed images of racial difference they did not contribute to the discourse of racial supremacy upon which the moral justification of British imperialism rested.

Achieving the highest level of response readiness is an evolutionary process made more difficult by today's fiscal constraints on both government and industry. This paper will discuss the steps taken over the last 15 years (workshops, table-top exercises, hands-on drills) to develop a comprehensive marine fire-fighting contingency plan that was tested during a recent area PREP exercise. The PREP drill scenario involved a collision between two vessels that resulted in a large spill and fire well away from shoreside access. Participants included over 200 personnel representing 50 federal, state, and local agencies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Shipboard flammable liquid fires are never easy to extinguish; however, the degree of difficulty escalates exponentially when an event does not occur pierside with adequate access for local fire departments. Mutual aid agreements and state-of-the-art response strategies and equipment are essential to resolving this unique situation. Proper use of the incident command system helps ensure smooth, efficient waterside command and control of the fire attack assets. Special logistics systems and staging techniques need to be developed to bring adequate water and foam delivery (8000+ gpm) resources to bear on an away-from-shore incident. These requirements were shown to be well within the response capabilities of the San Francisco Bay fire-fighting community when dedicated fireboats and vessels-of-opportunity were converted to foam master stream delivery platforms.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has previously been shown that there is a significant association between mortality from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and rates of long-term migration between local authority districts in England and Wales. This evidence supports the theory that exposure to infections, mediated by population mixing, may be an important factor in many cases of SIDS. In this paper, multilevel modelling is used to examine the variability in SIDS deaths at different geographical scales, namely district, county, and regional levels. Given the population-mixing hypothesis, it is possible that high levels of population mixing in one district will have an effect on the spread of infections in an adjacent district, and the rates for individual districts will not be spatially independent of each other. Factors such as climate varying at regional scale may also be important. A log—linear multilevel model is developed to examine these issues, and the discussion focuses on the methodological issues raised by the analysis such as appropriate multilevel structure, methods of estimation, dispersion of residuals, and significance of parameter estimates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geography is centrally concerned with difference and heterogeneity, yet much quantitative modelling has been concerned with finding average or general relationships thereby relegating variability to a single catchall ‘error’ term. Multilevel modelling, in contrast, anticipates complex between-individual and between-place heterogeneity. Previous accounts of the approach have stressed the modelling of higher level, between-place differences, but here the emphasis is placed on the simultaneous consideration of complex variation at all levels. A parade of models is presented each of which considers a particular facet of the model specification. Attention is drawn to the important contrasts between the modelling of categorical and continuous predictors. Illustrative results are provided for variations in British house prices, modelled with the ML n software. An appendix provides an example of the use of this software. </jats:p>",

The new course utilized a hybrid problem‐based learning (PBL) format that provided students with an overview in lecture format while encouraging active learning in small group tutorials and seminars. Half the second‐year class was randomly selected to participate in the new course, while the other half received the standard lectures on the subject. An outcomes assessment examined whether the aforementioned problems had been addressed in the new course. Course participants completed a post‐course evaluation, and all students completed a self‐assessment of their preparedness and progress in treatment planning and diagnostic. Clinical instructors, who were blind to the identity of the new course participants, were asked to independently assess each student using the same criteria. Results indicate that students who participated in the hybrid‐PBL course enjoyed the learning process and later rated themselves as being better prepared and improving more in the areas of treatment planning and diagnostic records than their counterparts, although the latter results were not routinely statistically significant (p &lt; 0.1). Instructor evaluations supported these differences between the two groups.</jats:p>",

The focus of the one-day visits for students is primarily nature awareness, with little emphasis on influencing knowledge or attitudes about local issues, human-environment relationships, or actions to reduce environmental problems.

This article describes an on-line planner for two cooperating arms whose task is to grab parts of various types on a conveyor belt and transfer them to their respective goals, while avoiding collisions with obstacles. Parts arrive on the belt in random order, at any time. Both goals and obstacles may be dynamically changed. This scenario is typi cal of manufacturing cells serving machine tools, assembling products, or packaging objects. The proposed approach breaks the overall planning problem into subproblems, each involving a low-dimensional configuration or configuration x time space, and orchestrates very fast primitives solving these subproblems. The resulting planner has been implemented and extensively tested in a simulated environment, as well as with a real dual- arm system. Its competitiveness has been evaluated against an oracle making (almost) the best decision at any one time; the results show that the planner compares extremely well. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are several strands of research which have recently converged in the analysis of exam results. A long-standing line of enquiry has been to assess the impact of deprivation on educational performance. At the school level, recent work has concentrated on trying to assess the ‘added value’ of the education provided by a school, taking into account the abilities of the children on entry. The need to assess influences operating at different levels (notably, the individual and the school) has led the analysis of exam results to be a core area in which multilevel models (MLMs) are being developed. A key question which remains is whether conditions in the neighbourhood in which the child lives exert a separate influence over and above the individual's characteristics and those of the school. This paper is an examination of the value of different data sources for explanatory MLMs of 16 year olds' exam results in Newcastle upon Tyne. Several different types of data source are assessed in order to profile individuals, schools, and neighbourhoods. The process of linking the data sets is described, highlighting some problems which are inherent to the innovation here of drawing upon administrative data from several separate information systems. As a result of these and other limitations, the MLMs which are then developed are essentially exploratory. The aim is to indicate which of the data sources provide the variables which appear to have the most predictive power in these analyses. The results are interesting and intuitively reasonable and enable judgments to be made as to, for example, which data sources provide the more indicative measures of the effects of deprivation (which the MLMs show to be operating independently at two different levels, with schools and wards cross-classified at the higher level). </jats:p>",

The authors' main concern is with the effects of the government migration policy, and the focus is on the migrations in the city/town/rural hierarchy. There are two main findings. First, although the migration policy resulted in a very low migration level and systematic distortions in migration schedules, its encouragement of downward migrations was very ineffective, whereas its control on rural-to-urban migrations was partially weakened by the strong upward aspiration of rural families awakened by recent economic reform. Consequently, net in-migration contributed substantially to the growth both of city and of town populations. Second, although the level of education had a strong positive effect on the migration propensities both of males and of females in general, it had a strong negative effect on the migration propensities of females at the time of marriage, a finding which suggests that the families at subsistence income level tended to marry their daughters to grooms in other communities in order to reduce the risk of familial income shortfalls. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Primary forest cover in western Madagascar declined from 12.5% in 1950 to 2.8% in 1990. Approximately 23% of remaining forest is located within reserves, but this is no guarantee of protection. Forest cover in the Andranomena Reserve in western Madagascar has been reduced by 44% since 1950. The identification of priority areas for establishment of development projects has been constrained by lack of information on the distribution, abundance, and habitat requirements of threatened species and the size, condition, and threats to survival of forest remnants. We evaluate a rapid fauna survey and habitat modeling procedure specifically designed to generate information for reserve selection and design using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). The study was conducted in the largest remnant (94,000 ha) of primary monsoon rainforest in western Madagascar, using lemurs as an indicator group. Lemur abundance and microhabitat variables were measured at 64 stratified survey sites dispersed throughout the region. These records were incorporated into a GIS with other environmental and landuse data derived from maps and satellite imagery. Statistical procedures were applied to analyze species habitats, predict and map species distributions, and estimate species population sizes throughout the study area. Patterns of slash and burn agriculture and anthropogenic disturbance were also analyzed to identify areas at low risk of cultural disturbance. A map of disturbance risk was overlaid with a map of relative lemur biodiversity to identify conservation priority areas with high biodiversity and low risk of short term disturbance. Lemur diversity was most strongly influenced by habitat clearing and human disturbance (harvesting, stock grazing, and hunting) within 8 km of villages. Lemur diversity was highest in a region of higher elevation and rainfall, distant from villages and roads. The only existing reserve in the study area was located in a region of high disturbance risk. Almost half the reserve has been degraded during the past 45 years. There is considerable scope for re‐allocation of land use within the study area to include a core protected area, a buffer zone with controlled hunting and timber harvesting, and an adjacent ecotourism facility. We found that information generated by a stratified biodiversity and landuse survey at a sampling intensity of less than 0.1% was sufficient to provide an objective foundation for regional biodiversity planning.</jats:p>",
