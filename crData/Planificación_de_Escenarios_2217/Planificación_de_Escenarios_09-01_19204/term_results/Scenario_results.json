      "abstract": "<jats:p>In der fremdsprachendidaktischen Fachdiskussion wird die Dramapädagogik zunehmend häufiger zum Bezugspunkt. Inzwischen ist ihr enormes Potenzial für die Sprach-, Literatur- und Kulturvermittlung in Forschungsarbeiten und Praxisberichten vielfach beleuchtet worden (vgl. dazu die umfangreiche Bibliographie auf der SCENARIO-Homepage). Inwiefern durch die Nutzung des Potenzials der Dramapädagogik speziell das interkulturelle Lernen effektiv gefördert werden kann, wurde bereits öfter thematisiert (vgl. z.B. den Sammelband von Byram/Fleming (1998)). Allerdings liegt nunmehr mit Benedikt Kesslers in drei Teile gegliederter, knapp 150seitiger Veröffentlichung ein erster Systematisierungsversuch vor. Im Sinne des Buchtitels ist er mit dem Anspruch verbunden, das Feld einer „Interkulturellen Dramapädagogik“ zu markieren. Im ersten Teil thematisiert Kessler, Lehrer in den Fächern Englisch und Politik/Wirtschaft für das Lehramt an Gymnasien, wie im Laufe der letzten zwanzig Jahre der Aspekt des interkulturellen Lernens in der Fremdsprachendidaktik immer mehr an Bedeutung gewonnen hat und der kommunikative Fremdsprachenunterricht um die Dimension der Interkulturellen Kommunikativen Kompetenz (IKK) erweitert wurde. Er reibt sich dabei allerdings an der Tatsache, dass die damit einhergehenden theoretischen Ansprüche bisher nicht in eine überzeugende Unterrichtspraxis umgesetzt wurden. Seine Bestandsaufnahme mündet in die Feststellung, dass die Verwirklichung interkultureller Kompetenzen im Allgemeinen und die Realisierung des umfassenden Ansatzes der IKK im Besonderen in weiter Ferne zu sein ...</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Engagement in depth with a foreign language is a challenging experience. Within the experience, and at a crucial interface – where familiar perspectives are questioned, deconstructed and re-considered – lies an area that I term ‘strangeness’. The word strange has a range of meanings; “outside of”, “alien”, “different”, “unusual”, “exceptional to a degree that excites wonder or astonishment” (OED 1989). The strangeness that resonates within a foreign language reflects several of these definitions; it is multi-faceted, unpredictable, even sometimes unfathomable, but ultimately, I hope to show that it has exciting, life-enriching potential that, like the latter definition above, will elicit wonder and astonishment. This article proposes a ‘pedagogy of strangeness’ in foreign language education that aims to provide some ideas and praxis to help students unlock more of the enriching potential that the study of the subject holds. The term ‘predictable strangeness’ is used critically to describe the conventional approach to teaching language and culture. The idea of ‘unpredictable strangeness’ is employed to elucidate the subtleties that lie especially within an ethnographic approach to foreign language teaching. Theatre and drama concepts that substantially employ strangeness within their work will be shown to have particular relevance to my article.

Sie richtet sich an das theaterpädagogische Fachpublikum und möchte neben der Darstellung der aktuellen Situation von Theaterprojekten mit jungen Migranten und Migrantinnen vor allem eine fundierte Diskussion über Konzepte für diese spezifische theaterpädagogische Arbeit anregen und damit zukünftige Projekte politisch, inhaltlich und künstlerisch unterstützen. So findet sich im Buch nach der ausführlichen Darstellung der empirischen Untersuchungsergebnisse eine Aufsatzsammlung mit Handlungsempfehlungen für zukünftige Theaterprojekte mit Migranten, die auf den Ergebnissen der Studie beruhen sowie Beiträge zur interkulturellen Theaterpädagogik, die zum größten Teil Praxisberichte der Spielleiter/-innen beinhalten. In einem abschließenden Serviceteil befinden sich hilfreiche Literaturempfehlungen, Adressen von Theaterverbänden, Institutionen und Festivals sowie Links und Hinweise zu finanziellen Fördermöglichkeiten. Die erste bundesweite Bestandsaufnahme basiert auf der Auswertung einer computergestützten schriftlichen Befragung an Hand von Fragebögen, die von knapp 500 Spielleiterinnen im schulischen und außerschulischen Bereich hinsichtlich ihrer Erfahrungen mit 700 Theaterprojekten ausgefüllt wurden.

      "abstract": "<p>This paper explores the rationale for including drama-based pedagogy into the curriculum of the Department of English at Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University (APU) in Japan. Traditional Japanese teaching practices are explained, followed by an outline of the parallels between drama-based pedagogy and teaching practices of the Japanese elementary school. Contrary to popular expectation, drama-based pedagogy is compatible with existing traditional and cultural systems of education in Japan. Therefore, drama-based pedagogy was included in the Fundamental English language course at APU to provide the students a bridge to move from teacher-led styles of junior high and senior high schools to return to the more learner-centered styles of education of the elementary educational system. This would seem a reasonable way in which to facilitate more cooperative, rather than competitive, styles of learning. Secondly, within the course subject matter of “Intercultural Communication”, drama-based pedagogy could be employed through role plays and self-reflection inside the classroom to allow the students to experience awareness of differing communicative styles when engaged in social interaction with the international students outside of the classroom. Likewise, the process of self-reflection in drama and theatre practices is a complex mix of introspective interrogation and affective engagement, which forms the catalyst for dramatic communication. The purpose of this paper is to present one specific case where drama-based pedagogy was incorporated into the English language curriculum of a rather unique Japanese university.</p>"

The prescriptive premise behind instructional design is that if an instructional design is followed, the learning outcomes identified in the design will occur. As one evaluates the extent to which learners achieve learning outcomes, changes in the instructional design may be warranted. Documenting these changes provides designers and users of the model with feedback on its efficiency and effectiveness. Despite these attributes, the merits of instructional design have not been achieved in some settings, and some users, including teachers and product developers, are looking elsewhere for instructional development guidance. But should they? The premise of this chapter is to propose a scenario-based ID model that addresses a major shortcoming of instructional design?namely, the gap between formative design decisions and design review. Scenarios are used to keep people designing, reflecting, and re-designing.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scenarios have been defined in many ways, for example, a management tool for identifying a plausible future (Porter, 1985; Schwartz, 1991; Ringland, 1998; Tucker, 1999; Alter, 1983) and a process for forward-looking analysis. A scenario is a kind of story that is a focused description of a fundamentally different future (Schoemaker, 1993), that is plausibly based on analysis of the interaction of a number of environmental variables (Kloss, 1999), that improves cognition by organizing many different bits of information (De Geus, 1997; Wack, 1985; van der Heijden, 1996), and that is analogous to a “what if” story (Tucker, 1999). It can be a series of events that could lead the current situation to a possible or desirable future state. Scenarios are not forecasts (Schwartz, 1991), future plans (Epstein, 1998), trend analyses, or analyses of the past. Schoemaker (1993) also explains that scenarios are for strategy identification rather than strategy development. Fordham and Malafant (1997) observe that decision scenarios allow the policymaker to anticipate and understand risk, and to discover new options for action. Ritson (1997) agrees with Schoemaker (1995) and explains that scenario planning scenarios are situations planned against known facts and trends, but deliberately structured to enable a wide range of options and to track the key triggers that would precede a given situation or event within the scenario. In this article we propose an operational definition of scenarios that enables us to manage and support scenarios in a coherent fashion. This is then followed by an in-depth analysis of the management of scenarios at the conceptual level as well as at the framework level. The article goes on to discuss the realization of such a framework through a component-based layered architecture that is suitable for implementation as an n-tiered system. We end with a discussion on current and future trends. </jats:p>"

Furthermore, the scenario specification model and the validation model should be clearly separated. The specification model comprises the intrinsic behavioral and structural properties of the application under consideration, while the validation model consists of any additional information required for ensuring compliance with the feature specifications. The usage of pre- and postconditions in scenario models is one lightweight approach for detecting, modeling, and resolving FIs. It requires low effort, allows for incremental development, and if properly structured, allows for separation of the scenario and validation models. Aspect-oriented modeling techniques, however, add further requirements, as aspectual scenarios should remain independent from each other even if FIs are present. We present a specification and validation framework that satisfies the above-mentioned goals and assess its aspect-oriented scenario notation, Aspect-oriented Use Case Maps, against these goals based on a radio software case study.</jats:p>"

This Integrated Scenario consists of a wind tunnel, an open source flight model and a real simulator cabin. With these three components it is possible to validate, from the scratch, a low cost UAV using fast prototyping techniques. A brief introduction to the actual integration of UAS in the airspace is presented as well as the development process of a new aircraft in the intelligent scenario. The two facilities, the real cabin simulator and the wind tunnel are explained. These facilities were constructed by students in their final bachelor thesis in collaboration with the authors and members of the ICARUS research group.</jats:p>"

When further synthesizing the results, Expert Choice helped us provide a clear rationale for the decision. The issue is that data mining technology is changing very rapidly.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Sustainability of infrastructure depends on the ability of designers to foresee future interactions between the building and its environment. Whereas representing these interactions as dead and live loads leads to satisfactory designs, additional consideration of specific events in the probabilistic space and application of advanced simulation techniques exhibits the potential to facilitate better and more sustainable design. To illustrate the event based analysis, scenario of localized failure due to malicious human activity is presented in this paper. Probability of building occupant survival is introduced as a measure to compare effectiveness of alternative designs. Since there are numerous possibilities of local failures, number of feasible scenarios were selected and analyzed using the Monte Carlo sampling. For localized failure, interaction between the building and its environment was characterized as a sudden removal of a key structural member. Such analysis is at the forefront of civil engineering modeling because it involves material nonlinearities, large deflections, finite strains, and certainly requires dynamic analysis. The modeling aspects (e.g. retrieving reliable structural information, probabilistic geometric inaccuracies, and material model) are presented. For each scenario, conditional probability of survival was calculated. Consecutively the theorem of total probability was used to evaluate the global probability of occupant survival for the considered array of events. Calculated scalar measure provides an opportunity to employ optimization algorithms to produce the safest structural design and save human lives in the case of abnormal loadings and/or unexpected hazards. In the proposed scenario based analysis, not only structural integrity after completion of construction is achieved, but also other specific objectives (e.g. high survivability in&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the case of abnormal loading). Presented methodology can be extrapolated to analyze fire resistance, flooding, truck impact, etc., in order to achieve desirable building characteristics and sustainable infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

These models provide a reasonable approximation to single drop impact events, and significantly improve the expected accuracy of the splash. The models are implemented in the Vulcan software, a CFD code for fire modeling. We wanted to understand how important the splash is to a suppression scenario and the implications of common simplifying assumptions. A scenario with several rectangular objects located beneath a water suppression system is examined. This scenario was designed to be representative of an industrial fire and suppression situation. We compare the deposition masses on the surfaces for three cases, one with the recently developed model, another assuming no splash, and another assuming all splashing drops eject an excessive fraction of their mass. The results of the higher fidelity predictions compared with the more commonly employed and simpler assumptions suggest the importance of splashing to the outcome of an industrial water sprinkler fire suppression event.</jats:p>",

In this chapter we develop this definition into a formal conceptual model that can be applied to a variety of governance domains. At the heart of this model lies the concept of the governance solution and its lifecycle. The governance solution embodies the set of mechanisms—decision rights, policies, controls, and measurements—applied to a governance scope in order to achieve some governance goals. As part of the lifecycle, the effectiveness of the governance solution is measured, and corrections and alignments are made as necessary. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to multiple governance domains by providing examples from IT governance as well as software-development governance. We conclude by providing a detailed scenario in the software-development governance space, which looks at large software organizations undergoing transition to agile development methodology. We further demonstrate how the governance model is instantiated and evolved in the context of this scenario.</jats:p>"

Some previous studies have looked into how these learning activities can be carried out on source materials, such as web documents, and the provision of appropriate scaffolding to guide the learning process. Here we consider how intelligent support can be provided to guide the learner in analysing source materials and building knowledge from their interpretation. An important feature of our case study is that the source materials are images, potentially having greater variation in how they are interpreted and therefore increasing the need for intelligent support. Intelligent support provided by our system can identify patterns and inconsistencies in the learner's interpretation and knowledge building, and offer recommendations based on comparison with a reference model. The recommendations derived from a reference model aim to guide the learner in reviewing and revising their interpretation of the images and the implications of these for their inferences, rather than directly providing a &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; evaluation of their answer.</jats:p>"

Although grazing studies have identified the scope for wet season resting strategies to be used to rehabilitate degraded pastures, the economic outcome of these strategies has not been extensively demonstrated. An exploratory study of the prospective economic value of wet season resting is presented using an economic simulation model of a 28 000 ha beef enterprise located in the Charters Towers region of north-eastern Australia to explore seven hypothetical scenarios centred on the projected performance of a wet season resting strategy. A series of 20-year simulations for a range of pasture recovery profiles, stocking capacity, animal productivity responses, beef prices and agistment options are compared with a baseline scenario of taking no action. Estimates of the net present value of the 20-year difference in total enterprise gross margins between the various resting options and the ‘do nothing’ option identify that wet season resting can offer a positive economic return for the range of scenarios examined, although this is contingent on the assumptions that are made concerning the trajectories of change in carrying capacity and animal productivity. Some implications for management and policy making to support the practical implementation of wet season resting strategies are discussed.\n</jats:p>"

In this chapter we develop this definition into a formal conceptual model that can be applied to a variety of governance domains. At the heart of this model lies the concept of the governance solution and its lifecycle. The governance solution embodies the set of mechanisms—decision rights, policies, controls, and measurements—applied to a governance scope in order to achieve some governance goals. As part of the lifecycle, the effectiveness of the governance solution is measured, and corrections and alignments are made as necessary. We demonstrate how this model can be applied to multiple governance domains by providing examples from IT governance as well as software-development governance. We conclude by providing a detailed scenario in the software-development governance space, which looks at large software organizations undergoing transition to agile development methodology. We further demonstrate how the governance model is instantiated and evolved in the context of this scenario. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the case of a severe accident scenario of a pressurized water reactor which includes cracking of the vessel bottom head, it is crucial to predict the leak rate and hence the crack size for the ex-vessel accident management. We present an experimental framework to analyze the crack propagation under such severe conditions for different 16MND5 French nuclear steel grades. An original experimental setup has been designed in order to perform bi-axial tests (tensile load independent of internal pressure) at high temperatures (1180K – 1280K) on tubular test specimens. The temperature loading and the mechanical loading can be set to reproduce the stress distribution of the hemispherical vessel bottom head submitted to an internal pressure. Moreover, the test was designed to be easily transposable to the real structure in terms of crack propagation and depressurization thanks to an energy based scaling methodology. We observed the crack initiation and propagation with two high speed digital cameras. Force, internal pressure, displacement and temperature fields were also measured and synchronized with the optical measurements. The different creep stages are observed and characterized. The crack propagation and opening history have been measured. During crack initiation and propagation stages, the depressurization can be correlated with the crack geometry. Finally, the setup has been designed in order to validate future numerical analysis.</jats:p>",

Depending on the application a centralized or distributed algorithm based on (k, r) –Dominating Set is used for the selection of clusterheads and gateway nodes. Here k is the minimum number of clusterheads per node in the network and r is the maximum number of hops between the node and the clusterhead. The non-clusterhead node can select the most qualified dominating node as its clusterhead from among the k dominating nodes. The quality of the clusterhead is a function of various metrics, which include connectivity, stability and residual battery power. Long-term service as clusterhead depletes their energy, causing them to drop out of the network. Similarly, the clusterhead with relatively high mobility than its neighbors leads to frequent clusterhead election process. This perturbs the stability of the network and adversely affects the network performance.</p>",

Amphotericin B and its lipid formulations are very effective but require hospital admission and monitoring. Oral drugs like Miltefosine have already been launched.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The high deposition pulse current gas metal arc welding (P-GMAW) with multiple drop transfer per pulse has been used to weld thick wall austenitic stainless steel pipe. Welding of the pipe was also carried by the commonly used shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) and conventional gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes and compared. Utility of the P-GMAW to facilitate narrow gap welding of the thick wall pipe by appropriate control of pulse parameters has been discussed in reference to produce superior quality weld. The superiority of weld quality has been justified through the microstructure, mechanical properties, residual stresses and fracture mechanics properties of weld joints. Basic characteristics of the P-GMAW process changing the scenario of thick wall pipe welding have been closely studied with respect to its arc characteristics and behaviour of metal transfer. A precise control of the process in order to achieve desired thermal, mechanical and microstructural effects in the narrow gap welding has been achieved by regulation of summarised influence of pulse parameters, mean current (Im) and arc voltage. The summarised influence of pulse parameters is defined by a hypothetically defined dimensionless factor φ = [(Ib/Ip) f.tb] where, the Ib, Ip, f and tb are the base current, peak current, pulse frequency and pulse off (base) time respectively.</jats:p>",

An Intelligent Disaster Collaboration System (IDCS) is introduced in this paper as a conceptual model to integrate ICT into DM and the mitigation process and to enhance collaboration. The framework is applicable to the collaboration process at the local, regional and national levels. Within this context, the deployment of ICT tools in DM is explored and scenario‐based case studies on flooding and terrorism—examples of natural and human‐induced disasters, respectively—are presented. Conclusions are drawn regarding the differences found in collaboration patterns and ICT used during natural and human‐induced disasters and the differences between currently available ICT and proposed ICT.</jats:p>",

Against this background, the VitaBIT project started in 2007 with the objective of designing an ICT platform for the safe application of mobile information services in ambulatory care nursing. Communication and secure information exchange between all parties involved in the care process are also guaranteed. The article explains the project's current approach to develop a user-oriented solution using the design steps implied by ISO 13407. Even if a technology is developed and formally tested to be highly usable there exists no guarantee that this will lead to acceptance. That is the reason why end users are involved in all the project stages and serve as testers of prototypes in VitaBIT.</jats:p>"

The international trend for SF management policy and the Korean situation has been investigated. The once-through back-end fuel cycle scenarios has been developed and screened in point of technical and economical aspect.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nThe emerging carbon economy will have a major impact on grazing businesses because of significant livestock methane and land-use change emissions. Livestock methane emissions alone account for ~11% of Australia’s reported greenhouse gas emissions. Grazing businesses need to develop an understanding of their greenhouse gas impact and be able to assess the impact of alternative management options. This paper attempts to generate a greenhouse gas budget for two scenarios using a spread sheet model.\nThe first scenario was based on one land-type ‘20-year-old brigalow regrowth’ in the brigalow bioregion of southern-central Queensland. The 50 year analysis demonstrated the substantially different greenhouse gas outcomes and livestock carrying capacity for three alternative regrowth management options: retain regrowth (sequester 71.5 t carbon dioxide equivalents per hectare, CO2-e/ha), clear all regrowth (emit 42.8 t CO2-e/ha) and clear regrowth strips (emit 5.8 t CO2-e/ha). The second scenario was based on a ‘remnant eucalypt savanna-woodland’ land type in the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion of north Queensland. The four alternative vegetation management options were: retain current woodland structure (emit 7.4 t CO2-e/ha), allow woodland to thicken increasing tree basal area (sequester 20.7 t CO2-e/ha), thin trees less than 10 cm diameter (emit 8.9 t CO2-e/ha), and thin trees &lt;20 cm diameter (emit 12.4 t CO2-e/ha).\nSignificant assumptions were required to complete the budgets due to gaps in current knowledge on the response of woody vegetation, soil carbon and non-CO2 soil emissions to management options and land-type at the property scale. The analyses indicate that there is scope for grazing businesses to choose alternative management options to influence their greenhouse gas budget. However, a key assumption is that accumulation of carbon or avoidance of emissions somewhere on a grazing business (e.g. in woody vegetation or soil) will be recognised as an offset for emissions elsewhere in the business (e.g. livestock methane). This issue will be a challenge for livestock industries and policy makers to work through in the coming years.\n</jats:p>"

The construction, 3×3 m in size and 13 m deep, was exceptionally large for its time. The larger outer box-frame contained two smaller frames whose construction could be interpreted as an attempt to repair the damaged original well. The outer box was made from 160 oak elements of about 3 m length built in the blockhouse method. The large box is dated to 5090\n            <jats:sc>bc</jats:sc>\n            and the two smaller ones to 5057±5\n            <jats:sc>bc</jats:sc>\n            by dendrochronological analysis. At\n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>\n            . 8 m depth several elements of the large box are vertically sheared off and the broken parts moved inward and downward. The cause of this damage has not yet been determined. As the well is located only 3 km from one of the active tectonic faults in the Lower Rhine Embayment, a seismogenic origin of the damage is considered and tested in this paper. This question has relevance for determination of seismic hazard in an area with present-day moderate seismicity but documented occurrence of strong surface-rupturing earthquakes from the palaeoseismic record. First, a geotechnical model for the construction pit with a total volume of\n            <jats:italic>c</jats:italic>\n            . 540–550 m\n            <jats:sup>3</jats:sup>\n            is used to prove the stability of the open pit during well construction and to help explain how the well was built. The seismogenic hypothesis is tested in a deterministic approach using theoretically derived ground motion at the site of the well for two simulated earthquakes with magnitudes 6.2 and 6.8. Ground deformation and relative displacement calculated with a finite element model of the casing are found to be too small to account for the documented damage. Among other potential sources of damage, swelling, shrinking or rotting of the wood elements are possible explanations; however, a conclusive answer to this question remains to be found.\n          </jats:p>",

The cluster analysis of trend data for 18 years till 2002 on five parameters and with reference to eight dimensions of coconut performance delineated the key players in the international coconut market. Philippines, Indonesia and India formed the cluster of major stakeholders. India fared better than both the other countries in the major cluster, in respect of area, production and yield; and therefore, it should enjoy a comparative advantage. However, the acreage growth in India was stagnant during the post-liberalization phase and it does not appear to take advantage of other options available to it by moving up the value chain and thereby resisting the market pressure on domestic prices in an open economy environment. This resulted in a price crash of coconut products at the dawn of the new century. </jats:p>",

Modularity is a key to linking life cycle scenario to an appropriate product architecture because modular architecture increases performance in life cycle processes, such as disassembly, recycling, maintenance, reuse, and upgrading, by unifying components applicable to the same lifecycle scenario. We propose a method for determining modular structure based on life cycle scenario by evaluating the similarity among lifecycle-related components attributes.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>During last four years, in the framework of the periodic safety review of the Belgian Nuclear Power Plants, the Severe Accident Management Guidelines implemented in Belgium have been involved in a series of detailed validation exercises as suggested by the Westinghouse Owner Group SAMG Scenario Templates. The purpose of this task is essentially to evaluate the severe accident management capabilities of the units and to ensure that personnel in the utility’s emergency response organization (crisis team and eventually the control room staff for certain type of accidents) are trained with the use of the above mentioned guidelines. The supporting calculations to the validation exercises have been performed by Tractebel Engineering by means of the MELCOR 1.8.5 code, which is developed under the sponsorship of the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC). Most of the implemented scenarios and related validation exercises account for full power operating states and are based on previous PSA studies. These included Station Black-Out accidents (SBO), Small Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (SBLOCA), Large Break Loss of Coolant Accidents (LBLOCA), and Interface System Loss of Coolant Accidents (ISLOCA), possibly including additional losses of available emergency safeguards features (ECCS, containment sprays, fan coolers, chemical and volumetric control system). In order to cover the entire spectrum of possible scenarios, it has been judged necessary to consider also a type of accident not originated at nominal power but initiated while the plant is in shutdown conditions. The specific Plant Operating State characterizing this scenario has been defined by a mid-loop operation with the reactor pressure vessel head still in place, and including the opening of the pressurizer manhole, the installation of the nozzle dams in all steam generators, the isolation of the reactor building, and the operation of the Residual Heat Removal system. The initiating event of this accident is the loss of the Residual Heat Removal system one day after the normal reactor shutdown. A point demanding a special attention is the fact the entry criterion to redirect towards the opening of the SAMG (based on core exit temperature measurement in full power states) does not straightforward apply in this case and an alternative criterion is necessary. In particular this paper presents the approach and results obtained accounting for the proposed criterion based on the launch of the internal emergency plan and on the timing for the crisis team to be operational and take the decision.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Reactivity accident scenarios can occur originated by internal boron dilution in the primary system of a nuclear pressurized water reactor type (PWR or VVER). In essence the problem is caused by boron dilution following vaporization and condensation of the primary system coolant in case of decrease of primary system mass inventory, for example during a small-break loss of coolant accident (SB-LOCA) that may include boiling in the core with condensation of steam in the steam generators. When the liquid level in the reactor vessel decreases below the hot leg elevation, steam begins to flow to the steam generators and condenses there. This steam carries no boron and thus boron concentration in the cold leg loop seals begins to decrease. If for some reason this water plug with low boron concentration begins to flow towards the core and enters it without any major mixing with the borated coolant, the result is a positive reactivity insertion. The paper presents an analysis by RELAP5 Mod 3.3 code [1] of a small break LOCA of 20 cm2 area in the lower plenum of a four-loop PWR nuclear reactor. The boundary conditions of the calculations consider the eight accumulator tanks available, two/four low pressure injection systems (LPIS) available, and two of the four high pressure injection systems (HPIS) available. Sensitivity calculations were performed, regarding among other things, the boron concentration in the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCS) and reactor cooling system (RCS) from Design Basis Accident (DBA) to beyond DBA conditions. From the results obtained, in some calculations boron dilution is observed in more than one loop seal. The situation in which the plugs in the loop seals are transported to the core without mixing with other borated water led to a potentially hazardous situation for four calculations in which initial conditions were far from DBA. It is important to emphasize that the present study has not the objective of a safety analysis of the NPP involved, but it should be considered inside research activities regarding the boron dilution issue.</jats:p>",

To evaluate the impact of the Myanmar–China international land bridge on the Shanghai, China, port, this paper first proposes a novel concept of the probability-based port market area to measure the service area of a port by assuming that costs and times of the intermodal freight transport routs are the normal distributed random variables. The analytical expression of the probit-based market area of the Shanghai port is then derived for two competing transport routes to the Dubai port: one involves the Myanmar–China land bridge and the other uses the direct port-to-port maritime link. The probability-based market area curves in relation to transport cost and time of the Shanghai port are established for two operational scenarios of the Myanmar–China land bridge: ( a) current state of operation and ( b) a possible future state of operation with efficiency similar to that of the U.S. continental land bridge operation. Each of these curves possesses one branch of a hyperbola curve representing a contour of the impact level of the land bridge on the Shanghai port. Differences of the impact contours of the two scenarios provide an indication of the market area of the Shanghai port that will be affected by changes in the efficiency of the land bridge operation. </jats:p>",

Product lifecycle can be designed easily by describing lifecycle scenario at an early stage and the product should be designed to realize the scenario. This paper proposes a modular design method that links lifecycle scenario to appropriate modular structure by unifying components applicable to the same lifecycle option, such as recycling, maintenance, reuse, and upgrading. Appropriate modular structures may differ with the lifecycle options, meaning that while the modular structure for recycling should be based on the type of material, the structure for upgrading should be based on the lifetime of components. The modules, therefore, can undergo lifecycle processes without disassembly into components. These may lead to easy management of components throughout the lifecycle and increase the efficiency of recovery processes and logistics in resource circulation. We also propose an evaluation method of modular product from the viewpoint of resource efficiency. For the evaluation, we formalize the probability that each module goes through preferable lifecycle paths designated by the scenario in order to represent the advantage of modularization. This paper also illustrates a case study in order to discuss effectiveness of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Previous papers pointed out the influence of long-term service exposures on the thermal-mechanical behavior of Zr alloys in LOCA conditions and, especially, the impact of in-service hydrogen pick-up on post-quench mechanical properties. Moreover, the oxide layer grown under in-service conditions was occasionally expected to have a protective effect against high temperature oxidation. Finally, the oxygen and hydrogen distributions within the prior-β layer appear as a key parameter with regard to the residual ductility of the alloy, especially as a function of the cooling scenario. The objective of the study presented here was to further investigate the influence of these parameters on the post-quench mechanical properties. Unirradiated Zircaloy-4 and M5® cladding tubes were consequently hydrided up to different concentration levels, then oxidized at high temperature (1000–1200°C) up to at least 10 % measured equivalent cladding reacted (ECR) and directly quenched to room temperature (RT). Ring compression tests (RCT), 3-point bending tests (3PBT) at RT and 135°C, as well as impact tests at RT were then performed to determine the evolution of the post-quench mechanical properties of Zircaloy-4 and M5® alloys with H content. Similarly, specimens preoxidized out-of-pile were also submitted to high temperature oxidation and direct quench, as well as to post-quench ring compression tests. Along with calculations of oxygen diffusion in the metal, results from those tests allowed us to estimate the assumed protective effect of the pretransient oxide layer. Finally, using specimens in the as-received condition or hydrided to typical end-of-life H contents, the effect of temperature history after oxidation at 1200°C was studied, i.e., at the end of the high temperature isothermal oxidation, samples were either submitted to direct quenching to RT or to slow cooling to different final quenching temperatures. It was thus demonstrated that the cooling scenario has a significant impact on the post-quench mechanical properties. All test samples were investigated by means of fractographic examinations to assess the type of failure mode. Moreover, a deep metallurgical analysis has been performed: SEM and image analysis were used for accurate phase thickness measurements, nuclear and electron microprobes for quantitative mapping of hydrogen and oxygen. It proved that the oxygen and hydrogen contents and their distribution in the prior-β layer have a first-order influence on the residual ductility. From all the results obtained on as-received and hydrided samples directly quenched from the oxidation temperature, it was then possible to derive a relationship between structural parameters, i.e., oxygen and hydrogen contents and thickness of the prior-β layer, and the post-quench impact properties at RT.</jats:p>",

The risk-based traceability this paper proposes for evaluating global circulation scenarios based on economic and environmental aspects clarifies conditions for sustainable global circulation. The key to its success is traceability, and this paper presents a case study on desktop computers whose simulation results demonstrate that reuse scenarios are economically superior to recycling scenarios, but are less traceable because of their longer supply chains. Implementing anti-risk measures improves traceability and lessens environmental risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Whereas team project-based learning of engineering design has attracted wide acceptance, it is still rare to see a curriculum that addresses high level societal needs involving diverse students with a wide range of practical experience. Such a curriculum should develop a shared understanding of the use of scenarios for amorphous products and a process to objectively evaluate the project progress while the design concepts mature. This paper describes two key tools that respond to these challenges: 1) scenario prototyping and 2) cross-team project scorecarding. These tools evolved through a collaborative curriculum development of Keio University, MIT, and Stanford in the development of the Active Learning Project Sequence (ALPS), a capstone experience for Keio’s new Graduate School of System Design and Management (SDM). ALPS selected a theme from the “Voice of Society,” according to which the project teams generated solution scenarios, identified requirements, and described the proposed system using appropriate prototypes of not only hardware but other amorphous means as well. The twelve ALPS teams in 2008 addressed the theme “Enhancing the Lives of Seniors in Japan,” which led to more specific scenarios. The paper gives an overview of the ALPS workshop sequence, and describes in detail two key learning modules that were essential in integrating the multi-disciplinary teams: a) scenario prototyping and b) cross-team project scorecarding. These methods are going through further trials in Stanford’s own Design for Manufacturability curriculum involving 10 project teams in the US and Japan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            In the past decade, real-time embedded systems have become much more complex due to the introduction of a lot of new functionality in one application, and due to running multiple applications concurrently. This increases the dynamic nature of today's applications and systems, and tightens the requirements for their constraints in terms of deadlines and energy consumption. State-of-the-art design methodologies try to cope with these novel issues by identifying several most used cases and dealing with them separately, reducing the newly introduced complexity. This article presents a generic and systematic design-time/run-time methodology for handling the dynamic nature of modern embedded systems, which can be utilized by existing design methodologies to increase their efficiency. It is based on the concept of\n            <jats:italic>system scenarios</jats:italic>\n            , which group system behaviors that are similar from a multidimensional cost perspective—such as resource requirements, delay, and energy consumption—in such a way that the system can be configured to exploit this cost similarity. At design-time, these scenarios are individually optimized. Mechanisms for predicting the current scenario at run-time, and for switching between scenarios, are also derived. This design trajectory is augmented with a run-time calibration mechanism, which allows the system to learn on-the-fly during its execution, and to adapt itself to the current input stimuli, by extending the scenario set, changing the scenario definitions, and both the prediction and switching mechanisms. To show the generality of our methodology, we show how it has been applied on four very different real-life design problems. In all presented case studies, substantial energy reductions were obtained by exploiting scenarios.\n          </jats:p>",
