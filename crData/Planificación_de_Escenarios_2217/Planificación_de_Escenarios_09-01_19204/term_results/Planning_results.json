      "abstract": "<jats:p> At a time of rising concern over urban sprawl and its adverse financial, quality-of-life, and environmental consequences, nodes assume growing importance within urban (and especially metropolitan) planning strategies. Nodes are defined as high-density multifunctional developments featuring a pedestrian-conducive environment and good public-transit accessibility. The article draws from the Toronto experience to explore reasons for the popularity of nodes among planning agencies, their limited capacity over recent years to attract new office and retail development, and difficulties in launching new nodes. It also investigates their problems in meeting walking and public-transit-patronage objectives. The article proposes four means of enhancing the smart growth performance of nodes: (1) improved planning coordination; (2) reliance on both incentives and coercion; (3) investment in public transit systems; (4) merging nodal and corridor approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last 10–15 years, urban planners in the Netherlands have been given more policy space for defining area-specific environmental ambitions, in an attempt to promote further the integration of environmental and urban planning. This increased policy space has offered new opportunities, but also poses new challenges for urban planners. Urban planners often appear to struggle with the issue of how to come to an operationalization of area-specific urban environmental quality. Various planning tools exist that can assist planners with these tasks. In this paper we distinguish between ‘substance-oriented’ tools such as environmental impact assessments and ‘process-oriented’ tools that facilitate interaction and consensus building among planners and stakeholders. Recently, in the Netherlands, a distinct type of ‘hybrid’ planning tool has been developed specifically for defining area-based environmental ambitions in spatial plans, coupled with the development of measures for attaining these ambitions. However, little research has been conducted into how these planning tools perform in practice and how this can be understood, especially in comparison with more traditional ‘substance-oriented’ and ‘process-oriented’ planning tools. In this paper we assess the added value of the new hybrid tools on the basis of an analysis of three exemplary case studies. Although the tools seem to be helpful in assisting urban planners to better integration of environmental and spatial planning, there are some aspects that deserve more attention, including the identification of financial consequences of environmental ambitions, and guidelines for dealing with controversies. Future research is recommended into the influence of the hybrid tools on their sociopolitical contexts, their performance in comparison with other hybrid planning tools, and their effective design. </jats:p>",

The question is examined in a real-world case of neighborhood revitalization, in which both techniques were practiced simultaneously. Comparisons are made at four major planning junctions, in order to study the contributions of each technique to the qualities of involvement, trust, and empowerment. The results show that web-based participants not only differ from the participation of traditional practices, but they also differ from each other on the basis of their type of web participation. The results indicate that web-based participation is an effective complementary means of public participation, but it cannot replace the traditional unmediated techniques. </jats:p>",

On the basis of a dielectric breakdown model in combination with cellular automata, we present a method to steer precisely the generation of settlement structures with regard to their global and local density as well as the size and number of forming clusters. The resulting structures depend on the logic of how the dependence of the settlements and the road network is implemented to the simulation model. After analysing the state of the art we begin with a discussion of the mutual dependence of roads and land development. Next, we elaborate a model that permits the precise control of permeability in the developing structure as well as the settlement density, using the fewest necessary control parameters. On the basis of different characteristic values, possible settlement structures are analysed and compared with each other. Finally, we reflect on the theoretical contribution of the model with regard to the context of urban dynamics. </jats:p>",

In both stages, land-use planning and transportation planning are cast as multiobjective design problems and solved with a genetic algorithm.

The MAS extends an existing approach with the principle of sharing knowledge between participating actors while trying to create a shared vision. In the simulation, actors are modelled as agents. They have desires and preferences regarding the future development of their environment. These are used to develop their individual views on what areas are eligible for change. A facilitator agent coordinates the exchange of information by indicating possible solutions and conflicts to the actor agents. The simulation is demonstrated for an allocation problem in a pilot area in the southeast of the Netherlands. Four different scenarios are implemented, which demonstrate the impact of cooperation and hierarchy during an interactive spatial-planning process. Although the model is kept limited in terms of input data, the results show its potential for providing insight into the relations and interaction between actors, rather than predicting the results of an interactive spatial-planning process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As one of the newly planned capitals in the 20th century – like Islamabad, Canberra and Brazil –, Ankara represents an original case in planning history: from shaping a new town under the influence of early European urbanism to the control of a dynamic metropolitan form by structural planning approaches. Forming its urban core according to the initial planning perspectives between the beginning of 1930s and the mid-1970s, the city has entered a rapid phase of space production in its extensions for about the last thirty years.\n\nIn the current period of development, highly fragmented urban peripheral formation has being occurred in Ankara. Since the existing trend on the dispersion of urban form lacking spatial coherence at different scale-levels causes the dominance of the private domain and a loss of urbanity, this trend might at first glance be considered as a break with the European tradition and the emergence of Anglo-Americanization in Turkish planning system in terms of looser development control approach on urban form.\n\nBefore, coming to such a critical end-point, the paper prefers a closer look into the changing dynamics of master plans of the city. It is aimed to reveal the developmental logic of the city by means of master plan analysis. The comprehensive outlook – called plan matrix – is integrated into each master plan schema by correlating the basic components like main policy directions, depth of control, settlement typology, and city structure and form. Such a framework has a potential to be utilized for any kind of plan analysis at metropolitan scale for different cases. At the end of the analysis, the paper tends to address an alternative master planning approach for the similar types of developing cities striving for keeping its urban character within a fragmented urban body.</jats:p>"

Within designing for instruction, Bransford’s, “variables affecting learning,” are the focal points organizational planners need to consider in planning instruction.

Applications for mobile networking have a broad scope as they can be applied to many situations in either industrial or commercial sectors. The challenge for firms is to better match market-induced variability to the organizational issues and systems necessary for technological innovation. This chapter develops a business planning framework for mobile networking applications. This framework recognises the fluidity of the situation when trying to anticipate and model emerging wireless applications. The business planning framework outlined in this chapter is a generic model which can be used by companies to assess the business case for applications utilizing mobile networking technologies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A classic problem in planning is districting, which aims to partition a given area into a specified number of subareas according to required criteria. Size, compactness, and contiguity are among the most frequently used districting criteria. While size and compactness may be interpreted differently in different contexts, contiguity is an unambiguous topological property. A district is said to be contiguous if all locations in it are ‘connected’—that is, one can travel between any two locations in the district without leaving it. This paper introduces a new integer-programming-based approach to districting modeling, which enforced contiguity constraints independently of any other criteria that might be additionally imposed. Three experimental models are presented, and tested with sample data on the forty-eight conterminous US states. A major implication of this paper is that the exact formulation of a contiguity requirement allows planners to address diverse sets of districting criteria. </jats:p>",

After a short introduction we give an overview about the stateof- the-affairs of wireless community networks presenting the driving forces, stakeholders, services and built upon applications in some carefully selected projects. Then, we discuss the technological aspects and suggest a design methodology for planning wireless community networks. The application of this methodology is illustrated via an ongoing digital city project in Hungary. After this we analyze the relevant business models. And finally, before concluding the chapter we give a short outlook discussing the future trends of the area.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, we will first present the characteristics and the architecture of the four main generations of cellular networks (1G, 2G, 3G and 4G). We will then expose different planning problems related to each generation followed by a short description of different solutions that have been proposed in the literature.</jats:p>"

Since pollutants are dispersed by wind, transport costs are irrelevant in its formation. Pollutant distribution on the ground level has an asymmetric bell shape in the wind direction. In addition to the linear functions, the exponential and quadratic shadow price functions are considered for the compensation of a health hazard to consumers, where the strict liability in the framework of the Coase theorem applies. The shadow market area for pollutants is shell shaped. This specific characteristic has an implication for market boundaries between polluters and their location decisions. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a theoretical basis for understanding the current shift in performance-based design and proposes a model of performance-based design in architecture, termed performative design. Automated processes related to the impact of environmental forces on form generation in digital design are the content of experimental processes upon which the paper reports. In the theoretical introduction the terms performative design and performative architecture are defined and discussed. Topics related to the current movement towards performance-based design in architecture, such as the role of topology, parametric design, associative geometry, and generative processes, are presented, and their implications for, and influence upon, performative design are discussed. An experimental design example in architectural design is demonstrated to illustrate various methodological issues in performative design. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Occurrences of crime are complex phenomena. They are the result of a large number of interrelated elements which can include environmental factors as well as complex human behaviours. Traditionally, crime occurrences have been modelled using statistical techniques, and although such approaches are useful, they face difficulties in providing predictive analyses and with the integration of behavioural information. Also, it is particularly difficult to account for the strongly influential effect of local urban form. Agent-based modelling is a relatively new modelling paradigm that has generated a considerable amount of interest. An agent is an independent component of a system which interacts with other agents and its environment to achieve goals. In this manner, large systems of agents can be created to mimic real scenarios. Most importantly, the agents can incorporate behavioural information to determine how they should achieve their goals, and models can include a highly detailed environment. This paper presents an agent-based model used to predict burglary rates, which, despite its simplicity, yields interesting results. We apply the model to the city of Leeds, UK. The model indicates that the urban configuration in Leeds is a major element in determining the level of crime across the city. It also demonstrates that agent-based modelling is an excellent tool for these types of analyses with much potential. </jats:p>",

The development of e-shopping might have an impact on travel activity, but for the present the results from different studies are still inconclusive. In this paper the interaction between information searching, e-shopping, and travel activity is examined. The analysis is based on answers from 2700 Norwegian respondents. The dataset provides detailed information about the respondents' activities and trips, and which type of goods and services they search for information about and purchase. The analysis indicates that there are different segments using the Internet for information and purchase, and that different types of goods attract different customers. The analyses of the interaction between e-shopping and travel suggest no direct relation between the two phenomena. There is no indication of substitution of travel by shopping online. The multivariate analyses show, rather, a higher mobility among frequent e-shoppers than among those buying on the Internet less often. E-shopping seems to be a complementary activity to traditional shopping, at least for the time being. </jats:p>",

A distinction is drawn between permanent plans (which, however, should be living documents) and contingency planning during emergency situations. Planning is considered more as a process than an end product. The relationship between plans, procedures and protocols is described. The chapter discusses the use of scenarios as a basis for planning emergency responses. Emphasis is given to the exploration of reference scenarios of known hazards in terms of what how they relate to emergency response needs. Next, the phases of emergency planning are described, with particular attention to how they can be implemented in a socially inclusive way. After this, the chapter discusses the integration and standardisation of plans around the local authority level, which in many cases is the reference level for planning activities. The discussion is extended to the role of disaster planning at the community level. The chapter concludes by considering the fields of ignorance and potential for unforeseen change in threats and hazards. It ends with a brief, synthetic summary of the emergency planning process.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reports the findings of a study that investigated the processes through which health planning and social planning were integrated in practice, at the community level, through the active engagement of childcare centres in health promotion and community capacity building. A small-scale, retrospective study of Healthy Bodies Healthy Minds, a community-based health promotion project for early childhood environments, was conducted. Focusing on links between health and social planning, the study revealed crucial factors that led to integrated planning and action at the community level: opportunities for professional development, the strengthening of partnerships through interpersonal networks, reduced isolation of childcare staff in community contexts, and genuine engagement of childcare centre staff in a planning process. It also demonstrated how momentum for planning and action at the community level was created, and how a shift towards integrated health and social planning, stemming from an attitudinal shift by childcare staff towards planning and partnerships, emerged. Insights are gained on ways to build upon the social component of health promotion programs, so as to establish sustainable partnerships for integrating health and social planning in communities.</jats:p>"

Very few studies to date, however, have investigated the impact of geographic context on people's e-shopping behavior. This study reexamines the explanatory factors that are related to people's e-shopping patterns through a study of the Columbus Metropolitan Area, OH. It focuses on the effect of accessibility to local shops and the residential context on the adoption of e-shopping and the frequency of buying online. Using an activity–Internet diary dataset, the results suggest that people with lower levels of accessibility to local shopping opportunities are more likely to engage in e-shopping, since the Internet enhances the efficiency of shopping by providing more product information and by eliminating the need of travel in the physical world. Further, people who live in areas with a white majority are more likely to adopt e-shopping. The magnitude of the impact of these context factors on e-shopping, however, is quite small. </jats:p>",

Most of the existing approaches in the field do not consider free school choice nor are they able to consider substitution effects between school locations. We minimize the location and transport costs with respect to students choosing the school with the highest utility. Since these school choice probabilities (determined by a mixed multinominal logit model) depend on the available schools, we have to consider two steps. First, we generate for each period a set of scenarios indicating which school is open and which is not. For each scenario we allocate the students to available schools according to capacity and utility. Second, we select for each period one scenario in order to minimize total costs. Problems with a long planning horizon and a large number of demand points are solvable. We apply this approach to schools of the City of Dresden, Germany. </jats:p>",

Their paper models the emergence of urban centers brought about by household and firm location decisions in the context of spatially differentiated labor and land market interactions. Their approach is an analytical one that seeks to characterize the equilibrium values of the system. In contrast, we employ an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach that seeks to replicate the individual household and firm behaviors that lead to equilibrium or nonequilibrium outcomes. The F–O model has little to say about what happens outside of equilibrium, while the ABM approach is preoccupied with this question and is particularly well suited to address questions of path dependency and bounded rationality that lie well beyond the scope of the F–O original. We demonstrate that the urban outcomes that emerge depend critically upon the bidding behavior of agents and the institutional context within which their decisions are made. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recovery is a long-term decision process in the face of rapid change, involving many individual actors and organizations making decisions about rebuilding, planning, and financing. Communities must make rapid decisions about physical reconstruction and economic development, while at the same time making critical decisions regarding management and financing, all under great time pressure. It is tempting to think of a disaster-affected community as a &amp;ldquo;blank slate&amp;rdquo; upon which a new, improved, disaster-resistant community can arise, under the guidance of rational planning. In fact, actual post-disaster situations are much more complex, and, although some forces facilitate the opportunity for positive change, there are at least an equal number of countervailing forces resisting such change. Significant change is difficult to achieve, because the political and administrative environments resist it, and because the historic evolution of the city reflects the deep-seated desires of its inhabitants. Still, physical changes do occur&amp;mdash;usually in limited parts of a city&amp;mdash;and they sometimes are able to bring about social and economic improvements. The challenge for planners is to learn how to maximize the limited opportunity for positive post-disaster change. This paper briefly summarizes some of the complexities of the post-disaster decision environment and suggests some ways to maximize positive change following disasters.</jats:p>"

We find that this field has attracted little attention of regulatory scholars, whilst fields such as the ‘natural’ or ‘occupational’ environment are often addressed in regulatory studies. We furthermore find that studies of building regulation and control often lack theoretical descriptions or applications. We argue that such details are necessary for a better understanding of building regulations and control. </jats:p>",

Or should the initiators strive for more interaction with users and other stakeholders, thus organizing the initiatives much looser than what the traditional project work method allows for? Building on a large survey, the authors found that ICT based service innovation was not associated with a tightly run project – focused on cost, time and quality; nor with the presence of a professional project manager. Rather, successful service innovation was found in projects where the service providing organization and the users of the forthcoming services were well integrated in the project. They discuss three alternatives to the traditional project work form model, called Integrated Classic Structure, Mutual Adaptation and TQM, and assess their potential strengths and weaknesses in service innovation, as an agenda for further experimentation and empirical research.</jats:p>"

This paper presents a novel method to model urban land-use change using support-vector machines (SVMs), a new generation of machine learning algorithms used in classification and regression domains. An SVM modeling framework has been developed to analyze land-use change in relation to various factors such as population, distance to roads and facilities, and surrounding land use. As land-use data are generally unbalanced, in the sense that the unchanged data overwhelm the changed data, traditional methods are incapable of classifying relatively minor land-use changes with high accuracy. To circumvent this problem, an unbalanced SVM has been adopted by enhancing the standard SVMs. A case study of Calgary land-use change demonstrates that the unbalanced SVMs can achieve high and reliable performance for land-use-change modeling. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Developing countries experience poor and deteriorating water services where the costs of improvements, water utilities assume, are not affordable by households. However, if water services are hypothetically improved, are households willing to pay? From employment of an attribute-based stated-preference method, the paper examines households' willingness to pay for improvements in water services in a city in south India. Aside of quantity, households are willing to pay for improvements in quality, pressure, frequency of supply, and increased quanta of supply during the dry season. In addition, households prefer regulation in water services, albeit from a public service provider. In Asian countries and other developing country regions households' willingness to pay is substantially higher than the costs of the provision of water, and on a par with mean water tariffs in developed regions of the world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This research describes the growth of the Minneapolis Skyway network and aims to determine if the growth of the system has followed a predictable path. We hypothesize that the system expanded to the places in which it was valued the most. The point accessibility of each block lying within and adjacent to the connected system for each expansion year is calculated and used to predict the expansion of the Skyway System. In order to determine how often the expansion connected the blocks with higher accessibility, a connection-choice logit model relating the probability of joining the network (in a given year) to accessibility measures and network size was employed. The results disclose that accessibility is a significant explanatory factor of network growth. In accordance with the findings from the logit model, a network-growth simulation model was then developed on the basis of the strongest-link assumption (ie for a link to be constructed, it must be ranked the highest in terms of increasing accessibility between the two blocks it connects). The results show that the simulation model performs well in predicting the sequence of skyway additions on the basis of the myopic strongest-link assumption. This suggests that—although various physical, economic, regulatory, and legal factors may have played a role—accessibility remains an important factor in predicting which links are connected during the growth of the Minneapolis Skyway network. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports on an in-depth study of the status of sustainable housing design (SHD), in Sutherland Shire, Sydney, Australia. The motives and attitudes of key stakeholders towards SHD were identified. Also investigated was the feasibility of an Ecological Sustainability Index (ESI) developed by Sutherland Shire Council, to assist as a tool for the assessment of residential developments. Residential surveys, reviews of development applications, and interviews with housing professionals all indicated that the status of environmentally sustainable housing in the area was inadequate and was not improving. Despite an overwhelming majority of people supporting the principles and goals of environmental sustainability this did not translate into practice in terms of SHD. This indicates that government education and financial incentives to include SHD features in new homes were not sufficient to affect significantly decisions made by stakeholders during the development process. The findings support the use of simple and flexible sustainability tools such as the ESI in this area, with obvious potential in broader contexts. This study suggests the need for initiatives such as an ESI to provide gradual cumulative environmental benefits towards sustainable cities in Australia and internationally, provided that they receive the necessary political will, and public and local government administrative support for sufficient implementation. The study also raises a wider agenda for interdisciplinary research into sustainable design indices. </jats:p>",

The opportunity exists for researchers to examine the formation of different types of SIs as well as their interdependencies by exploring the patterns embedded in the data. To circumvent the limitations of existing methods of flow data compression and visual exploration, we propose an integrated computational and visual approach, known as VISIDAMIN, for handling both SI data projection and SI data quantization at once. The computational method of self-organizing maps serves as the data mining engine in this process. Using a large domestic air travel dataset as a case study, we examine how the characteristics of the air transport system interact with the SI system to create relationships and structures within the US domestic airline market. </jats:p>",

The objective of the model is to maximize the aggregate accessibility of population to the different classes of facilities, taking explicitly into account the fact that location decisions influence the spatial distribution of population growth. The model was applied to a problem dealt with in Portugal during the preparation of the Centro Region Development Plan 1994: the redefinition of the regions' urban hierarchy.

They rated themselves as experienced computer users and consequently found the participation in the online discussion forum to be easy. The contributions showed a great degree of interest and knowledge in the issues of sustainable community development.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The quality of the urban living environment is strongly related to the provision and planning or design of public facilities, of which NIMBY, not-in-my-back-yard, facilities are often resisted by residents. Therefore, selecting the location for NIMBY facilities has become more and more difficult and time consuming. In Taiwan in particular, when the tenure landholding system is adopted, along with financial difficulties, frequent mass protests take place in relation to environmental issues, and consequently lead to financial development issues for the country. Hence, the interaction between the government and the public becomes critical and urgent. O'Hare believes that NIMBY facilities can be seen as a prisoner's dilemma game in game theory, and Camerer also points out that public issues such as environmental concerns are also a type of prisoner's dilemma game. This research adopts an alternative methodology to that of Axelrod, in which a computer simulation was used to compare interactive strategies in prisoner's dilemma games. On the basis of a deductive analysis comparing different interactive strategies in prisoner's dilemma games, in this research an experiment was conducted to verify empirically the results of that analysis in the context of siting NIMBY facilities. The experiment has once again proven that tit-for-tat is indeed a comparatively more effective strategy than the others, not only for the player under consideration, but also for the society as a whole, with the assumption of symmetric information, and it can be used as a reference when political decisions are to be made from the government regarding NIMBY facilities. </jats:p>",

By combining highly detailed height measurements with, amongst others, topographical data we are able to quantify urban volume. This new approach is demonstrated in two separate case studies that relate to the temporal and spatial dimension of the urban environment, respectively. In the first study the growth of the city of Amsterdam over the past century is studied. The urban-volume indicator is used to visualise and quantify the urban extension and intensification process. To critically analyse the spatiotemporal development of Amsterdam the self-organising-map approach is applied. Special attention is given to highlighting any signs of recent polynuclear development. The second case study compares the building-height frequency and spatial distribution of high-density zones in the four major Dutch cities. Additionally, the presence of built-up areas and the actual urban-volume values are explained simultaneously using a Heckman selection model. </jats:p>",

The key difference between these two perspectives is that the regret-minimization perspective implies that the anticipated satisfaction associated with a chosen spatial alternative depends on the anticipated performance of nonchosen alternatives. In order to provide a meaningful statistical comparison, we formulate a model of regret minimization such that it reduces to utility maximization for a given parameter restriction. Estimation results, based on a binary stated travel-mode-choice experiment, show how the regret-based model outperforms its utilitarian counterpart. Furthermore it is shown how participants in the experiment attached relatively much weight to the situation where the nonchosen alternative is slightly better than the chosen one, and they tend to discount larger differences. We show how this concavity of the regret function is in line with the prospect theoretical notion of risk-seeking behaviour in the domain of losses. </jats:p>",

Referring to data based on twenty-nine interviews with building surveyors, we show that change in building control is complex and contradictory, and best thought of as the emergence of new capacities, competencies, and interactions (of regulation) both within BCD, and between BCD and new actors and agents. This includes the enlargement of the regulatory networks of BCD, through the use of external expert advisors, and by the formation of, sometimes unstable, partnerships in which BCD may work with each other and with clients of building-control services. Such partnerships and networks are part of a complexity of regulation, in which outcomes are not the products of any one professional, or actor, but part of a diversity of overlapping relations and interventions. Such relations, we argue, are part of a process that may undermine, even dismantle, the public provision of building-control services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A major trend, recently drawing much attention, is the employment of new technologies in retailing. This involves a shift from some aspects of the traditional store format towards the introduction of electronic means of performing retail activities. E-retail encompasses three main activities—specifically, a product search activity (often referred to as a product-evaluation or information-gathering facility), an online purchase function, and the product delivery capability. Early studies have asserted that information technology would generate a revolution in the retail sector, owing to the potential of the web to reduce the costs of transaction, transportation, and searching. Yet the proportion of virtual shopping is significantly smaller than that of traditional shopping. An understanding of this difference can be obtained by modeling consumer choices. This paper will examine the different shopping activities, by modeling both purchase and delivery choices. Identifying the reasons that consumers use virtual (electronic) modes is crucial in order to influence the share of electronic shopping and to understand the potential impacts. Modeling the probability of using e-shopping should reveal the significant variables that may encourage or discourage the use of this mode of shopping. </jats:p>",

An in-depth examination of between-group differences in demand for recreational cycling was carried out on the basis of personal characteristics, cycling experiences, and cycling resources. An omnibus test was conducted to examine whether there were any differences between the two groups of workers in terms of their environmental preferences for cycling facilities. Additional analyses were conducted to examine the importance that the cyclists placed on environmental factors, as well as their levels of satisfaction. Significant between-group differences were found regarding the environmental preferences and significant within-group differences were also found regarding the importance ratings of the environmental components, as well as their ratings of satisfaction with those components. The results provide valuable information for evaluating the efficiency of governmental-resource allocations and, by extension, providing guidelines for an appropriate cycling policy when constructing recreational cycling facilities. </jats:p>",

The visibility analysis calculates fields of intervisibility between the high-rise building and locations in the urban landscape. Visual obstacles such as existing buildings and trees are included. The dominance analysis adds to the visibility analysis a measure of how visually dominant the high-rise building would be. The dominance measure is based on the distance to the building and how much of the building would be visible from any observation point. The result is an assessment of visibility and dominance throughout the entire study area as opposed to using photomontages for assessing visibility and dominance from single standpoints. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Abstract. This prospective research study was conducted at a government office which moved from an open-plan office with somewhat enclosed workspaces to another open-plan office with open workspaces. The study at the old office was conducted almost one year before the move, and the study at the new office was conducted more than one year after the move. The purpose of this study was threefold: (1) to measure and evaluate changes in patterns of accessibility and visibility due to changes in office layout, (2) to understand the effects of layout changes on observed behaviors, and (3) to determine the effects of layout changes on environmental perception. The study included the analysis of visibility and accessibility of each layout using space syntax techniques, field observations of behaviors, and questionnaire surveys of employees’ perceptions of privacy, job satisfaction, and commitment to the organization. During field observations, movement, visible copresence (ie the number of people visible from a space), and face-to-face interaction were observed along a predefined route in each office. Thirty-five people responded to the questionnaire survey at the old office. Out of the thirty five, only twenty nine were available for survey at the new office. On the basis of the questionnaire survey data, three multi-item scales were constructed in order to measure perceived privacy, job satisfaction, and commitment to organization. Results indicate better visibility and accessibility, increased face-to-face interaction, and improved perceived privacy at the new office. Results also show consistent effects of space on movement, and significant positive correlations between perceived privacy, job satisfaction, and commitment to the organization at these locations, despite significant design differences. Implications of the research results and limitations of the research design are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an analysis of general shopping and travel-related attitudes collected from a custom-designed Internet-based survey conducted in the spring of 2006, of randomly selected residents of two communities in Northern California. These and other data collected in the survey will eventually lead to models of shopping mode (channel) choice, intention, and frequency among other analyses. In this early examination of the data ( N = 966), exploratory factor analysis is performed to identify the conceptual constructs underlying a group of forty-two general shopping-related attitudinal statements, with which respondents agreed or disagreed on a five-point Likert-type scale. From the nineteen potential constructs identified in the design stage, thirteen dimensions emerged empirically: shopping and store enjoyment, price and time consciousness, impulse buying, materialism, trust, caution, trendsetting, and opinions with respect to credit card usage, technology, exercise, and the environment. Cluster analysis is then conducted to identify seven market segments having different attitudinal profiles: store shopaholics (15%), bichannel shopaholics (14%), time-starved worriers (16%), nonmaterialistic greens (16%), unwired antishoppers (14%), practical and leisure-oriented (13%), and technoconservatives (11%). These segments differ significantly, in logical ways, on a number of sociodemographic and other characteristics, including shopping channel choices. Thus, more detailed investigations of choice behavior using these market segments should prove fruitful. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Despite a burgeoning literature on global health partnerships (GHPs), there have been few studies of how GHPs, particularly those trying to build a bridge between horizontal and vertical modes of delivering essential health services, operate at global and country levels. This paper will help address this knowledge gap by describing and analyzing the GAVI Alliance's early experience with health systems strengthening (HSS) to improve immunization coverage and other maternal‐child health outcomes. To date, the strengths of HSS reside in its potential to optimize GAVI's overall investment in immunization, efforts to harmonize with other initiatives, willingness to acknowledge risk and identify mitigation strategies, engagement of diverse stakeholders, responsiveness to country needs, and effective management of an ambitious grant‐making enterprise. The challenges have been forging a common vision and approach, governance, balancing pressure to move money with incremental learning, managing partner roles and relationships, managing the “value for money” risk, and capacity building. This mid‐point stock‐taking makes recommendations for moving GAVI forward in a thoughtful manner. The findings should be of interest to other GHPs because of their larger significance. This is a story about how a successful alliance that decided to broaden its mandate has responded to the technical, organizational, and political complexities that challenge its traditional business model.

The model is founded on the monocentric urban economic model and uses a cellular automata (CA) approach to introduce endogenous neighbourhood effects. Households are assumed both to like and to dislike the density of their neighbourhood, and are assumed to trade-off this density with housing space consumption and commuting costs. Discontinuous spatial patterns emerge from that trade-off, with the size of suburban clusters varying with time and distance to the centre. We use space–time diagrams inspired from 1D elementary CA to visualise changes in spatial patterns through time and space, and undertake sensitivity analyses to show how the pattern and timing of sprawl are affected by neighbourhood preferences, income level, commuting costs, or by imposing a green belt. </jats:p>",

Fundamental to this is the notion that aspects of risk are socially constructed, and therefore this paper explores the subject from both data and conceptual perspectives. These risk patterns evolve over time due to the changing structure of social-economic, demographic and constructed systems, and also due to changes in the physical environment. Risk must therefore be viewed as a constantly changing dynamic system. A review of the literature suggests that risk is increasing in some very significant ways, and that mitigation strategies should pay close attention to those trends if they are to be effective.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An ongoing challenge in telecommunication is the integration of a variety of services on broadband access platforms at increasing transmission speed. Traditional Internet services like file transfer, email and web browsing, are carried on the same multi service IP platforms with voice, video and television over IP, online gaming, peer-to-peer and grid networking etc. While broadband access is established as a standard equipment for homes, the networking capacities in the access and the backbone are steadily extended to keep pace with higher traffic volumes. Together with the spectrum of services, the traffic mix on the aggregation levels becomes increasingly versatile with different demands for end-to-end transport in terms of throughput, loss and delay sensitivity. The chapter focuses on planning and traffic engineering for link bandwidth and buffers as main resources in communication platforms based on measurement and statistical properties of traffic growth and variability. We summarize quality of service demands of main Internet applications and mechanisms to control and stabilize the performance of ISP network platforms on different time scales. Load thresholds for link dimensioning are derived with regard to quality of service (QoS) demands and the variability in source and aggregated profiles. Finally, link level and network wide traffic engineering is addressed together with load balancing techniques.</jats:p>"

Using a nationwide sample of 3000 Dutch e-shoppers we provide more insight into this topic. Results indicate that city centres are most likely to face the substitution of e-shopping for in-store shopping, followed by city district centres. Surprisingly, village centres are less affected by e-shopping than city centres. Moreover, for neighbourhood and convenience centres the adverse effects of e-shopping are small. The probability of substituting e-shopping for in-store shopping at particular shopping locations is largely influenced by the extent to which people shop online, as well as personal and geographical factors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transportation analysis is typically thought of as one kind of spatial analysis. A major point of departure in understanding problems in transportation analysis is the recognition that spatial analysis has some limitations associated with the discretization of space. Among them, modifiable areal units and boundary problems are directly or indirectly related to transportation planning and analysis through the design of traffic analysis zones (TAZs). The modifiable boundary and the scale issues should all be given specific attention during the specification of a TAZ because of the effects these factors exert on statistical and mathematical properties of spatial patterns (ie the modifiable areal unit problem—MAUP). The results obtained from the study of spatial data are not independent of the scale, and the aggregation effects are implicit in the choice of zonal boundaries. The delineation of zonal boundaries of TAZs has a direct impact on the reality and accuracy of the results obtained from transportation forecasting models. In this paper the MAUP effects on the TAZ definition and the transportation demand models are measured and analyzed using different grids (in size and in origin location). This analysis was developed by building an application integrated in commercial GIS software and by using a case study (Lisbon Metropolitan Area) to test its implementabiity and performance. The results reveal the conflict between statistical and geographic precision, and their relationship with the loss of information in the traffic assignment step of the transportation planning models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We present a model of the interaction of segregation and suburbanization in determining residential location. The model incorporates differential income between two classes of agents, a simplified market mechanism for the purchase of housing, and a simple geographic structure of one central city and four symmetrically arranged suburbs. Agents derive utility from neighborhood racial composition, the size of their lot, private amenities that are specific to neighborhoods, and public amenities that stretch across municipalities. We find that the public-amenities term leads to a positive-feedback loop in which migration to suburbs increases the public amenities in those municipalities while lowering amenities in the central city, thus sparking further migration. When the minority agents are uniformly less affluent than the majority agents, this dynamic produces discontinuity in segregation as measured by centralization. Such discontinuities are typical of first-order phase transitions. When minority and majority incomes overlap, significant regions appear over which there are multistable equilibria at high and low levels of segregation, along with considerable sensitivity to the initial distribution of minority agents. We discuss the implications of these findings. </jats:p>",

Considering urban growth only as the outcome of local forces creates an incomplete perspective of complex realities. The chapter focuses on the vulnerability and adaptation of urban areas to the potential impacts of climate change in poor countries and emerging economies and explores a role of urban planning in building adaptation strategies. It also highlights the need of new multidimensional approaches orienting urban growth and the responses to climate change. Many of the actions needed to reduce social and urban vulnerability and enhance adaptation to climate change strongly relate to current development pressures in urban areas. Efforts in this direction can make a difference in the livelihood of millions of present and future urban inhabitants.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Automated Planning (AP) studies the generation of action sequences for problem solving. A problem in AP is defined by a state-transition function describing the dynamics of the world, the initial state of the world and the goals to be achieved. According to this definition, AP problems seem to be easily tackled by searching for a path in a graph, which is a well-studied problem. However, the graphs resulting from AP problems are so large that explicitly specifying them is not feasible. Thus, different approaches have been tried to address AP problems. Since the mid 90’s, new planning algorithms have enabled the solution of practical-size AP problems. Nevertheless, domain-independent planners still fail in solving complex AP problems, as solving planning tasks is a PSPACE-Complete problem (Bylander, 94). How do humans cope with this planning-inherent complexity? One answer is that our experience allows us to solve problems more quickly; we are endowed with learning skills that help us plan when problems are selected from a stable population. Inspire by this idea, the field of learning-based planning studies the development of AP systems able to modify their performance according to previous experiences. Since the first days, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been concerned with the problem of Machine Learning (ML). As early as 1959, Arthur L. Samuel developed a prominent program that learned to improve its play in the game of checkers (Samuel, 1959). It is hardly surprising that ML has often been used to make changes in systems that perform tasks associated with AI, such as perception, robot control or AP. This article analyses the diverse ways ML can be used to improve AP processes. First, we review the major AP concepts and summarize the main research done in learning-based planning. Second, we describe current trends in applying ML to AP. Finally, we comment on the next avenues for combining AP and ML and conclude. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>IS literature continues to highlight the issues of strategic business and IT planning alignment to achieve business performance. As an alternative to the mainstream models in the planning and implementation of the IS/IT by an organization, this chapter proposes an externalized approach by identifying the market driven needs through the firm’s value proposition to the customer derived from the product/service consumption. The market based push-pull framework is to ensure that the push strategy of the firm in what it wants to offer and at a price that it intends to offer is matched with the pull strategy of the market in what it wants to buy and at a price it is willingly to pay. This externalized customer value is reconciled by the internalized firm’s creation and delivery of the value as proposed by the firm based on the reconciliation of the market-pull and firm-push value proposition affecting customer satisfaction. Once the market pull and firm push strategy is identified, the alignment of the IT would be based on the pushpull effect of the business requirement to serve and satisfy not only the internal customer needs but also the more important external customer needs and requirements in term of the firm’s value proposition. The IT as a key enabler would be the main enabling mechanism to create and deliver on the value as proposed to the customer. A case study of how a university revamp its Information Management System by aligning the external and the internal elements is used to illustrate this reconciliation in its market driven IS/IT planning. The “market driven IS/IT” planning model is the base of the strategic integration of the internal and external elements that is contended to address the key planning issues in a more integrated and comprehensive way.</jats:p>"

Much of the debate centers on issues of economic development versus the maintenance and support of already existing communities. As a number of urban areas are in the throes of gentrification and economic development projects, there is a dearth of information on not only the use of private power in this process, but also the response of the community members. This anthology responds to a growing concern about urban and community development, and the role of corporate power. These essays focus on key themes of land ownership and management, community resistance against corporate agendas, and public discourse over these issues. These themes are presented and developed within an interdisciplinary framework which includes information and commentary about history, contemporary politics, economic development, and ideology. Most of the chapters include case studies that provide concrete examples of contemporary developments in urban areas, and each chapter includes discussion questions and a list of key words and terms to help guide the reader.</p>"

We present the data model for service provision. The network expansion and cost reduction case studies are discussed. A SWOT analysis about University’s Telecommunications Center is given.

Desenvolvido a partir da aplicação de cuidados paliativos sustentados pela gravação das decisões dos doentes referentes à recusa antecipada de tratamento, prevenindo situações de incapacidade cognitiva no final da vida, os processos de acp alargaram-se, recentemente, aos cuidados de saúde e cuidados de protecção social prolongados. Este processo tem como objectivo envolver clientes, famílias e outros cuidadores informais no sentido de se prepararem para pensar antecipadamente acerca das exigências de situações de necessidade de cuidados difíceis. A investigação demonstra que esse processo aumenta a satisfação dos clientes com os serviços e amplia a probabilidade de se verem alcançadas as escolhas de clientes e famílias. O acp é um avanço importante na teorização do serviço social relativamente às questões específicas da prestação de serviços de longa duração, quando o papel destes serviços se perspectivava apenas focalizado na gestão e coordenação dos casos. Este processo, fortalece, também, a participação dos clientes na tomada de decisão sobre os serviços sociais a adequar à sua situação.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Owing to the richer set of concepts which are involved in activity-based transportation models, the potential advantages of an activity-based approach for air quality purposes have been recognized for a long time. However, models that have been developed along these lines are still scarce. In this research the activity-based model ALBATROSS was used in combination with the emission model MIMOSA to assess the travelled distances and the mobile source emissions produced by passenger cars in the Netherlands. The fact that this approach is based on hourly travel and emission values, rather than on aggregated results or peak hour values, a common practice within other traditional models, is an important added value. The predicted values seem to correspond well with the reported values from the Dutch Scientific Statistical Agency. Predictions for travelled distances overestimated the reported values by approximately 8%. Predictions for emissions of nitrogen oxide, carbon dioxide, volatile organic compounds, and particular matter differed by 16%, 11%, 9%, and 3%, respectively, from the officially reported values. This paper is novel in the sense that it both reports on the applied methodology and presents the practical results from a case study of the activity-based emission modelling approach. </jats:p>",

This holistic model comprises four modules: Want-Is-Target (WIT) model, Transition and Alignment Grid (TAG), Comprehensive Architecting Process (CAP), and Joint Analysis &amp; Roadmapping (JAR). The characteristics and features of the constituent elements in the STEP model are articulated in great detail. The WIT model defines three stages of architecture states – current, target, and end state. TAG specifies two dimensions for architecture planning, namely current-to-future state transformation and IT-to-Business alignment. CAP presents an overarching method for step-by-step engineering and design in system architecture and portfolio optimization. JAR comprises the best-of-breed strategic analysis techniques, accompanied by a hybrid method with strategy-driven and initiative-driven planning streams. Applying the framework in planning and future trends are also discussed in the context. This overarching framework provides a comprehensive multi-disciplinary approach to conducting strategic and tactical technology planning for both near-term needs and long-term goals.</jats:p>"

Administrative methods for running an economy, with economic planning foremost among them, were inseparably linked to the collapse of the socialist system and, in essence, were held responsible for it. Thus, although the dominant economic paradigm has once again failed to deliver in recent years, the research for other methods fell into oblivion along with the system they were attached to. This work represents an attempt to reconsider the potential of economic planning as a means of organizing an economy at various levels, at various degrees and in various environments. I shall try to illustrate that the blame for the collapse of different socialist systems should not have fallen on the systemic deficiencies of economic planning but, instead, on the political institutions responsible for its application. In addition, I will stress that economic planning has been condemned by non-economic parameters and the application of wrong planning methods. In making this argument I hope to provide an angle through which the discussion of economic organization can be opened to a broader scope of research.</jats:p>"

Street centrality is calibrated in a multiple centrality assessment model composed of multiple measures such as closeness, betweenness, and straightness. Kernel density estimation is used to transform datasets of centrality and activities to one scale unit for analysis of correlation between them. Results indicate that retail and service activities in Bologna tend to concentrate in areas with better centralities. The distribution of these activities correlates highly with the global betweenness of the street network, and also, to a slightly lesser extent, with the global closeness. This confirms the hypothesis that street centrality plays a crucial role in shaping the formation of urban structure and land uses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The previous chapters describe how IT strategy and enterprise architecture can be defined in line with business strategy. The success of business and IT strategies, as explained in Chapter IV, depends on the firm’s ability to translate the strategies into work packages known as strategic programs, and diligently plan, prioritize, and execute the strategic programs in a sequence that is in accordance with the business strategy and priorities. Chapter VI describes enterprise architecture as the link between business strategy and information systems planning and implementation (which, in effect, executes the strategy). The gap analysis of the current enterprise architecture in comparison with the target or future state architecture will identify the scope and extent of change required on the current architecture to transition towards the target architecture. Compared to business strategy gap analysis, architecture gap analysis offers a more granular and integrative assessment of the business and system changes required to realize the business strategy. The scope and extent of architecture change required constitutes the overall scope of the strategic programs that need to be defined and developed to deliver the objectives of the business strategy. These programs will be prioritized by IT governance using IT project portfolio management principles. Their implementations in time sequence will define the migration path of the current enterprise architecture towards the target future state architecture. This chapter explains the theory behind and the practice of strategic program planning and program management. We first describe two contrasting approaches to IT strategic planning, namely: the Cassidy model, and the Y model discussed in Chapter IV. The Cassidy (2006) model uses the business vision to define the IT architecture direction from which the IT strategic plan is then specified including its business case justification. In terms of the Y model, strategic program planning and execution fall in stages 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the model. Discussions of the Y model and analysis of barriers to strategy implementation will give the readers a basic understanding of IT strategic planning and program execution (introductory project management practice). We conclude the chapter by describing the principles and methods for enterprise architecture-driven strategic planning as well as IT project portfolio management principles. This is a more advanced practice, typically taken by firms with higher maturity in IT management practice. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Diverse perspectives need to be brought together to facilitate the organisational delivery of more sustainable transport plans and policies. This necessitates close-working partnerships and good cross-sector learning. This paper looks at the rationales for design of, and anticipated roles for, two tools to assist this process: one a guide to cross-sector and intra-organisational partnership working written specifically for local authority transport practitioners; and the other an online framework within which practitioners can better identify and utilise other products from the research programme. Whilst grounded in UK research and experience, the lessons learned are generic to the European context. The paper also investigates the success of DISTILLATE’s own interdisciplinary approach and relates this to the literature, in particularly to the idea of ‘double loop learning’ by which individuals and organisations (research and practitioner) can acquire the new knowledge necessary to make the step-change towards more sustainable transport systems and practices. This is followed by a discussion of the implications of this for supporting decision-making more widely in the field of transport and infrastructure.</jats:p>"

Effective grant-writing is emphasized, as well as information related to planning for change through the use of small groups and activities. In the authors' experience, many professionals recognize the need for effective planning, but often balk at using material that seems too far removed from their scope of expertise and academic discipline. The text presents material in a straightforward manner that is intended to make planning accessible and meaningful to these individuals who are uniquely qualified to effect positive change.</p>"

We propose a method to reach consensus for a group decision on the basis of a combination of the analytic hierarchy process and the assurance region model of data envelopment analysis. Several strategies for using this methodology—for example, Delphi procedures—are also discussed. On the basis of these analyses, the evaluators (council members) responsible for recommending the proper candidate JDS for an MRT system in Taichung City, Taiwan, came up with two contenders from among five: one station in Taichung's CBD area and the other in the Situn district. It was not possible to discriminate between the two using multiple criteria for evaluating stations. The evaluators recommended these two stations to the city council, who should now be able to make an informed, objective decision. In this report we have summarized, with emphasis on the methodological aspects, the decision-making processes that the evaluators followed. </jats:p>",

The framework has been used widely within start-up companies and well-established companies both large and small; it has been deployed in the service and manufacturing sectors. It has been applied by practitioners and consultants to help improve e-business capability levels, and by academics for teaching and research purposes at graduate and undergraduate levels. This chapter will provide an account of the unique e-business planning and analysis framework (E-PAF) and demonstrate how it works via an abridged version of a case study (selected from hundreds that have been produced). This will include a brief account of the three techniques that are integrated to form the analysis framework: quality function deployment (QFD) (Akao, 1972), the balanced scorecard (BSC) (Kaplan &amp; Norton, 1992), and value chain analysis (VCA) (Porter, 1985). The case study extract is based on an online community and dating agency service identified as VirtualCom which has been produced through a consulting assignment with the founding directors of that company and has not been published previously. It has been chosen because it gives a concise, comprehensive example from an industry that is relatively easy to relate to.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a state-of-the-art approach to running organizations with the help of comprehensive information systems, providing support for key business processes and more general, for electronic business (e-business). ERP has evolved from earlier approaches, in particular, materials requirement planning (MRP) and manufacturing resource planning (called MRP II) in the 1980s. The focus of MRP and MRP II was on manufacturing firms. The essential problem that MRP attacked was to determine suitable quantities of all parts and materials needed to produce a given master production schedule (also called a “production program”), plus the dates and times when those quantities had to be available. Application packages for MRP have been available from the 1960s on. In the beginning, they were mostly provided by hardware vendors like IBM, Honeywell Bull, Digital Equipment, Siemens, etc. MRP was later expanded to closed-loop MRP to include capacity planning, shop floor control, and purchasing, because as Oliver Wight (1884) puts it: “Knowing what material was needed was fine, but if the capacity wasn’t available, the proper material couldn’t be produced” (p. 48). The next step in the evolution was MRP II (manufacturing resource planning). According to the father of MRP II, Oliver Wight, top management involvement in the planning is indispensable. Therefore, MRP II expands closed-loop MRP “to include the financial numbers that management needs to run the business and a simulation capability” (Wight, 1984, p. 54). Enterprise resource planning (ERP) has its roots in the earlier MRP II concepts, but it extends those concepts substantially into two directions. ERP takes into account that other types of enterprises than those producing physical goods need comprehensive information system (IS) support as well, and even in the manufacturing industry, there are more areas than those directly related to the production of goods that are critical for the success of a business. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban greenspace has consistently been argued to be of great importance to the wellbeing, health, and daily lives of residents and users. This paper reports results from a study that combined the visualisation of public results from a study that combined the visualisation of public greenspace with environmental economics, and that aimed to develop a method by which realistic computer models of sites could be used within preference studies. As part of a methodology that employed contingent rating to establish the values placed on specific greenspace sites, three-dimensional computer models were used to produce visualisations of particular environmental conditions. Of particular importance to the study was the influence of variables including lighting, season, time of day, and weather on the perception of respondents. This study followed previous work that established a suitable approach to the modelling and testing of entirely moveable physical variables within the built environment. As such, the study has established firmly that computer-generated visualisations are appropriate for use within environmental economic surveys, and that there is potential for a holistic range of attributes to be included in such studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A generalization of cellular automata was developed that allows flexible, dynamic updating of variable neighborhood relationships, which in turn allows the integration of interactions at widely disparate spatial and temporal scales. Cells in the landscapes were modeled as vertices of dynamic graph automata that allow temporally variable causal connectivity between spatially nonadjacent cells. A trial was carried out to represent changes in an Amazonian and a tropical Andean landscape modeled as dynamic graph automata with input from a Landsat TM-derived Level 1 classification with the following classes: for the Amazon—forest, nonforest vegetation, water, and urban or bare (soil); for the Andes—forest, scrub (shrub or grassland), agriculture, and bare or exposed ground. Explicit automata transition rules were used to simulate temporal land-cover change. These rules were derived independently from fieldwork in each area, including vegetation plots or transects and informal interviews. Such a generalization of cellular automata was useful for modeling land-use–land-cover change (LULCC), although it potentially increases the computational complexity of an already data intensive process (involving 5–8 million cells, in 1000 stochastic simulations, with each simulation encompassing 15 annual time steps). The interannual predicted LULCC, while more nuanced in the Andean site, poses a serious threat to compositional and configurational stability in both the Andes and the Amazon, with implications for landscape heterogeneity and habitat fragmentation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Competition Commission's analysis in 2007 of entry and exit conditions among small stores across more than one thousand British high streets provided a landmark piece of research on a topic in which debate and policy recommendations had moved significantly, and arguably dangerously, ahead of the available evidence base. Within a general context of a continuing long-term decline of specialist small stores in British town centres and high streets, it cast considerable doubt on the popularly held view that a broad-based decline of the independent convenience store sector was taking place across the UK, or that Britain's high streets were experiencing an accelerating decline in their small and specialist stores. Additionally, and even more controversially, the Commission's analysis was able to demonstrate that competitive entry by larger format corporate food retailing was not inevitably and uniformly associated with negative impacts on the small store sector. It is known that the Commission's research was paralleled by an identical analysis conducted on behalf of one of the main parties to the Groceries Market Inquiry by the University of Southampton. The first component of the Southampton analysis, which both corroborated and extended the Commission's findings, is available in the public domain. This paper now presents the second component of the Southampton analysis, which similarly both corroborates but also extends the vitally important ‘conditional entry’ dimension of the Commission's research—focusing directly on the extent to which entry into the small store sector during the early to mid 2000s might have been constrained by, and exit from the sector accelerated by, the competitive impacts of larger format foodstore openings by the major corporate retailers. The paper shows: (a) that there is an important missing regional dimension within the Commission's analysis, and (b) that entry and exit into the small store sector in the UK during 2000–06 was constrained and/or accelerated by the competitive impacts of supermarket opening in a different fashion within ‘London and prospering southern England’ than elsewhere in the country. That is to say, in the region of the UK in which arguments about the threat of corporate retail to the diversity of the small store sector had often proved particularly heated, the Southampton analysis shows small shops in town centres and high streets to have been more robust to the competitive opening of larger format corporate foodstores than elsewhere in the UK. In that context, the paper suggests that the findings represent an ‘inconvenient truth’ which deserves consideration both in policy debate and in future processes of planning regulation reform. Discussion of the relevance of the findings in respect of the proposed changes to Planning Policy Statement 6 released for consultation by the Department for Communities and Local Government in July 2008 is presented. </jats:p>",

Desenvolvido a partir da aplicação de cuidados paliativos sustentados pela gravação das decisões dos doentes referentes à recusa antecipada de tratamento, prevenindo situações de incapacidade cognitiva no final da vida, os processos de acp alargaram-se, recentemente, aos cuidados de saúde e cuidados de protecção social prolongados. Este processo tem como objectivo envolver clientes, famílias e outros cuidadores informais no sentido de se prepararem para pensar antecipadamente acerca das exigências de situações de necessidade de cuidados difíceis. A investigação demonstra que esse processo aumenta a satisfação dos clientes com os serviços e amplia a probabilidade de se verem alcançadas as escolhas de clientes e famílias. O acp é um avanço importante na teorização do serviço social relativamente às questões específicas da prestação de serviços de longa duração, quando o papel destes serviços se perspectivava apenas focalizado na gestão e coordenação dos casos. Este processo, fortalece, também, a participação dos clientes na tomada de decisão sobre os serviços sociais a adequar à sua situação.</jats:p>"

Therefore, this chapter tries to broaden the discussion around the FOS-ERP subject, currently focused only in cost aspects, bringing more attention to other aspects and pointing out their innovative potential.</jats:p>"

Three rural district hospitals from three provinces in the North of Vietnam were purposively selected for this study. The “step‐down” approach was applied.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: There was little difference in the costs of an outpatient visit across the hospitals, but the costs of an operation and an inpatient day varied considerably. In terms of cost structure, personnel costs accounted for the highest share of total cost of the clinical services. The shares of operating cost were considerable while depreciation of buildings/equipments made up a small “proportion”. The study results revealed that the user fee levels were much lower than the actual costs of providing the corresponding services. The present study highlights the importance of costing data for hospital planning and management. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This chapter introduces a framework for planning of information technologies (IT) for the industry cluster. More specifically, the different stages in planning and executing an industry scale IT project for supply chain management are discussed here based on an example from Singapore.

The ability of software agents to act somewhat autonomously links them with living animals and humans, so they seem appropriate for discussion under nature-inspired computing (Marrow, 2000). This paper presents AGALZ (Autonomous aGent for monitoring ALZheimer patients), and explains how this deliberative planning agent has been designed and implemented. A case study is then presented, with AGALZ working with complementary agents into a prototype environment-aware multi-agent system (ALZ-MAS: ALZheimer Multi-Agent System) (Bajo, Tapia, De Luis, Rodríguez &amp; Corchado, 2007). The elderly health care problem is studied, and the possibilities of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) (Sokymat, 2006) as a technology for constructing an intelligent environment and ascertaining patient location to generate plans and maximize safety are examined. This paper focuses in the development of natureinspired deliberative agents using a Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) (Aamodt &amp; Plaza, 1994) architecture, as a way to implement sensitive and adaptive systems to improve assistance and health care support for elderly and people with disabilities, in particular with Alzheimer. Agents in this context must be able to respond to events, take the initiative according to their goals, communicate with other agents, interact with users, and make use of past experiences to find the best plans to achieve goals, so we propose the development of an autonomous deliberative agent that incorporates a Case-Based Planning (CBP) mechanism, derivative from Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) (Bajo, Corchado &amp; Castillo, 2006), specially designed for planning construction. CBP-BDI facilitates learning and adaptation, and therefore a greater degree of autonomy than that found in pure BDI (Believe, Desire, Intention) architecture (Bratman, 1987). BDI agents can be implemented by using different tools, such as Jadex (Pokahr, Braubach &amp; Lamersdorf, 2003), dealing with the concepts of beliefs, goals and plans, as java objects that can be created and handled within the agent at execution time. </jats:p>"

Intra-enterprise integration was a driving force in the design, development, and use of early ERP systems, but increased globalization, intense competition, and technological change have shifted to focus to inter-enterprise integration. Current and evolving ERP systems thus reflect the expanded scope of integration, with greater emphasis on things like supply chain management and customer relationship management. This manuscript explores the evolution of ERP, the current status of ERP, and the future of ERP, with the objective of promoting relevant future research in this important area. If researchers hope to play a significant role in the design, development, and use of suitable ERP systems to meet evolving business needs, then their research should focus, at least in part, on the changing business environment, its impact on business needs, and the requirements for enterprise systems that meet those needs. </jats:p>"

The task in manufacturing is then to produce the components that meet the design specifications. The components are in turn assembled into the final products. When computers are used to assist the process planning and manufacturing activities, multiple benefits can be had. The related technologies are known as computer-aided process planning and computer-aided manufacturing. Often, they are not separable and are therefore discussed in tandem in this chapter. It should be emphasized that process planning is not only for metal-cutting processes. We need process planning for many other manufacturing processes such as casting, forging, sheet metal forming, compositesz and ceramic fabrication. In this chapter, the basic steps of developing a process plan are explained. There are two approaches to carrying out process planning tasks—manual experience-based method and computer-aided process planning method. The focus is on two computer-aided process planning methods, the variant approach, and generative approach. These discussions on process planning have been limited to machining processes. The topic of computer-aided manufacturing, on the other hand, is discussed with a more general point of view. A fictitious CAM plant is presented and some of the key aspects of CAM in a manufacturing system are discussed. A more specific version of CAM (i.e. computer numerical control) will be covered in Chapters VIII and IX.</jats:p>"

Although not a perfect replacement for faceto- face communication, videoconferencing can bring educators and students together although they may be separated by vast distances. Using videoconferencing technology, a lecturer in San Francisco can address students and colleagues in New York and Australia, students in Qatar and Pittsburgh can collaborate on a graduate research project and a doctoral candidate in Houston can defend his dissertation to a review board of faculty from a number of cities. Videoconferencing requires a substantial investment in equipment, expertise and support resources. Any institution considering such an investment must make a significant effort to evaluate the technical and usage requirements for a videoconferencing implementation to ensure the supportability and expandability of the system.</jats:p>"

This chapter presents SMEs’ Web presence implementation patterns and unravels the reasons behind the lack of strategic planning when adopting Electronic Commerce Technologies (ECT). The chapter presents findings from semi-structured interviews from 11 SMEs in the Northwest of the UK. Findings reflect the difference in development and management practices of Web presence, between the more able Need Pull SMEs that identified the need to adopt ECT, and the less able Technology Push SMEs that were mostly influenced by change agent diffusion and awareness efforts. Over time, each group of SMEs reflect a different pattern in ECT implementation. This chapter depicts the issues that hinder SMEs, particularly in micro and small, in moving beyond Web site adoption.</jats:p>"

As the function of CIO is likely a knowledge center of the organization. The big challenge on the implementation of ICT governance in Indonesia is that administratively, Indonesia consists of 33 provinces, five of which have special status. Each province has its own political legislature and governor, and each one of them has different governance structures. This condition can lead to information islands. G-CIO established to overcome this challenge and to achieve the knowledge based society in Indonesia. This is because G-CIO position is to fill the leadership gap across government unit and institution. Due the widely and political aspect, a G-CIO has to has technical ability, management skill and soft skill.</jats:p>"

Enterprise architecture management is cross-linked with other IT management processes and delivers the necessary information for a sustainable governance. The continuous analysis of the IT landscape, the deduction of measures for optimization and its controlling also belong to the tasks of architecture management. Standards for development and infrastructures are made, e.g. reference architectures and a “book of standards”, whose implementation is overseen by solution architects throughout the operative architecture management. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the main topics in IT Portfolio Management, according to IT Governance models, is to plan and control information systems that are aligned with the company mission and objectives. The goal of the IT Portfolio Planning is to define which information systems are necessary and with which priority. In general, planning methodologies trace directions from a present point to a future and desired target. However, in many cases, companies can not control situations; events may occur that can not be avoided. A scenarios-based planning methodology can help managers to identify future events, their probability and consequences. A scenario represents a future situation that can not be controlled nor can be avoided. However, the study of future scenarios can help managers to plan reactions, so that company can create mechanisms for avoiding problems or for minimizing bad consequences. The goal of this chapter is to present an adaptation of the scenario-based methodology for IT and Information Systems Planning. The chapter will describe in details each step of the proposed methodology and discuss a study case. Steps include the identification of different scenarios and their corresponding antecedent events, the determination of probabilities and consequences of the events, how to calculate risks and how to plan Information Systems and IT resources to manage each scenario.</jats:p>"

In this chapter, the case study involves a multinational conglomerate that is in the process of integrating and Web-enabling their enterprise database systems. The objective of the system was to help engineers sift through millions of components offered by various suppliers and component manufacturers, where the end-result was to improved the integration and efficiency of the product development, engineering design, e-sourcing, and e-procurement processes. This research is a qualitative action research study on how different organizational, social, political, and technical forces influenced the social construction of an enterprise-wide information system. Understanding the dynamics and power of these socio-technical forces in shaping the development environment and change process of enterprise systems is the focal point of this chapter’s discussion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this excerpt from the introduction to volume three of Sphären ( Spheres), subtitled Schäume ( foam), Sloterdijk argues that what makes the 20th century uniquely singular and creative is its invention of what he calls here atmosterrorism, the assault not on the body of the enemy, but on his or her environment. This terrorism of the atmosphere is to be understood as a human-made form of quake that turns the enemy's environment into a weapon against them. Living organisms, among them humans, simply cannot not breathe, and it is this double negative that is at the heart of atmoterrorism. Weaving a fascinating narrative that links the development of insecticides and pesticides to the first use of poisonous gas during World War I, to the development of the gas chamber as the tool of supreme punishment in the United States, to the eventual convergence of putative humane killing and disinfection and delousing into the mobile and stationary gas chambers of extermination used in the Nazi concentration camps. Terrorism, argues Sloterdijk, reveals the essence of war, the will to exterminate the enemy, with the difference that the former expands the extermination of the enemy to the very world that enables the enemy to exist. In the 20th century, atmoterrorism leads to the exterminism of total war. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A typical packaged software lifecycle, from the client-organization perspective, is packaged software selection followed by implementation, installation, training, and maintenance (that includes upgrades). Traditional software maintenance has been acknowledged by many researchers as the longest and most costly phase in the software lifecycle. This fact is no exception in the ERP packaged software maintenance context (Moore, 2005; Whiting, 2006). According to Ng, Gable, &amp; Chan (2002, pg. 100) ERP maintenance is defined as “post-implementation activities related to the packaged application software undertaken by the client-organization from the time the system goes live (i.e., successfully implemented and transported to the production environment), until it is retired from an organization’s production system, to keep the system running; adapt to a changed environment in order to operate well; provide helps to the system users in using the system; realize benefits from the system (best business processes, enhanced system integration, cost reduction); and keep the system a supported-version and meet the vendor’s requirements for standard code. These activities include: implementing internal change-requests (initiated by an ERP-using organization’s system users and IT-staff); responding or handling usersupport requests (initiated by an ERP-using organization’s system users); upgrading to new versions/releases (introduced by the vendor); and performing patches (support provided by the vendor).” In order to achieve the abovementioned maintenance objectives of keeping the ERP system running, adapting the system to a new operating environment, and ensuring the system up to the vendor’s requirement for standard code; and realizing benefits such as competitive advantages from the system, the IT department staff has to collect some metrics or relevant data on patches and modifications done to the ERP system so that they can know or can tell the status and the performance of their maintenance activities. The authors in Fenton (1991), Fenton &amp; Pfleeger (1997), and Florac (1992), agree that software maintenance data are useful for planning, assessment, tracking, and predictions on software maintenance. Although, there is a lot of literature on ERP, we find almost no literature on ERP maintenance metrics. Thus, this text is meant to provide some fundamental metrics on ERP patches and modifications which could be useful for ERP maintenance management in order to answer questions on the state of their ERP system, their patch implementation costs, and the ongoing maintenance costs for their previous modification or custom development. </jats:p>"

The attack resulted in severe economic impact, especially to airlines, and a stock market loss of $1.2 trillion. On December 26, 2004, a tsunami from a 9.1 earthquake overran the shores of many countries along the vast rim of the Indian Ocean. Over 283,000 people died. On August 29, 2005, Katrina, a category-5 hurricane, knocked out electric and communication infrastructure over 90,000 square miles of Louisiana and Mississippi and displaced 1.5 million people.” (Denning, 2006, p. 15). This past decade has been catastrophic, and there are still three more years to go. Many American businesses have not responded to the call for better human resource crisis planning, while a few corporations have risen to the challenge. It is necessary and extremely important for organizations to understand the importance of implementing crucial changes in the organizational structure of businesses, primarily in the human resource sector. The human resource sector is the area most responsible for the safety of personnel and therefore best equipped to foster the communication requirements any crisis will necessarily exact. </jats:p>"

Intra enterprise integration was a driving force in the design, development, and use of early ERP systems. Changing business needs have brought about the current business environment, wherein supply chain integration is desirable, if not essential, thus current and evolving ERP systems demonstrate an expanded scope of integration that encompasses limited inter-enterprise integration. This chapter explores the evolution, the current status, and future of ERP, with the objective of promoting relevant future research in this important area. If researchers hope to play a significant role in the design, development, and use of suitable ERP systems to meet evolving business needs, then their research should focus at least in part on the changing business environment, its impact on business needs, and the requirements for enterprise systems that meet those needs. </jats:p>"

Strategic planning gained\n   importance in the framework of those changes, particularly owing to the\n   growth of the environmental complex and sustainable growth planning, but also\n   because of the need for a higher security of markets and states. Strategic\n   spatial planning can be defined as a quite diverse planning activity. It is\n   considered that 'new' strategic planning will not represent a return to\n   comprehensive planning, but will rather be a combination of traditional and\n   new approaches to planning of sustainable development where an integrative\n   role will be progressively assumed by spatial and regional plans and\n   programs. Apart from a review of the development of strategic planning, this\n   paper considers the importance and role of strategic planning as a mechanism\n   of regional development and 'new' regional politics, based on the\n   contemporary development of critical thinking and practical experiences in\n   the European Union.</jats:p>"

In particular, we propose a learner-adaptable scaffolding method, in which functions of the tool can be fadable according to their planning skill.

This method seriously affects the spring production efficiency. In order to solve this problem, the coiling process planning system for spring based on CBR (case based reasoning) is developed in this paper. The system mainly comprises a case library that holds the details of coiling process plan. Similar cases are retrieved and adapted when a new spring is manufactured. The process of finding the most similar case is divided into three stages. Some key technologies of the system, including the information model of the spring coiling process and the structure of the case library, are also revealed in this paper. The result indicates that this system reduces the setup time and enhances the production efficiency of spring.</jats:p>",

The logistics plan includes repositioning the DCs in relation to the customer location for efficient distribution. The problem is formulated as truck delivery schedule using a new algorithm where single distribution centre is converted into a multiple warehouse location problem.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) developed the corridor-planning process to bridge the gap between its statewide long-range transportation policy plan and project-level National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) processes. MDT cooperated with Lincoln County, Montana; the USDA Forest Service; and FHWA to complete the Libby North Corridor Study. The approach used new rules and regulations: 23 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 450, Appendix A: Linking the Transportation Planning and NEPA Processes. Corridor planning complements NEPA and ensures that decisions are made at the appropriate level with consideration of low-cost alternatives and available funding. Environmentally complex issues in the Pipe Creek area, north of Libby, prompted the study. It was uncertain whether any project was possible on this secondary highway (MT-567) because of its environmentally challenging location: parallel to Pipe Creek (Bull Trout Critical Habitat), within the Kootenai National Forest and grizzly bear habitat distribution area, and just outside the Cabinet–Yaak grizzly bear recovery zone. If this project had been developed under traditional methods beginning with the NEPA-compliant environmental review, a full environmental impact study would have been likely. Concerned that any reconstruction would be insurmountable and not fundable because of environmental sensitivities, MDT and the county took a step back. The corridor was reassessed at the planning level to obtain a better understanding of corridor limitations and needs and to determine what improvements, if any, could be pursued. With the aid of many stakeholders and agencies, the study identified recommendations for improving safety, maintaining the scenic character of the corridor, and minimizing impacts to threatened and endangered species. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The task of planning a path between two spatial configurations of an artifact moving among obstacles is an important problem in many geometrically-intensive applications. Despite the ubiquity of the problem, the existing approaches make specific limiting assumptions about the geometry and mobility of the obstacles, or those of the environment in which the motion of the artifact takes place. In this paper we propose a powerful approach for 2D path planning in a dynamic environment that can undergo drastic topological changes. Our algorithm is based on a potent paradigm for medial axis computation that relies on constructive representations of shapes with R-functions that operate on real-valued half-spaces as logic operations. Our approach can handle problems in which the environment is not fully known a priori, intrinsically supports local and parallel skeleton computations for domains with rigid or evolving boundaries, and appears to extend naturally to 3D domains. Furthermore, our path planning algorithm can be implemented in any commercial geometric kernel, and has attractive computational properties. The capability of the proposed technique are explored through several examples designed to resemble highly dynamic environments.</jats:p>",

It starts by noting the impact of digital technology on teachers’ practice, particularly the role of planning in the creation of effective technology-mediated learning. It espouses the reconceptualization of planning as design for learning and identifies a key role for the emergent genre of pedagogic planning tools in stimulating practitioners’ engagement in this reconceptualized practice. Drawing on activity theory, the chapter then characterizes the principal elements and relationships in design for learning. From the insights gained, it analyzes research data from two projects to pinpoint the enabling factors and tensions in current practice that might be conducive to (or, conversely, impede) the effective design and deployment of pedagogic planning tools. It then synthesizes these into a framework in which software developers and policy makers can explore their own contexts for implementing such tools. </jats:p>"

Responding to the increasing interest in SISP, researchers have developed a large number of SISP methodologies and models. However, when organisations embark on planning for their information systems, they face difficulties and usually fail to gain the expected benefits. Strategic alignment and the identification of the business areas where the IT contribution is strategically important for the organisation are the most difficult problems in SISP. None of the existing SISP methodologies and models offers a complete solution. The approach presented in this chapter, utilises a Fuzzy Cognitive Map in order to align strategic objectives with IS opportunities that exist at the level of business processes. This chapter exemplifies fuzzy cognitive mapping in SISP, and illustrates how the strategic alignment between the business and IT domains can be realised.</jats:p>"

An influence diagram model that permits continuous decision variables is used to determine optimal decision rules for a single product monopolist making capacity and price selections once per period. Solutions under different scenarios based on the timing of actual demand observations and the ability to adjust initial capacity are compared to previous solutions in the literature. The results demonstrate that optimal decision rules for capacity and price determined using influence diagrams closely approximate those found using analytical approaches. The influence diagram is used to determine the effect of changing demand function parameters on the optimal solutions. Additionally, the influence diagram model can be adapted to solve capacity-planning problems that do not meet the assumptions required to obtain analytical solutions or heuristics in previous studies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article analyzes the allocation of the government budget to civilian and military expenditure by two rival countries that are involved in an arms race. We compare the consequences of myopic (period by period) planning versus rational (long-term) planning and show that although myopic planning is always favorable for both countries, they are likely to become locked in a prisoners' dilemma equilibrium in which they plan rationally. The prisoners' dilemma equilibrium results in higher stocks of weapon systems and lower welfare for both countries. We also find some evidence of the existence of a prisoners' dilemma equilibrium in the current Israeli-Syrian arms race. Generally, this article suggests that solving military/political conflicts that evolve into an arms race by relying only on military might is an expensive and suboptimal solution. Each country should identify this phenomenon and attempt to take it into account in its decisionmaking by using appropriate policy alternatives. There are two major policy options in this case. The first option is to reach some kind of agreement with the rival (directly or through a third party). The second option is to institute force multipliers techniques.</jats:p>"

In addition, changes to Annexes IV, V and XI of REACH have been adopted by the Commission. The review of Annex I has been completed whilst the review of Annex XIII is still ongoing, although a change to Annex XIII is likely XIII.

Business processes are running according to the business rules. However business processes are changing rapidly and especially because of changes in business logics and sequentially changes in rules system. To implement such changes into the business system, all software systems of information system (IS), which are supporting business, should be readjusted to be in alignment with business. Separation and centralisation of business logics represented by business rules from the code of software system of IS is one of the ways to solve the problem. The paper analyses problems and available solutions of integration tasks to allow ERP system the collaboration with other software systems of IS. The main contribution of the paper is a business rule management system based method for solution of such a problems by providing of the separated component of shared business logics for all software systems of IS that are servicing the business system.</jats:p>"

In doing so, they abandon or ignore their ongoing and more generic emergency planning and deny the obvious, that the next emergency or disaster has a high probability of being a very different situation. The same counterproductive results can be obtained if an organization is swept up in media hype and public concern about an “emergency du jour,” such as Y2K or pandemic flu.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise resource planning systems can be defined as customizable, standard application software which includes integrated business solutions for the core processes and administrative functions (Chan &amp; Rosemann, 2001). From an operative perspective, ERP systems provide a common technological platform unique for the entire corporation allowing the replacement of mainframes and legacy systems. This common platform serves to process automation as well as to simplify current process either by an explicit reengineering process or by the implicit adoption of the system “best practices” (Markus &amp; Tanis, 2000). Finally, the common centralized platform allows the access to data that previously were physically or logically dispersed. The automation of the processes and the access to data allows the reduction of operating times (thus reducing operating costs) while the latter serves to a better support of business decisions (see e.g., Umble, Haft &amp; Umble, 2003 for a detailed review of ERP benefits). ERP is considered to provide businesses with new opportunities to acquire knowledge (Srivardhana &amp; Pawlowski, 2007), being the sources of knowledge the aforementioned best practices from the ERP, and the ERP software company’s staff during the implementation phase. At present, ERP systems are either used or implemented in a large number of enterprises. According to Genoulaz and Millet (2006), up to 74% of manufacturing companies and up to 59% of service companies use an ERP system. In addition, more than 70% of Fortune 1000 companies have implemented core ERP applications (Bingi, Sharma, Godla, 1999; Yen, Chou &amp; Chang, 2002). The objectives for implementing an ERP system can be classified as operational, strategic, dual (operational plus strategic), or without objective (Law &amp; Ngai, 2007). The adoption of an ERP system with operational objectives is aimed at improvement operating efficiency together with the reduction of costs, while companies implementing ERP with a strategic objective would experience a change in business processes, improving sales and market expansion. A widespread critique to ERP systems is their high total cost of ownership (Al-Mashari, Al-Mudimigh &amp; Zairi, 2003) and hidden costs in implementation (Kwon &amp; Lee, 2001). Besides, ERP systems impose their own logic on an organization’s strategy and culture (Davenport, 1998), so ERP adopters must adapt their business processes and organization to these models and rules. Consequently, organizations may face difficulties through this adaptation process which is usually carried out without widespread employee involvement. This may cause sore employees, sterile results due to the lack of critical information usually provided by the employees; and also late delivery, with reduced functionality, and/or with higher costs that expected (Kraemmeraard, Moeller &amp; Boer, 2003). Additionally, some analysts have speculated that widespread adoption of the same ERP package in the same industry might lead to loss of competitive advantage due to the elimination of process innovation-based competitive advantage (Davenport, 1998). This has been observed, for instance, in the semiconductor manufacturers sector (Markus &amp; Tanis, 2000). The early stage of ERP was carried out through Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) systems (Umble, Haft &amp; Umble, 2003). The next generation of these systems, MRP II (Manufacturing Resources Planning), crossed the boundaries of the production functionality and started supporting not only manufacturing, but also finance and marketing decisions (Ptak &amp; Schragenheim, 2000). Current ERP systems appeared in the beginning of the 1990’s as evolved MRP II, incorporating aspects from CIM (Computer Integrated Manufacturing) as well as from EDP (Electronic Data Processing). Therefore, ERP systems become enterprise-wide, multilevel decision support systems. ERP systems continue evolving, incorporating Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Supply Chain Management (SCM), Product Data Management (PDM), or Geographic Information Systems (GIS), among others (Kwon &amp; Lee, 2001). </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Planning for Computerized Numerical Control (CNC) fabrication requires generation of process plans for the fabrication of parts that can be executed on CNC enabled machine tools. To create such plans, a large amount of domain specific knowledge is required to map the desired geometry of a part to a manufacturing process, thus decomposing design information into a set of feasible machining operations. Approaches to automate this planning process still rely heavily on human capabilities, such as planning and reasoning about geometry in relation to machining capabilities. In this paper, the authors present a new, shape grammar-based approach for automatically creating fabrication plans for CNC machining from a given part geometry. To avoid the use of static feature sets and their pre-defined mappings to machining operations, the method encodes knowledge of fundamental machine capabilities. A method for generating a vocabulary of removal volume shapes based on the available tool set and machine tool motions is defined in combination with a basic rule set for shape removal covering tool motion, removal volume calculation and CNC code generation. The use of shape grammars as a formalism enables systematic formulation of hard and soft constraints on spatial relations between the volume to be removed and the removal volume shape for a machining operation. The method is validated using an example of machining a simple part on a milling machine. Overall, the approach and method presented is an enabler for the creation of an autonomous fabrication system and CNC machine tools that are able to reason about part geometry in relation to available capabilities and carry out on-line planning for CNC fabrication.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this article is to determine what organisations in Namibia use as basis for investing in IT. In interviews with six organisations in Namibia, it was determined how they define and manage their investment in IT. Some conclusions can be drawn, the first being that organisations need to look at their definition of IT to include all aspects of IT like communication systems, maintenance, etc. the second implication is that somebody must be appointed to take responsibility for managing the IT investment.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper seeks to give expression to notions of excess within economies of climate change. The paper begins by addressing the dominance of scientific modelling in the scientific and political constructions of climate change manifested through general circulation models and scientific visualisation. Considering this ‘digital earth’, the paper further investigates how the unit-based accumulation of earth data has actively secured the production of political responses that have both emulated and reinstated a model of accounting (such as the Stern Review and carbon trading). Considering the rendering of digital earth as a specific assemblage of globalisation produced through digitalisation, I argue that the digital realm is productive of its own forms of excess (expressed in aesthetics and globalism). I suggest how this excessive globality reveals its own fragmentation through negative presentation. Drawing from Georges Bataille's notion of expenditure and Maurice Blanchot's writing of the disaster I seek to describe a terrain of knowledge and loss that breaks with this aforementioned circuit of accounting, and instead considers another kind of relation (Bataille's concept of expenditure) to account for the wasting of the world. The paper concludes with a Bataillean ‘sketch’ to consider how this excess may be recuperated as an emergent ethic within the disaster yet to come. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sinks are a device within environmental studies that describe spaces and processes that capture and channel wastes. This paper first explores sinks both as a cultural figure of environmental understanding and as an important technoscientific instrument within current attempts to describe the global carbon cycle in relation to climate change. The movement of wastes to and through sinks is often characterized as a metabolic operation, and this metabolic framing forms a key part of this investigation. Drawing on Serres's notion of the parasite, the paper considers how waste, noise, and interference may characterize other types of metabolic exchange that allow for a revised approach to sinks. The second section of this paper considers how waste ‘spills’ across environments in space and time. Spills are a way to describe the movement and exchange of wastes that do not conform to a clear trajectory or network, but, rather, express more formless and even disruptive geographies. Three ‘spills’ then structure this examination of the movement and mutation of waste, including the elusive transfer of carbon found within the ‘missing sinks’ in the biosphere, the indistinct exchanges of carbon and other wastes that occur with human and nonhuman bodies, and the uncertain exchanges and accumulations of carbon wastes in the future. In this investigation I argue that sinks point toward the revision of the notion that environments are or should be in metabolic balance, in favor of more complex and hybrid ecologies and exchanges that incorporate the transformative capacities of waste. Concluding with Bennett's discussion of the ‘ecology of matter’, this paper then suggests that the dynamic qualities of waste and matter require renewed attention to environmental exchanges, practices, and imaginings. </jats:p>",

The spatial and environmental planning should play the\n   key role in coordination and integration of different planning grounds in\n   achieving the sustainable regional development. The paper discusses the\n   spatial planning capacity to offer the integral view of the sustainable\n   territorial development. The brief review of tendencies in new spatial\n   planning and regional policy has been given. The focus is on the concept of\n   balanced polycentric development of European Union. The guiding principles of\n   spatial planning in regard of planning system reform in European countries\n   have been pointed out. The changes in paradigm of regional policy, and the\n   tasks of European regional spatial planning have been discussed. In Serbia\n   problems occur in regard with the lack of coordinating sectoral planning with\n   spatial and environmental planning. Partly the problem lies in the legal\n   grounds, namely in non codification of laws and unregulated horizontal and\n   vertical coordination at all levels of governance. The possibilities for the\n   implementation of spatial planning principles and concepts of European Union\n   sustainable territorial and regional development have been analyzed on the\n   case of three regional spatial plans of eastern and southeastern regions in\n   Serbia. The disadvantages in implementing the strategic environmental impact\n   assessment as an instrument for coordination and integration of sectorial\n   planning with spatial and environmental planning have been analyzed. The\n   strategic environmental impact assessment has been implemented only in the\n   spatial planning process. Through spatial planning process its feedback\n   effect on sectorial planning has been indirectly achieved. The priority\n   actions in Serbia for achieving the spatial and environmental planning role\n   in coordination and integration of different planning grounds in sustainable\n   regional development have been given.</jats:p>"

No matrix inversion is necessary and the computational mechanism does not crash near kinematic singularities or when the robot is asked to achieve a final pose that is outside its intrinsic workspace: what happens, in this case, is the gentle degradation of performance that characterizes humans in the same situations. Moreover, the remaining error at equilibrium is a valuable information for triggering a reasoning process and the search of an alternative plan. The terminal attractor dynamics implicitly endows the generated trajectory with human-like smoothness and this computational framework is characterized by a feature that is crucial for complex motion patterns in humanoid robots, such as bimanual coordination or interference avoidance: precise control of the reaching time.</jats:p>"

Given the failure rate of information technology projects in general (25%), successfully launching a new telemedicine or e-health system can be a daunting prospect–especially for organizations without experience with these new technologies. This chapter provides examples of important aspects of pre-project planning that can help set the stage for success in implementing new telemedicine and e-health applications; importantly, the lessons provided in this chapter are provided by discussing both systems that have achieved success and others that have faced significant difficulties. Key points discussed include: the benefits of involving important stakeholders and users in the planning process, effectively contracting with external technology vendors, and successfully managing expectations. Improved pre-project planning can contribute substantially to the eventual project outcome, so this is a step that cannot be overlooked.</jats:p>"

TRM allows program mangers to pinpoint potential failure modes of a project early in the process, so that corrective actions can be taken in the most effective manner. TRM also allows managers to appropriately prioritize program tasks so as to achieve optimum use of available technical resources. TRM requires that a methodology of practices and processes be implemented on an ongoing basis. These processes identify, evaluate, mitigate, and manage technical risks affecting program success. This chapter will discuss implementation of the TRM process and provide a simple example to show how the process works.</jats:p>"

Precedence constraints restrict the sequence in which a Dubins’ vehicle visits the given set of targets by imposing a partial ordering on the sequence in which the targets must be visited. This problem arises in applications involving fixed wing, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) where the vehicles have fuel and motion constraints. A fixed wing UAV may be modeled as a Dubins’ vehicle that can travel at a constant speed and has an upper bound on its turning rate. This is a difficult problem because it couples the combinatorial problem of optimally visiting a set of targets with the path planning problem of finding the shortest path that satisfies the motion constraints given the sequence in which the targets must be visited. In this paper, the sequence in which the targets must be visited is obtained by solving the combinatorial problem using a split dual algorithm. Using this sequence, the path planning problem is solved using Dynamic Programming. Computational results are given to corroborate the performance of the algorithms.</jats:p>",

This omits to structurally address the practical application of environmental legislation. Strong environmental groups which could contribute to the effective application of EC environmental law, lack; this feature makes the environmental sector different from most other economic or social sectors, where strong interests—professional bodies, trade unions, competitors, trade and industry associations, farmers' associations—promote the defense of their respective interests. All the more is the environment dependent on the commitment of the civil society to preserve and protect it. The contribution examines the instrument of the environmental complaint in EU law and criticizes the Commission's attempt to stop using the complaint system as a tool to assess practical application of EC environmental law in the Member States, though it is almost the only one existing.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The field of development studies has produced a number of institutional ethnographies in recent years that evaluate the internal workings of development agencies such as the World Bank or grassroots social organizations. Although within the social sciences research on conservation often emphasizes the power of international conservation institutions, there have been few comparable studies assessing the internal workings of these organizations. In addition, less is known about the specific activities of national and provincial conservation agencies operating in the Global South. Ethnographies of these institutions are also needed in order to examine how conservation is variously understood and executed by organizations within different contexts. This paper presents an institutional ethnography of the Mpumalanga Parks Board, which is the chief conservation agency operating in Mpumalanga Province, South Africa. Following the 1994 democratic elections, the Mpumalanga Parks Board pursued a neoliberal commercialized conservation mandate that reflected the position of natural resource management in relation to other national priorities. This paper traces out the construction of the commercialization discourse in order to understand the internal and external factors that produced it while assessing its implications for nature preservation. Although the commercialization drive emulated a general trend towards neoliberal decentralization in the Global South, I argue that its particular manifestations were deeply embedded in South Africa's particular spatial economy and history of racial segregation. In tracing out the commercialization discourse from within the conservation agency itself, this paper assists in an understanding of how neoliberalism shapes natural resource management and can become hegemonic at the expense of other possibilities. </jats:p>",

It is focused empirically upon people who often have been written out of ‘belonging’, precisely through land and landscape. The examples presented are not intended simply to unmask the ideological undergirdings of land and landscape but, rather, to raise the possibilities for an oppositional politics of belonging in which land and landscape figure as the practical stage upon and through which citizenship and community can be practiced. The conclusions are directed toward grounding concerns for belonging-as-social-justice, which, in these cases, is an incremental achievement, eked out of daily existence, and largely-but not always-in response to dominant social, political, economic, and cultural practice.</jats:p>",

This paper offers a sympathetic critique of such ‘ontologisation’ of practice, asking what is presumed about the human and the social when practice is taken as the primary social ‘thing’. The critique works by outlining, somewhat tentatively, a ‘phenomenology’ of dreamless sleep; a situation and a state in which a subject cannot be said to be doing anything at all. The figures that will be discussed below lie flat out; for the moment they have no bearing or gait, no focused or dispersed attention, no reflexive, deliberative or tacit understanding. This discussion is developed through a reading of Tim Ingold's (2000) landmark essay “The temporality of the landscape” (in The Perception of the Environment Routledge), here taken as exemplary of a broad range of practice based approaches. While looking specifically at issues around skill, place, and sociality, the overarching claim of the paper is that thinking about sleep and about being a being which sleeps provides a way of touching on the susceptibility and finitude of corporeal existence. A susceptibility and a finitude which, I suggest, are the very condition of possibility of practice and action. </jats:p>",

It shows that neoliberal discourses and techniques do not always emerge in the sites we assume, travel in the forms we expect, or move in the directions we anticipate. By analysing Moore's understanding of relationships between the global economy and nation-states, the reforms he made to WTO processes following the ‘Battle of Seattle’, and the implications these reforms had for broader conceptions of global spaces and subjects, the paper contributes to a conceptual argument that neoliberalism can be usefully understood as an assemblage which comes together in much more disjunctive ways than is often recognised, and that it should be theorised and researched as such. </jats:p>",

Evolutionary strategies are employed to determine optimal paths for their robustness and ability to solve complex problems. However, current evolutionary approaches fail to consider varying terrain conditions when determining an optimal path and offer only path planning without trajectory planning. This chapter presents an approach that determines a near optimal path while incorporating trajectory planning in the solution. Fuzzy linguistic variables are used represent the inherent imprecision and uncertainty in the terrain conditions presented to the robot. Most importantly, the method is computationally efficient and robust, providing real-time response and the ability to operate in a dynamic environment.</jats:p>"

Today most of the nurses traditionally document patient information in a medical record using pen and paper. Most nursing administrators not currently involved with computer applications in their settings are interested in exploring whether technology could help them with the day-to-day and long &amp;ndash; range tasks of planning and evaluating nursing services. The results of this investigation showed that respondents (nurses), as specialists and nursing informatics, make their activity well: they had &amp;ldquo;positive&amp;rdquo; attitude towards computers and &amp;ldquo;good&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; computer skills. The nurses overall computer attitude did influence by the age of the nurses, by sex, by professional qualification. Younger nurses acquire informatics skills while in nursing school and are more accepting of computer advancements. The knowledge about computer among nurses who don't have any training in computers' significantly differs, who have training and using the computer once a week or everyday. In the health care services often are using the computers and the automated data systems, data for the statistical information (visit information, patient information) and billing information. In nursing field often automated data systems are using for statistical information, billing information, information about the vaccination, patient assessment and patient classification.</jats:p>"

This principle states that our image of matter should be multiplied, so that it can be attended to as taking place with the properties and capacities of any element or state. We elaborate this principle through three substantive discussions of materiality as turbulent, as interrogative, and as excessive. In doing so we draw upon, in turn, forms of relational materialism associated with actor-network theory, the postphenomenologies of Lingis, the animate or enchanted materialism developed by Bennett, and the figurative and affective (im)materialities of Deleuze. The conclusion clarifies why we do not call for geography to be ‘rematerialised’. </jats:p>",

The author focuses on the importance of adopting modern techniques and stresses that technology should not be viewed just as a growing trend.

Using an Alternating-direction implicit method, the Pennes bioheat transfer equation is solved for microwave and ultrasound hyperthermia applicators for a range of parameters, including the applicator power, treatment time, and coolant parameters. Thermal coagulation contours are developed by evaluating the temperature-history data against the thermal-damage data obtained in ex-vivo experiments for prostate tissue slices and cells. Treatment protocols are proposed for treatment planning purposes and developing an optimal hyperthermia applicator that can coagulate the target tissue effectively, without destroying the surrounding healthy tissue.</jats:p>",

For them, the transition to a new work environment and the adoptionand utilization of a software process implies a number of problems, commonly including necessary human and organizational resistance to the ensuing cultural change. This chapter provides IT organizations and professionals with insights into the most important key success factors that may promote the entire process of organizational change. We investigate the effect of various human factors on the adoption and diffusion of an object-oriented software development process. Some of the human factors include motivation, leadership, resistance to culture change, and willingness and readiness to change. In addition, this chapter explores the significant role of these factors in controlling the entire process of implementing an OO process in practice, emphasizing the significance of planning and managing these “soft” factors to achieve clear advantages and gain enviable results.</jats:p>"

This paper will present new developments that aim to improve both the planning and delivery of this important cancer treatment technique. Specifically, this work develops a new direct delivery parameter optimization approach for planning of solid compensator intensity modulated radiation therapy, coined Direct Compensator Profile Optimization (DCPO). In order to understand the benefits and implications of this new DCPO approach, a reasonable understanding of the field of radiation therapy is needed. Therefore, this document will include a brief discussion of the history and relevant background information in the area of radiation therapy. It is intended that this background information is detailed enough so that the remainder of this research can be followed by those without existing experience in the field of radiation treatment planning. The specific details of this new approach will be then be presented followed by a display of initial results to verify the performance.</jats:p>",

The microscope tip has to go back and forth in a raster scanning motion over a substrate carrying the sample at slow rate to get enough accurate image of the sample. Many algorithms are designed to solve such problem by steering the tip along the surface of the sample. In the present work, a control algorithm is designed to steer the tip along the desired sample surface only. The scanning process is carried out simply, rabidly, and acquiring high resolution. The proposed algorithm depends only on the data coming from the vertical sensing device. The algorithm is tested for different samples and it is found to be ideal in imaging string-like objects, such as carbon nanotubes, nanowires, and DNA strands. The algorithm performance is accurate, reliable, and resolution is now a controlled parameter.</jats:p>",

Unique features of these devices include their mobility, personalization, and location-awareness. These features play a very significant role in enabling a novel class of emerging applications that take advantage of recent advances in pervasive computing. The paradigm of pervasive computing environment was first introduced by Mark Weiser in the early 1990s who postulated the anytime anyplace availability of computing and information services that are enabled by miniature devices and sensors seamlessly and unobtrusively embedded in the surrounding environment. Although this vision has not been realized in its literal sense, today mobile and smart phones are commonly viewed as an enabler of a human interface to the surrounding computing and information environment. As an application area where many principles of pervasive computing have been successfully implemented, mobile commerce has reaped significant benefits from the recent scientific and technological advances. This chapter discusses a number of pervasive computing principles and illustrates how they have been implemented in mobile commerce applications. The chapter also presents some new trends in developing context aware m-commerce services that tap into the power of Web 2.0 services and digital communities.</jats:p>"

This chapter refers to the technology driven aspects of globalization as “techno-globalization” and describes the role of strategic technology planning in the marketing of cities in this global economy. It describes strategic technology planning for information and communication technologies and its intersection with marketing planning. It is intended to guide managers through the technology planning aspects of ICTs and city marketing. In addition to providing practical guidelines for preparing a technology plan that supports the organization’s strategic and marketing objectives, the chapter explains many of the nuances of the preparation and alignment of organizational strategic plans using current information systems and organizational theory concepts.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Human geography critiques of GIS are operationalized under a unique interpretation of ontology and epistemology. Internal to poststructuralism, this metaphysics collapses the traditional separation between ontology and epistemology, reducing ontological questions to epistemological constructs. Although critiques have moved beyond an initial fixation upon positivism, critical/cultural assessments of GIS tendered within the last ten years continue to motivate epistemology as a basis for its deconstruction. The epistemological reductionism of such a reading of the technology inappropriately abstracts GIS from its ontic basis in computing, giving rise to a fundamental ‘disconnect’ of poststructuralist metaphysics to the technology. This disconnect is identified in terms of (1) the epistemic fallacy, which, underwritten by (2) an ‘undoing’ of the metaphysics of presence, culminates in (3) an effective ‘deontologization’ of an immediately ontic entity. This does not negate the poststructuralist critique of GIS, but it necessitates that critical engagements of the technology accord a material ontological ground to the objects of critique. </jats:p>",

The method generates target trajectories that are either asymptotically stable or result in a stable limit cycle. The former case is used to implement formation control. Coordination is guaranteed in the latter case due to the nature of limit cycles where non-crossing independent paths are automatically generated from different starting positions that smoothly converge to closed orbits. The use of position feedback in the trajectory generation allows for simultaneous determination of a stable tracking control law and consideration of constraints and system limitations. The tracking control law presented in this work is based on sliding mode control which is suitable for real-time implementation. It is also robust to modeling uncertainties and disturbances normally encountered in autonomous operations. A system of robotic manipulators and a group of autonomous vehicles are used as examples to demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of the proposed method.</jats:p>",

In particular, the paper argues that it is possible to think of different ways of raising the spectre of space which are as plausible as the account provided by Sloterdijk's spatial philosophy/philosophy of space. Navigating by the compass of classical Chinese civilisation, I proceed to sketch out a different diagnosis from that of Sloterdijk of how space is being materialised in contemporary Euro-American cultures. Drawing on logographic traditions of writing the world, I argue that, rather than describing what is now being produced by capitalism and other actors as a warehoused world full of lost souls, it is possible to think of different means of describing how the future is being scripted. </jats:p>",

We then present a collaboration process for incident response planning that was designed using Collaboration Engineering principles, followed by a discussion of the application process in three cases.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As everyday activities are increasingly carried out at least in part through digitally mediated remote interaction, researchers interested in the complex relationships between urban activities, spaces, and travel are running up against the limits of familiar forms of time geography. This paper argues that because information and communication technologies (ICTs) are loosening the traditionally close links between activity, place, and time, physicalist models such as the space–time path and prism of time geography may need to be reexamined in light of the new realities. An important part of these new realities is the fact that virtual communications depend on specific kinds of material means (computers and mobile phones, in particular). These now compete with and complement a fundamentally different kind of material means (of physical transportation) which have traditionally been at the basis of time-geographic analyses. The paper proposes a novel conceptual framework for time geography, whereby people's space–time behavior is modeled not just in a three-dimensional space but in a multidimensional space. The framework amounts to a primitive domain ontology for conceptualizing human activity in an ICT-rich world, and can naturally accommodate activity in cyberspace as well as in physical space. The objectives are: (1) to expand our ability to understand activities in space and time in the age of ICT by explicitly representing choices of means (here, transportation-related and communication-related means) to serve specific ends: to be most useful, this should be done within the same model that also tracks people's spatiotemporal trajectories; (2) more specifically, to improve our ability to represent and analyze the increasing variety of activities carried out with the help of ICT as these relate to time and place, and (3) to do so in a way that conserves the power of traditional time geography and is practical enough to be implemented. A few simple examples are discussed and illustrated with the help of parallel coordinates plots. </jats:p>",

All of these elements and more are utilized to collect data in a mostly automated fashion to subsequently correct and adjust undesired conditions that can affect part quality. Inspection process planning plays an essential part of CLM. As G&amp;M codes that contains low-level information or vendor-specific bespoke routines is the primary programming language, inspection process planning is mostly isolated from machining process planning. With the development of new data model standards such as STEP and STEP-NC providing high-level product information for the entire manufacturing chain, it is conceivable that both machining and inspection process planning are considered hand-in-hand to generate optimal machining and inspection sequences with real-time measurement feedback for the CLM scenario. This paper introduces an reactive process planning system architecture that incorporates machining, inspection, and feedback. In order to provide real-time inspection feedback, On-Machine Measurement (OMM) is chosen to carry out inspection operations. Implementation of the proposed architecture has been partially carried out with newly developed data model and interpreter. A case study testified the feasibility of the proposed architecture.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Impact Technologies developed a model-based decision support Framework that facilitates the use and development of decision support tools in a CBM environment. The Framework leverages existing CBM and PHM data to provide enhanced automated strategic analysis. Its modular structure promotes reusability of components to expedite development of new decision capabilities, making it extensible to many different operational environments. The Framework also embraces open architecture and standardized data interfaces for increased supportability and upgradeability. An advanced probability-based mission readiness forecasting and assessment tool developed by Impact Technologies for the U.S. Navy was used to illustrate how the proposed Framework facilitates the assembly of independent decision support tools to provide a high fidelity knowledge product. In this application the Framework combined three separate functional areas — a mission profile modeling tool, a system relational model, and a maintenance optimization module. The mission profile modeling tool provided the ability to create functional representations of multi-layered complex systems for any mode of operation, accounting for different machinery line-ups, redundancy, system-to-system interactions, and component and sub-system criticalities. The system relational model provided the overall system probability of failure calculated based on the current and projected system configuration and usage. The maintenance optimization module determined the safest and most cost-effective time to perform required and opportunistic maintenance. The resulting software product enables the comparison of multiple what-if scenarios where the scheduling of maintenance and logistics support activities can be optimized based on resource availability and the propagation effects of those actions can be measured in terms of readiness at any level within the system hierarchy. A visual assessment of the ship’s probability of completing the prescribed mission of any combination of ship operations (e.g., anti-surface warfare, non-combat operations, or mine warfare) can be generated so corrective actions in the form of maintenance or changes to mission operations can be evaluated. The tool incorporates several novel approaches including fusion of multiple independent low-level indicators to predict overall system readiness, methodologies to account for the interactive effects of interconnected subsystems, and a risk-based optimization to select and schedule the optimal maintenance schedule. This paper summarizes the features of the model-based decision support tool Framework and the mission readiness software application developed using this architecture.</jats:p>",

In Experiment 1, skilled soccer players performed a kicking task under four conditions: planning in terms of an external action effect (i.e., ball trajectory) or in terms of body movements, either with or without visual error feedback. When feedback was withheld, a ball focus resulted in more accurate outcomes than a body focus. When visual feedback was allowed, there was no difference between these two conditions. In Experiment 2, both skilled and novice soccer players were tested with the addition of a control condition and in the absence of visual feedback. For both groups there was evidence that a ball focus was more beneficial for performance than a body focus, particularly in terms of movement kinematics where correlations across the joints were generally higher for body rather than ball planning. Most skilled participants reported that ball planning felt more normal than body planning. These experiments provide some evidence that actions are planned in terms of their external action effects, supporting the common-coding hypothesis of action planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many organisations are currently dealing with long standing legacy issues in clean up, decommissioning and demolition projects. Industry is required to ensure that all bulk articles, substances and waste arisings are adequately characterised and assigned to the correct disposal routes in compliance with UK legislation and best practice. It is essential that data used to support waste sentencing is of the correct type, quality and quantity, and that it is appropriately assessed in order to support defensible, confident decisions that account for inherent uncertainties. AMEC has adopted the Data Quality Objectives (DQO) based methodology and the software package Visual Sample Plan (VSP) to provide a better, faster, and more cost effective approach to meeting regulatory and client requirements, whilst minimising the time spent gathering data and assessing the information. The DQO methodology is based on a scientific approach that requires clear objectives to be established from the outset of a project and that there is a demonstration of acceptability of the results. Through systematic planning, the team develops acceptance or performance criteria for the quality of the data collected and for the confidence in the final decision. The systematic planning process promotes communication between all departments and individuals involved in the decision-making process thus the planning phase gives an open and unambiguous method to support the decisions and enables the decision-makers (technical authorities on the materials of concern) to document all assumptions. The DQO process allows better planning, control and understanding of all the issues. All types of waste can be sentenced under one controllable system providing a more defensible position. This paper will explain that the DQO process consists of seven main steps that lead to a detailed Sampling and Analysis Plan (SAP). The process gives transparency to any assumptions made about the site or material being characterised and identifies individuals involved. The associated calculation effort is reduced using the statistically based sampling models produced with VSP. The first part of this paper explains the DQO based methodology and Visual Sample Plan and the second part shows how the DQO process has been applied in practice.</jats:p>",

The study assesses how forest management planning in  family forest holdings could be developed to tackle these challenges.  The approach introduces a new way of evaluating the effectiveness of  information- and communication-based policy instruments. Here, the  cultural-historical activity theory is applied in studying the  interwoven practices of present-day planning and the associated advisory  services targeted at landowners. The data, comprising semi-structured  in-depth interviews with 19 professional planners, were qualitatively  examined, and a forest management planning activity model was  constructed with the emphasis placed on the inherent contradictions of  planning work. As the main contradiction, the forest and the forest  owner compete as objects. The aims of making the forest productive and  advising the landowners towards an increased activeness motivate forest  management planning but the planners feel that they lack the opportunity  to respond to the needs of the landowner. A wood-production-emphasizing  interpretation of the benefits to the national economy frustrates the  policy goal of genuinely promoting the goals of multiple-use forestry.  The conclusion drawn is that the actors engaged in forest management  planning can reveal the needs for change by discussing their opinions  and practical innovations. This can be done with the aid of facilitation  by e.g. researchers oriented to developmental work study.</ja:p>"

Grid job scheduling, or selection of appropriate mappings between resources and the application, with the goal of leveraging available capacity and imposed requirements is thus at the heart of successful grid utilization. Grid job scheduling can be viewed as a function of resource heterogeneity, resource and application availability, and application options. This chapter presents work that incorporates all of these factors to provision and present individual users with alternative job options in terms of cost and time tradeoffs. Inherently, this leads to more effective scheduling policies. To support these aims, a framework is introduced with a novel scheduling methodology that introduces new user-scheduler interaction levels and a new layer of scheduling that includes application parameter selection and parameter value optimization.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter introduces the concept of technology management by objectives. Technology is one of the fastest moving elements in the 21st Century, which could be well explained using the growth theory. The growth theory is defined on the basis of the economic growth from the increasing returns that is associated with the new knowledge. The knowledge has various dimensions in today’s world, one of which is the technology. The major portion of any improvement or any development in any sector is due to technology or due to a change in technology. Technology in any organization can improve, sustain, and diminish the business based on the approaches used in the model. The ability to connect technology and gain organization advantage depends upon how efficiently and effectively the technology is managed within the organization. Technology has been managed by different means based on the application of the technology. This chapter would discus how the technology could be management by objectives (TBO). Many approaches have been utilized to integrate individual and team goal with the overall goals of the organization of an enterprise. Each group goal would have a set of objectives and satisfying all these objectives is virtually impossible because many of them contradict to each others. Technology by objectives is a process in which the common goals are identified and would define individually the major area of responsibility in terms of the results and objectives expected in detail. The goals would be jointly established by the administrators and the sub-ordinates and would emphasis on the output variables. Every corporation has different technological goals and visions, so based on the enterprise the goals and objectives are set.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many case examples in the mobile market have indicated that the success of mobile services (e.g. Internet browsing, email messaging or streaming video playback with mobile phones) is difficult to predict. Different factors serve either as drivers or bottlenecks in mobile service adoption. The present chapter has covered earlier research on mobile service adoption and utilized a newly developed handset-based mobile end-user research platform in obtaining data from 548 Finnish panelists in 2006. The main research goal is to understand the process of mobile service adoption by extracting new kinds of data straight from handsets. In addition to descriptive results, a path analysis model is developed that explains mobile service adoption contingent on a given set of explanatory variables. The chapter finds that user intentions have a strong impact on consequent adoption of the service. What is more, perceived hedonic benefits from the service are the strongest factor driving user intentions to use the service. The perceived technical capability to use the service and the role of the surrounding social network explain little why early-adopter kind of independent users intend to use services. Interestingly multimedia services are strongly driven by newer more capable handsets and mobile Internet browsing benefits significantly from block or flat-rate (instead of usage-based) pricing plans for transmitted data. The chapter develops several indices that measure time-varying characteristics of mobile services. Calculated indices for a set of mobile services in 2006 suggest that different mobile services are currently experiencing different phases in their life cycle.</jats:p>"

The CMG+ grouping methodology is a case mix tool produced by the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) to analyze the acute-care inpatient population in Canada. CMG+ methodology can be applied, for example, to utilization management. The expected length of stay (ELOS) indicator can be used as a benchmark for assessing the length-of-stay distribution of various subgroups of patient activity. It can also be used to compute potentially conservable days and to identify those patient subgroups where gains in efficiency may be realized. We describe CMG+ utilization management using this and other examples.</jats:p>"

The situation in which urban planning in Serbia has found itself in has been analyzed. In the circumstances of the undeveloped fundamental institutions of the democratic and market-oriented society, the lack of the necessary rationality and simulation of the basic models of planning is perceived in the planning practice in Serbia. The request to explore aspects of a wider reform agenda of planning practice has been highlighted. The transformation of planning comprises a fundamental reorganization of the institutions, development of the analytical framework, change in the planning approach, i.e. the change of the planning culture. The basic position in the paper is that those changes can be realized only by building and pinpointing the system in which planning is performed, namely by defining the institutions of the socio-economic framework: the market, the private ownership and its protection, as well as the rule of law.</jats:p>"

In Eastern German cities processes of shrinkage cause declines of urban densities with particular relevance for the provision of public utilities. Therefore, it is necessary to define spans of minimum densities from the perspective of public utilities for different urban structural types. Criteria to determine adequate densities for public utilities are compared against those deriving from other fields of planning such as transport, social facilities, green space provision and housing demand.</jats:p>"

An important component of this is making sure technology offers its intended users the functionality they require in a manner appropriate to how they want to achieve their goals. This chapter presents an area of science, human factors, with particular relevance to developing and deploying business mobile systems that are fit for purpose. The value of human factors is discussed, before moving onto some general guidelines to ensure that a mobile technology is suitable for its users. Finally, each system, each application, and each user should be taken on their own merits. To achieve this, it is critical to take an approach that puts users at the heart of requirements, build and deployment of a new technology or service. This approach is presented as a three-stage model of context analysis, specification and design, and evaluation.</jats:p>"

However, there were indications which seemed to suggest that Member States make very little use of their powers to lay down or maintain more stringent national standards. The general question to be dealt with in this paper is whether Member States actually use their power to lay down or maintain more stringent environmental standards after European harmonization. Based upon the papers and discussion at the meeting of the Avosetta Group of European Environmental Lawyers in Monção (Portugal), 6 and 7th February 2009, this paper aims to paint an impressionist picture of the contemporary practice of gold plating (or not) in the Member States.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Seoul had to be constructed as the national capital in the absence of continuity in its represented past, consequent on the attempted total obliteration of Korean identity by the Japanese colonialist regime and subsequent wartime destruction. Its ‘monuments’ are virtually empty of cultural referencing; even the National Assembly is a ‘painted shed’; new cultural production is overwhelmingly either pastiche or electronic; political activity slips from the Third Estate of popular democracy to an emerging Fifth Estate of the Internet and the weblog. While print capitalism may have been a necessary enabling condition for the rise of nationalism in Europe, the Americas, and beyond, as Anderson asserts, in Korea's case we may have the paradox of the weakly defined nation slipping away, into a wider imagined community, even as the dream of Korean distinctiveness cuts ever deeper. </jats:p>",

To gain an insight into the processes that occur during a design and assembly task, two time and motion study methods called therbligs and chronocyclegraphs have been utilised in both virtual tools to carry out the investigation. In addition, a brief investigation has been carried out to examine the time savings of using the virtual tools in comparison with the traditional manual method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the near future, several radio access technologies will coexist in Beyond 3G mobile networks (B3G) and they will be eventually transformed into one seamless global communication infrastructure. Selfmanaging systems (i.e. those that self-configure, self-protect, self-heal and self-optimize) are the solution to tackle the high complexity inherent to these networks. In this context, this chapter proposes a system for automated fault management in the Radio Access Network (RAN) of wireless systems. The chapter presents some basic definitions and describes how fault management is performed in current mobile communication networks. Some methods proposed for auto-diagnosis, which is the most complex task in fault management, are also discussed in this chapter. The presented systems incorporate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to identify the cause of the network malfunction.</jats:p>"

Isis is designed to display any DICOM/PACS compatible three-dimensional image data for visualization and interaction in an immersive environment. Pseudo-coloring can be applied in real time, with multiple interactive clipping planes to slice into the volume for an interior view, and the windowing feature controls the tissue density ranges to display. Features such as virtual trocars placement, tumor inspection, and an endoscopic view provides surgeons with essential tools for surgical planning. A wireless gamepad controller and an intuitive menu interface allow the user to interact with the software. By wearing a pair of stereo glasses, the surgeon is immersed within the model, providing a sense of realism as if the surgeon is “inside” the patient.</jats:p>",

Much has been written about causes of project failure and many have provided best practices and critical success factors for effective management projects, yet projects still continue to fail. As a first step to overcome systemic causes of project failure we propose a unified definition of software quality assurance (SQA).

In this chapter, the authors discuss how a Wiki was used to facilitate project management in a large system implementation for a decentralized organization. Further, they show how it continues to add value to the organization after the project’s completion, supporting operational management activities while at the same time providing a platform for fostering and promoting innovation. They introduce important implementation considerations for deploying a Wiki in your organization, in addition to sharing observations from our own implementation that saw both successes and failures.</jats:p>"

These services demand hard guarantees in term of the service availability, experienced Quality of Service (QoS) and robustness. Moreover, to be able to reach customers on a large scale, most of these services should be deployed with an Inter-domain scope. In order to meet QoS requirements of these services in an interdomain context, several issues should be solved. This chapter focuses on two issues: provider-to-provider agreements and enhancements to inter-domain routing protocol to convey QoS-related information. A concept called Meta-QoS-Class is introduced together with an enriched version of Border Gateway Protocol. This chapter provides a framework suitable for the promotion of QoS-enabled services with an inter-domain scope: the Parallel Internet. This concept is a viable way for the management of IP resources so as to deliver end-to-end QoS-enabled services.</jats:p>"

The proposed model takes 3D mesh of the blood vessel as input. It first fits a generalized cylinder to extract the blood vessel's medial axis. Then, it uses rotation minimizing frame as a reference to model and measure the torsion of blood vessel after deformation. In general, the proposed approach can incorporate any kind of deformation algorithms. In our experiments, differential geometry method is used as an example. The test results show that our algorithm can correctly and effectively evaluate the amount of torsion caused by blood vessel deformation. In addition, it can also determine the configuration of the blood vessel with minimum torsion.</jats:p>"

This paper responds to recent calls from geographers to move to finer scales of analysis that enrich our understanding about the geographies of welfare state restructuring and neoliberalism. Our response is based on case-study research of NGOs that provide social services to migrants in Minneapolis-St Paul, USA, and Toronto, Canada. We draw on the concept of ‘translation’ to show the agency of NGOs in articulating macroscale programmes of governance into concrete regulations that govern the conduct of everyday life. The case studies demonstrate the usefulness of seeing NGOs as translation mechanisms to current debates about the role of NGOs amidst welfare state restructuring and the rise of neoliberalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we want to open up for discussion what counts as ‘biopolitics’—a term frequently used by critics and devotees alike to describe the organization of political power and authority in a world after Bretton Woods, the Cold War, and 9/11. We do so on two fronts. On the one hand, we contrast Foucault on war and the normalizing society, Agamben on thanatopolitics, and Hardt and Negri on biopotenza. Our goal here is to draw attention to multiple competing definitions of biopolitics, and in so doing problematize the term as a catchall category to describe either the ‘nonsovereign’ or the ‘postsovereign’ operation of power. On the other hand, while refusing some baseline definition of what counts as biopolitics, we develop our own specifically geographical criticisms of Agamben and Hardt and Negri on the topic of biopolitics. Following Sparke's recent interrogation of postfoundational thought on account of its oftentimes buried metaphysics of geopresence, we submit that Agamben as well as Hardt and Negri deploy biopolitics in both metaphysical and metageographical ways. We contrast this with Foucault's inductive, genealogical, and time-specific and place-specific use of the concept. </jats:p>",

Unlike logically devised software codes and performance tested hardware components, human responses can be unpredictable when faced with the combined stressors of technological and organizational change, which occur when management dictates a technological upgrade. As such, the human interface is a dynamic system component that has the ability to degrade or disable system performance in ways unlike other subsystems. This leads to the idea that integrating employee preparation and participation into the design process from concept development through system deployment improves technology adoption and thereby overall system performance and acceptance of the technological enhancements. An analysis of peer-reviewed literature combined with the author’s industrial experience provides a ten-step process for converting an existing manual system to an automated or computerized version with emphasis on integrating the human element.</jats:p>"

In recent years, three dimensional (3D) computer graphics (CG) were used as visualization tools of environment because it has the ability to accurately simulate the changes caused by a proposed plan. In particular, virtual reality (VR), which enables to walk through in a modeled park or in a visualized forest, was considered as the advanced technique of landscape visualization. In this study, we developed a landscape visualization system with graphic user interface, which we named VR-Terrain (GUI version), to generate the virtual reality image easily by using VRML (Virtual Reality Modeling Language) and plant modeling techniques. In order to test the feasibility of the landscape visualization system, we applied the system to Ichinoe Urban Design Plan. Ichinoe is located at Edogawa Ward, Tokyo. There is a Sakaikawa Shinsui Park with water space surrounded by large amount of green. In the case study, we simulated the landscape of Sakaikawa Shinsui Park with about 200 plants and 300 buildings. We used the images simulated by VR-Terrain to explain the concept (such as building height limit) to the residents in the public meetings. It took about 30 hours to make the 3D model of the town. After ten minutes of training, anybody can walk through in the simulated town freely. The results showed that the VR image by the system helped the public understanding of the concept of the urban plan.</jats:p>"

Embracing recent developments in tourist studies, I seek to move from understanding tourism as a series of predetermined, linear, and static stages through which we pass to be a tourist. In doing so, I explore the ways in which visuals, in particular photography and subsequent visualities, enliven tourists' becoming through a multiplicity of fluid and dynamic performances, practices, and processes. I suggest photography is not merely an empty practice, but, rather, lights up the tourist experience. The emerging dynamics of visual practice renegotiate new understandings between tourists and place to establish a series of conceptual moments that outline photography as: political artefacts, reflexive performances, the imagination of space, embodied visualities, and ethical prompts. Such conceptualisations and practices of tourist photography are by no means arbitrary, but are situated in a framework of visuality that highlights key moments of anticipation, rewriting, and remembrance and reliving. Thus, I move beyond notions of the hermeneutic cycle of travel, and present photographs and photography as complex performative spaces that extend beyond divisible boundaries of the before, during, and after travel experiences and infiltrate the entire tourist experience. </jats:p>",

If they can be encouraged to purchase environmentally friendly products and services instead of conventional ones with the same functions, they can save energy, natural resources and water, reduce harmful emissions and hazardous substances, generate less waste, improve health and stimulate behavioural change towards sustainable consumption and production. In this way, public authorities will be promoting modes of production that are more environmentally friendly and stimulate the supply of green goods and services. Politically GPP has been widely recognised as a powerful voluntary instrument in most of the Member States. At EU level European Commission sets a target that, by 2010, 50% of all tendering procedures should be green, where green means compliant with endorsed common core GPP criteria. Also, GPP guidance tools have been developed, together with common criteria for 10 priority product groups, and translated into all EU languages. However, in order to make GPP a standard practice of procurement procedure, more needs to be done to develop further common GPP criteria, and to train procurement officials, and possibly to establish a product database at EU level.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Within this theoretical frame, industrial landscapes are given short shrift. I seek to redress this by taking the example of Victorian and Edwardian Dundee and exploring the construction of a specific manufacturing space by the city's industrial elite. Moreover, this paper moves beyond traditional analyses to take a specifically gendered look at this process. I argue that, while women numerically dominated Dundee's jute industry, it was men as jute-company directors who laid claim to place through their role in image making. The paper starts by looking at the processes of building and elaborating industrial space and power through an investigation of the fabric of the city. It then explores how such materiality was accompanied by and represented in a range of industrial imagery. Unpacking this landscape—pointing to the construction and subversion of gendered binaries and the recursive relationship between the material and immaterial—helps us see how industrial elites fashioned and reaffirmed their identity and power through the mobilisation of a set of representational tactics, creating a particularly gendered manufacturing (of) space. </jats:p>",

We introduce an architecture containing a service composer that uses AI planning to compose services in AmI environments. The composer can be seen as an enhanced meta planner that uses service technologies. It makes use of three strategies for selecting planners and a heuristic to cancel planners. This design is based on extensive experimental evaluation in which we analyzed the behavior of planners.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The ontological status of historic buildings has until recently been little explored, particularly in relation to their conservation. This is curious, for the assumed status and existence of buildings have critical impacts upon our attempts to conserve them. Conventional conservation thought has conceived buildings as solid objects constructed under the gaze of a single architect and retaining exemplar properties worth preserving. This paper offers an alternative and novel conceptualisation of buildings in time and space, drawing on the naturalistic ontology of Jubien and combining this with actor-network theory to explore how buildings might be conceived as multiple things with variant but persisting properties (some of which may be worthy of conservation). Using the moment of post-1945 reconstruction, we explore conservation of the architecture and spaces of Exeter (UK) to consider three objects, their nature, persistence, properties, and formation. Doing so reveals the multiplicity of material and social objects that may become entwined in attempts to conserve these buildings. Things such as ‘views’ become reconsidered as multiply constructed, with variant nonessential parts. The paper concludes that conservation practice requires a more heterogeneous understanding of these objects, how they are formed, and the potential for their social and material hybridity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">A Halifax Harbour Plan is being developed within the context of the 25-year Regional Municipal Planning Strategy in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia. This strategy recognizes the importance of climate change and the need for a precautionary approach to minimize\nnegative impacts of rising sea level. Airborne LiDAR data were acquired in 2007 to produce a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) as a basis for mapping flood limits. The selection of flood levels for adaptation planning required an understanding of present and future sea-level rise (SLR),\nvertical land motion, extreme water levels (combined tide and surge), harbour seiche and wave runup. Relative sea level in Halifax Harbour has risen at 3.2±0.13 mm/a since 1920 through a combination of regional subsidence (1.6±0.3 mm/a) and local SLR (~1.6 mm/a). Scenarios of future\nextreme water levels were developed using (1) current local SLR, (2) the upper limit of the 2007 IPCC projections, and (3) a higher projection based on a growing scientific consensus that the IPCC upper limit may have been overly conservative. These projections of SLR (0.16, 0.59, and 1.3 m over\n~100 years) were combined with regional subsidence and extreme water levels for 2-, 10-, and 50-year events derived from a generalized extreme values distribution of annual extreme water levels in Halifax Harbour. The resulting water levels were applied to the LiDAR DEM to visualise the extent\nand depth of flooding for each event. A plausible upper limit with very low probability was developed by superimposing the record storm surge on the highest tide with a sea-level rise of 1.3 m. A buffer ranging from 1 to 2 m was considered to account for observed values of seiche and wave runup in\nvarious parts of the harbour. This study provides the scientific basis for a set of plausible scenarios for a 100-year planning horizon, but the choice of water level for planning purposes is a policy decision.</jats:p>"

While these technologies have made precision agriculture possible, there are still major obstacles which must be overcome to make this new technology accepted and usable. Most growers will not do image processing and development of prescription maps themselves but will rely upon commercial sources. There still remains the challenge of storage and retrieval of multi-megabytes of data files for each field, and this problem will only continue to grow year by year. This chapter will discuss the various wireless technologies which are currently being used on three proof-of-concept farms or areas in Mississippi, the various data/information intensive precision agriculture applications which use wireless local area networking and Internet access, and the next generation technologies which can immensely propel precision agriculture to widespread use in all of agriculture.</jats:p>"

Specifically, and contra some chief social-scientific accounts, we seek to acknowledge how ‘policy’ and ‘emotion’ were inseparable in this project. We suggest that policy and media discourses, and much extant research, regarding Sure Start have been characterised by a particular apprehension of what matters, which constitutes a particular assumption about how policy interventions, in ‘deprived’ neighbourhoods and elsewhere, should be evaluated. In marked contrast we propound qualitative data wherein users of the Sure Start Centre articulated how this facility mattered to them. Our aim is not simply to reiterate a twofold truism: policy is always emotional; emotions are latently political. Rather, we consider how, in the wake of this truism, more combinative, open-minded encounters between bodies of social-scientific endeavours conventionally labelled ‘policy relevant’ vis-à-vis ‘theoretical’ might yield more careful apprehensions of the emotion and affect in policy, and the politics of emotions and affects. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents results from an ongoing research project which aims at developing a numerical tool for route planning of container ships. The objective with the tool is to be able to schedule a route that causes minimum fatigue damage to a vessel before it leaves port. Therefore a new simple fatigue estimation model, only using encountered significant wave height, is proposed for predicting fatigue accumulation of a vessel during a voyage. The formulation of the model is developed based on narrow-band approximation. The significant response height hs, is shown to have a linear relationship with its encountered significant wave height Hs. The zero up-crossing response frequency fz, is represented as the corresponding encountered wave frequency and is expressed as a function of Hs. The capacity and accuracy of the model is illustrated by application on one container vessel’s fatigue damage accumulation, for different voyages, operating in the North Atlantic during 2008. For this vessel, all the necessary data needed in the fatigue model, and for verification of it, was obtained by measurements. The results from the proposed fatigue model are compared with the well-known and accurate rain-flow estimation. The conclusion is that the estimations made using the current fatigue model agree well with the rain-flow method for almost all of the voyages.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research in behavioural economics, as in economic geography, seeks to address fundamental questions about cognition, the status of human rationality, and social-cum-spatial structure in economic decision making. Critiques of the ‘strong’ model of economic rationality that underpins models of behaviour in orthodox economics by those working under the rubric of the former, such as Thaler and Sunstein, are gaining the attention of politicians and policy makers. Yet the ‘limits to rationality’ thesis nevertheless lacks a credible appreciation of the diversity of social life and the significance of context in framing behaviour. Economic geography, while taking seriously the issues of the coconstitution of culture and economy and the relational nature of economic decision making, has moved away from behaviouralism at a time when critical approaches are arguably more salient than ever. I put forward the argument for an engagement with behavioural economic approaches to decision making while critically examining the need for multimethod approach that can accommodate quantitative, statistical, and experimental approaches and qualitative work that takes seriously social identity and attributes including gender, age, social class, and aspirations. The challenge of theorising the social context in which choices are made is discussed with reference to Bourdieu's notion of habitus, and three exemplars are used to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of different methodological approaches. Herbert Simon's metaphor, which conceptualises the decision-making moment as a pair of scissors, is suggested as a way of thinking about the intersection between cognition and the decision-making environment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper interrogates the reactions to three riotous events that occurred in 2004 and 2005 in neighbourhoods of Sydney, Australia. At Redfern and Cronulla, the riots appeared to be ‘race’ related, whereas the Macquarie Fields incidents represented an apparent ‘class war’. Parallels between Redfern and Macquarie Fields were also drawn because of the identification of similar circumstances of poverty and dispossession. By delving into the populist accounts of the three events and untangling their discursive threads, a different picture emerged. This paper unearths some of the strategies used to distinguish suburban Cronulla from the stigmatised Redfern and Macquarie Fields. I argue that this separation has served to reinforce the expectation that riotous activities remain the provenance of ‘ marginal’ (racialised, and/or classed) groups. Through a process of remembering—utilising my personal experiences of place—I found an entry point to challenge this understanding about riotous domains by reflecting on some of the underlying tensions and manifestations of wider historical geographies of a city, and a society. This paper traces the production of a societal fabric(ation) that has worked to reinforce and consolidate existing entitlements to urban space and amenity, which have led to violent turf protection in the past and present. </jats:p>",

By investigating 25 major IT projects and analysing the variables that influence project performance, the research has successfully developed, tested and refined a hypothesised risk-based management model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Witness testimonies provide a singular challenge to historians of Auschwitz. Survivor accounts offer a privileged perspective on the world of the camp, yet as recent conceptual work has shown the performative structure of these texts exceeds and eludes this representational duty. The challenge for historians is that, given their privileged, ‘insider’ status, any equivocality regarding the content of witness testimonies provides space for Holocaust denial. This paper offers a critical reading of one historical strategy for meeting this challenge: Exposing witness accounts to an uncompromising criteria of evidentiality and plausibility, designed to test their representational quality as a means of preempting negationist attempts to manipulate ‘faulty’ accounts. Drawing on Lyotard, I argue that, even as this strategy succeeds in refuting individual cases of denial, by refusing to enter into dialogue with the language game of testimony, and, more importantly, by invalidating any attempt to do so, this strategy actually reiterates the tactics of those deniers it is designed to oppose, thus undermining its own important work. Rather than rejecting this historical approach, I argue that it is compromised only by an historiographical insistence on imposing this ‘evidential’ language game as universal and representational; if we conversely recognise its performative, nonrepresentational status, it is more equipped to refute denial and without making of testimony a collateral damage. </jats:p>",

In October 2007 the City of Santa Ana released a draft Renaissance Plan to revitalize a transit-oriented district and government center supported by two neighborhoods. The plan exemplifies New Urbanist design principles which promote mixed income residential neighborhoods and respect local culture. Using a case study in two Mexican and working-class immigrant barrios and the adjacent downtown district, we investigate these principles. We describe different community-wide perspectives concerning ‘redevelopment’ and employ a textual analysis of the Renaissance Plan. One salient finding is that local planning codes reflect and support cultural and class beliefs that alienate Latino barrios. Another finding is that it is in the construction of a new science of form that the disciplinary gaze of New Urbanism reshapes places upon cultural-alien and class-alien norms. We conclude by suggesting research on the tensions between ethno-cultural-dominant city councils and ethno-cultural and economically marginalized neighborhoods while exploring how policy and discourse impact urban place. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the distinction between space and place cannot be abandoned or easily altered because it remains inextricably entangled with other key concepts. Drawing upon Derrida's notion of différance, we illustrate two such entanglements, the relation of space – place with nature and with economy. We argue that space – place helps to constitute, but in turn is constituted by, nature and economy. The larger point is that none of these metaphysical concepts are separate and independent, but are entwined in complex and changing forms, producing effects that demand critical scrutiny. </jats:p>",

A textual hermeneutic of the phenomenal insights reported by authors reveals instead that their personal geographies are characterized by rich, rewarding, and meaningful relationships with the wider more-than-human world, and that aspects of their lives can be undeniably, agreeably, ‘social’ in this broader sense. Such an analysis may offer important, albeit methodologically limited, insights into experiences of ASD while also challenging dominant understandings of ‘sociality’—in the sense of ‘being-with-others’—and of emotional involvement, that focus entirely on interactions between human beings. Indeed, to some extent, these emotionally charged experiences of the ‘natural’ world resonate with the feelings of many more neurotypical individuals. </jats:p>",

This non-linear class boundary line determines the heading of the robot for a collision-free path. Complex obstacles and maps have been created in the simulation environment of Player/Stage. The effectiveness of SVM for path planning on unknown tracks has been studied and the results have been presented.

The framework is comprised of five major components: consumer and intellectual property protection, market and resources access, and environmental protection. We argue that these encompass the interests of the stakeholders operating in mobile industry and given its dynamic and complex nature co-regulation is an effective approach that can be used to minimize costs and enhance compliance.</jats:p>"

These are examined in order to learn the influence that organisational structures exert on employees' willingness to exchange information and knowledge for the purpose of requirements engineering (RE). RE happens in multiprofessional settings, which requires that information and knowledge are exchanged, and be made understandable to other project members. Data indicate that departmental structures facilitate the development of dedicated knowledge and language sets. However, these sets of knowledge and language decrease options for direct communication across departments. Furthermore, the decision‐making and working modes in a dedicated department have an impact on employees' motivation to engage in the exchange of information and knowledge.

Firstly, it is argued that Sloterdijk proposes an important new interpretation of Heideggerian Gelassenheit for which I propose the English word ‘relief. The concept of relief rests on the substitution of ontological difference by what I propose to call ‘natal’ or ‘natural’ difference. Secondly, I will develop the significance of these concepts in relation to complexity theory and cybernetics, focusing on a key subject in the Sphären trilogy—insulation—and on a key subject in Sloterdijk's essays on Heidegger—homeotechnics. Thirdly, it will be shown how the concepts of relief and natal difference can be further developed into an ethico-aesthetic paradigm for experimentation with new technologies, based on a reinterpretation of the Gestell as total work of art. Finally, by relating Sloterdijk's work to that of Michel Serres, it will be demonstrated why, for Sloterdijk, this paradigm finds its exemplary modal in the spaceship. </jats:p>",

The focus of the paper is the angry and indignant resistance to the introduction of mandatory pool fencing in the Northern Territory in 2002–04. Adopting an attitude of ‘witnessing’ small and ordinary happenings, I explore the spontaneous outbursts of identity and belonging expressed by antifence residents of Darwin, with particular emphasis on their creative enactment of frontier tropes of freedom, vigilance, risk, and self-reliance in defence of unfenced pools. By exploring an apparently ordinary event I reflect on the unconscious, subtle, and pervasive reach of the frontier in shaping performances of belonging in the urban north.</jats:p>",

Subjects: Fifty acute stroke patients were systematically recruited for a retrospective patient record audit of staff compliance with clinical guideline recommendations related to discharge planning. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted over six months post-discharge on patients’ actual community support needs and experiences. Audit and patient experience data were integrated to seek evidence of 1) characteristics of patients receiving guideline-compliant care, 2) relationships between staff compliance with discharge planning recommendations and patient’s post-discharge experiences, and 3) whether patient’s post-discharge experiences of shortfalls in support related to hospital discharge planning. Results: Not all patients received guideline-based care. There was a trend that patients with more complex strokes received guideline-compliant care than other patients. Compliance with providing an occupational therapy (OT) home assessment was significantly related to discharge directly home from hospital. There was a shortfall with 40% of patients between community supports predicted by hospital staff and actual post-discharge support requirements. Community support requirements increased over time for 32% of patients, whose six-month post-discharge needs were actually greater than their needs at six weeks. Conclusions: Staff compliance with discharge planning recommendations was variable and did not always relate to improved post-discharge patient experiences. The post-discharge experiences of many stroke patients could not have been predicted whilst they were in hospital. Discharge planning and support systems thus need to be flexible and responsive to short and long-term needs.</jats:p>"

As key enablers of IP network connectivity, IP addresses are positioned today among the most important resources to be managed. Ready access and flawless handling of IP address usage, assignment, tracking and reallocation help in enhancing network reliability and security, while enabling more efficient network expansion and troubleshooting. Today, more than any time before, companies are realizing the need to adopt and implement a comprehensive IP Address Management (IPAM) strategy. Such a strategy, backed by automated IPAM tools, will enable organizations to address the stringent requirements imposed by new converged technologies. This chapter turns the spotlight on the most important challenges in IPAM and attempts to address some of the solutions and best practices to tackle these challenges. The author’s views on future IPAM perspectives are discussed and some open research issues are pointed out. The paper underlines the need for organizations to adopt proven IPAM best practices and deploy good automated IPAM tools. This will put them in a better position to expand and leverage their existing networks, while optimizing their IP address space in a secured and controlled fashion.</jats:p>"

The focus is on government agricultural and rural policies which contribute to the maintenance or enhancement of the multifunctional characteristics of agriculture and other land uses. We suggest that, despite differences in views of the importance of farming and rural areas, a convergence is appearing between Australia and European countries in the development of policies aimed at the promotion of multiple outcomes from agriculture. </jats:p>",

Due to the convergence of IT and telecommunications, an ever-growing onslaught of emerging technologies and new entrants with new business models are starting to eat up the incumbent’s revenues, profits, and market shares. The theory of disruptive technology (Christensen, 1997; Christensen &amp; Raynor, 2003) helps managers, policy-makers and analysts to analyze emerging technologies, new business models, and new entrants in order to be prepared in advance, providing appropriate ways to react in a timely fashion to innovation- based opportunities or threats. In this chapter the theory of disruptive technology, the concept of disruptive potential and a method for applying this concept in a telecommunications planning and technology management context is presented. Finally, some examples of potential disruptive technologies in telecommunication which were analyzed ex ante are introduced with specific emphasis placed on the WLAN-technology.</jats:p>"

Not surprisingly, both sets were similar and for ease of use they were merged into one shorter set of twelve criteria. These are useful in informing the design of programs or assessing whether existing programs are capable of affecting behaviour. The key claim in this paper is the importance of understanding both the theory and the local community at the design phase of any program. Good planning of behaviour change programs enables graceful interventions, the magic of co-learning and the power of adaptation.</jats:p><jats:p>The authors acknowledge the work and support of the City of Sydney in undertaking this project.</jats:p>"

This chapter employs the PVV view about the justifiability of constraints to explore several aspects of pandemic planning that have been less discussed to date. It argues that the use of models must be sensitive to both the risks of too much constraint and to the possibility that there is a mismatch between what models predict and what may actually occur. Too few plans have built in careful mechanisms for reconsideration as pandemic conditions develop. Plans should devote more attention to social distancing—which considers people as vectors—but in so doing should also attend to their plight as victims. It is argued that too few plans have devoted sufficient attention to such matters as the delivery of food, essential medical supplies, or palliative care for those who may become isolated under stay-at-home and home quarantine strategies for pandemic management.</jats:p>",

In the case of such projects the budget and time frame are determinated by the effort being spent on activities needed to deliver product, which would meet client's requirements. Objective and reliable effort estimation still appears to be a great challenge to the software engineering. In the author's opinion the main reason of that problem is effort estimation on the basis of resources, while such planning activity should ground on the required software product size, which determines work effort. But using suitable methods for software size estimation will not be sufficient as long as it does not take into account benchmarking data concerning similar projects having been completed in the past. This paper is aimed at indicating the important role of using reliable benchmarking data in order to obtain valuable effort estimates for software development and enhancement projects, including particularly the attempt to analyse usefulness of benchmarking data of general character.</jats:p>"

Drawing on intensity, as a way of coming to know the qualitative experiential dimension of affect as diminished or heightened, I explore some of the complex relationships between intensity, desirability, and intentionality that cohere around pained bodies. In contrast to transient pain, chronic pain is presented as an undesirable affective intensity that has no recourse to intentionality and meaning but territorialises the body in ways that prevent other intensities from taking hold. Through an encounter with a pain-management programme, I explore a number of strategies for deterritorialising the chronically pained body in order to open it up to more desirable intensities. I argue that ultimately it is the progressive vulnerability and openness that deterritorialisation promises that is the key to becoming otherwise. </jats:p>",

Their cosmopolitan attitudes and behaviours arise from both survival strategies and a taste for cultural goods, thus challenging the elite–working-class divide in current cosmopolitanism literature. Through semistructured interviews and participant photographs of twenty-four East European construction workers who have arrived in London since the European Union expansion in May 2004, I illustrate how these ‘new’ European citizens develop varying degrees and multitudes of cosmopolitanisms in everyday places such as building sites and shared houses. These cosmopolitanisms are shaped by their transnational histories, nationalistic sentiments, and access to social and cultural capital in specific localised contexts. Thus subjective perceptions of gendered, ethnic, and racial notions of ‘others’ that are carried across national boundaries are reinforced or challenged as their encounters with ‘others’ produce perceptions of marginalisation or empowerment in these places. Finally, I suggest that cosmopolitanism should be understood not simply through class but rather also through access to power and capital in everyday localised contexts. </jats:p>",

MVNOs have gained popularity in the Western markets, but have a dismal track record in non-Western regions. In comparing the different regions, this study analyzes how the MVNO market has changed and what opportunities and/or threats network operators and potential MVNO entrants are likely to face. This study conducts an economic assessment of market structure and environment for different countries’ MVNO penetration. The data on market structure is analyzed by means of cluster/factor analysis techniques in order to group countries according to their market environments. Then, regression equation analysis is used to investigate the relations of MVNO penetration and independent variables. The results show that MVNO penetration significantly relates to market structure and performance. These results also imply an appropriate policy to promote MVNO diffusion.</jats:p>"

I analyse the main approaches used for this purpose and consider their underlying rationale. I argue that there is some justification for developing more specialised activities and sources of differential advantage that other cities cannot reproduce. However, many cities appear to be pursuing the same policy formula comprising one or more of the following elements: nascent industries, high-level occupations, signature buildings, and consumer identities. I discuss the limitations of each of these. I conclude with some constructive suggestions for what cities might do to develop more original and distinctive advantages. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the politics of contemporary encampment within the UK with reference to the positioning of asylum seekers as a group subjected to a biopolitical logic of ‘compassionate repression’. The paper opens by examining the utility of presentations of the asylum seeker as an exemplar of Agamben's figure of the homo sacer. Drawing on recent critiques of the British government's apparent turn to a ‘deliberate policy of destitution’, I argue that through such acts of sovereign abandonment asylum seekers are relegated to a position reliant solely upon the ethical sensibilities of others. I then proceed to consider ways in which such a positioning ‘outside the law’ has been employed by asylum seekers and local campaigners to make ethical claims and demands upon the relational nature of the citizen as a figure of potential bare life. I then close by arguing that such an ethical gesture alone, of ‘assuming bare life’, is not enough and that the outright rejection of logics of distinction which Agamben suggests as a future politics offers little means to politically engage bare life beyond an irreconcilable ethic of the unconditionally hospitable. Opposed to this, I suggest the need to (re)engage with political theories which draw the political as always already an ethical practice in itself. Here, I examine the UK's involvement in the UNHCR Gateway Protection Programme, as an example of a conditional, and imperfect, act of hospitality, one grounded in distinction, yet one which holds both the risks of ethical practice and the possibility of political alteration at its heart. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the relationship between modernisation, consumption, and society, challenging received ideas about the distinction between ‘modern’ and ‘premodern’ geographies of food consumption. While conventional accounts posit a historical progression from premodern to modern forms of consumption, associated with the rise of the supermarket and the demise of the corner store, we argue that such distinctions may, in fact, refer less to a historical process of transition than to a contrast between different forms of contemporary sociality, experienced simultaneously in different sites of consumption. By drawing critically on the work of Augé and his contrast between places and nonplaces, these ideas are then put to work empirically in an examination of contemporary food shopping in Germany, focusing particularly on notions of consumer trust. A practice-based and ethnographically informed account of food shopping in Germany shows how distinctions between ‘traditional’ and ‘modern’ forms of consumption involve historicised accounts of contemporary consumption spaces and their associated socialities rather than referring to historical differences per se. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Globalization is expected to benefit developing country manufacturers through exposure to quality-demanding markets and global buyers. Yet, its contribution to the process of local upgrading depends on the ability of these manufacturers to have access to and learn from global transactions. Growing awareness of the exclusion of smaller sized manufacturers from buyer-driven upgrading arrangements has led development scholars to document alternative strategies for global market insertion that are locally coordinated. But what happens when these alternative upgrading paths are themselves hindered by development-inhibiting relational dynamics at the local level? What options exist for unlocking entrenched social roles and practices in order to promote regional upgrading and with it the repositioning of an established manufacturing district? This paper explores this policy challenge within the context of a historic apparel-making district in West Central Mexico. It looks at the innovative steps taken by development practitioners to promote relational deepening between established manufacturing elites and their traditional subcontractors and, in turn, to encourage joint upgrading as a regional strategy for new market access. </jats:p>",

However, ROs are based on the concept to delay investment for collecting more information and learning more about business conditions and during this delay another competitor may act gaining significant competition advantage. In addition, RO models are strictly quantitative and very often telecommunications investments may contain qualitative factors, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms. In addition, ROs analysis results in some factors that can be treated more efficiently when taken qualitatively.

Using spatial data from 1990 and 2000 and a geographical information system, the present study examined the degrees and spatial variations of accessibility disparity between commuting by car and public transit as well as the temporal changes in this disparity in the metropolitan areas of Boston and San Francisco. In both metropolitan areas there was a considerable disparity in job accessibility in a comparison between users of cars and public transit, which turned out to differ substantially by location. Between 1990 and 2000 regional levels of this accessibility disparity lessened in the two metropolitan areas, but the temporal changes in the accessibility disparity varied considerably among different locations within the metropolitan areas. The accessibility disparity decreased in the majority of central areas and in a number of suburban zones near rail stations, whereas the accessibility disparity increased in a number of suburban zones near major highways. Improving accessibility for public transit, relative to that for cars, should be a key strategy for redressing auto-orientation urban spatial structure, an important objective of sustainable development. </jats:p>",

There are some research and development efforts in this area. Based on the review of the methods used for paint path planning and simulation, the paper concludes that: the tessellated CAD model formats have many advantages in paint path planning and paint deposition simulation. However, the tessellated CAD model formats lack edge and connection information. Hence, it may not be suitable for some applications requiring edge following, such as welding. For the spray gun model, more complicated models, such as 2D models, should be used for both path planning and paint distribution simulation. Paint path generation methods should be able to generate a paint path for complex automotive parts without assumptions, such as presupposing a part with a continuous surface.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>The paper makes possible automated path generation for spray‐painting process using industrial robots such that the path‐planning time can be reduced, the product quality improved, etc.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>The paper provides a useful review of current paint path‐planning methodologies based on the CAD models of parts.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We introduce the HAO* algorithm, a generalization of the AO* algorithm that performs search in a hybrid state space that is modeled using both discrete and continuous state variables, where the continuous variables represent monotonic resources.  Like other heuristic search algorithms, HAO* leverages knowledge of the start state and an admissible heuristic to focus computational effort on those parts of the state space that could be reached from the start state by following an optimal policy.  We show that this approach is especially effective when resource constraints limit how much of the state space is reachable.  Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in the domain that motivates our research: automated planning for planetary exploration rovers.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Social life in Japan has been historically orientated towards hierarchical networks of social integration starting in the family home and extending to the neighborhood, company, and nation. In the postwar period, households and life courses were largely fixed, mediated by company society, a standard breadwinner family model and an ascent up an owner-occupied housing ladder. The bursting of the economic bubble two decades ago, and the subsequent ‘lost decade’, disrupted established flows into employment, family life, and owner-occupation. We examine recent restructuring of life courses around the home which has become characteristic of social changes and a medium of individualization. The home, once ingrained with notions of the eternal Japanese family, has become a conduit of atomization for younger generations who have experienced radical shifts in social and economic conditions. Since the 1990s numbers of single-only and couple-only households have ballooned while marriage and fertility rates have declined. Although homeownership norms have persisted, new patterns of renting and single living in the city, or remaining in the family home as a ‘parasite single’, are increasing. We consider how the reconstitution of ‘home’ under more insecure housing and employment conditions is embedded with the reshaping of life courses, housing pathways, and patterns of urban space and living. </jats:p>",

The paper shows that the essential elements of urban form are outcomes of real estate markets. The focus of the research is to examine the economic sustainability constraints to the adaptation of the existing urban form via housing market development viability. To address the task a number of econometric models are linked together to estimate spatial patterns of viability in five cities. The results demonstrate a substantial difference between cities that can be attributed not to urban form per se but to socioeconomic factors. This demonstrates that in practice it is impossible to divorce the physical structure of cities from their economic and social structure. Viability is also influenced strongly by public policy through the location of social housing. The research suggests that a driving force/constraint for development viability is the level of neighbourhood house prices. Large swathes of negative viability are found even without accounting for the additional costs of brownfield development, suggesting that there are major constraints to the reconfiguration of housing markets in some cities in a piecemeal way. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The goal of any product is to be used. In a very real sense, people judge the success or failure of any product by the extent to which it is used by intended users in their daily practice. Understanding a product from the perspective of the end-user is one of the most important and often overlooked keys to the success of any project. Many products suffer from a lack of widespread utilization because developers and managers often have a deterministic view of the relationship between technology and users. This deterministic view leads to an over reliance on technical specifications as the driving force in the end users’ decision to adopt and use a product. However, a wide variety of human, organizational, social, and cultural factors also affect the acceptance and use of any product. Any organization, even those in the most highly technical and advanced fields, is, in reality, a dynamic example of a sociotechnical system in which people and machines interact, negotiate usage, compete for primacy, and generally co-exist. This chapter will provide a broad theoretical overview of the critical role that end-users play in the adoption, implementation, utilization, and institutionalization of any technology. A number of relevant theories will be discussed, including diffusion theory (e.g., Rogers, 1995), technological determinism (e.g., Ellul, 1967), sociotechnical systems (e.g., Volti, 2006), and utopian and dystopian philosophical perspectives (e.g., Rubin, 1996). In addition to a theoretical overview, this chapter will provide practical recommendations for developers and managers who wish to increase the utilization of their products by bringing the user into the development process. The practical recommendations will include a discussion of Ely’s (1999) conditions that facilitate the implementation of innovations. These conditions include developing a sense of dissatisfaction with the status quo, providing sufficient time to become familiar with a new technology, and generating meaningful commitment to the project by upper level managers. Also included in the practical recommendations will be a brief discussion of various organizational components that enable the introduction of innovations (Surry, Ensminger, &amp; Haab, 2005). These components include the development and maintenance of an adequate infrastructure of supporting technologies, an emphasis on shared decision making, and ongoing support systems. Other recommendations to be discussed in this chapter will be derived from rapid prototyping models of development (e.g., Tripp &amp; Bichelmeyer, 1990) and recent surveys of user-centered design methods.</jats:p>"

Based on field research in rural China, where cultural heritage has become a central resource in economic development, the paper argues that cultural development cannot be relied upon to produce spaces of resistance, empowerment, or ‘sustainability’. This is, in part, because cultural development tends to conceive of cultural spaces as ‘rooted’ rather than as spaces of translocality. While third space offers an attractive alternative to such a conceptualization, it remains vulnerable to the same alienating spatial abstractions as found in the practices of cultural development. The paper seeks to maintain the critical focus of third space while redefining it in more prosaic terms to better reflect the everyday governmentalized spaces of culture within which people live. </jats:p>",

Historically, policy tended to sacrifice dynamic efficiency for the sake of competitive prices and static efficiency. In the last few decades, economists and other researchers have begun to document the large welfare costs of ignoring dynamic efficiency. We analyze the theoretical impact regulation has on innovation. We then turn to the empirical evidence that regulation dampens firms’ incentive to innovate in the telecommunications industry in general and the market for broadband Internet access in particular. Both product and process (cost reducing) innovation are discussed. The chapter forms a compendium of available research on the intersection of telecommunications regulation and innovation. We conclude with lessons the literature provides to policy makers and a discussion of future regulatory trends.</jats:p>"

The exploration process is composed of several stages. In the first stage a number of proposals are generated beginning with the analysis of users’ expectations, best practices and technology developments. In the next stage prototypes for selected proposals are implemented. Only the most viable prototypes are then further developed to maturity, providing a reliable service. This chapter is based on the experience gathered by our team over a period of 18 months. During this period six prototypes have been developed, three of which have been further developed to full maturity. The introduction of a voice over IP service for all the university members illustrates the exploration process.</jats:p>"

Efficient management and utilization of geographically different networks (such as wide area networks, metro networks, and access networks) present different optimization problems dealing with the placement of special optical equipment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1986, the Internet has developed into a global network enabling users worldwide to connect to each other to exchange information and data. The initial zero settlement peering arrangements, however, have now largely been replaced by commercial transit arrangements, as backbone providers seek to recoup their network infrastructure investments and generate commercial profits. This is a key cause of the issues and debates that have emerged between developed and developing countries about international Internet interconnection services (IIS). This study focuses on current interconnection settlement arrangement models that disfavor ISPs and end-users in the Asia-Pacific region. After reviewing the Internet market and digital divide in the region, the chapter summarizes the main current IIS issues between the Asia- Pacific and Western regions into three categories of concern: inequity, anticompetitive practices and the threat of the “balkanization” of the Internet. Practical recommendations to resolve these issues and improve the Asia-Pacific IIS market are discussed from regional and international perspectives.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Protest movements offer a rich vernacular for investigating how the connections between social justice and creating political subjects always involve spatial transformations. In this paper, I put Jacques Derrida's contemplations regarding justice as incalculable in conversation with critiques of public witnessing and the role of empathy for catalyzing political action, and I do so to present some speculations over why a social justice movement in northern Mexico has weakened domestically as it has gained steam internationally. The movement has grown since 1993 in response to the violence against women and girls and the surrounding impunity that has made northern Mexico famous as a place of ‘femicide’. By examining these events in relation to the debates on calculating justice and on the politics of witnessing, I hope to add to the growing literature within and beyond geography on the interplay of emotion and social justice politics while illustrating what is at stake in these dynamics for Mexico's democracy and for women's participation in it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Water has played a key role in the development of the Australian inland and the nation. For European colonists, the dry and variable landscape challenged ideas about nature imported from northern temperate regions. I argue first, that colonists brought with them ideas for ordering nature and tools for transforming landscapes that led to inappropriate and destructive water management and the silencing of local voices and knowledge systems. Secondly, colonial patterns of ordering and transforming landscapes are ongoing, but new ways of governing water, which challenge colonialism, are emerging. In the first section of the paper I discuss colonial relationships with water; in particular the methods of irrigation, river diversion, and bore drilling. In the second section I consider contemporary manifestations of colonial relationships between humans and water, focusing on the bureaucratic separation of land and water, the problematic definition of a river, and the ongoing desire to drought-proof the inland. In the third section I examine emerging ways of governing Australian water, which emphasise knowledge and interconnection, and in so doing challenge ongoing colonial relationships. I describe these two ways of governing water as existing in tension; a tension between engineering-based and knowledge-based approaches to water governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of the paper is to tackle the question of what the European territory will look like over the next fifteen years by providing quali–quantitative territorial scenarios for an enlarged Europe, under different assumptions about the future direction in which the driving forces affecting development will move. Based on an econometric model, called MASST, two scenarios are built on the bases of alternative strategies put in place by the EU 15, the New 12, and the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) countries, on which alternative behavioural patterns in the driving forces of change depend. The scenarios presented are not policy scenarios: a more general approach is chosen, and more general issues of external competitiveness and global confrontation are emphasised and placed in the forefront of reflection, in an endeavour to define, through the use of the MASST simulation model, their likely impact on territorial trends, regional convergence, and general economic performance. Major determinants of territorial trends are attributed to the competitive game between the three above-mentioned blocks of countries. The model is able to provide the simulations for twenty-seven countries (the ‘Old 15’ EU members and the ‘New 12’ Eastern EU members) and for their 259 regions of GDP and population in 2015 in the two scenarios. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In opposition to the Vietnam war, the US-based group Another Mother for Peace (AMP) coined the compellingly simple slogan, ‘War is not healthy for children and other living things’. I analyze the changing ways in which these women connected health and war. They transformed the imagined geography of where war is not healthy from the fields of Vietnam to include their own backyards. In this way they reworked Cold War strictures of motherhood and challenged the sturdy fiction that war is about real men protecting vulnerable women and children. Nonetheless, by failing to examine social hierarchies among different groups of mothers and children, they obscured differential vulnerabilities to premature death domestically. Because AMP did not adequately confront the privileging of white domesticity that structured national security discourses, I argue that it unwittingly reproduced the racial–gender common sense for war. I draw upon intersectional analyses to situate discourses of health within the racial–gendered constructions of home and nation. These works allow me both to question the apparent neutrality of ‘health’ and to examine the limitations of not recognizing ‘the home’ as a space of whiteness in US white women's antiwar activism. </jats:p>",

The data collected by adequately trained inspectors are gathered in a Data Base and are automatically analyzed by the system using a number of mathematical models. These models have been developed by DIMS with the following objectives: calculating the reliability and the risk associated with each bridge, evaluating the evolution in time of the condition state, simulating long-term scenarios for infrastructure development by critically comparing alternative Maintenance, Repair and Reconstruction (MR&amp;amp;R) strategies. This paper illustrates the prioritization model implemented in the APT BMS, based on the concept of total risk.

In particular, this paper explores the organ-izational and legal activities of the American Kennel Club (AKC) to highlight the importance of form in their political engagements and to illustrate some of the unintended consequences these activities produce. Although the AKC attempts to instantiate its own vision of the ideal dog, the organization is incapable of solidifying the character of the domestic dog, for it must contend with other groups (animal welfare groups, dogfighters, governmental agencies, and dogs themselves) which have different visions of the ideal dog. To accentuate and counteract these failings, formlessness is utilized here as a tool and as a normative ethic to reconsider the nature of human–nonhuman relations. Dogs are an ideal subject for such an investigation because they exist in many different forms that are themselves susceptible to considerable change. Yet the specific findings described here should be applicable to a wide range of natural phenomena since the interplay between form and formlessness is generally pervasive throughout the world. </jats:p>",

It argues that, as Milan tries to become connected into the global flows of capital by ‘going up’ the city league, most Milanese are becoming disconnected from the democratic government of their city. As such, an excessive emphasis on connectivity and fluid conceptions of space risks losing sight of the particularities and uniqueness of places and the territorial nature of problems in cities today.

It is argued that they changed its management accounting system due to efficiency and institutional pressures from its constituencies following the liberalisation of the Portuguese and European Union telecommunications market. The replacement of Marconi’s “old” management cost accounting system by an ABC system popularised by the business mass media and consultants as a “progressive” management accounting tool, helped display expectations of dynamism and efficiency to important external institutions, such as regulators. Whilst it was used and welcomed by managers dealing with commercial matters, operational managers were more unconvinced and contributed to technical problems affecting its accuracy and operation. The divided reactions of the managers give support to both advocates of ABC and its critics who claim it is beset with problems of economic measurement, behavioural issues during implementation and operation, and questionable cost-benefit returns.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The aim of this paper is to show that insofar as it is possible to isolate a theory of space in Badiou's ontology it is incomplete and fragmented along at least three possible motifs: ruptured space, flat space, and dense space. From the presence of these motifs, I argue that the radical contingency Badiou seeks to give his concept of event is, in fact, closer to randomness. Randomness is predicted upon regulative patterns, however minimal they might be. This leads me to argue that there is a latent nonvitalist morphogenetic idea to the emergence of subjectivity in Badiou, which I call ‘formationism’: that is, an event-specific form is concomitant to the subject's naming of an event. This leads me to test Badiou's choice-based theory of subject against three other perspectives in the work of Jocelyn Benoist, Gilles Châtelet, and Jean Petitot. Finally, I contrast the concept of event with the reading Barbara Cassin gives in kairos, which submits ontology to an exclusionist charge. The upshot of this critique holds as much for an empowered reading of rhetoric against formal logic as it does for securing the contribution made by sophists to ontology. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>On November 1st 2008, a new ordinance came into force in Sweden. It extends the implementation of nuclear liability to all nuclear facilities and companies, regardless of size. The Government has authorized the Swedish Radiation Safety Authority (SSM) to issue further regulation as warranted and appropriate, and commissioned the same Authority to oversee the implementation. Consequently, SSM is presently conducting research in order to establish a basis for the implementation of the ordinance to smaller facilities and enterprises. The goal is to enable finance to be assured in an efficient manner so that any burden on the companies is as small as possible. Thus, “functional requirements” are identified, and used as a basis for various investigations. The aspects include technical and cost calculation prerequisites, as well as various domains of law: the environmental code, radiation and nuclear safety, financial reporting, and criminal law. It is found that the basis for the differentiation among the facility operators and owners should be the cost and the associated uncertainty. Thus, a cost calculation will have to be carried out by all. It should be based on available standards and guidance documents. It is found that this is a requirement that already exists elsewhere in the legislation, and thus no additional burden is imposed on the companies. It is found that segregated funds is the preferred option for long-term liabilities. Securities are suitable for short-term liabilities provided that the economy of the company in question is sound. Securities might also be used for long-term liabilities to cover uncertainty. It is proposed that a de minimis limit of at least kSEK 25 (about k€ 2, 4 and k$ 3, 4) is used. An important reason for this is that lower limits might be incompatible with the rules for financial reporting. It is also proposed that securities might be used also for long-term commitments if the total environmental liability does not exceed 1,00 MSEK (about k€ 96 and k$ 135). It is found that the “general advice” that must be used by smaller companies lacks proper instructions on how to account for environmental liability whilst at the same time it prohibits the use of e g the international reporting standards IFRS/IAS. It is also found that the “general advice” prohibits distribution of costs for research and development over time. This might be incompatible with a fund system where considerable research may be necessary at the early stages of the work and often many years before the actual decommissioning is to take place. The rules in the penal code require that an annual report presents an “essentially correct financial situation”. One of the interpretations to this statement is that a deviance of at most 30% might be tolerated. Although previous work has indicated that the error in cost estimates need not be higher than about 15%, even for research facilities, concealed cost raisers may from time to time lead to much larger errors, even when best practices are being used. It is therefore essential that decommissioning planning and cost predictions are made in accordance with state of the art, and that the estimating methods as well as the results are properly documented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the recent worldwide trend towards devolution has been driven by the belief that fiscal decentralisation is likely to have a positive effect on government efficiency and economic growth. It is generally assumed that the transfer of powers and resources to lower tiers of government allows for a better matching of public policies to local needs and thus for a better allocation of resources. These factors, in turn, are expected to lead to an improvement in regional economic performance, if subnational authorities shift resources from current to capital expenditures in search of a better response to local needs. In this paper we test these assumptions empirically by analysing the evolution of subnational expenditure categories and regional growth in Germany, India, Mexico, Spain, and the USA. We find that, contrary to expectations, decentralisation has coincided in the sample countries with a relative increase in current expenditures at the expense of capital expenditures, which has been associated with lower levels of economic growth in countries where devolution has been driven from above (India and Mexico), but not in Spain, where it has been driven from below. We hypothesise that the differences in legitimacy between the central or federal government and subnational governments in top-down and bottom-up processes of devolution may be at the origin of the diverse capacity to deliver greater allocative and productive efficiency and, eventually, greater economic growth by devolved governments. </jats:p>",

As more aggressive security tactics have been deployed, scholars have sought to understand the changing relationship between individual rights and the authority of sovereign states by drawing on Giorgio Agamben's insights into the state of exception. In this paper I argue that borderlands are a key site for investigating the connections between the state of exception and securitization processes because political borders are the symbolic markers of the limits of a sovereign's authority. I trace the securitization of the borderlands between India and Bangladesh and I describe the increasingly exceptional measures employed by Indian border security forces in order to prevent terrorist threats from entering India. At the intersection of the state of exception in the borderlands and the securitization narratives and practices of the global war on terror, Muslims in both India and Bangladesh are marginalized in the affairs of the state and targeted in state-sanctioned violence. I conclude that borderlands, as an explicitly spatial example of the state of exception, are a crucial site for locating and understanding the decision on the exception.</jats:p>",

Even if multiple scales are acknowledged in policy discourse and strategy, actual boundaries defining a policy's geography of interest have typically focused on the neighbourhood. The emergence of citywide or subregional regeneration initiatives, such as England's Housing Market Renewal pathfinder programme and Philadelphia's Neighborhood Transformation Initiative, have been accompanied by different considerations as to how space is negotiated and enrolled both in strategic and in delivery terms. Using these ‘market shaping’ initiatives as a basis for discussion, I seek to add to debates regarding the tensions tied up in fixing space from the practical perspective of programme implementation. While a partial defence of boundary setting is offered, the influence and impact of scale arising from the delimitation of space are seen as crucial factors in determining how complex initiatives sustain their rationale and deliver in practice. Exploring the challenges created by the disjuncture between the spaces of strategic thinking and the impact of those policies as experienced on the ground, the paper concludes by offering some perspectives as to why the neighbourhood retains a pervasive hold within regeneration policy as the point of mediation between the local and global. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Against the horizon of Earthly depletion and social exhaustion, miserly thinking is once again on the ascendancy, catching hold of critical and radical thought as well as the popular and conservative imagination. Whatever its ethicopolitical inflection, miserly thought enjoins one to conserve, constrain, and sustain. It is consumed by scarcity: specifically, the inability of the world to accommodate itself to the insatiable demands that are placed upon it. Faced with lack, miserly thought advances its ethic of restraint, the target of which is everything that would exceed the paucity of means placed at our world's disposal. Pitching itself against miserly thinking, the paper unfolds a form of thought animated by excession rather than immiseration, by a world given as excess rather than as privation. This is accomplished in four parts, the first of which dislodges the grip of miserly thinking by recourse to Georges Bataille's notion of general economy. The paper then considers arguably the best-known form of excessful thinking: Marxian political economy, as rendered by David Harvey. Nevertheless, while this successfully reveals how social formations are animated by surplus rather than by scarcity, its desire to restitute excess remains mired in miserly thinking. Consequently, the third part of the paper considers the fate of excess once it suffuses the whole of existence. With its ontology of association, Bruno Latour's actor-network theory has gone the furthest in this regard. However, this ontology runs aground upon an inconsistent excess held in reserve: plasma. The final part of the paper addresses the limitations of Latour's actor-network theory by way of Alain Badiou's ontology of subtraction. In the final analysis, the sequence of ‘lack’, ‘surplus’, and ‘association’ gives way to the constellation of ‘multiplicity’, ‘situation’, and ‘event’, which is illustrated with reference to the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. </jats:p>",

If the construction of these threats appears similar then so are the pleas for preemptive and precautionary action. In this paper we explore the ways in which terrorism and climate change are imagined, drawing on a conjoined history in which preemption and precaution are not easily separable. We then trace this through the knowledges, models, and ideas of risk that inform contemporary debates on these issues and suggest that these are caught between a desire for rationality and affective governance through catastrophic visions. Furthermore, we argue that these imaginations of an actionable future have political consequences that depoliticize and delegitimate debate and that potentially bring the unimaginable into being. Reconceiving precautionary politics is thus vital if we are to engage ethically with the world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> “Geometry in the colossal” ( Geometrie in Ungeheurem) appears as pages 47–72 of the second volume of Peter Sloterdijk's Sphären—the volume is entitled Globen, ‘Globes’. The excerpt is a beginning of the history of the idea of the sphere or the globe. As claimed by Heidegger in the epigraph, the conquest of the world as picture is the fundamental event of modernity. The historical question that arises, then, is that of the rise of the globe as the fundamental picture of the world. Sloterdijk begins with remarks on what he calls a “treatise on the metaphysics of roundness”, Nicholas of Cusa's De Ludo Globi, set in a discussion concerning the movement of the notion of the globe from the Greek to the Roman world. The second half of the excerpt is devoted to a more focused analysis of the composition, history, and significance of the Farnese Atlas. In this work we see the world portrayed as a “poetic - scientific bastard heaven, a product of geometry as much as of mythology”, borne upon the shoulders of a titan - philosopher - athlete, images at once ancient and modern. The conquest of the world as picture thus transforms Atlas's punishment into a symbol of the greatest earthly power. </jats:p>",

In the emerging global economy, e-business has increasingly become a necessary component of business strategy and a strong catalyst for economic development. In near future, vehicles may be equipped with short-range radios capable of communicating with other vehicles and highway infrastructure using a VANET.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The local exchange telephone market is no longer considered to be a natural monopoly as a result of technological advancements. In particular, the power, versatility, and adaptability of digital technology has enabled traditional telecommunications companies to transition their network architecture from one based on copper wires and circuit switches dedicated to the provision of high quality transmission of point-to-point voice signals to a multi-faceted, general network based on fiber optic cables and packet switches capable of providing an array of voice, data, and video services. A network layers model is introduced to conceptualize the process of convergence to the Internet model. Convergence is fundamentally changing the nature of what it means to be a telecommunications company and promises to alter the market structure of many voice, data, and video markets. Convergence has pitted wireline telecommunications companies in a fierce rivalry with cable companies for voice, data, and, increasingly, video services. More generally, this research provides a framework to explain the convergence of communications networks and identifies and analyzes key issues that confront public policymakers. One key competition issue, termed network neutrality, addresses the concern that the evolving broadband network architecture will enable network providers to favor the provider’s services or affiliated services at the expense of independent rivals.</jats:p>"

The model is used to predict the final hardness and the effect of process parameters on a metal matrix. A defined area is covered by H13-WC powder with three different deposition patterns: one-section, two-section, and three-section. The one-section pattern is the normal deposition pattern in which the deposition area is covered with zigzag patterns and in one step. In the two- and three-section patterns, the deposition area is divided to two and three sections, respectively, and is covered in two and three steps. The finite element model is used to determine the temperature history of the process used in the kinetic model to analyze the tempering effect of the heating and cooling cycles of the deposition process on the composite matrix. The results show that dividing the area under deposition into smaller areas can influence the phase transformation kinetics of the process and, consequently, change the final hardness of the metal matrix. The two-section pattern shows a higher average hardness than the one-section pattern, and the three-section pattern shows a fully hardened surface without significant tempered zones with low hardness. The simulation results are in very good agreement with the experimental ones.</jats:p>",

In particular, the active pursuit of indicted war criminals across the international borders of the former Yugoslavia has challenged the primacy of the state as the locus of judicial authority. Using the arrest of Radovan Karadžić as a starting point, this paper evaluates the emergence of the ICTY and its contribution to peace building in the former Yugoslavia. It suggests that the ICTY is challenging existing international interventions within Bosnia—in particular, the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement—whilst simultaneously producing new judicial spaces and encounters. The paper calls for an understanding of international justice not as an abstract condition or outcome, but as a process that is incomplete and situated in space. </jats:p>",

Although it seems intuitive that retirement planning leads to more positive retirement outcomes, limited longitudinal analysis has confirmed the directionality of this relationship or clarified its complexities. The Health and Retirement Study, a prospective survey of American workers and retirees from 1992 to the present, can help illuminate this relationship. Data signifying the preretirement activities of employed individuals from the 1992 wave were compared with their postretirement ratings of retirement satisfaction and subjective physical and emotional health in 2004. An ordinal regression analysis indicated that those who had discussed retirement with their spouses and had retirement superannuation or savings plans in 1992 reported greater well-being in 2004 (controlling for health status, the reason for retirement, and income in 1992). These results confirm the importance of preretirement preparation and provide a rationale for developing more comprehensive, theory-driven measures of retirement planning. </jats:p>",

The study was performed amongst the members of IPMA-The Netherlands during the summer of 2007. In the study the 46 competences of the International Competence Baseline 3 (ICB 3) were tested against the expectations of the respondents for the development of project management. Based on four scenarios for the future of Europe, the members indicated which of the competences are expected to become more important, equally important or less important than today. The aim of the study was to provide insight in the expected future development of the project management competences. This goal is relevant for both practitioners and educators.The conclusions are that the study shows indications that project management is developing from an ‘occupation’ into a true ”profession”. Part of this development is a broader orientation of the project manager in which especially the competences related to the relationship of the project with its environment grow strongly in importance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deterioration processes such as fatigue and corrosion are typically affecting offshore structures. To “control” this deterioration, inspection and maintenance activities are developed. Probabilistic methodologies represent an important tool to identify the suitable strategy to inspect and control the deterioration in structures such as offshore wind turbines (OWT). Besides these methods, the integration of condition monitoring information (CMI) can optimize the mitigation activities as an updating tool. In this paper, a framework for risk-based inspection and maintenance planning (RBI) is applied for OWT incorporating CMI, addressing this analysis to fatigue prone details in welded steel joints at jacket or tripod steel support structures for offshore wind turbines. The increase of turbulence in wind farms is taken into account by using a code-based turbulence model. Further, additional modes t integrate CMI in the RBI approach for optimal planning of inspection and maintenance. As part of the results, the life cycle reliabilities and inspection times are calculated, showing that earlier inspections are needed at in-wind farm sites. This is expected due to the wake turbulence increasing the wind load. With the integration of CMI by means Bayesian inference, a slightly change of first inspection times are coming up, influenced by the reduction of the uncertainty and harsher or milder external agents.</jats:p>",

We argue that, in order to meet the enhanced goals of waste reduction specified in Waste Strategy for England 2007, UK municipal waste policy needs a far closer engagement with the household, the primary unit of consumption. Opening-up the ‘black box’ of the household, we show why the potential for achieving enhanced rates of materials diversion through recycling is limited in certain neighbourhoods. We demonstrate the potential for furthering waste reduction through the intensification of existing practices with the ‘arts of transience’, and by engaging with the lumpiness of household-waste generation. The paper considers the policy implications of these findings and offers a number of suggestions as to how such insights might be taken up within UK municipal waste policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in automotive industry are faced with the conflicting goals of creating vehicles with higher reliability, increased feature content and quality while lowering model runs, reducing costs, and shorter developmental times. However, to achieve these goals is very difficult in a global product development environment that involves globally distributed OEMs and suppliers working on the components and subsystems of the same but a complex product like an automobile. This is especially true with regard to electronic systems in automotive industry due to the continued and significant increase in overall electrical content in a vehicle, and the historical short lifecycle of enabling technologies. For example, in the last three decades, electrical/electronics control has gone from 100% analog to primarily digital microprocessor based controls (Paras et al., 2004). As the level of integration occurs, automotive electronics are going to be challenged by software development and integration. As a result, it is going to increase overall product development time and cost. While it has been a growing concern for both academician and practitioners, the prior literature is still very limited in terms providing a clear or sufficiently structured framework to address the issues of global product development system. This chapter attempts to narrow down this gap by presenting a lean and global product development (GPD) framework and the necessary enablers to achieve this end. The framework is demonstrated through an automotive industry case study.</jats:p>"

Any changes to either application is immediately synced and updated to the other. This is an efficient collaboration tool that allows multiple teams of doctors with only an internet connection to visualize and interact with the same patient data simultaneously. With this multi-modal environment framework, one team working in the VR environment and another team from a remote location working on a desktop machine can both collaborate in the examination and discussion for procedures such as diagnosis, surgical planning, teaching and tele-mentoring.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> On 21 September 2006 UK über-entrepreneur and Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson pledged approximately £1.6 billion, the equivalent of all the profits from Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains for the next ten years, to fighting climate change. Since then, Branson has restated his commitment to action on global warming, including investment in technologies for sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this paper, I critically examine and engage with Branson's announcements as a specific entrée into a dialog about so-called ‘green capitalism’. I am particularly interested in the role of the entrepreneurial subject in environmental policy and environmental action. There are glaring problems associated with green capitalism as a mash-up of environmentalism with capitalism. One of these is the tethering of environmentalism to a political economy whose mantra is growth for growth's sake, or, in Marx's terms, accumulation for accumulation's sake. This has been discussed by some as the problem of capitalism's ecological metabolism or ‘metabolic rift’. Yet, while accumulation for accumulation's sake may well be anathema to progressive environmentalism and sustainability, I argue that this is not only an objective, quantitative problem but also one of the qualitative dimensions of produced nature and the cultural politics of environmentalism. Appreciation of this can be gleaned by reexamining Marx's discussion of the role of the bourgeois subject in the relentless drive to reproduce and expand capital accumulation via anarchic, entrepreneurial investment. Green capitalist orthodoxy relies on this source of innovative dynamism, but in the process obscures or overlooks the fact that accumulation for accumulation's sake is by definition guided by the anarchic and amoral search for profitable realization of surplus value. Moreover, in order for green capitalism to succeed, its legitimacy must be secured. I argue that this legitimacy derives in part from specific performances of green capitalism by entrepreneurial elites, also made evident by Branson and his commitments to climate action. All of this raises questions about the political, cultural, and ecological character of green capitalism, issues brought to the fore by Branson's brand of climate activism. </jats:p>",

Despite differences in research focus and approach, scholars agree that quality is the outcome of a contingent and so far underresearched process of negotiation that entails and determines relations of power in the food chain. To understand the nature and implications of the relationship between quality and power in the food sector, this paper focuses on the recent ‘quality revolution’ implemented in the school meals system in Rome. Based on the analysis of documentary material and qualitative data collected through formal and informal interviews, the paper examines the process through which city authorities have integrated different (and at times contrasting) quality conventions. The analysis shows that procurement policies such as those implemented in Rome have the power to create an ‘economy of quality’ that can deliver the economic, environmental, and social benefits of sustainable development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Serious games are suitable for learning. They are a good environment for improving the learning experience. As a key part of this setting, feedback becomes a useful support for decision making and can reinforce the learning process in order to achieve certain objectives. Destination feedback allows users to draw on strategies and improve skills. However, too much feedback can make the learner too dependant on external advice when taking the next action, resulting in a weaker strategy and a lower performance. In this chapter the authors introduce a conceptual approach to feedback in E-Learning with serious games; how useful or harmful it can be in a learning process. They describe a case study carried out with a simulation of an educational planning task. The authors studied the performance of 43 learners who had, or did not have, visual destination feedback in a problem solving task. They conclude that in this context, too much assistance can be counterproductive.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the spatial strategies used to achieve national integration in the formative years (1923–45) of the Turkish Republic. During this critical period, despite a severe shortage of human and material resources, Turkey's leaders undertook ambitious infrastructural projects, including the construction of roads, railroads, bridges, institutional buildings, and the implementation of uniform urban plans, which were meant to transform the face of the country. These projects generated webs of uniform and centralized services, which enabled the state to assume a more active role in shaping the daily life of its citizens. Crucially, they also forged a standard recognizable material culture throughout Turkey. I argue that this extensive tangible scaffolding of public works, which introduced new types of spaces and practices, reworked the rhythms and routines of daily life, and created new networks of accessibility across the country, was instrumental for cultivating people's ability to relate the local with a larger national geography, thus rendering the nation an imaginable community. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The UK Home Office and the US Transportation Security Administration have made substantial recent investment in new Backscatter X-ray scanners to screen bodies at securitised border checkpoints. Promising to make the invisible visualisable, these devices project an image of a naked body onto a screen to identify concealed ‘risk’. Contemporary security practices which seek to fix identity at the border through biometrics, datamining, and profiling—of which the ‘whole body scanner’ is part—have their genealogy in efforts in aesthetics and medical science to mine the body for certainties and reveal something of the unknown future. The scan is revealed as a simultaneous partitioning and projection, the body ‘digitally dissected’ into its component parts, from which a specific, securitised visualisation is shaped. Drawing on the entangled histories of ‘body knowledge’ in art, science, and anatomy—their techniques of abstraction and technologies of visualisation—we explore what light may be shed on the Backscatter scan and, more importantly, what ramifications this may have for a critical response. Challenges to the biometric border have tended to centre on surveillance, making appeals to privacy and bodily integrity. However, if border disclosures which ‘take apart’ the body are more precisely understood as visualisations, then there are more fundamental issues than recourse to rights of privacy can counteract. </jats:p>",

It begins with a discussion of writings translated into English in the late 1980s—the Critique of Cynical Reason and Thinker on Stage—but then shows how Sloterdijk's work has developed and changed over the last two decades. Particular attention is paid to his writings on Europe and politics; the three-volume book Sphären [Spheres]; and his most recent writings on globalisation. The suggestion is that with the extensive forthcoming programme of translations and renewed interest in his work the scene is set for an effective ‘second coming’ of Sloterdijk.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Model simulations of residential segregation have shown that even modest levels of social homophily (or wishing to live near residents with similar social characteristics) gives rise to distinct spatial patterns of residential segregation. However, this proposition has been contested where social homophily is modest. This paper contrasts two explanations for urban sociospatial patterns (socioeconomic and demographic spatial patterns) in a region where social homophily is modest-South East Queensland (SEQ). The research question is whether sociospatial patterns are better explained by social homophily or by structural homophily. In other words, are they better explained by residents wishing to live in neighborhoods with similar people (social homophily), or by residents with similar social characteristics finding similar neighborhood physical attributes important, and thus moving to neighborhoods with similar people (structural homophily). SEQ residents were asked how important various reasons were in choosing their neighborhood. The survey data were linked to neighborhood social characteristics from census data with the aid of geographic information systems. Six neighborhood social characteristics in SEQ were investigated. Social homophily explained a small, though statistically significant, level of spatial variation in socioeconomic and ethnic (non-Western) environments. However, it did not explain any variation in the other four neighborhood social characteristics which related to household structure: that is, younger nonnuclear household environments; nuclear family environments; and older nonnuclear household environments, or disadvantaged environments. Moreover, structural homophily explained much more variation than did social homophily in all six neighborhood social characteristics. In regions such as SEQ, spatial patterns can largely be explained by structural homophily. Thus, modest levels of social homophily are not necessarily important in explaining sociospatial patterning. </jats:p>",

While decentralisation offers hope for a more holistic, integrated and effective approach to environmental planning decisions and solutions, challenges remain to put these ideals into practice. The present paper focuses on a key component of this approach to environmental planning and decision-making – the integration of different types of knowledge used to inform planning goals and the design of water quality management programs. The analysis draws on knowledge integration issues surrounding the water quality improvement plan in the Tully–Murray basin in north-eastern Australia. Here, government and non-government stakeholders are coordinating efforts to assess water quality condition and set management priorities for improving the quality of water entering the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage coastal lagoon. Our analysis of the kinds of knowledge and mechanisms of translation involved highlights three main points. First, the tensions between the uncertainty and bias in different types of knowledge brought to the planning table. Second, the timing of knowledge contributions that affects if and how knowledge contributions can be debated and integrated. Finally, the challenges faced by local collaborative groups to broker the translation and integration of knowledge needed to inform strategic environmental decisions and programs.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores how the mobile body and, specifically, the face have become a site of observation, calculation, prediction, and action in the process of moving across borders. The paper explores how in the circulatory space of the airport/border, the body's circulatory systems, biological rhythms, and affective expressions have become objects of suspicion—mobile surfaces from which inner thoughts and potentially hostile intentions are scrunitized, read, and given threatening meaning by the newest modes of airport security and surveillance. Examined according to the vectoral modes of historicity and virtual possibility, as well as the internal and external play of intention and feeling, the paper uncovers an increased attention to differential axes of mobility—of past and future, surface and interior. The paper situates these techniques within the preemptive biopolitical securitisation of mobility across borders which, it is argued, has found its referent object in the primal realm of affective capacities. </jats:p>",

Instead it focuses on the spaces that images themselves produce. Drawing upon the technology of the screen as a contemporary site at which images are experienced, I argue for a dual conception of the ‘space’ of screened images: an existential space constructed through the background context of a user's relation with an image; and an ecological space constructed through the expressive relationship between body and screen. I use video games as an exemplar of these spaces to show how screened images reconfigure the relationship between touch and vision and how this alters users' spatial awareness of the world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper applies insights from actor-network theory to extend our understanding of the influence of evaluation techniques in decision making. Rather than assuming that evaluation is influential because of the intrinsic methodological veracity of the technique—that is, because it measures ‘the truth’ of our environmental predicament—it is more useful to view the adoption of evaluation tools in terms of their contested translation into decision-making settings. This is demonstrated by the growing use of the ‘ecological footprint’ (EF), which has been presented as a methodologically robust yet intuitive tool for guiding decisions. By following the use of the EF within a UK local government setting (Cardiff Council), one can see that its influence depended only partly on claims to technical credibility; it also depended upon an array of other institutional and personal commitments. The extent to which the EF was translated into policy settings reflected the way in which it had been institutionalised as an ‘obligatory passage point’ (after Latour) in decision-making arrangements, and careful representation of the implications of footprint measures. Overall, the credibility of the EF—as with other evaluation techniques—can be seen as a complex product of internal properties and institutional settings, but also of wider network-building activities which seek to cement the status of footprint calculations. </jats:p>",

Both public and private assessments have been used previously to study deadweigh, but so far little is known about how they correspond to each other. To address this issue we conducted a joint evaluation of the private and public assessments of deadweight for Finnish business projects. A unique dataset combines large register data with both public and private information on projects financed in 2000–03. First, our results suggest that the different measures for deadweight are greatly uncorrelated, and thus cannot be used as substitutes. Second, characteristics affecting the public and private measures of deadweight are identified using ordered probit models. We find that the public and private sectors emphasize different factors in their assessment of deadweight. Third, an upper bound for the level of deadweight spending is estimated at 73.8%. </jats:p>",

Second, we discuss the recent policy efforts at the European level toward the implementation of the technology. Third, we present an empirical investigation. Our results suggest that organizations become more likely to adopt as time goes by, and that the decision to adopt is mostly affected by size and availability of financial resources. Organizations can benefit from IP communications systems, because they offer cost savings and enhanced applications facilitating network management and on-line transactions. However, technical shortcomings, established habits and practices, and legacy network investments can inhibit adoption. This explains why firms are more likely to adopt as time passes and why small organizations are more inclined to adopt than larger ones.</jats:p>"

These data, however, must have very coarse geographic resolution in order to protect respondent anonymity. Thus the geographic scale of these microdata sources is drastically different from the scale of many spatial processes—particularly neighborhood-scale processes. It is suggested that this difference in geographic scales creates a problem of conclusion validity for regression models which use anonymized microdata: measures of statistical significance are biased in these models. A correction to this problem in which small area data and population-density maps are used to estimate the effects of spatial dependence is presented. Monte Carlo evidence is presented which demonstrates that the conclusion-validity problem may be severe in practice. Further, this evidence shows that the suggested correction with small area data restores conclusion validity to statistical tests. </jats:p>",

The author seeks to move beyond these divides by focusing on the production of urban space under different structural conditions in two Indian cities, Delhi and Ahmedabad. Using a Lefebvrian theoretical framework, the author examines existing literature to unpack the mutually constitutive political and spatial practices of informality. The segregated spaces thus produced can be linked to a politics of informality that includes not just everyday resistance and creeping encroachments to achieve gains, but also episodic moments of open protest, collective mobilization, and violence. In highlighting these impacts, production of space theories also open up the question of generating knowledge for new sites of resistance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most of the existing networks (e.g., telecommunications, industrial control, enterprise networks etc.) have been globally connected to open computer networks (Internet) in order to decentralize planning, management and controls in business. Most of these networks were originally designed without security considerations, thereby making them vulnerable to cyber attacks. This has given rise to the need for efficient and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) to secure existing networks. Existing IDSs and IPSs have five major limitations, which prevent them from securing networks absolutely. It has been proven that the right combination of security techniques always protects networks better. This approach used change in Hurst parameter and a signal processing application of wavelets (i.e., multi-resolution technique) to develop an IDS. The novelty of our proposed IDS technique presented in this chapter lies in its efficiency and ability to eliminate most of the limitations of existing IDSs and IPSs, thereby ensuring high level network protection.</jats:p>"

In this process, incident radiation, patterned by a dynamic mask, passes through a transparent substrate to cure photopolymer resin layers that grow progressively from the substrate surface. When compared to existing Stereolithography techniques, this technique eliminates the necessity of recoating, reducing process time and improving accuracy. A regression model is adopted in this process plan to accurately control the curing front on the substrate. An existing Mask Projection Micro-Stereolithography process planning method is extended to account for radiation transmission through the substrate.

The place where one lives is a reflection of one's position in society and therefore people may want to leave neighbourhoods with a poor reputation even if they are satisfied with their residential environment. Using data from a specifically designed survey in twenty-four Dutch neighbourhoods we tested the hypothesis that, in addition to neighbourhood satisfaction, perceived neighbourhood reputations are an important predictor of the intention to leave a neighbourhood. The results show that perceived neighbourhood reputation is indeed a significant predictor of moving intentions, even after controlling for neighbourhood satisfaction and neighbourhood attachment. This finding suggests that neighbourhood regeneration policy should focus not only on improving residents' neighbourhood satisfaction, but also on improving the perceived reputation of neighbourhoods. </jats:p>",

The former parameter grows with the demand, whereas the latter sinks if the demand is too high, as throughput may collapse. As the equipment price decreases with time, it may be interesting to wait rather than to invest immediately. We then propose and discuss two methods that help in making the decision. The first one is an actualization algorithm, where the upgrade should be performed when the loss of profit, derived analytically, exceeds the expected discount. The second is a real option-like strategy to hedge against the risk that the investment has to be anticipated. The evaluation of the investment date is then performed, in the latter, by a backward dynamic programming approach, using recent improvements based on least-squares estimations, whereas, in the former, a forward actualizing algorithm is investigated through simulations.</jats:p>"

On the one hand, pension-plan assets, which approached US$18 trillion in 2005 for OECD countries, are having global impacts on financial markets. On the other hand, pension-plan liabilities, larger than the assets in nominal terms, are also having dramatic impacts on plan sponsors. If assets are not properly managed, pension liabilities can threaten the financial solvency of plan sponsors. Consequently, owing to the enormous and growing financial and political importance of pension plans, I contend that the procedures governing these institutions are of increasing importance for economic geographers. In this paper the effectiveness of the current governance system is tested through a widely subscribed ‘expert survey’. Then, the relationship between pension-fund governance and economic geography is demonstrated through case study. I conclude that the current governance model remains inadequate. Moreover, poor pension-fund governance, in addition to having an economic cost, is shown to have tangible geographic impacts. </jats:p>",

Political justification for the expansion of privatised social insurance markets has frequently been couched in the language of responsibility. However, as the ‘credit crunch’ spectacularly attests and as studies of the dynamics of financialisation have succeeded in showing, financialised capitalism turns on excess. In this paper we explore some of the ways in which the reworking of long-term insurance or life assurance has contributed to the financialisation of everyday life. More particularly, we trace the emergence of what we call ‘lifestyle insurance’. Our purpose here is not only to begin to map the terrain and consider the consequences of this nascent modality of insurance in the UK, but in so doing to contribute to wider debates about the processes of subjectification that underwrite financialisation. In addition to pressing for a greater attention to be given to life assurance the paper suggests, by mobilising the figure of excess, three more areas to which studies of the financialisation of the everyday might productively attend: first, the financialisation of life itself; second, the ways in which financialisation is affectively charged; third, the spatial politics of financialisation. </jats:p>",

In the Sphären (Spheres) trilogy, Sloterdijk provides both a spatialised ontology of human existence and a historical thesis concerning the radical shifts in human conceptions of the space or sphere they inhabit. Essentially, Sloterdijk argues that global interconnectedness and increasing population and communication density have brought about a situation in which every human action is limited and inhibited by the proximity of others—a situation he describes using the metaphor of foam. In this context, are not all possibilities for constructive political action stifled from the very outset? I will argue that Bruno Latour's concept of cosmopolitics furnishes us with resources to respond to this collapse of political space. </jats:p>",

This pits the need to reduce elephant density and grazing pressure to prevent environmental damage against animal-welfare concerns about the killing of elephants. This complex debate is characterised by factual uncertainty and moral complexity. The procull storyline suggests that high elephant densities pose a risk to biodiversity. The anticull standpoint critiques this position as politically and economically motivated and lacking in adequate scientific support. Both procull and anticull positions draw on science as a source of authority, and on the precautionary principle as a framework for making decisions. They differ in their interpretation of the scientific evidence for serious impacts of high elephant densities, the relations between scientific, ethical, and economic arguments, and the way uncertainty and the idea of a precautionary approach are used. A decision to resume culling of elephants in South Africa was made in February 2008, but debate continues.</jats:p>",

A recent revision of The Norwegian Act Relating to Concession in the Acquisition of Real Property is designed to influence the relation between subjects (property owners) and objects (properties) through ceasing the obligation of residency and cultivation on certain properties, which in turn is intended to increase sales prices of the respective properties. Drawing upon empirical research conducted in four Norwegian local authority districts, we argue that responsibility for past, present, and future generations of family or kin is highly important in property enactment. Although relations between subjects and objects are powerful and inform policy actions, relations between social subjects might be just as influential and powerful. When enacting properties, people may live in more complicated worlds than is often assumed. We assert that further research in legal geography and the emerging field of ‘geographies of relatedness’ might profit from seeing kinship and property as coconstituted. </jats:p>",

Using the National Neighborhood Indicators Partnership as a framework, I critique the practices of using quantitative, spatial statistics to ‘democratize information’ within the feminist theoretical debates surrounding the production of knowledge, the use of quantitative methods, difference across gender, essentialism versus antiessentialism, and the discursive production of gender. In so doing, I demonstrate the importance of a feminist theoretical and practical perspective in informing the future development of urban neighborhood-level indicator systems. </jats:p>",

In response to these dangers, coastal evacuation may be ordered. This paper describes the development of a simulation model to analyze the movement of vehicles through I-65, a major US Interstate highway that runs north off the coastal City of Mobile, Alabama, towards the State of Tennessee, during a massive evacuation originated by a disastrous event such a hurricane. The constructed simulation platform consists of a primary and two secondary models. The primary model is based on the entry of vehicles from the 20 on-ramps to I-65. The two secondary models assist the primary model with related traffic events such as car breakdowns and accidents, traffic control measures, interarrival signaling, and unforeseen emergency incidents, among others. Statistical testing was performed on the data generated by the simulation model to indentify variation in relevant traffic variables affecting the timely flow of vehicles travelling north. The performed statistical analysis focused on the closing of alternative on-ramps throughout the Interstate.</jats:p>"

To generate physically feasible throwing motions in a fully predictive method without input reference, rigorous dynamic models are associated with the constraints. Given the target location and the object mass, the algorithm outputs the motion, required actuator torques, release parameters, balance criterion, and ground reaction forces.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper aims to address the oft-mentioned dearth of research on the suburbs by examining processes of sociospatial segregation and middle-class disaffiliation in London's eastern suburban periphery. By drawing upon aspects of Bourdieu's theoretical framework, the paper shows how the home-owning, middle-class, largely white residents of the ‘Woodlands’ private housing estate attempted to shore up their threatened sense of exclusivity in relation to the nearby deprived ‘Eastside’ suburb. The empirical material is drawn from survey and interview research on incomers to Woodlands. For its affluent incoming residents, Woodlands' dominant place image was that of an ‘oasis’ within Eastside, an area dominated by a large council-built housing estate. Although the Woodlands incomers were physically resident in Eastside, they symbolically and practically disengaged from ‘local’ places, notably shops, pubs, and schools, and their lower class and not-quite-white populations. The author argues that the Woodlands incomers adhered to a spatially selective version of what Savage et al refer to as ‘elective belonging’. Such selective belonging denotes a spatially uneven attachment rooted in residents' schizophrenic relationship to the suburban area, embracing the Woodlands oasis whilst abjuring the ‘other Eastside’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The cellular principle is an effective way to guarantee efficient utilization of the offered radio band. Although PCS networks use the cellular principle, the next generation of PCS networks needs more improvements in location management to face the increased number of users. Both an Enhanced Profile- Based Strategy (EPBS) for small-scale roaming and a Caching Two-Level Forwarding Pointer (C2LFP) strategy for large-scale roaming have been proposed. This chapter introduces a model that unites the above two strategies. The idea behind this model is based on applying those two location management strategies and specifying the physical parameters of PCS networks from mobility management’s point of view so that the underlying solutions can be more cost effective for location management. An evolutionary method using a constraint Genetic Algorithm (GA) has been used to achieve network parameters optimization. For convenience, we selected the planning problem with an appropriate set of parameters to be treated both genetically and analytically. Thus one can easily verify accuracy and efficiency of the evolutionary solution that would be obtained from the genetic algorithm. For more realistic environments, GA could be used reliably to solve sophisticated problems that combine the small-scale and large-scale roaming parameters of PCS networks. A case study is presented to provide a deep explanation of the proposed integration approach.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Mobile robots operating in natural terrain need some sort of long‐range perception in order to navigate efficiently. Whereas LADAR is a commonly used sensor on such systems, providing range data out to 25 m and beyond, we have instead focused on what information can be extracted from vision. Our robot has only two stereo camera pairs for terrain sensing; they provide reliable stereo data up to 5 m away, but this is not enough to prevent myopic behavior. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel approach to navigation using monocular imagery by planning a path in the image space. We take a monocular image and apply a learned color‐to‐cost mapping to transform the raw image into a cost image. Then, after a pseudo‐configuration‐space transform, we search for a pixel‐to‐pixel path from a point in front of the robot to the projected goal point in the cost image. Our implementation has been shown to react to obstacles at a range of 93 m, far beyond the range of our stereo perception. We describe the details of our method and results from testing under the DARPA Learning Applied to Ground Robots (LAGR) program and discuss the characteristics and trade‐offs of our approach. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Land development for nonagricultural uses in China's periurban areas has been driven by the rapid urbanization which has made the areas an intense mixture of urban and rural activities. The taking of land-rent differentials derived from land-use change is also a strong driving force for land conversion. In addition to formal land developments, informal and quasi-formal land developments have been induced by the institution of incomplete and ambiguously delineated collective land rights which facilitate disordered land-rent competition. Urban land uses permeate extensively into the agricultural territory of villages. Spatially uncoordinated land conversion and disorganized physical development result in substandard, inferior, and deteriorating habitations. Land utilization becomes suboptimal, and land values depreciate in a worsening environment. Land rents dissipate as a result. This mode of periurbanization is deemed unsustainable for a low-income developing country with high population density and scarce land resources. </jats:p>",

While the first part of the paper discusses the staging of what is referred to as a dispositif of safety, which discursively frames subjective–spatial relations in powerful ways, the second part moves towards an understanding of lived experiences of spaces and places that unfold within, but also beyond, the dispositif of safety. For this purpose, the German concept of Geborgenheit is introduced. For a theoretical elaboration of this concept, Walter Benjamin's work around experience and temporality is referred to and articulated with Deleuzian theory. An analysis of Geborgenheit, it is argued, displaces hegemonic notions of ‘safety’ by addressing the dynamics that enable subjects to open up to and nest within a place. The paper concludes with a discussion of vignettes from a qualitative study in Berlin in order to exemplify the constitution of geographies of Geborgenheit in the context of recent safety politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Mojave Desert and Mountain Recycling Authority is a California Joint Powers Authority (the JPA), consisting of nine communities in California’s San Bernardino County high desert and mountain region. In August 2008 the JPA contracted with Gershman, Brickner &amp; Bratton, Inc. (GBB) to prepare the Victor Valley Resource Management Strategy (Resource Management Strategy). Working with RRT Design and Construction, Inc. (RRT), GBB prepared a coordinated forward-looking strategy to guide the JPA’s future program and facilities decisions. The Resource Management Strategy focused on the Town of Apple Valley, population 70,092, and the City of Victorville, population 107,408, the two largest JPA member communities, which have a combined total of more than 130,000 tons per year of material entering the JPA’s recycling system and the Victorville Landfill. The Resource Management Strategy is underpinned by a characterization of waste loads delivered to the Victorville Landfill. A visual characterization was carried out by RRT in September/October 2008. RRT engineers identified proportions of materials recoverable for recycling and composting among all loads collected from residential and non-residential generators for a full week, nearly 300 loads total. The JPA financed and manages the operations contract for the highly automated Victor Valley Material Recovery Facility (MRF). The MRF today receives and processes an average of 130 tons per day (tpd), five days per week, of single stream paper and containers and recyclable-rich commercial waste loads. The waste characterization indicated that as much as 80 percent of loads of residential and commercial waste currently landfilled could be processed for recycling and composting in a combination manual and automated sorting facility. Residue from the MRF, which is predominated by paper, would provide potential feedstock for an energy recovery project; however, the JPA has two strategies regarding process residue. The first strategy is to reduce residue rates from existing deliveries, to optimize MRF operations. An assessment of the MRF conducted by RRT indicated that residue rates could be reduced, although this material would continue to be rich in combustible materials. The second strategy is to increase recovery for recycling by expanding the recyclable-rich and organics-dense waste load deliveries to the MRF and/or a composting facility. The Resource Management Strategy provided a conceptual design and cost that identified projected capital and operations costs that would be incurred to expand the MRF processing system for the program expansion. Based on the waste composition analysis, residue from a proposed system was estimated. This residue also would be rich in combustible materials. The December 2008 California Scoping Plan is the roadmap for statewide greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts. The Scoping Plan specifically calls out mandatory commercial recycling, expanded organics composting (particularly food residue), and inclusion of anaerobic digestion as renewable energy. The Resource Management Strategy sets the stage for JPA programs to address Scoping Plan mandates and priorities. California Public Resources Code Section 40051(b) requires that communities: Maximize the use of all feasible source reduction, recycling, and composting options in order to reduce the amount of solid waste that must be disposed of by transformation and land disposal. For wastes that cannot feasibly be reduced at their source, recycled, or composted, the local agency may use environmentally safe transformation or environmentally safe land disposal, or both of those practices. Moreover, Section 41783(b) only allows transformation diversion credit (10 percent of the 50 percent required) if: The transformation project uses front-end methods or programs to remove all recyclable materials from the waste stream prior to transformation to the maximum extent feasible. Finally, prior to permitting a new transformation facility the California Integrated Waste Management Board is governed by Section 41783(d), which requires that CIWMB: “Hold a public hearing in the city, county, or regional agency jurisdiction within which the transformation project is proposed, and, after the public hearing, the board makes both of the following findings, based upon substantial evidence on the record: (1) The city, county, or regional agency is, and will continue to be, effectively implementing all feasible source reduction, recycling, and composting measures. (2) The transformation project will not adversely affect public health and safety or the environment.” The Resource Management Strategy assessed two cement manufacturers located in the high desert region for their potential to replace coal fuel with residue from the MRF and potentially from other waste quantities generated in the region. Cement kilns are large consumers of fossil fuels, operate on a continuous basis, and collectively are California’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. The Resource Management Strategy also identified further processing requirements for size reduction and screening to remove non-combustible materials and produce a feasible refuse derived fuel (RDF). A conceptual design system to process residue and supply RDF to a cement kiln was developed, as were estimated capital and operating costs to implement the RDF production system. The Resource Management Strategy addressed the PRC requirement that “all feasible source reduction, recycling and composting measures” are implemented prior to approving any new “transformation” facility. This planning effort also provided a basis for greenhouse gas reduction analysis, consistent with statewide initiatives to reduce landfill disposal. This paper will report on the results of this planning and the decisions made by the JPA, brought current to the time of the conference.</jats:p>",

Dynamic modelling technique based on the combined Euler–Lagrange formulation and assumed modes method is applied, then by implementing the Pontryagin’s minimum principle; necessary conditions for optimality are derived. Nonlinear states and control constraints are treated without any simplifications or transforming them into sequences of systems with linear equations.

This article describes a detailed framework developed through the BioNet program to facilitate coordination of bioterrorism preparedness planning among military and civilian decision makers.Methods: The authors and colleagues conducted a series of semistructured interviews with civilian and military decision makers from public health, emergency management, hazardous material response, law enforcement, and military health in the San Diego area. Decision makers used a software tool that simulated a hypothetical anthrax attack, which allowed them to assess the effects of a variety of response actions (eg, issuing warnings to the public, establishing prophylaxis distribution centers) on performance metrics. From these interviews, the authors characterized the information sources, technologies, plans, and communication channels that would be used for bioterrorism planning and responses. The authors used influence diagram notation to describe the key bioterrorism response decisions, the probabilistic factors affecting these decisions, and the response outcomes.Results: The authors present an overview of the response framework and provide a detailed assessment of two key phases of the decision-making process: (1) pre-event planning and investment and (2) incident characterization and initial responsive measures. The framework enables planners to articulate current conditions; identify gaps in existing policies, technologies, information resources, and relationships with other response organizations; and explore the implications of potential system enhancements.Conclusions: Use of this framework could help decision makers execute a locally coordinated response by identifying the critical cues of a potential bioterrorism event, the information needed to make effective response decisions, and the potential effects of various decision alternatives.</jats:p>"

On the basis of fieldwork carried out in three women's prisons in the secure and restricted penal zone within Mordovia, Russian Federation, we present unique and original qualitative data, as well as a critical engagement with contemporary Russian press sources. Starting from the assumption that the (free) female body is a particular target of Foucauldian disciplinary power, in that gender is a discipline which produces bodies and identities and operates as an effective form of social control, we examine the ways in which this disciplinary power of gender is compounded by bodily imprisonment. Criminal women are often considered not only to have broken the law but also to have offended against their culturally specific gender role expectations, and punishment applied to women prisoners is grounded not on what women are like, but on how women ‘ought’ to behave in a particular cultural context, with interventions coercing or persuading women to reintegrate into a recognisably ‘feminine’ form. We uncover Russia's exceptional and exclusionary geography of women's imprisonment, and rehabilitative and educational processes, including a beauty pageant, which seek to rescript criminal women toward a predetermined ‘ideal’ of Russian womanhood, and also explore the ways in which women seek to resist. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Narrating a world of flux entails moving away from equilibrium-oriented thinking toward considerations of emergence, uncertain futures, and unintended consequences. This is not the exclusive domain of the qualitative theory construction and analysis that has dominated such thinking in sociospatial theory: it is also involved in mathematical theory construction. It requires a relational approach to mathematical theory, however, that moves beyond unidirectional claims of cause and effect, avoids deterministic and teleological thinking, and recognizes the incompleteness and openness of any such theoretical construction. These arguments are explored through an example that employs mathematical techniques often associated with complexity theory to examine unevenly shifting economic landscapes where the best guesses of capitalist entrepreneurs are interrelated with the emergent multiregional economy in which capitalists participate. This highlights the unexpectedly heightened dynamical importance of regions in a globally connected world; how cherished theoretical principles become renegotiated, as relationality leads to emergence; and that there is space for human agency, through modeling praxis appropriate to ‘incomplete systems’. We open modest cracks in the supposed wall between quantitative and qualitative approaches, oriented toward a methodological reinterpretation of what employing mathematical arguments could mean within larger, postpositivist theoretical projects in critical human geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The environmental management and planning community is struggling with a gap between knowledge and policy making. To bridge this gap, ‘decision support systems’, ‘planning support systems’, and other computer tools have been developed to make knowledge about complex issues more accessible for policy makers. However, the use of these systems in practice is limited. One major reason for this is that these systems are designed for well-defined problems, whereas in practice there is often a lack of stakeholder consensus on the problem structure. The aim of this paper is to present, and explore the potential of, a new approach for decision and planning support. The Quasta tool aims at facilitating participatory problem structuring through computer-supported cognitive mapping. The tool, allowing qualitative exploration of scenarios and simultaneous forecasting and backcasting, is tested in four participatory problem-structuring workshops, in which various environmental issues have been discussed. Evaluations of these workshops show that this approach (1) helps stakeholders to become aware of causal relationships, (2) is useful for a qualitative exploration of scenarios, (3) identifies the need for further (in-depth) knowledge, and (4) has a low threshold for nontechnicians. </jats:p>",

We use contingent valuation—a survey-based approach that elicits willingness to pay (WTP) directly from individuals—to estimate the benefits of a nationwide conservation of built cultural heritage sites in Armenia. The survey was administered to Armenian nationals living in Armenia, and obtained extensive information about the respondents' perceptions of the current state of conservation of monuments in Armenia, described the current situation, presented a hypothetical conservation program, elicited WTP for it, and queried individuals about what they thought would happen to monument sites in the absence of the government conservation program. We posit that respondents combined the information about the fate of monuments provided by the questionnaire with their prior beliefs, and that WTP for the good, or program, is likely to be affected by these updated beliefs. We propose a Bayesian updating model of prior beliefs, and empirically implement it with the data from our survey. We found that uncertainty about what would happen to monuments in the absence of the program results in lower WTP amounts. </jats:p>",

Article 84 of the EURATOM Treaty excludes the application of the Treaty from cases of military uses of nuclear energy, nevertheless, on several occasions the European Court of Justice (ECJ) had to pronounce itself on the legal 'grey zone' issue of what is indeed considered as peaceful use of nuclear energy and the legal regime to be applied thereby. This was the substance of the issues raised in cases C-61/03 Commission v. UK and C-65/04 Commission v. UK. Through a comparative analysis of the relevant case law it is interesting to observe how in the matter of defining the EURATOM competences the ECJ is adamant to the use of 'policy-oriented' arguments, otherwise affluently used with respect to affording new competences to the European Community (EC), EURATOM's 1957 contemporary.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

We discuss the implications for theories of policy change based on well-defined networks located within single, discrete, policy domains. We suggest that such approaches struggle to account for the dynamics of change in conditions of policy convergence. The issue of climate change has opened up and destabilised the UK energy policy sector, but this process has been surprisingly free of conflict, despite radical policy shifts. To date, convergence of the energy and climate change sectors has largely occurred at a discursive level, and we focus our attention on a number of different, but largely complementary, storylines about solutions to climate change. We draw on ideas about sociotechnical regime transitions, first, to explore why the storylines are not in obvious conflict, and, second, to identify small-scale niches where tensions in storylines do emerge as discourse is translated into material reality. </jats:p>",

Addressing young offender needs is a key priority for their rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. The objectives were to identify programs and interventions that assist detained youth through focussed discharge planning by a systematic review of the literature. In addition, this review examined the identified health needs of young offenders in secure care. Our systematic review searched electronic databases using the keyword terms youth, secure care, health assessment and primary health care. Keyword browser terms were also entered as search strings, and only literature from 1997 onwards was retained. Twenty-two pieces of published literature were retained, and these documented the needs and service utilisation of young offenders. Mental health problems and trauma exposure were commonly identified in the literature, as was general physical health deficits and social and familial problems. Retrieved articles also made recommendations for health assessments and discharge planning, and some provided discharge planning models. Young offenders have diverse needs that can be ascertained from quality assessment measures. Effective discharge planning is important to attend to ongoing health issues and aid rehabilitation and reintegration into the community. By administering a comprehensive multidimensional screening measure upon admission to secure care, individualised care plans can be formulated with discharge planning measures. Recommendations for further study include the development and implementation of a needs assessment tool in youth secure-care facilities that complements the existing assessments and helps reintegrate young offenders to primary health care and community services.</jats:p>"

Our approach aims at establishing a bridge between task planning and manipulation planning that allows a rigorous treatment of geometric preconditions and effects of robot actions in realistic environments. We show how links can be established between a symbolic description and its geometric counterpart and how they can be used in an integrated planning process that is able to deal with intricate symbolic and geometric constraints. Finally, we describe the main features of an implemented planner and discuss several examples of its use. </jats:p>",

A development methodology provides structure to a project, which facilitates communication, establishes expectations, enhances quality and promotes consistency. One potential reason project managers do not employ a development methodology is that selecting the correct methodology from among the hundreds available can be an overwhelming task. For this reason, understanding the decision-making process, and identifying those factors that influence it, is a worthwhile endeavor. While empirical research in this area is lacking, a review of the extant literature reveals several factors that are important when choosing a development methodology. In this chapter, many of these factors are identified, a model for categorizing them is proposed, and a model for selecting a methodology is presented.</jats:p>"

This investigation advances a lineage of work on the development and maintenance of gay and lesbian neighbourhoods, and their role in residents' well-being. The findings also extend understandings of social cohesion, a key theme in neighbourhood and policy research across the West. The context of this study is Australia, where recent projects on social cohesion have focused on public order, economic benefits, and race tensions. However, given that gay men and lesbians are present in Australian social and political debates, sexuality should be integrated into studies about neighbourhood cohesion. To analyse processes of cohesion between heterosexual and same-sex-attracted people, we draw on data from case studies of two queer-friendly neighbourhoods in Australia—the inner-city suburb of Newtown, NSW, and the regional town of Daylesford, Victoria. We discuss the findings in three analytical categories to highlight common processes and characteristics of queer-friendly neighbourhoods: diversity and difference; symbolic landscapes; combating homophobia. </jats:p>",

Another important change in the legal regime applicable to State aid for environmental protection is brought about by the new General Block Exemption Regulation which, for the first time, contains several block exemption provisions for aid in this field. The new Guidelines—together with the respective provisions in the new General Block Exemption Regulation—are a remarkable step in that they entail a considerable increase in regulatory density and are thereby increasing \"red tape\" in this field. The new Guidelines are evidence of a more and more palpable tendency of the European Commission to use its power to examine aid for its compatibility with the common market under Article 87(3) EC to regulate in areas of law in which it is not competent to legislate. In doing so, it does not only interfere with competences of the Member States and of the other Community institutions but also risks contradiction to its own decisions in other fields.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In this response to Heidegger's Letter on Humanism, Sloterdijk poses the basic question about the purpose of politics, governance, and civic solidarity. On the one hand, since Plato, politics has been conceived in part as concerned with the necessity of ‘taming’ humans into being good citizens. Sloterdijk thus follows Nietzsche and Heidegger in portraying humanism as one side in a “constant battle … between bestializing and taming tendencies”. It is in the Hobbesian state of nature that humans are ‘wolves’ to each other; but who turns the wolves into friendly, loyal dogs? Humanism has claimed, according to Sloterdijk, that it is “reading the right books” which “calms the inner beast”. It is the great books, the “thick letters” from one great thinker to another, that provide the “model presented by the wise”, which enables “the care of man by man”. At the present, Sloterdijk argues, we appear to have been abandoned by the wise. It is no longer the humanist but the archivist who bothers to look up the old, thick letters. Humanism thus gives way to archivism. </jats:p>",

Improvements in data coverage and quality, particularly in the Northern Territory, now permit the effective use of conceptually preferable multistate methods. The multistate model presented in this paper explicitly incorporates identification change and, in contrast to previous modelling which has assumed all offspring of mixed Indigenous/non-Indigenous couples to be Indigenous, permits babies born to mixed couples to be ascribed either Indigenous or non-Indigenous identities. A hybrid directional–net-migration approach is taken to the modelling of internal migration. Illustrative projections are presented for the Northern Territory. </jats:p>",

In public housing, belonging is not guaranteed by the provision of a dwelling. Belonging is an active process created by tenants through interactions within households, with neighbours, and with housing providers. Central to these interactions, and the primary focus of this paper, are interactions based on care. The paper draws on results from a survey of public housing tenants in inner Newcastle, Australia. It is argued that a range of forms of care were critical to developing belonging for public housing tenants. The entry point of belonging allows an appreciation of the active of role of tenants in creating their everyday lives and the caring possibilities of public housing tenancy. The care needs and bonds of public housing tenants are explored, as well as perceptions of care deficits that make the achievement of belonging more challenging. </jats:p>",

During a participatory research project to inform the Tully Water Quality Improvement Plan (WQIP), the local community was involved in qualitative interviews and workshops to identify the water uses and values in the Tully basin. The results showed that these waters are extensively used and valued via a wide range of activities and that water is more than an economic good. All participants valued the aquatic ecosystems, which provide the basis for setting the most stringent water quality objectives (WQOs). Moreover, the results showed that many of the current uses and values of waters are under serious threat and that some uses and values have been lost over time. These findings informed the setting of the WQOs for the Tully WQIP to protect and re-establish the water uses and values that the local community supports.\n</jats:p>"

Summarized counts of users and performance trends serve as essential sources of information for those who need to analyze problems, monitor security, improve software, perform capacity planning, etc. With the reach of the Internet extending into all aspects of higher education research and teaching, however, new questions have arisen as to how, where, and when user activity gets captured and analyzed. Tracking and understanding remote users and their round-the-clock activities is a major technical and analytical challenge within today’s cyber-infrastructure. As open content publishing and open source development projects thrive in higher education there are some side effects on usage analysis. This chapter examines how data mining solutions – particularly Web usage mining methods– are being taken up in three open systems project management contexts: digital libraries, online museums, and course management systems. In describing the issues and challenges that motivate data mining applications in these three contexts, the chapter provides an overview of how data mining integrates within project management processes. The chapter also touches on ways in which data mining can be augmented by the complementary practice of data visualization.</jats:p>"

This paper utilises the concept of ‘regimes of publicity’ to explore how marginalised groups are included in the public. Regimes of publicity are the prevailing system of laws, practices, and relations that condition the qualities of a public and the ways that it is situated with respect to other publics. In exploring how publics might be formed and received, we focus on three interlinked elements of regimes of publicity—community and social norms, legitimacy, and the relations that constitute property—as they condition the strategies of activists and the resources that different agents and institutions bring to struggles over entry to the public. The argument we present highlights the ongoing nature of struggles for access to the public realm and the fragmented nature of the public. </jats:p>",

This paper extends Weitzman's analysis by examining how his conclusions are altered by the introduction of a conservation authority that considers the <jats:italic>value of information</jats:italic> contained in the biosphere. Introducing nonquasiconcave preferences for the information contained in each species substantially modifies the characterization of a cost‐effective conservation plan. In particular, I find that a cost‐effective plan generally includes partial funding for many species and funds no species completely.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author supports the argument that a focus on the spatiality of economic mechanisms can be a valuable way to address the issue of interurban housing markets, a theme which has not yet been adequately addressed by academic research. Developments are based on a theoretical framework in which two factors are considered central to the structuring of markets: (i) the possibility of choice between substitutable supplies (spatially related to the territory prospected by the consumer), and (ii) the availability of information on the state of the market (spatially related to the use of local sales references when market participants prepare their negotiations). This theoretical framework is empirically applied to the case of building sites prepared for self-built housing, with a modelling methodology elaborated for Belgium. The modelling methodology, based on cross-sectional regressions, develops a spatial autoregressive specification and incorporates a multiscale comparison. By highlighting the importance of information availability and demand substitutability, this exercise confirms that a focus on interurban market spatiality can be helpful to housing researchers. In fact, the results suggest that such a focus is particularly appropriate to the analysis of the impact of planning regulations on market outcomes. </jats:p>",

My main argument is that agency in the built environment is practised and performed through a dynamic relation between households and the built fabric, among other actants. The paper is based on an ethnographic study of forty-two inner-city households in the Polish city of Gdańsk, combined with archival research. I investigate the forces that constrain and enable the transformation of residential dwellings over time, with the aid of Jacobs's concept of ‘building events’. I wish to provide a more elaborate theorisation and operationalisation of the building event, while applying it to the interrogation of relations between buildings and households in the given context. The paper explores the different modalities through which buildings have been forced to create new allies and associations—allowing for the interpretive flexibility of their technological frame—in order to keep surviving and functioning in different sociopolitical circumstances. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I seek to move beyond understandings of Colombia as a failed state or qualified democracy by exploring how the state continues to govern despite widespread shortcomings. I argue that two technologies of governance are central to contemporary rule in Colombia: state fragmentation and citizen education. These technologies are exemplified by the recovery of public space from street vendors in order to preserve it as a privileged site for citizenship. This process is made possible by the proliferation of state agencies, policies, and plans which define the problem of public space as one of its invasion by ambulant vendors, and the solution to this invasion as the relocation of vendors to spatially marginalized and state-regulated markets where they are taught to overcome their ‘culture of informality’ by participating in political and economic transactions in state-prescribed ways. I argue that the recovery of public space and relocation of street vendors is a spatial technology of governance that codes structural inequalities as a question of culture while producing new forms of segregation in which citizens and street vendors have differentiated places and rights to mobility. This study analyzes the relationship between state and citizen construction while considering the pedagogical work implicated in the resilience of both democracy and neoliberal economic policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Predicting singular/extremal phenomena exceeding certain spatial, temporal, or energetic scales remains as a main scientific and practical challenge. The question is: does modern geophysics - based on recent progress in theories of complex systems and nonlinear dynamics - provide useful scientific insights to mechanisms underlying disastrous extreme events? The question is of primary importance, because providing more reliable disaster prediction methodologies is closely tied with scientific understanding of the hazardous process. From the point of view of dynamics, hazardous natural phenomena such as earthquakes, floods, or landslides are recognized as complex and high-dimensional processes. For such randomlike processes with no (or weak) inherent determinism, there are major, perhaps fundamental, difficulties in creating a comprehensiv physical/mathematical theory to describe and predict their evolution in spatial, temporal or energetic domains. At the same time, the weakness of deterministic relations in high dimensional processes does not imply an absence of order in governing rules. This is why for complex natural systems very large deviations from the mean (catastrophic extreme events) are not negligible and originate from system's inherent rules, not from chance. The most important features of complex systems are their ability to self-organize and the fractal distributions. For commonly limited natural scales it reveals itself in the form of memory or long-range dependence. According to the present understanding almost all important natural hazards are associated with such memory, scale invariant, close-to-critical state models, e.g. landslides with the sand-pile model, earthquakes with the slider-block model, and forest fires with the forest-fire model. In spite of present difficulties related to the correct dynamical analysis of complex systems, it is accepted that predictability of natural disasters can be considered as a well-posed task. Thus, developing dynamical methods together with quantitative models needed to evaluate probabilistic hazard assessment is within our reach. This will require a combined effort of earth scientists, physicists, statisticians, and practitioners. In this chapter we present a short review of dynamics and predictability of complex processes as well as some results of seismic hazard assessment in Georgia.</jats:p>"

The effort made in developing our system of response to disasters has diverted attention away from the root causes of risk. This paper examines the nature and drivers of risk exposure in order to develop a framework for analysis and to achieve more effective governance. Risk transference between agents and historical exposure, the satisfaction of basic needs and economic wants, and poor risk knowledge have been identified as key drivers. The concept of exposure challenges the complementary notion of vulnerability elaborated by scholars and practitioners from various disciplines. In this context, exposure implies a potential for loss, while vulnerability implies the potential for differential loss.</jats:p>"

The task is advanced with reference to a controversial development proposal to build a marina and residential subdivision on estuarine mudflats near a seaside dormitory suburb in the capital city of Hobart on the island state of Tasmania, Australia. Particular attention is paid to story lines generated in three discourse coalitions which have formed around the controversy over the proposal: a multimillion dollar mainland company known as the Walker Corporation, the Tasmanian state government, and a community action group known as Save Ralphs Bay Inc. Techniques of narrative and discourse analysis are used to read these story lines for evidence of belonging. In this analysis of ‘text, talk, and practice’, opportunities arise to consider the wider salience of the case to geographers, among them connection and attachment to place, and counterpoints of belonging such as social and ecological dispossession and displacement. </jats:p>",

IP Telephony transmits voice communications over a network using open standard-based Internet protocols. This is both the strength and weakness of IP Telephony as the involved basic transport protocols (RTP, UDP, and IP) are not able to natively guarantee the required application quality of service (QoS). From the point of view of an IP Telephony Service Provider this definitely means possible waste of clients and money. Specifically the problem is at two different levels: i) in some countries, wherelong distance and particularly international call tariffs are high, perhaps due to a lack of competition or due to cross subsidies to other services, the major opportunity for IP Telephony Service Providers is for price arbitrage. This means working on diffusion of an acceptable service, although not at high quality levels; ii) in other countries, where different IP Telephony Service Providers already exist, the problem is competition for offering the best possible quality. The main idea behind this chapter is to analyze specifically the state of the art playout control strategies with the following aims: i) propose the reader the technical state of the art playout control management and planning strategies (overview of basic KPIs for IP Telephony); ii) compare the strategies IP Telephony Service Provider can choose with the aim of saving money and offering a better quality of service; iii) introduce also the state of the art quality index for IP Telephony, that is a set of algorithms for taking into account as many factors as possible to evaluate the service quality; iv) provide the reader with examples on some economic scenarios of IP Telephony.</jats:p>"

The site of the new cemetery at Carnide was selected between three hypotheses as meeting the main prerequisites. However in the initial opinion it was already recognized that the topography was too rough and the composition of local soil and relatively high groundwater levels should be considered as less favourable conditions. The engineering geological characterization of the Carnide's cemetery site was based on a site investigation program carried out in 1983. As the groundwater level may reach the elevations of the burials, the design studies proposed to elevate the burial areas over the natural terrain. With this purpose a terrace modelling of the terrain was proposed, using selected materials to construct the burials prisms, and designed a deep drainage systems as well as surface system. The Carnide's New Cemetery was opened in 1996 and after a period of 12 years there were a total of about 10000 burials. According to a preliminary analysis of the first 5 years of activity (1996&amp;ndash;2000) it seems that a timescale of 5 to 10 years as design criterion for corpse decomposition failed leading to studies with the aim of determining the causes and possible solutions for that problem.</jats:p>"

This has been registered in a range of topics in cultural, social, and political geography, and impacted in work on landscape. Such work has antecedents in several decades of humanistic geography and is immersed in more recent writings on performance and subjectivity and the critical rethinking of being, dwelling, movement, and place. With those and allied works in mind, this paper interrogates such literatures through writing about walking an urban section (through the port of Plymouth) of Britain's South West Coast Path; one of the few places where any of the twenty demarcated national trails and long-distance routes in the UK intersects a city. The existence of a rich literature on strolling in urban space opens up possibilities and connections. However the approach here is deliberately eclectic and also draws on works from/about geopolitics, natural history, and urban studies. My purpose here is to bring such literatures into closer and productive dialogue, through an account that shifts geographical and temporal scales and perspectives. This is done through the device of an evening's walk along a section of the path: negotiating spaces of capital and sovereignty. Military geography and security/insecurity emerge as master keys to how topography has been shaped here and the paper draws a series of connections between landscape, life, death, and military activities, both near and far. What the paper aims to do, therefore, is to illustrate how geopolitics affects us—to illustrate how the repercussions of militarism, war, and death are folded into the textures of an everyday urban fabric. This has implications for how other landscapes, places, and paths might be understood. </jats:p>",

Much work has been done to develop optimal design methodologies that generate a “best” design but designs often have to be changed to meet operational considerations, potentially mitigating any optimization benefits. This work proposes to expand the optimal network design process by applying a process borrowed from Finance and Operations Research/Management Science literature known as the Efficient Frontier or production frontier analysis. Using this idea, a portfolio of designs differing in cost, and number, size and location of nodes will be developed and from that the efficient frontier will be defined. By comparing any subsequent design to the frontier, the network designer can have an understanding of the impact of changes in the design strategy to the long-term cost effectiveness.</jats:p>"

We developed and tested a protocol to guide an adaptive approach to water quality management in north-eastern Australia. The protocol articulates a framework for documenting uncertainties and performance expectations, negotiating feedback and anticipating iterative and transformative responses to future scenarios. A Water Quality Improvement Plan developed for the Tully–Murray catchment in the Great Barrier Reef region was used to test the protocol and three benefits of its use were identified. First, developing rigorous and timely monitoring and evaluation ensures that opportunities for iterative planning are realised. Second, anticipating future endogenous or exogenous changes to the plan enables the early initiation of actions to inform transformative planning responses. Finally, the protocol exposed the need to coordinate multi-scalar responses to tackle environmental knowledge and management uncertainties and assumptions. The protocol seeks to provide a practical translation of adaptive planning theory that will enable the benefits of adaptive management to be realised on the ground.\n</jats:p>"

But which competencies should a firm push to develop its legitimacy and to whom should they be targeted? While firms can push its in a variety of different ways, there is no guarantee of success in a network of embedded, interdependent stakeholders. Drawing on institutional theory, this chapter presents a case research based framework to describe an iterative and incremental process to help firms manage their network legitimacy.

Our inference is based on a single equation that includes variables to capture the effect of spatial structure. Special attention is given to a proper estimation method: we estimate the distance-decay parameters by nonlinear weighted least-squares with balancing factors. It appears that neither an exponential nor a power distance-decay function fits the data well. Using a spline regression we find a cost elasticity of – 4 for distances around 20 km and a much smaller value for shorter and longer distances. It appears that the logarithm of distance decay can be described adequately as a (downward) logistic function of log cost. </jats:p>",

We look at whether these shifts happen in practice and also look at the link with participation. At all political levels a big gap remains between the rhetoric on participation and the real-life implementation of participatory processes. </jats:p>",

Sloterdijk's book is itself a discussion of Nietzsche's book The Birth of Tragedy, and the account offered here is a critical appreciation of both texts, focusing on the question of individual and collective existence. The essay looks at the question of the future of the human, raising the question of the superhuman alongside that of the posthuman. In doing so, it brings in other texts from Sloterdijk—especially “Rules for the human zoo”—and offers an account of Nietzsche's work on these themes as a whole. The essay criticises some aspects of Sloterdijk's appropriation, but more positively makes the case for retrieving the uniqueness of Nietzsche's answers. Human existence cannot be corrected, but it can be transfigured. </jats:p>",

In this study of a passerine species of conservation concern, the woodlark <jats:italic>Lullula arborea</jats:italic>, we highlight the conservation implications of spatial shifts of breeding territories and changes of habitat requirements during the course of the breeding season. We described the factors affecting the distribution and habitat selection of this species in the Trebbia river valley (northern Apennines, Italy), where we mapped woodlark territories during the average time of first and second clutches. A strong shift of territories towards higher altitudes with the progression of the season was observed. The habitat models predicting woodlark occurrence varied between the early and the late period. Specifically, fodder cover positively predicted occurrence early in the season, whereas late in the season occurrence was positively influenced by shrub cover, length of woodland edge, alfalfa cover and rocky areas. Accordingly, territories that were occupied throughout the entire season had greater fodder, shrub and rocky cover compared with those that were occupied only early in the season, suggesting that these variables were important in determining territory quality for woodlarks. Therefore, changing ecological needs of multi‐brooded bird species during the breeding season have to be taken into account for defining appropriate conservation strategies. This was demonstrated by showing that the habitat variables predicting woodlark occurrence early in the season poorly predicted occurrence late in the season and vice versa. In conclusion, this study provides the first detailed assessment of habitat factors affecting the occurrence of breeding woodlarks in an important portion of the species' range, and represents the first explicit attempt to model seasonally changing ecological requirements of bird species for conservation purposes. Our findings suggest that complex data and flexible habitat management strategies are required to account for temporal changes in habitat suitability in multi‐brooded bird species.</jats:p>",

A highly mobile robot such as IMPASS could prove very valuable in applications where the terrain is complex and dangerous, but for this platform to be practical for real world use, motion control of the actuated rimless wheel must be automated. This work discusses considerations for motion planning concerning the transitions from step to step in the two-dimensional sagittal plane. Each step transition can be defined by a switching angle, which is the angle made between the back spoke and a reference axis. Presented is a review of the types of step transitions that are advantageous for ascending and descending obstacles, as well as traversing terrain with minor irregularities. These step transitions have been tested in simulation and on a physical prototype, the results of which will be discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning and urban policies emphasise ‘sustainability’, but claims that ‘compact cities' are more socially sustainable and acceptable have been controversial and subject to limited empirical testing. After a brief review of the concepts and debate, we set out new empirical evidence based on household surveys linked to neighbourhood physical, map-based, and sociodemographic data for five British cities. Statistical models are developed to account for systematic variations in the main social sustainability outcomes. The results are considered both in terms of the role of particular urban form and locational measures, but also in terms of the broader patterns of effects of packages of measures. Outcomes relating to residential satisfaction, stability, neighbourhood environment, and safety are all shown to be lower in higher density/central places, but it is also shown that a good deal of this apparent effect is due to social and demographic factors. Interaction with neighbours and participation in groups is better at medium densities, controlling for other factors, while use of local services is, as expected, greater in denser, more central locations. These findings indicate that compact cities are not ‘win-win’ on all dimensions of sustainability but, rather, that reductions in transport emissions will have to be weighed against social criteria. In addition, urban form has different aspects, which have differing social effects, and this knowledge could inform the future design of ‘smarter’ urban environments. </jats:p>",

Command-and-control systems feature a high degree of prescription and coercion by higher-level governments to put in place local planning processes that emphasize technical rationality in identifying and overcoming barriers to mitigation. Cooperative systems feature a high degree of flexibility and use of incentives by higher-level governments to put in place local planning processes that emphasize communicative rationality by increasing community understanding of and political support for safe development patterns and building standards. Our empirical analysis of planning systems in the United States and Australia finds merit in aspects of each system. We conclude that hybrid central government mandates are needed to harness the ability of command-and-control policy designs to bring about local government participation in hazard mitigation planning with the ability of cooperative designs to build community understanding of problems and support for their solution.</jats:p>"

It builds upon and further develops a life-cycle oriented product policy, and also addresses the consumption dimension. This article looks at implementation and application of the Action Plan. This is presenting a number of challenges: setting up and implementing a coherent legal framework, providing the requisite tools and steering voluntary processes.

We instead examine some challenges in implementing EPI at the local level. We look at legal and policy frameworks relating to environmental governance and actual waste management decision making in five Swedish cities. We observe an implementation gap between the high-level policy ambitions relating to environmental governance of the waste sector, as expressed in national policy frameworks, and the local-level decision-making procedures and outcomes. Several discrepancies are identified: between national waste policy and the local decision premises, between local waste planning and project decision making, between knowledge gathering and project decision making, and between the legal mechanism in the development consent process and the national environmental quality objectives framework. Our study indicates that the governance frameworks at different levels are quite different, and at least partly incompatible, which causes important coordination problems across levels. Sectoral developments towards an industrial marketisation of waste have rendered frameworks such as local waste plans obsolete. We also find that the more traditional and coercive forms of governing the sector, such as consent, bans, and taxes, are the ones that have steering power, whereas new procedures, such as management by objectives, lack sufficient institutional and cognitive support structures to be effective. </jats:p>",

The review revealed that climate change considerations were not included in a majority of cases in the transportation planning process, especially to adapt transportation systems to the potential effects of climate change. When such consideration did occur, the focus was on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission mitigation, with data collection techniques and analysis tools that were better developed and already in place within many planning organizations. A conceptual framework for transportation planning is presented and used to illustrate how some agencies have considered climate change in each step of the planning process. Recommendations are provided on how GHG emission mitigation and climate adaptation strategies can be incorporated into the transportation planning process. </jats:p>",

To address this, the Maternal and Child Health Bureau has made receipt of transition services a core performance outcome for community-based systems of care for youth with special health care needs. In this article we describe the results for the transition core outcome from the 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs. We also describe changes in the measurement strategy for this outcome since the first National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs in 2001.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>METHODS. In the nationally representative, cross-sectional 2005–2006 National Survey of Children With Special Health Care Needs, parent or guardian respondents of 18198 youth with special health care needs (aged 12–17) were asked if they have had discussions with their child's health care providers about (1) future adult providers, (2) future adult health care needs, (3) changes in health insurance, and (4) encouraging their child to take responsibility for his or her care. All 4 components had to be met for the youth to meet the overall transition core outcome. Those who had not had transition discussions reported if such discussions would have been helpful.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>RESULTS. Overall, 41% of youth with special health care needs met the core performance outcome for transition. Forty-two percent had discussed shifting care to an adult provider, 62% discussed their child's adult health care needs, and 34% discussed upcoming changes in health insurance. Most (78%) respondents said that providers usually or always encourage their child to take responsibility for his or her health. Non-Hispanic black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, lower income level, not speaking English, and not having a medical home reduced the odds of meeting the transition core outcome.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CONCLUSIONS. Current performance on the transition core outcome leaves much room for improvement. Many parents feel that having transition-related discussions with their health care providers would be helpful. Future clinical and policy-level research should be directed at identifying barriers to, and recommending content for, health transition discussions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Aircraft navigation can be safely accomplished by properly addressing the following: decision-making, obstacle perception, aircraft state estimation, and aircraft control. To develop a monolithic navigational system is probably an impossible task; instead a hierarchical decomposition is presented, which breaks down the safe recovery and landing of distressed aircraft into sub-problems that maximize the probability that the overall objective is achieved. Navigational performance is often hinder by in-flight damage or failures, which often results in mission failure and an inability to guide the aircraft to a safe landing. Uncertainty is a very important concern in recovery of damaged aircraft since it can cause infeasibilities, false diagnosis and prognosis causing further performance degradation and mission failure. The damaged aircraft is simulated via a simplified kinematic model. The different sources and perspectives of uncertainties in the damage assessment process and post-failure trajectory planning are presented and classified. The decision-making process for an emergency motion planning and landing is developed via the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The objective of the trajectory planning is to arrive at a target position while maximizing the safety of the aircraft given uncertain conditions. Simulations are presented for an emergency motion planning and landing that takes into account aircraft dynamics, path complexity, distance to landing site, runway characteristics, and subjective human decision.</jats:p>",

The SGT5-8000H has been developed based on an evolutionary innovation concept which can be characterized by a technology platform strategy and prior component pre-validation. To ensure that the new product line can be brought to market with extensive testing and operation experience under real power plant conditions, a comprehensive validation program was launched in December 2007 at the prototypical power plant in Irsching. The 18 month validation program consists of multiple measurement campaigns, covering the full operation range starting from the hot commissioning to a final endurance test in single-cycle configuration. To gain the required data for the validation, the SGT5-8000H prototype has been equipped with close to 3000 measuring sensors and an extensive data acquisition system. For the realization of the largest gas turbine validation program ever conducted by Siemens, innovation in various aspects of test execution and evaluation had to be realized. Dedicated teams are operating and monitoring the engine operation from on-site and from the world-wide engineering locations utilizing real-time data acquisition, monitoring and evaluation methods. This paper describes the infrastructure and settings of the validation program in terms of the testing scope, facilities, methods and tools.</jats:p>",

Evidence of a relationship between leisure home ownership and health can inform efforts to resolve this dilemma. Using longitudinal register data, we assessed the prospective association between ownership of a leisure home and early retirement for health reasons among 42 588 adults residing in high-density Swedish urban municipalities. The research design included controls for ‘drift’ of unhealthy people into particular residential circum-stances, and other potential alternative explanations for the association of focal interest. After adjustment for age, socioeconomic position, and type of primary housing, logistic regression analysis revealed that men with a leisure home had lower odds of early retirement for health reasons than men who did not own a leisure home. Among women, leisure home ownership interacted with socioeconomic position; in contrast to nonowners, women who owned a leisure home had higher odds of early retirement for health reasons if they also had higher levels of education and employment income. The associations we have uncovered provide additional insight on the relationship between access to natural environments and health, and they warrant consideration in efforts to resolve the densification dilemma. </jats:p>",

Here we examine the complexity of measuring patterns of distribution using examples of socioeconomic data on rural poverty and affluence as well as data on environmental quality and species richness. We demonstrate how changes in the base spatial units used for analysis have different effects on different measures of inequality. The effects of such changes in spatial resolution also depend on the underlying processes that generate the data. The results of our investigations into the effects of scale on the assessment of inequality suggest that, where data come from both the social and natural science sources, the most appropriate level for analysis is that of the finest common resolution. This may result in redundancy of effort for some types of data but any such disadvantage is offset by the benefits of identifying inequalities that are masked at coarser resolutions. </jats:p>",

While a significant amount of criminological research has been undertaken in the country, the spatial analysis of crime and offenders, a basic prerequisite for a functional crime management strategy, has not been adequately addressed at a sufficiently fine scale of aggregation. This paper reports on the geodemographic development of offender risk profiles for neighbourhoods in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality in South Africa. Geodemographics is a relatively new geo-analytical technique that is being increasingly used in policing applications to complement law enforcement techniques and provide further insight into offenders and their offences. Findings of the study indicate that neighbourhoods at a high risk for offender development are amongst the most socially and economically deprived in the municipality and are disproportionately occupied by black Africans. The results highlight a need to reassess the current law enforcement approach to crime reduction in the country and return to the crime prevention initiatives that were part of the National Crime Prevention Strategy of the 1990s. </jats:p>",

Additional findings include: elders are better prepared for the event of death than the dying process; lawyers and financial planners play a prominent role in guiding elders through end‐of‐life decisions; and elders believe that the optimal time for advance care planning discussion is during periods of relative wellness.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Implications for practice: </jats:bold> Enhanced understanding of the patient perspective is key to incorporating advance care planning for healthy elders in the ideal milieu of primary care.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite the rapid growth of the small and medium-sized enterprise sector since the 1970s, rates of entrepreneurial activity in the UK remain moderate by international standards. Since its arrival in 1997 the Labour government in the UK has taken steps to tackle barriers to entrepreneurship by addressing economic, political, legal, and cultural issues. Through a review of key literature and policy documents, we seek to shed light on how the Labour government has shaped its entrepreneurship and enterprise-development policy agenda. It is found that, although there has been limited improvement in closing the enterprise gap, the Labour government does appear to have put in place a number of measures that are aimed at harnessing the long-term drivers of future enterprise, particularly catalysing the required cultural changes through the education system. It is suggested that enterprise policy making is diverse and has shifted away from small-business policy into a broader interpretation of entrepreneurship, although there inevitably continues to be significant overlap across the two areas. Furthermore, it is argued that enterprise initiatives are leading to the government taking quite radical routes in shaping its policies, becoming a bigger risk taker, and operating in a quasiprivate sector role. It is concluded that the increasing sophistication and specificity of policy instruments means that further research is required to understand how policies interact with each other.</jats:p>",

We present an adaptive GA that incorporates population-level statistics to dynamically update penalty functions, a process analogous to strategic oscillation from the tabu search literature. We also explore performance of various selection strategies. The GA identified feasible solutions within 96%, 98%, and 93% of a nonspatial relaxed upper bound calculated for landscapes of 100, 500, and 1000 units, respectively. The problem solved includes forest structure constraints limiting harvest opening sizes and requiring minimally sized patches of mature forest. Results suggest that the dynamic penalty strategy is superior to the more standard static penalty implementation. Results also suggest that tournament selection can be superior to the more standard implementation of proportional selection for smaller problems, but becomes susceptible to premature convergence as problem size increases. It is therefore important to balance selection pressure with appropriate disruption. We conclude that integrating intelligent search strategies into the context of genetic algorithms can yield improvements and should be investigated for future use in spatial planning with ecological goals.</jats:p>"

This paper considers the engagement of users in service delivery, service planning and in monitoring and evaluation activities for Children's Centres in Greater Merseyside. Research findings indicate that a lack of time to implement (and develop trust within) the new arrangements, a lack of awareness by users to participate and a broader thematic (employment and education) and geographical remit for Children's Centres is impacting upon the greater involvement of users in all aspects of co-production. Without such participation it is concluded that there is a real risk that the current needs of those most disadvantaged will not be adequately addressed.</jats:p>",

The analysis is in two phases; the manifestation of wetlands in map making in Iceland; and the social history of wetlands. Both phases focus on the 20th century until the present. Maps and the history of mapmaking are used as a heuristic devise to gauge and set the scene for the perception and experience of wetlands in the thinking of people. In order to illustrate this development, examples are taken from literature and travel accounts. Current endeavour in the utilisation of land and biotopic classification, best demonstrated in maps today, foregrounds the nature of the striations, making maps, and drainage ditches. Thus wetlands are viewed differently today, but nonetheless lingering traces of the modernist logic of progress remain, as we aim to demonstrate. The lines that form the tufts on the Icelandic maps are thus never stable, the striation never an end but constantly motile. </jats:p>",

The concept of critical mass is applied to different growth scenarios. Additional success factors are discussed.

Adjustments to external market conditions, proactive management, and a bilateral marketing approach are a key to lasting success within the Net Economy.

However, there are no census-based analyses of population change and residential segregation that cover the entire 1971–2001 period using consistent geographical units through time for all NI. This shortcoming is addressed in this paper by an analysis of changes in (i) the spatial distribution of population and (ii) residential segregation between 1971 and 2001 using the NI Grid-Square Product comprising data for a set of 1km2 cells that cover all populated areas in NI. The substantive issue of whether NI has become more segregated through time is addressed as are questions about measuring change through time using the census and the importance of spatial scale. One important conclusion is that NI indeed became more residential^ segregated between 1971 and 2001, but that residential segregation in 2001 remained approximately at its 1991 level according to most indicators. </jats:p>",

The scheme, together with the Eco-Label, the other EU voluntary tool, was developed as a complement to traditional 'command-and-control' legislation. While noble and ambitious in its design, EMAS has failed to become the shining light of environmental management which it was designed to be, and instead has devolved into a second class citizen. While the ongoing revision, EMAS III, offers some hope for the future, the program as a whole remains burdened by inefficiency and impracticality. The Scheme must expand in scope, and include motivations and rewards for incorporating such pressing ideas as CSR, or it will be doomed to the ash heap of history.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Preoperatively, the surgical anatomy of these lesions was investigated with 3D reformatting of multislice CT angiography, in addition to conventional angiography. Reformatted images clarified the surgical anatomy of the malformation. Reconstructing both the osseous and the vascular structures and simulating the surgical orientation allowed localization of the dural takeoff point of the DAVF's drainage, showing its relationship with osseous landmarks. Precise localization of the DAVF's drainage may help in choosing the most direct and effective approach to treat the malformation. The reported cases could be treated with a standard retrosigmoid exposure, avoiding the need for more complex cranial base approaches.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The precautionary principle can require regulatory action in cases of potential environmental damage, even before conclusive scientific proof of harm has become available. Critics charge that this inherently puts the principle at odds with rational risk management, which should be based on sound science and cost-benefit analysis. This chapter clarifies the significance of the precautionary principle by answering a variety of criticisms. The precautionary principle is not anti-science; it calls for more and wider scientific investigation of poorly understood environmental phenomena. It does not oppose hazard assessments done by experts, but it does make experts answerable to a broader public. Yet the deliberative turn in implementing the precautionary principle does not expose it to charges of populism. By using standards such as proportionality and revisability, the precautionary principle promotes reasoned policy-making in cases where risks are insufficiently understood. Finally, precaution is not to be equated with prohibition. Precautionary measures include anticipatory actions such as intensified monitoring, increased safety margins, systematic labeling, and spatial planning that creates protected zones for certain activities. The complexity of precautionary action is a reflection of the complexity of our societies and of the links they create with nature.</jats:p>"

Sun-Tsu’s The Art of War (AW) has been adapted successfully to the military domain (MD); and, MD has been adapted to strategic management (SM). If an ERP’s business drivers can be mapped to a firm’s strategic goals, one may conclude Sun-Tzu’s Art of War can be adapted to an ERP implementation (AW?MD?SM?ERP). Therefore, the authors hope to explore the applicability of Sun-Tzu’s Five Factors of Initial Estimation (Five Factors), an Eastern philosophy (a non-linear thought process) to ERP-related Western-oriented project management techniques (a linear thought process).</jats:p>"

However, the sensors used to construct these grids observe the environment in their own sample space based on sensor type and viewpoint. In this paper we present an<jats:italic>image space</jats:italic>technique for path planning in unknown unstructured outdoor environments. Our method differs from previous techniques in that we perform path search directly in image space—the native sensor space of the imaging sensor. After an image space path has been found, it is used for navigation in the real world. By operating at the resolution of the image sensor, image space planning facilitates accurate robot vs. obstacle localization and enables a high degree of movement precision. Our image space planning techniques can potentially be used with many different kinds of sensor data, and we experimentally evaluate the use of stereo disparity and color information. We present an extension to the basic image space planning system called the<jats:italic>cylindrical planner</jats:italic>that simulates a 2π field of view with a cylindrically shaped occupancy grid. We believe that image space planning is well suited for use in the local subsystem of a hierarchical planner and implement a<jats:italic>hybrid hierarchical planner</jats:italic>that utilizes the cylindrical planner as a local planning subsystem and a two‐dimensional Cartesian planner as the global planning subsystem. All three systems are implemented and experimentally tested on a real robot. We evaluate the failure modes of image space planning and discuss how to avoid them. We find that image space enables precise real‐time, near‐field planning. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

Much public policy is now concerned with addressing issues (such as accessibility) that span traditional organisational responsibilities and boundaries and thus require ‘joined-up’ thinking. At the same time, public policy is also increasingly required to be ‘evidence based’. As a consequence, it becomes necessary to develop appraisal and evaluation tools capable of assessing the achievements of joined-up policy interventions and their broader impacts on decision making and delivery across a diverse number of stakeholders. The Accessibility Policy Assessment Tool has been developed as a way of focusing more on the wider impacts of policy initiatives and is based upon a realist synthesis and multimethod approach to policy assessment. Through this focus, it has the potential to contribute to broader evaluation practice. </jats:p>",

In the late 1980s and 1990s, some fortunate developments in the international currency markets, together with an unofficial trade with Russia following the collapse of the Soviet Union, resulted in windfall trade gains for Turkey. During the last decade, a shift in the culture of fashion, from ready-to-wear to fast fashion pushed Turkish suppliers to upgrade into higher value-added activities such as design. While our focus is on the latter advantage, we point out that both sets of advantages have a commonality: namely, a sustainability problem. </jats:p>",

Studies show that a strong reason for resistance by the sales force to the technology is the failure to convince salespeople of the advantages and benefits of the new technology. Consequently firms face the challenge of selecting SFA technologies that their sales force will perceive as valuable and accept to use to enhance its performance. This issue becomes more challenging when it comes to introducing emerging technologies such as mobile technologies, where there is a risk of falling into the trap of overestimating/underestimating their potential value. The present study proposes a value-based approach for planning the introduction of Mobile applications to support the sales force. The approach suggested provides guidelines on how to determine whether or not mobile technologies would add value to the sales force before those technologies actually get selected and implemented. Good planning of SFA investment would help firms avoid resistance of the sales force towards the implemented systems, rather than having to treat it at the post-implementation stage.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Conflicts over the installation of wind farms constrain the potential to adopt an effective means for mitigating climate change. Although conventional wisdom attributes wind farm opposition to ‘not in my back yard’ attitudes, research shows that this explanation fails to incorporate the multiplicity of underlying motivations of opposition. Instead, distributional and institutional factors and procedural opportunities for public participation significantly influence support for wind farms. We consider the relevance of a political ecology explanation of wind farm conflicts by focusing on a case study in rural Catalonia, Spain. We argue that the conflict constitutes a recurrence of older and broader ‘centre’–‘periphery’ antagonisms and that two more explanatory elements are complementary to this political ecology explanation: the existence of alternative landscape valuations and the encouragement of instrumental rationality by the planning framework. We suggest that the absence of opportunities for meaningful deliberation in decision making and the predominance of decisional bottom lines curtail claims to fairer distribution of costs and benefits from locally hosted energy developments, as well as alternative landscape value claims, and that this fuels conflict. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the relationship between migration and labor-market segmentation in the northeastern Chinese city of Dalian. Several authors have stressed the importance of institutional arrangements in shaping the opportunity structures confronting migrants to China's urban areas. In particular, the ‘insider status' defined by the differential hukou or household registration status has been implicated in differential access to housing, schooling, health, and other benefits, as well as employment. The examination of the role of the hukou system in shaping employment outcomes in three high-tech industrial sectors of Dalian does not challenge this general finding; however, important variations among the software, biotech, and digital manufacturing industries are found. In these industries, the increasingly decentralized decision making of local economic development policy and shortages of skilled workers are leading to a selective relaxation of the hukou system—at least for some migrants. The implications of these changes for labor-market outcomes and urban development are highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates practices of border formation through an analysis of Australia's quarantine processes. We use the work of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), through the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS), to interrogate the ways in which borders are made and remade in daily life. By exploring quotidian practices of quarantine we argue that borders are the sites of complex and fluid relationships that are constantly being renegotiated as multiple active agents cohabit, contest, belong, and exclude. We find that quarantine borders are constantly being (re)made by forces outside NAQS's control, including through the practices of Yolngu Indigenous land-management staff and rangers, individual local residents, and diverse non-humans. Borders are revealed as active spaces produced in multiple locations at multiple scales. They are underpinned by diverse ontologies and are always more-than-human. This challenges the overly simplified view evoked within AQIS's public awareness material and the prevailing national discourse of defence, invasion, and fear. Through attention to quotidian practices of border making, different ways of understanding borderland geographies emerge. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Lock deterioration in a waterway network requires timely maintenance to maintain navigability and regular lockage service. Locks degrading over time have reduced capacities and increased service times. Because demand responds to service changes, the objective function maximizes the overall net benefits rather than the minimization of costs. To maximize the net benefits, it is important to schedule maintenance that preserves lock conditions above threshold values, provides minimum acceptable service, and reduces the risks of serious failures. With constrained budgets, network-level maintenance can be scheduled over a planning horizon. A waterway model that combines simulation and optimization was developed to allocate maintenance funds and to schedule maintenance tasks optimally. Numerical cases are evaluated by parallel processing. The promising demonstration of simulation-based optimization shows the applicability of the proposed methodology to network-level and component-level maintenance planning and scheduling. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, in order to achieve this task it is necessary to free Sloterdijk's thought from certain phantasms that beset and undermine the most promising of his categories. The first part of the paper consists of an exposition of some of the basic ideas regarding bubbles and globes (thus, following the first two volumes of the trilogy Sphären); and contends that it is not possible to pass from the first ( Blasen/bubbles) to the second ( Globen/globes) without losing the most critical and subversive elements concerning the task of rethinking the social sciences in their micro-anthropological dimensions. In the second part, against the account of Western metaphysics espoused by Sloterdijk but taking on board some of his most suggestive insights, a radically different materialist perspective is put to the test. Finally, the third part offers a summary of our differences. </jats:p>",

We argue that way-finding is better understood as a function of gender differences where gender is understood as a lived social relation, a product of the interaction between an embodied habitus and a particular social field. The use of survey versus landmark way-finding strategies is linked to an individual's gendered experiences of urban life. The study examines way-finding strategies from a sample of 127 gay men and lesbians from the Tallahassee, Florida metropolitan region to explore urban habitation patterns. We find that different way-finding strategies (most commonly a survey or landmark approach) are influenced by the habitus and gendered experiences of fear and anxiety in urban areas. Both bivariate and multivariate analyses suggest that individuals who perceive that their own gender presentation violates gender norms (gender dissonance) experience higher levels of social sanctions (harassment, hostility, and discrimination). In multivariate analysis, the study finds that gender-dissonant men tend to navigate using the landmark way-finding approach usually associated with women, whereas gender-dissonant women navigate using the survey way-finding approach usually associated with men. </jats:p>",

The discipline of organisational studies has adopted this concept to set out the primacy of good business practices, such as foretelling risk and opportunity. Government policy documents use the term where medium- and long-term goals are set out, for example, the New Zealand Ministry of Education's Pathways to the Future. A Ten-Year Strategic Plan for Early Childhood Education. This article uses Michel Foucault's methodology of genealogy to trace the emergence of the term ‘strategy’, its use in organisational studies, and its displacement to education, specifically early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The study by Richard Whipp into the effectiveness of strategic planning supports the problematising of the term. The study deconstructs some naturalised truths about the image of people, of time, and of analysts' reflexivity. It asks about the use of terms that originated in the military lexicon, such as ‘manoeuvres’, ‘strategy’, ‘target’, ‘plan’ and ‘risk’, but have slipped to that of business practices, retaining traces, however, of the original military intent. Foucault inverted the phrase that ‘politics is war by any other means' as institutions centralised control, set up supervision of populations, and collected statistics to plot changed patterns. This article examines some of the tracery that remains in such use of governmental language, and asks if this is the most appropriate lexicon for education. </jats:p>",

The use of Web Services for management allows the integration of low-level activities (e.g., retrieving monitoring information from gateways) with high-level business processes (e.g., creating a new product and its marketing strategy.) Despite clear advantages, Web Services-based management does not come for free; since Web Services are based on XML documents, its performance, compared with traditional management technologies, may represent an important drawback. This chapter covers the aspects of using Web Services for management focusing on the different interactions between managers and devices and the performance associated with it.</jats:p>"

Information is shared and participation in the Party of origin procedure by the public in affected as well as origin states is required (non-discrimination); these provisions are enhanced under the related Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters (Aarhus), which also contains provisions enabling enforcement. The purpose is to analyse whether EU citizens have greater opportunities to enforce these rights than citizens of state Parties to the two treaties that are not members of the EU. Procedure and practice under the transposing directives on EIA and public participation is examined, and conclusions are drawn that although to a large extent EU membership is advantageous to EU citizens involved with TEIA, certain constraints concerning public participation and access to justice remain.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The article suggests that the voluntary approach can be extremely useful to promote sustainable consumption and production provided that some essential conditions are met: voluntary commitments must be verifiable, they need the right level of ambition and they must involve a wide range of actors. In particular, the article explores the feasibility of developing a code of conduct for the retail sector.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Special attention is given to the topic of intelligent networking which represents the combination of software, technology, and electronic pathways that makes business process innovation possible for both large and small organizations alike. A central tenet is that the intelligent network is not one network, but a series of networks designed to enhance world-wide communication for business and residential users. Two very different kinds of intelligent networks are discussed in this chapter. The first involves satellite-to-cable television networking where the emphasis is on program distribution to the end consumer. The second is a supply chain management network where the emphasis is on just-in-time manufacturing. Each of the said networks represents a highly innovative business process and share the common goal of improving organizational performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We focus on the governance instrument of partnerships for rural areas, because these have become important for the implementation of rural development policy in Britain. Emergent forms of governance are often assumed to enhance participatory democracy as they facilitate the involvement of nongovernmental actors and citizens. However, governmental policies about partnerships often use ‘representation’ to democratically legitimise these new forms. Partnership members themselves also use these concepts in their everyday language—they too say that they represent and participate. We explore the different meanings of both being a representative and being a participant, based on a qualitative study of three local rural partnerships in Wales. Our analysis reveals important nuances in how four types of representatives (from the public, private, community, and voluntary sectors) differ in their perceived duties and attitudes towards their constituencies. But, above all, most partnership members see themselves rather as participants than as representatives. However, partnership members can also hide behind being participants in two ways. First, they can downplay their organisational membership and their organisation's self-interest. Partnership members who most actively participate in ‘driving the partnership forward’ are also those who have the most self-interest in doing so. And, second, they do not have to worry about accountability mechanisms because their individualised participation has been decoupled from responsiveness to ‘others’. The neoliberal notions of participation obscure the political nature of working in partnership where decisions over rural development have to be made among members with different and possibly conflicting interests. </jats:p>",

This paper reviews the experience of local government in England, where just such a transformation has been brought forward in the past decade. Since 2001, local transport authorities have been required to develop a 5-year transport strategy with a series of key performance indicators and to set targets to be achieved. Over the past 5 years the levels of funding awarded to these authorities have varied according to factors including the quality of the plan, the robustness of the analysis underpinning projections, the delivery of planned schemes, and the achievement of the targets set. The paper presents the findings of two research projects conducted from 2003 to 2008 in collaboration with 20 local transport authorities. It describes the nature of the planning system that has brought about the organizational change. It then provides, on the basis of the research, a series of advantages and disadvantages that the new system has generated before presenting some solutions that have been developed to reduce the downsides. Some conclusions about the role of performance management and rewards and organizational targets are drawn for both the managing and participating agencies. </jats:p>",

We subsequently investigated the spatial dependence of these estimates. Results suggest the existence of positive spatial autocorrelation for all rural landscape attributes. As a means of benefit transfer, kriging methods were employed to interpolate WTP estimates across the whole of the Republic of Ireland.

Basing our work on a literature review and on our own direct observations, we construct a model that explains the development of LA21 processes. We term it the ‘isolated, supported, and connected’ (ISC) framework. Our model attempts to make a contribution to (1) LA21 literature and (2) policy network literature. On the one hand, previous LA21 literature discussed factors that hold back and drive LA21 processes, but a comprehensive conceptual framework has not been constructed. Our model integrates the different variables within a single conceptual ISC framework. On the other hand, conceptual policy network literature holds that fully connected models ought to be superior to less connected, or isolated, models, but empirical evidence is scanty and inconclusive. Our research supports the conclusion that policy networks are superior in terms of disseminating LA21 processes. </jats:p>",

Current research indicates that today's requirements justify theoretically sound selection and training processes for these personnel. Through discussion of a three-stage study, this paper addresses how this workplace is changing. The first stage was to interview, by scenario analysis, 20 experts with industrial, administrative, research-centered, and operational backgrounds, about the factors that influence the workplace and the tasks of operators employed there. In the second stage, the experts were asked to rate the consistency and probability of the top 10 influencing factors. In the third stage, the most consistent probable scenario was presented to 17 personnel working in TMCs. The operators were asked to rate the perceived requirements of the scenario with an enhanced version of the Fleishman Job Analysis Survey. These results, then compared with earlier research, indicated a general increase of requirements and a change in the character of the job; operators will be asked to judge and make decisions instead of monitoring traffic flow. This change will lead to an increase of all decision-related requirements, most notably, cognitive, interactive, and social requirements will increase. </jats:p>",

We first reviewed the government plans on home network services in the early stage of evolution. Second, consumer value expectations and current home network service levels were examined to understand the issues regarding weak diffusion of home network services. Next, we investigated business interests of the industrial participants comprising convergent home network services, and explored the causes of conflicts among them. On the base of the analyses, we offered policy suggestions from digital convergence perspective to help removing the obstacles that hinder business cooperation among industrial participants of the home network industry.

The authors believe that some of the issues may be commonly observed world-wide and the solutions to the problems should be sought by the international cooperation of engineering geologists. Engineering geology needs to be an autonomous field of science and should provide educational systems to foster engineering geologists who can work together on an equal footing with professionals from other disciplines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The lack of solid footing in political space is what makes the human rights claims of refugees most vulnerable in the contemporary international order. However, modern international human rights law and protection are predicated on a spatialised sense of the subject of rights that is formed in opposition to and in exclusion of the refugee. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) seeks to locate refugees as part of the universe of human rights through refugee registration exercises; it attempts to map their displacement within the geography of emplaced citizenry. Its conventional efforts in this regard fail, though, and, rather, serve to illustrate how the informal international movement of refugees still exceeds and, thus, undermines the universalism of the UN vision of human rights and freedoms. Consequently, the UNHCR has recently resorted to the highly sophisticated computerised registration technology, called proGres, under its Project Profile system. While the detail and complexity of Project Profile allow for a mapping no more capable of accurately tracing the movements of refugees within the global geography of universal human rights, the complex of digitalised mapping systems brought together within Project Profile permit the production and performance of an international space in which humanitarians may expect refugees to fit. The force of the UNHCR's new registration system is to produce a manner of spatialising refugees that can legitimate and moralise their constraint within orders of international politics and security which allow little room for response to the rights claims of refugees. Rather, their claims to human rights become foreclosed within a virtual understanding of human displacement with respect to emplacement in the state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the relatively new field of social-activity travel behavior research, it has often been stated that social relationships have become increasingly physically dispersed in various contemporary societies. If so, this dynamic has enormous consequences on both travel behavior and social support. More explicitly, people have to travel some distance in order to meet, they need to plan their social activities further ahead of time, and, sociologically speaking, they are at risk of weakening their relationships to friends, immediate family, relatives, etc due to spatial distance. In this paper a binominal logit model was used to examine the characteristics of Swiss citizens who had named nonlocal strong-tie relationships in a nationwide representative survey. The empirical findings show various characteristics that increase the likelihood of having strong-tie relationships outside one's community, such as one-person households, higher education, younger cohorts, long-distance commuting, and, interestingly, people who want to spend more time with friends. I elaborate a discussion of these findings as they concern recent debates in the field of social-activity travel behavior. </jats:p>",

In this paper we assess China's pilot programme and analyze how it has been constrained by major problems in three areas of governance capacities: state, policy, and administrative capacities. These problems reflect deeper and more profound dilemmas of market transition experienced by the Chinese government in the past three decades. The dilemmas have resulted in the development of a ‘state-led’ pseudomarket, instead of a full and ‘autonomous’ market, for emission trading in China. It is evidently clear that China still faces many challenges in establishing a market for emission trading which require strengthening its governing capacity in order to address effectively the issues of the rule of law, independent regulation, information disclosure, and public accountability. </jats:p>",

This system (developing code: JCDS-FX) builds on fundamental technologies of JCDS (JAEA Computation Dosimetry System) which has been applied to actual BNCT trials at Japan Research Reactor No.4 (JRR-4). Basic technologies of JCDS have been taken over to JCDS-FX, and some new functions have been built into the system. One of features of the JCDS-FX is that PHITS as a multi-purpose particle Monte-Carlo transport code has been applied to particle transport calculation. Application of PHITS enables to evaluate doses for neutrons and photons as well as protons and heavy ions. Therefore, the JCDS-FX with PHITS can perform treatment planning for not only BNCT but also particle radiotherapy. To verify calculation accuracy of the JCDS-FX with PHITS, dose evaluations for neutron irradiation of a cylindrical water phantom and for an actual clinical trial conducted at JRR-4 were performed. The verification results indicated that JCDS-FX is applicable to BNCT treatment planning in practical use. Further verifications of the system are being performed to achieve practical application of the system in the future. And in addition to the BNCT, investigations for application of the system to any other particle radiotherapy like proton therapy are carried forward.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores how earmarking in federal transportation spending alters the decision-making environment for metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and their members. Congress may designate earmarks to fund projects without regard to metropolitan (and state) transportation planning decisions. This raises questions about earmarking's impacts on metropolitan transportation planning. This work explores the interface between metropolitan transportation decision making and congressional earmarking through 55 open-ended interviews with transportation stakeholders across the nation. Interviewees–-identified by emergent sampling–-include metropolitan, state, and local transportation leaders, congressional staff, lobbyists, and national interest group representatives. In particular, the paper explores the earmark pursuit practices of MPOs and their members. These actors employ three different models for influencing earmarks. Some proactively request specific projects; others await opportunities to consult on earmark candidates; and still others remain on the sidelines. The paper discusses the models and contemplates the institutional consequences of earmarking for metropolitan planning. It observes that opportunities to influence earmarks have increased. Organizations involved in metropolitan and state transportation planning largely report that their earmarking involvement has shifted either from some involvement to more routine involvement, or from no involvement to some involvement. However, it concludes that the predominant patterns of organizational relationships in earmarking seem more likely to undercut metropolitan planning, either directly by yielding earmarked projects that are not regional priorities or indirectly by bypassing the MPO as a decision-making forum. </jats:p>",

Building on a view of place as ‘becoming’, we examine how the accessibility of community amenities and the in-place production and maintenance of social practices contribute to the cohesiveness of neighbourhoods and the social capital resources available to parents. We draw on a 2002–03 study of experiences of Maori, Pakeha (European), and Samoan parents residing in six diverse Auckland neighbourhoods. Analysis of the parents' narratives highlight aspects of the neighbourhood environment that give meaning to participants' daily experiences of parenting, and foster or impede the social relations of place. Beyond purely locational issues, the nuanced relationships between material and sociocultural resources of neighbourhood profoundly influence local patterns of parenting practice. We conclude that place matters in parenting but the salience of the neighbourhood for accessing material and social capital resources varies for parents of different ethnic groups. ‘Jumping’ spatial scale to meet resource needs through the active creation of amenities was more common for minority ethnic groups. </jats:p>",

Taking this question as a point of departure, we analyze local climate mitigation as a case of multilevel network governance. This is illustrated by the case of two Swedish cities, which are both involved in city networking in favour of climate-change mitigation. Different business structures and other local conditions in significant ways influence both the level of ambition and the climate-policy strategies of the two cities. The sheer size and intensity of the networking activities clearly illustrate the fact that cities are increasingly becoming arenas of globalization, rather than passive victims of global forces, thus confirming the call for a multilevel network-governance approach in policy and politics as well as in research. </jats:p>",

A conceptual framework is offered for explaining the heterogeneity of retailer performance in international markets, and three types of explanation are considered: the timing and mode of market entry and subsequent expansion, factors that allow the exercise of upstream market power, and sensitivity to issues of labour organization and standards. The two retailers are found to be differentially impacted by those factors, indicating the need to consider a process of institutional hybridization as central to the explanation of transnational retail performance. </jats:p>",

Varying in size, shape, and purpose, man-made islands are looming on the horizons of an increasing number of aspiring global cities and regions at the margins of global capitalism. From the Persian Gulf to the Black Sea, from the Caribbean to the North Sea, artificial islands are increasingly embraced as spectacular, technical signifiers of global participation and urban economic progress: as the ‘new cultural icons’. Appropriated in different contexts, island projects, however, can be (and are) also resignified. They thus change in form, meaning, and use. While islands have been objects of renewed interest in cultural and historical geography, surprisingly, these new man-made landforms seem to have gone largely unnoticed. This paper suggests a research agenda to engage with artificial islands as a new ‘metageographical’ category of emergent, yet historically resonant, social space. </jats:p>",

Integrating complex and often uncertain information into spatial PVA models requires that comprehensive sensitivity analyses be applied to explore the influence of spatial and nonspatial parameters on model predictions. We reviewed 87 analyses of spatial demographic PVA models of plants and animals to identify common approaches to sensitivity analysis in recent publications. In contrast to best practices recommended in the broader modeling community, sensitivity analyses of spatial PVAs were typically ad hoc, inconsistent, and difficult to compare. Most studies applied local approaches to sensitivity analyses, but few varied multiple parameters simultaneously. A lack of standards for sensitivity analysis and reporting in spatial PVAs has the potential to compromise the ability to learn collectively from PVA results, accurately interpret results in cases where model relationships include nonlinearities and interactions, prioritize monitoring and management actions, and ensure conservation‐planning decisions are robust to uncertainties in spatial and nonspatial parameters. Our review underscores the need to develop tools for global sensitivity analysis and apply these to spatial PVA.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we seek to demonstrate the continued utility of research into the social production of scale in relation to the politics of natural-resource distribution, ownership, and control. While traditionally oriented toward sociospatial theory and urban governance, research has begun to convey the importance of scale as a discursive framing device at the center of multiple kinds of environmental politics. Our approach draws from recent literature to show the material-discursive ‘difference that nature makes’ in constituting the grounds of scalar struggle in mineral development. We argue that the fixity of certain natural-resource deposits and the concomitant local socioecological impact of extraction stands in stark contradiction to the multiscalar forces that vie over their development. Our central argument is that this contradiction ensures that struggles over natural-resource development are necessarily struggles over scale—the scale of ownership and the scale of distributional benefits and costs. The politics of natural resources must be couched in scalar terms and those who gain access to resources must build stable institutional–scalar platforms for the production of resource wealth. We illustrate this through an analysis of US Congressional debate over reform of the infamous ‘1872 Mining Law’ in 1993 as an exemplary moment of scalar politics. In this case, we not only attempt to show how the concept of scale frames these debates, but also how the failure to reform the 19th-century law allowed for the institutional materialization of particular scalar conduits for capital accumulation in the mining sector. </jats:p>",

This paper reports on a quantitative study of the impact of the residential context on working arrangements and commuting arrangements of partners in couple and family households. Using multinomial logistic regression, we analysed data from the 2002 Netherlands Housing Demand Survey and the 2004 ABF Real Estate Monitor. The results show a (gendered) effect of residential location in terms of degree of urbanisation and job access on both working and commuting arrangements. Good access to jobs makes it more likely that couples have a symmetric full-time working arrangement and also more likely that both partners work far away from home. Those in symmetric full-time working arrangements are also those most likely to be in symmetric close commuting arrangements. This finding reflects the substantial time pressure on such households. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Netherlands is vulnerable to flooding by the sea and major European rivers. Climate change, socio-economic developments in low-lying areas and continuing land subsidence have significantly increased the risk of flooding. Real problems are expected to arise if the sea level rises to such an extent that river water can no longer discharge into sea, leading to safety risks in large areas of the country. The flood protection policies for the rivers being developed by the Dutch government have recently shown a shift from building ever higher and stronger dikes towards nature development (habitat creation and repair) and giving rivers more space (the Room for the River programme), since a more natural river system is regarded as the best protection against climate change. The implementation of this major transformation in the area along and between the major Dutch rivers requires many different public authorities and private stakeholders to cooperate in such a way that their different values, beliefs, needs and interests merge into coordinated action. Attempts to realize the high policy ambitions for the area along the rivers have led to a regional, multi-stakeholder initiative. The underlying philosophy of this approach is governance, that is, coordinated action by actors representing the government, the business community and civil society to cope with complex societal problems. A Dutch project in the river basin of the Rhine &amp;ndash; called Gelderse Poort &amp;ndash; is used here as a case study to show what governance with respect to climate adaptation policies might mean in practice. The chapter also shows the impact of unexpected events such as extremely high water levels in rivers on ongoing planning and policy processes.</jats:p>"

In the coming decades, ports are likely to experience higher sea levels and storm surges, as well as other direct and indirect impacts, due to climate change. Most ports do not appear to be thinking about, let alone actively preparing to address, the effects of climate change. Ports do not have specific information about either the types of impacts that they can expect on their facilities or the probabilities of different types of impacts occurring. Although climate change science is making considerable advances, projections of impacts at levels smaller than the regional scale are not available. In addition, ports’ typical planning processes are ill equipped to respond to the high levels of uncertainty associated with the impacts of climate change, the timescales of climate change, and the geographical scale of climate change. The data that ports typically use for planning purposes do not incorporate climate change forecasts. Some ports also believe that climate change does not pose an immediate threat to their facilities. However, several ports are beginning to think about how to prepare for climate change. These include the Port of Miami (Miami, Florida), the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Massachusetts Port Authority, the Port of Seattle (Seattle, Washington), the Port of Corpus Christi (Corpus Christi, Texas), and the Georgia Ports Authority. To help these and other ports assess their risk, more and better data are needed, as well as better planning tools and methods. </jats:p>",

Recently, there has been an emphasis on improving the adequacy of conservation area design to promote the persistence and future generation of biodiversity. Few studies have explored incorporating ecological and evolutionary processes into conservation planning assessments. Biodiversity in Australia is maintained and generated by numerous ecological and evolutionary processes at various spatial and temporal scales. We accommodated ecological and evolutionary processes in four ways: (1) using sub‐catchments as planning units to facilitate the protection of the integrity and function of ecosystem processes occurring on a sub‐catchment scale; (2) targeting one type of ecological refugia, drought refugia, which are critical for the persistence of many species during widespread drought; (3) targeting one type of evolutionary refugia which are important for maintaining and generating unique biota during long‐term climatic changes; and (4) preferentially grouping priority areas along vegetated waterways to account for the importance of connected waterways and associated riparian areas in maintaining processes. We identified drought refugia, areas of relatively high and regular herbage production in arid and semiarid Australia, from estimates of gross primary productivity derived from satellite data. In this paper, we combined the novel incorporation of these processes with a more traditional framework of efficiently representing a comprehensive sample of biodiversity to identify spatial priorities across Australia. We explored the trade‐offs between economic costs, representation targets, and connectivity. Priority areas that considered ecological and evolutionary processes were more connected along vegetated waterways and were identified for a small increase in economic cost. Priority areas for conservation investment are more likely to have long‐term benefits to biodiversity if ecological and evolutionary processes are considered in their identification.</jats:p>",

The long central span, the 270m high pylons and the sag ratio of 1/9 will secure 18,000TEU-class shipping serviceability, reduce risk of ship collision, diminish the size of anchorage, and reduce the construction cost. By introducing twin box girder, the aerodynamic stability of this bridge could be guaranteed. The most optimized section of twin box girder suppressing the vortex shedding vibration and minimizing the drag force coefficient could be found through wind tunnel tests.

Many planners and conservation scientists have called for broader use of planning and regulatory tools to support the conservation of biodiversity at local scales. Yet little is known about the pervasiveness of these practices. We conducted an on‐line survey of county, municipal, and tribal planning directors</jats:italic>(n =<jats:italic>116</jats:italic>)<jats:italic>in 3 geographic regions of the United States: metropolitan Seattle, Washington; metropolitan Des Moines, Iowa; and the Research Triangle, North Carolina. Our objectives were to gauge the extent to which local planning departments address biodiversity conservation and to identify factors that facilitate or hinder conservation actions in local planning. We found that biodiversity conservation was seldom a major consideration in these departments. Staff time was mainly devoted to development mandates and little time was spent on biodiversity conservation. Regulations requiring conservation actions that might benefit biodiversity were uncommon, with the exception of rules governing water quality in all 3 regions and the protection of threatened and endangered species in the Seattle region. Planning tools that could enhance habitat conservation were used infrequently. Collaboration across jurisdictions was widespread, but rarely focused on conservation. Departments with a conservation specialist on staff tended to be associated with higher levels of conservation actions. Jurisdictions in the Seattle region also reported higher levels of conservation action, largely driven by state and federal mandates. Increased funding was most frequently cited as a factor that would facilitate greater consideration of biodiversity in local planning. There are numerous opportunities for conservation biologists to play a role in improving conservation planning at local scales.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

We construct and analyse a unique evidence base of the labour-market circumstances at the neighbourhood level. We use the 2001 Census data for England and Wales to examine the impact of age, sex, birthplace, and educational qualifications on the employment of ethnic minorities nationally. We compute locally expected employment on the basis of these relationships and local characteristics, and compare it with locally observed employment. Our analysis demonstrates that 1.1 million new jobs are required to bring every ethnic group in every locality up to the average England and Wales employment rate. National ethnic-group differences account for most of this local job deficit; local variation in demographic composition and human capital account for a smaller proportion of the jobs deficit. Residual neighbourhood effects have both a geography common to each ethnic group (for example, a gradient of higher jobs deficits in the Midlands, the North of England, and Wales), and some group-specific characteristics (for example, more favourable outcomes for Pakistani and Bangladeshi groups in the North than might have been expected). The findings and approach allow targeting employment policies geographically and thematically. In addition, the on-line evidence base ( http://asp.ccsr.ac.uk/dwp ) is a public resource which can be used to investigate local outcomes and to prioritise remedial action. </jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to explore how environmental problems can provide an information key for planning and developing the management system for the Seymareh River basin. In this regard, the methodology for developing platform was participatory action plan development (PAPD) and involves a series of linked local workshops where different stakeholders participate separately and together to develop a management plan for the common resources they use. As the results show, enhancing public awareness of options for integrated river basin management and developing and strengthening at the local level, as appropriate, research and monitoring capabilities pertaining to the conservation of the Seymareh River basin are determined, especially in relation to environmental health parameters. The availability of finances, generation and availability of information and cooperation among stakeholders were all addressed as challenges to its implementation by participants for effective management (planning) in the Seymareh River basin. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper advocates the importance of selecting appropriate measures of effectiveness (MOE) for evacuation planning and optimization purposes. In addition to evacuation time, which is often the choice MOE used by many practitioners, this paper also presents several increasingly more complex and useful MOEs that consider average evacuee travel time, delay, and temporal–spatial-based exposure risks. By studying a real-world transportation network in the event of a hypothetical nuclear power plant incident, the paper demonstrates that the superiority of one evacuation plan (or an optimization strategy) over others is highly dependent on the MOE selected for evaluation. Optimization efforts based on a single and ill-chosen MOE may not yield the best evacuation plan, as one might expect. The overall space-based or time- and space-based risk exposure may be increased if the optimization process is focused on travel time or some other time-based measure alone. Depending on the specifics of an emergency scenario (e.g., disaster type, risk components, and time constraints), an appropriate MOE should be chosen judiciously to make sure the optimization process for the evacuation plan is not wasted. This paper also demonstrates a multiobjective optimization approach for planning and designing an evacuation plan. With combined space-based risk and the travel time in route searching and traffic assignment, better destination assignment (and improved evacuation efficiency) may be obtained. The findings here should provide insights for future efforts toward assessing, improving, and optimizing evacuation plans. </jats:p>",

The UK NIHR HTA multicentre COMICE trial considered whether adding an MRI scan to conventional triple assessment (mammogram, ultrasound and biopsy) assisted loco-regional staging and thereby reduced re-operation rates, for patients with primary breast cancer scheduled for wide local excision.&amp;#x2028; The primary endpoint of the COMICE trial considered the proportion of patients undergoing a repeat operation or mastectomy at further surgery within six months of randomisation, or an avoidable mastectomy at initial surgery (re-operation rate). This was compared using logistic regression adjusting for age, breast density, and surgeon.&amp;#x2028; Between December 2001 and January 2007 1625 patients were randomised to receive MRI (817) or not (808). Re-operation rate within six months (primary outcome) was 18.8% (MRI) and 19.3% (no MRI). No significant difference between the arms was detected (odds ratio=0.96, 95% CI=[0.75, 1.24], p=0.7691).

Increasing efficiency by adopting well‐designed, reliable processes can simultaneously reduce costs and improve quality.</jats:p>",

This paper also includes a literature review to trace the evolution of transportation classes and education over time. Along with the survey on course content, the manuscript presents an analysis of the spatial distribution of transportation courses and in particular of transportation planning courses. The study finds that educational opportunities in transportation planning are widely distributed across the nation and that students are able to take advantage of the opportunities. However, some planning programs stand out for offering a wider variety of relevant topics, and those programs are concentrated on the coasts. Relatively little is known about the affect of geography on the allocation of resources in transportation education. Transportation educators have multiple opportunities for exploring new topics and methods, such as by including globalization and comparative study, promoting transportation planning knowledge across different educational levels, and continuing to monitor and evaluate higher education and training programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An ongoing challenge worldwide has been to attract sufficient numbers of new people into transportation careers. When trying to understand what transportation engineering is about, many people often find that examples of practical applications are particularly useful. In this way, people acquire initial interest in a problem and then realize its real-world application to a career in transportation. Recently, funds donated to the University of Canterbury in New Zealand were used to develop an interactive transportation display board for both existing and prospective students. The display represents a landscape on which a new road route would be determined. The display surface is subdivided into hexagonal sections, each with a “cost” reflecting the relative difficulty of road construction in that location (e.g., due to mountains, rivers, or development). Magnetic road elements (each with a value reflecting the costs to road users) are then placed on the display to create a connection between the chosen endpoints. The intention is that the display's users determine the most optimal road alignment for minimizing construction costs, road user costs, or both. Since its creation, the display has been used at various sites, both on campus and at career expos, and has proven to be immensely popular with visitors. The display's potential as an educational tool for use in math, science, or geography classes has also been identified. This paper outlines the development of the display, its applications to date, and the transportation lessons the display can highlight. </jats:p>",

Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be a useful imaging modality for invasive cancer, its role and impact in preoperative surgical planning for DCIS is unclear. Our aim is to determine if women diagnosed with pure DCIS on core-biopsy who have preoperative MRI are more likely to undergo mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Methods: Retrospective survey of women diagnosed with pure DCIS on stereotactic core biopsy between 2000-2007 at an academic tertiary referral center. All women underwent definitive surgical treatment for DCIS. Patient characteristics, surgical planning and surgical outcomes were compared between patients who underwent preoperative MRI and those without MRI. Continuous variables among the two groups were compared using the t-test. Differences in dichotomous variables between groups were compared using the chi-square test. Significance was determined if p&amp;lt;0.05. Results: Of 137 women diagnosed with DCIS, 39 underwent preoperative MRI. Mean age, DCIS size and grade, and presence of invasive cancer on surgical specimen were compared between the two groups. The only significant difference between the two groups was younger mean age in the group with preoperative MRI (51 vs 59 yrs, p=0.001). On univariate analysis, mastectomy and SLNB were more commonly employed in the MRI group. The mastectomy rate was 55% for women who had preoperative MRI and 17% for those who did not (p&amp;lt;0.0001). The SLNB rate was 46% for women had preoperative MRI and 23% for those who did not (p=0.009). Number of re-excisions, margin status and size were compared between the two groups. Preoperative MRI was not significantly associated with wider surgical margins or higher proportion of patients with negative margins. However, the mean number of re-excisions was lower in women who underwent preoperative MRI (0.7 vs. 1.2, p=0.003). The only independent factor associated with likelihood of preoperative MRI in the setting of DCIS was patient age. On multivariate analysis, use of SLNB was independently associated with mastectomy, DCIS size and DCIS grade (p=0.0001, p=0.011, p=0.024, respectively). In contrast, independent predictors of mastectomy were DCIS size and use of MRI (OR 5.1, 95% CI 2.0-13.2)). Conclusion: Women who underwent preoperative MRI for DCIS were younger and more likely to undergo mastectomy. However, women who had preoperative MRI required a lower number of re-excisions to obtain negative margins. Our study cannot address whether the strong association between preoperative MRI and mastectomy is a causal one. Nevertheless our data support a critical need for future studies to further define the benefit as well as consequences of the use of MRI for DCIS evaluation and treatment.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Citation Information: Cancer Res 2009;69(2 Suppl):Abstract nr 1163.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Road freight transportation has increased dramatically over recent years, as have accompanying impacts such as congestion, noise, and pollution. As a result, European governments and the U.S. government started implementing policies to promote alternatives to road transportation, such as logistic chains containing a short sea shipping (SSS) link. Shipping by road is a more flexible means of transportation than shipping by sea, which is usually cheaper. Therefore, to move traffic to SSS chains, it is necessary to provide fast, frequent, and reliable maritime transportation. In this sense, roll-on–roll-off (RoRo) vessels are the most convenient types of vehicles to be used because they have shorter dwell times in port. Therefore, the level of this kind of traffic is likely to increase dramatically. To cope with the increase in traffic, terminal managers must decide whether a change in the terminal's operation would suffice or whether the enlargement or construction of a new terminal, given the level of service provided, is necessary. This paper proposes a methodology that can be used to relate the level of service in a RoRo terminal to its capacity from the ship's point of view. This goal is achieved by using several quality indicators that, in turn, should allow terminal managers to foresee what the level of service that they offer to shipping companies would be, given the numbers of arrivals and their distribution, as well as the terminal's performance. The paper ends by applying the methodology to a real terminal in Barcelona, Spain. </jats:p>",

Although the effects of many other variables are estimated, the focus is on the effects of location (in-home versus out-of-home) and log-sum (measure of travel characteristics) variables. The inclusion of several other variables (household and individual characteristics and activity attributes) allows controlling for many factors affecting this choice and increases the explanatory power of the models. The results of the models reveal that the effects of location and travel characteristics on planning time horizon choice vary among different activity types. Toward a better understanding and quantification of the effects of location and travel attributes, the probabilities of planning the activities in different time horizons are estimated separately for in-home and out-of-home, and with an incremental increase in the logsum. Results reveal that the household obligations and active activities are very sensitive to travel characteristics; therefore, significant changes in the planning and execution of these activities may be expected with changes in the transportation system characteristics. The results of this study enhance the understanding of relationships between travel time, cost, availability of transportation modes, and the activity planning process. </jats:p>",

To date, it is not well understood what factors affect group behavior as the planning group prepares for data-informed decision making. In this observational case study, the authors videotaped 18 meetings of a community planning group (CPG) to observe how a group's behavior changes over time in response to modifications in its structure and function. Discussions on authority and conflict were common, particularly during presentations on prioritized populations and interventions. Changes in the frequency of data-informed discussions were not statistically significant. Observed group conflict may have been an unintended consequence of efforts to improve equity. The authors suggest that formal and informal mechanisms to manage conflict and agreed-on procedures for decision making should be incorporated into the technical assistance offered to CPGs. Future studies should address whether data-informed decisions increase once contentious issues are resolved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Operational models of the household activity-scheduling process have emerged recently. These models replicate the sequence of decisions that leads to observed patterns of human activities and travel, including which activities to conduct, with whom, for how long, at what time and location, and by what mode. Activity priority has been suggested as an important dimension in such scheduling models, particularly as a determinant for the choice and sequencing of activities. The importance of intrahousehold interactions, joint activities in particular, has led to a rapid expansion of research on this topic. However, within most scheduling models, joint activities have been addressed, at best, by assuming that they are preplanned relative to independent activities. Within this context, two important issues concerning the planning of joint activities are explored: the extent to which joint activities are preplanned and whether male and female householders share the same priority when scheduling joint activities. The data set used for the study was the 2003 Computerized Household Activity Scheduling Elicitor survey for Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which recorded information about when a particular activity was planned by respondents. In the analysis, bivariate probit models are estimated for two scheduling alternatives (impulsive or preplanned) for husband and wife. Overall, the empirical results highlight the need to move beyond static priority assumptions for determining the sequencing of activities to develop a behaviorally sound model for activity scheduling. Furthermore, differences in planning priority across individual participants should be taken into account. </jats:p>",

Research was done to analyze factors influencing the actual activity scheduling process by using detailed activity travel data from an extensive data set collected in Flanders (Belgium). A model examines the attributes that influence activity planning; a second model analyzes the factors that affect activity rescheduling. The explanatory variables considered in both models are individual, household, activity, and schedule attributes, and their impact is analyzed by using mixed logit models. Random effects are added to the models to test for within-individual variance. The results reveal that activity and schedule characteristics considerably affect activity planning. The rescheduling model also has several highly significant activity and schedule attributes. Most individual and household attributes considered do not influence activity planning and rescheduling behavior, although strong statistical evidence indicates that individual-specific preferences for planning and rescheduling determine the process of activity scheduling. </jats:p>",

This extension will pass through the suburban community of Reston, Virginia, where two stops will be located. Safe and adequate pedestrian and bicycle access to the stations will increase station use, reduce congestion in and out of the stations, and make transit a more attractive alternative. People living or working within the surrounding areas should be offered a choice of different modes for travel to and from a station, whether walking, biking, driving, or taking the bus. In addition to the provision of adequate facilities for each of those modes, those facilities must also be safe. The impression that intended routes for pedestrians are unsafe is often enough to deter people from walking. The pedestrian intersection safety index, recently developed for FHWA, was used to determine the suitability and safety for pedestrians of intersections surrounding proposed stations. These measures use readily available data to produce a quantitative rating of the safety of intersections. Recommendations for physical improvements were developed for 38 intersections within 1 mi of the station entrances. These projects were then prioritized for implementation on the basis of several factors, including safety measures. This process discovered some benefits and constraints associated with the implementation of the model. Furthermore, most of the intersections with poor safety ratings were also identified as unsafe locations by members of the community. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Global climate change (GCC) has emerged in recent years as the highest-profile environmental issue of the early 21st century. Transportation institutions at all levels of government face significant challenges in effectively addressing GCC in terms of both the adaptation of the transportation system to the impacts of GCC and the mitigation of transportation's contribution to GCC. These challenges stem in large part from the fragmentation of decision making within and across governmental levels, the consequent mismatch of political boundaries, and the nature of options for effectively addressing GCC. This paper discusses these challenges and proposes a conceptual framework for rethinking how transportation institutions may more effectively address the connection between transportation and GCC. It includes an assessment of the current state and metropolitan planning activities related to GCC and the perspectives of various planning practitioners from across the United States. It also articulates several of the key institutional elements necessary for a GCC-responsive transportation agency, including entrepreneurial leadership, an appropriate geographic jurisdiction, a multi-disciplinary organizational structure, appropriately aligned funding and planning structures, and adequate planning and implementation authority. Finally, it also offers several suggestions on potential research needs associated with climate change and transportation institutional change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In adaptive radiation therapy the treatment planning kilovoltage CT (kVCT) images need to be registered with daily CT images. Daily megavoltage CT (MVCT) images are generally noisier than the kVCT images. In addition, in the abdomen, low image contrast, differences in bladder filling, differences in bowel, and rectum filling degrade image usefulness and make deformable image registration very difficult. The authors have developed a procedure to overcome these difficulties for better deformable registration between the abdominal kVCT and MVCT images. The procedure includes multiple image preprocessing steps and a two deformable registration steps. The image preprocessing steps include MVCT noise reduction, bowel gas pockets detection and painting, contrast enhancement, and intensity manipulation for critical organs. The first registration step is carried out in the local region of the critical organs (bladder, prostate, and rectum). It requires structure contours of these critical organs on both kVCT and MVCT to obtain good registration accuracy on these critical organs. The second registration step uses the first step results and registers the entire image with less intensive computational requirement. The two‐step approach improves the overall computation speed and works together with these image preprocessing steps to achieve better registration accuracy than a regular single step registration. The authors evaluated the procedure on multiple image datasets from prostate cancer patients and gynecological cancer patients. Compared to rigid alignment, the proposed method improves volume matching by over 60% for the critical organs and reduces the prostate landmark registration errors by 50%.</jats:p>",

SEMCOG is in the early stages of developing its 2035 regional transportation plan (RTP). As part of its planning process, SEMCOG is implementing a new approach for prioritizing transportation investments. The objectives of this effort are to ( a) build consensus on the region's transportation priorities and help ensure that the projects included in the RTP support these priorities, ( b) provide decision makers with the quantitative information needed to understand fully the consequences of their investment choices, and ( c) enable SEMCOG to develop an RTP that is realistic in terms of how much it will cost and how much it can achieve. SEMCOG's investment prioritization process consists of defining measures of effectiveness, analyzing the relationship between funding and performance in each of its goal areas, and presenting the results to decision makers in a manner that helps them reach a consensus on long-range funding and performance targets for the region. This paper describes each step in SEMCOG's prioritization process and presents the results of the analysis that was used to facilitate an initial round of target-setting discussions. It presents a comprehensive example of how an agency has incorporated performance measures and targets into their regional planning process. </jats:p>",

Only limited information about the occurrence and the types of haemoglobin abnormalities is available. Thus, an educational and screening programme was carried out in one high school with a total of 217 young students from the coastal province of Lushnja in Albania. The pilot programme included a systematic sampling of whole saliva, DNA genomic extraction and the determination of defective β-thalassaemia genes by reverse dot-blot hybridization with 22 probes specific for the Mediterranean populations.Of the 201 subjects tested, 17 (8.4%) students turned out to be carriers of β-thalassaemia mutations and haemoglobin variants. The most common mutation is HbS (c.20A→T) with a frequency of 3.2%, followed by IVS-I-110 (G→A) (c.93-21G→A) substitution identified in 4 out of 402 chromosomes (1%). In the province of Lushnja, the frequency of β-thalassaemia carriers was high. As expected, the results show that identified mutations in this population are similar to those found in the east Mediterranean area, suggesting the same origin for mutant alleles during migratory streams. Implementation of a routine carrier-screening programme is significantly facilitated by the presence of only two mutations and would be a wise approach to prevent β-thalassaemia in the region.</jats:p>"

First, confusion can be present between the innovation construct (in this instance, replacing the enterprise systems) and the diffusion construct (that is, selling that innovation to upper management). Second, the business case has never been examined in diffusion research. Research about business cases generally focuses on techniques such as Discounted Cash Flows and Total Cost of Ownership. Third, although a good business case can lead to successful innovation, it should not influence upper management to be overly positive or too cautious. One extreme leads to over-commitment. The other extreme leads to under-commitment or upper management’s inability to commit. Both extremes have unexpected and undesirable consequences. This single-case study examined a business case. The data included in the triangulation are observations, in-depth interviews, and archival documents. The analysis of a business case document was done with the ATLAS.ti v5.0 software. It is hoped that understanding a “real world” business case will give the academics insights on the relationship between the innovation and its diffusion as well as teach the practitioners the caveats of a business case.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems with dedicated lanes have shown advantages over traditional bus systems and have attracted more transit riders. However, it is not always possible to build BRT systems with double dedicated lanes because of physical and cost constraints. A BRT system with a single dedicated lane is more practical in such situations. In a single-lane configuration, buses approaching from opposite directions have to share the same road section and can overtake or pass each other only at the bus stops. An optimization model is proposed to describe the synchronization requirements of the BRT buses with the objective of minimizing the total travel and dwell time. The computational results show that a BRT system with a single dedicated lane yields total travel time that is similar to that of a BRT system with double dedicated lanes when the headway is not short (e.g., more than 20 min). In addition, to address possible delay at intersections, a simple speed control algorithm is implemented to adjust the bus speed in real time if the bus is delayed considerably. A microscopic simulation based on VISSIM is conducted to examine the impacts of the BRT bus on other traffic and the performance of the speed control. The simulation result shows that the speed control effectively handles the delay in the intersection and the other traffic is rarely affected by the speed control. </jats:p>",

By playing Dots &amp; Dashes, stakeholders express their preferences for public transit investments and are educated about the planning process through group negotiation. Dots &amp; Dashes was designed as a self-contained and branded package that would be replicable by planners in other regions. In the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) region, the program's aggregated results inform DVRPC's long-range plan as well as a new long-range vision for transit. Dots &amp; Dashes was designed to be transferable for application in other cities and regions. In the simplest terms, planners interested in replicating the exercise need only adjust the scale of the game board and game pieces to match the local area and scale costs as necessary to account for different time horizons or local project costs. </jats:p>",

More specifically they investigate the extent to which this relationship varies between urban and rural areas, between groups in the community that can be identified as more or less vulnerable, and the extent to which different types of green space exert different influences. The study includes 83 736 Dutch citizens who were interviewed about their feelings of social safety. The percentage of green space in the living environment of each respondent was calculated, and data analysed by use of a three-level latent variable model, controlled for individual and environmental background characteristics. The analyses suggest that more green space in people's living environment is associated with enhanced feelings of social safety—except in very strongly urban areas, where enclosed green spaces are associated with reduced feelings of social safety. Contrary to the common image of green space as a dangerous hiding place for criminal activity which causes feelings of insecurity, the results suggest that green space generally enhances feelings of social safety. The results also suggest, however, that green space in the most urban areas is a matter of concern with respect to social safety. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper investigates the methodology for fast machining process planning that satisfies part tolerancing specifications through the example of a handle. The method first maps each feature of a part into feasible finishing processes that are capable to achieve the specified tolerances and surface requirements associated with the feature. All possible process plans are then developed by expanding preceding processes of each finishing process. A directed graph, with processes as nodes and process sequence as links, is employed to represent the expanded machining processes. Process clusters with same specifications can be further merged and pruned to reduce the computational complexity of the graph. Each possible plan of the merged results is further integrated based on machining sequences. As there are often many feasible plans for machining a part, the qualified plan that satisfies design specifications is achieved by traversal through the graph. The procedure for machining process plan of the handle by such graph-based inference techniques is demonstrated in the paper. The merit of this method is to employ a unified graph model for representing and to reduce the complexity of the process plan efficiently based on inference on the graph.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 2003, the Healthy Forests Restoration Act (HFRA) called for USA communities at risk of wildfire to develop Community Wildfire Protection Plans (CWPPs) requiring local, state and federal actors to work together to address hazardous fuels reduction and mitigation efforts. CWPPs can provide the opportunity for local government to influence actions on adjacent public land, by establishing local boundaries of the wildland–urban interface (WUI), the area where urban lands meet or intermix with wildlands. The present paper explores local response to the HFRA and CWPPs in the eastern USA, specifically if and how communities are using the policy incentive to identify the WUI. We conducted document reviews of eastern CWPPs, as well as qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with participants in four case studies. We found tremendous variation in local response to HFRA, with plans completed at multiple scales and using different planning templates. The WUI policy incentive was not used in all CWPPs, suggesting that the incentive is not as useful in the eastern USA, where public land is less dominant and the perceived fire risk is lower than in the West. Even so, many communities in the East completed CWPPs to improve their wildfire preparedness.</jats:p>"

In Korea’s maturing mobile market currently also going through a period of transition, an intense competition is under way among carriers. As the market nears the point of saturation, carriers are focusing on winning over competitors’ subscribers, at the same time on retaining their existing customers. Understanding the factors that influence customers’ switching behavior, therefore, is crucial for Korean mobile carriers’ quest for successful customer strategies. Customer satisfaction is the widely acknowledged primary determinant of customer behavior. Even so, there are cases in which satisfied customers do not behave according to expectations. Some satisfied customers switch their suppliers, while others stay with their existing suppliers, even if they are dissatisfied with them. In sum, customer satisfaction does not appear to be the sole and the only determinant of customer behavior. This study is an attempt to explain the relationship between customer satisfaction and customer behavior using switching incentives and switching barriers. The role of switching incentives (subsidies toward handset replacement, attractiveness of alternative carriers, etc.) and switching barriers (burden of having to change numbers, burden of losing benefits provided by the current carrier) is investigated empirically using the results of a consumer survey.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although sensor planning in computer vision has been a subject of research for over two decades, a vast majority of the research seems to concentrate on two particular applications in a rather limited context of laboratory and industrial workbenches, namely 3D object reconstruction and robotic arm manipulation. Recently, increasing interest is engaged in research to come up with solutions that provide wide-area autonomous surveillance systems for object characterization and situation awareness, which involves portable, wireless, and/or Internet connected radar, digital video, and/or infrared sensors. The prominent research problems associated with multisensor integration for wide-area surveillance are modality selection, sensor planning, data fusion, and data exchange (communication) among multiple sensors. Thus, the requirements and constraints to be addressed include far-field view, wide coverage, high resolution, cooperative sensors, adaptive sensing modalities, dynamic objects, and uncontrolled environments. This article summarizes a new survey and analysis conducted in light of these challenging requirements and constraints. It involves techniques and strategies from work done in the areas of sensor fusion, sensor networks, smart sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry, and other intelligent systems where finding optimal solutions to the placement and deployment of multimodal sensors covering a wide area is important. While techniques covered in this survey are applicable to many wide-area environments such as traffic monitoring, airport terminal surveillance, parking lot surveillance, etc., our examples will be drawn mainly from such applications as harbor security and long-range face recognition.</jats:p>",

Traditionally, the vulnerability of coastal communities has been measured either on a micro (community) or a macro (regional) scale. We present research that suggests coastal vulnerability assessments need to be conducted in a multi-scalar manner to more accurately assess many of the components that contribute to vulnerability. This chapter employs a case study of Sarasota County, Florida, using GIS intensively in conjunction with an extended version of a vulnerability framework developed by F&amp;uuml;ssel (2007) to consider traditional components of vulnerability at both the micro and macro scales. This fusion of GIS and vulnerability analysis is accomplished through the theoretical concept of geospatially dependent vulnerability in which vulnerability is measured at multiple geographic scales to provide a vulnerability analysis that is sufficiently robust to aid communities in hazard mitigation and resilience enhancement.</jats:p>"

After decades of constant development, a recent decline coincided with the decade of great social and governmental disturbance, the transition period after the dissociation of former Yugoslavia. Objective. In order to overcome the crisis, we used modern management methods to define problems in the institution management, and to propose appropriate strategies. Methods. A survey that included 100 employees (17.67%) was carried out, followed by descriptive statistical analysis, PEST and SWOT analyses. Results The impact of political fluctuations, ageing of population, financing model, obsolete medical technology was evaluated. Various personal and interpersonal factors were assessed: the quality of medical service (3.59?0.76, mark 1-5); relations among health service participants (3.39?0.78); occupational conditions (not good-91%); human, financial and other resources; professional cooperation, stimulation; rivalry and mobbing (declared in 56%); public informing, institution image (rank 3.70?0.88) and PR activities (new to 78%). 93% declared to give maximum effort at work. Conclusion. Using these results, we defined several strategic objectives. These include strengthening scientific activities, general orientation to specific and exclusive pathological conditions and treatment methods, improvement of management transparency, introduction of quality-based stimulation of workers, support of promotional and PR activities.</jats:p>"

The proposed modeling framework makes use of two components: the Rogers multiregional population projection model and the aggregate spatial multinomial logit (ASMNL) model. The Rogers model utilizes cohort vital statistics on fertility, mortality, and migration to project the progression of population by age and sex at the regional level, while the ASMNL model extends the capabilities of the Rogers model enabling it to provide population estimates at a finer spatial scale. The model is applied to the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area in Canada.

Nonetheless, integration of climate risk information in development planning is now a priority for donor agencies because of the need to prepare for climate change impacts across different sectors and countries. This urgency stems from concerns that progress made against Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) could be threatened by anthropogenic climate change beyond 2015. Up to this time the human signal, though detectable and growing, will be a relatively small component of climate variability and change. This implies the need for a twin‐track approach: on the one hand, vulnerability assessments of social and economic strategies for coping with present climate extremes and variability, and, on the other hand, development of climate forecast tools and scenarios to evaluate sector‐specific, incremental changes in risk over the next few decades. This review starts by describing the climate outlook for the next couple of decades and the implications for adaptation assessments. We then review ways in which climate risk information is already being used in adaptation assessments and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of three groups of techniques. Next we identify knowledge gaps and opportunities for improving the production and uptake of climate risk information for the 2020s. We assert that climate change scenarios can meet some, but not all, of the needs of adaptation planning. Even then, the choice of scenario technique must be matched to the intended application, taking into account local constraints of time, resources, human capacity and supporting infrastructure. We also show that much greater attention should be given to improving and critiquing models used for climate impact assessment, as standard practice. Finally, we highlight the over‐arching need for the scientific community to provide more information and guidance on adapting to the risks of climate variability and change over nearer time horizons (i.e. the 2020s).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Dietary planning is supposed to mediate between intentions and dietary behaviors. However, if a person lacks self‐efficacy, this mediation might fail. A cross‐sectional study in Costa Rica and a longitudinal study in South Korea were designed to examine the moderating role of self‐efficacy in the intention–planning–behavior relationship. Intentions, planning, self‐efficacy, dietary behaviors, and baseline diet were assessed. Study 1 included 245 women; Study 2 included 358 women. Moderated mediation models were specified in which planning served as a mediator between intentions and behavior. Self‐efficacy was specified as a moderator of the intention–planning–behavior relationship. Intentions were translated into dietary behavior by planning. However, levels of self‐efficacy moderated this mediation process: The strength of the mediated effect increased along with levels of self‐efficacy, even when accounting for baseline dietary behaviors. For planning to mediate the intention–behavior relation, people must harbor sufficient levels of self‐efficacy. If they lack self‐efficacy, either intentions are not well translated into planning, or planning is not well translated into behavior. Further research needs to clarify under which circumstances the moderator effect of self‐efficacy operates in the first phase or the second phase of the mediation process.</jats:p>",

The resulting trajectories on a three-dimension terrain are collision-free and are represented by using Be´zier spline curves from start position to target and then target to start position or different position with altitude constraints. The efficiency of the two optimization methods is compared in terms of computational cost and design quality.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The occurrence of natural disasters in the coastal regions and numerous potential events in urban regions have drawn considerable attention among transportation stakeholders. Federal, state, and local officials need to be effectively prepared to address the challenges raised by an evacuation. The focus of this research effort is to develop a tool to study the repercussions of evacuation of an entire regional transportation network recognizing the human behavior element. Neglecting these seemingly chaotic traffic flow patterns would lead to inaccurate system assessment and predictions. The influences of evacuees’ locations in the urban region at the moment of emergency alert are studied. In addition, the locations of all members of the household are identified, and household member interactions are explicitly considered. Further, the accurate times the individuals enter the network to evacuate the study region are studied; times can vary according to where the other household members are located at that time and the travel time on the network to reach those locations. To accomplish the goals, the integration framework of activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment is used to study the evacuation traffic flow patterns at the time of evacuation. Specifically, the paper describes the evacuation problem, discusses the utility of deploying the integrated module of activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment for evacuation planning, and outlines the challenges in integrating these two tools. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A cluster-based hierarchical location model for the selection of the proper locations and scales of urban transit hubs was developed with the objective of minimizing the demand-weighted total travel time. As an improvement to previous work, the proposed model has the following unique features: ( a) it incorporates a hierarchical hub network topology that uses the concept of hub hierarchy establishment, route categorization, and service zone clustering to capture the critical operational issues for the transit network in an efficient manner and ( b) it extends the previous nonhierarchical model to account for the impacts of hubs with various hierarchies as well as their interactions with lane use restrictions. An enhanced set of formulations along with the linearization approach was used to reduce significantly the number of variables and the computing time required to achieve the global optimum. The results of a case study in Suzhou Industrial Park in China revealed that the proposed model and solution method are quite promising for use in the planning of hub locations for the transit network. Sensitivity analysis of the performance of the system was also done to assist planners with the selection of the hierarchical structure and the design of transit routes. </jats:p>",

Well‐shaped spherical particles were obtained in diameters ranging from 40 to 420 µm. The morphological, structural, thermal, and magnetic properties were characterized by SEM, FTIR, UV–Vis, VSM (Vibrating Sample Magnetometry), and thermal analysis techniques. Uncoated CrBO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> is paramagnetic at room temperature and antiferromagnetic at low temperatures (<jats:italic>T</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>N</jats:italic></jats:sub> = 12 K) while PVB itself is nonmagnetic at room temperature. The results indicated that the microspheres having a paramagnetic core and nonmagnetic shell displayed weakly ferromagnetic properties at room temperature. The observed ferromagnetism was correlated with the particle size and higher saturation magnetization values were achieved with smaller microspheres. This unconventional magnetic behavior can be tuned by varying the particle size and may allow CrBO<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>/PVB microspheres to serve as a smart material in future applications.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A national transportation planning model is needed for several reasons, including heavy investments in transportation infrastructures and the need to perform formal cost–benefit analyses of all medium- and large-scale transport projects. The paper describes the formulation and development of the planning model. The model is unique for the data collected and is used for analyzing nationwide travel. After careful legal review regarding privacy laws, cellular phone (CP) data were obtained for sixteen 1-week samples of 10,000 phones. In total, data for 1.04 million person-days were obtained. Data records included the unique CP identification, the antenna serving the CP, and a time stamp (date, hour, minute, second). At the minimum, a record was written each time a moving CP changed its connecting antenna. To ensure privacy, neither information nor identification of the cellular phone owner was recorded. The paper describes the structure of the planning model. The CP survey data were used only in the models for constructing person trip tables. To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that data obtained by wireless location technology (WLT) in large quantities have been used in transportation planning. The paper discusses the advantages and limitations of using WLT and presents directions for further research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a series of sequentially implemented policies to mitigate local diesel truck impacts resulting from goods movement activity at two port facilities and simultaneously to improve traffic operations in the communities of Barrio Logan in San Diego, California, and Old Town in National City, California, both low-income communities of color. The paper provides the first comprehensive documentation of the unique process and solutions that emerged following the collaboration of all major stakeholders. Local impacts in Barrio Logan comprised air pollution, noise, and decreased pedestrian safety, while traffic operations in both communities were affected by congestion on the main freeway access, interchanges with insufficient capacity, and heavily mixed land uses both within and adjacent to the communities. These issues provided the impetus for the mitigation effort, the final implementation of which involved a permanent rerouting of all trucks weighing more than 5 tons to roads external to the community. Previous assessments of the project have described the extent to which mitigation strategies are expected to improve traffic operations or have assumed air quality improvements without carrying out an air quality analysis. A local-scale analysis of diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions in Barrio Logan is given. The results show that while the mitigation did not result in improved regional air quality, it did significantly improve air quality in the primary affected corridor and resulted in a 99% reduction in DPM emissions and an 87% reduction in diesel truck vehicle miles traveled. </jats:p>",

In some cities its importance has been vital as a driving force to the economic development. The Guggenheim Museum is an example. It has clearly contributed to the economic development of the Gran Bilbao and it has even been something to imitate in other parts of Spain.  In our survey we have tried to investigate and show some features which have contributed to success, and analysed them through the methodology followed for the development of marketing strategic plans. We have been able to look into the different economic memorandums of the Museum for the last few years, as well as some strategic plans that the Museum has developed recently.  Our approach has incorporated both elements, internal and external, which once investigated, we believe, are the most important parts to success in management. This survey would like to be a starting point of reflection for the different museums to investigate and audit their marketing plans.</jats:p>"

Review of background national epidemiological data, local data, information from community, carer and tangata whaiora (consumer) stakeholders and the existing He Kākano Model of Care was undertaken. Use of tikanga (Māori protocol and practices) was evident throughout the hui. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: A number of aspects of tikanga were identified as essential to the positive outcomes of the future plan. This paper reports one in particular, that of whakatauaki (proverbs where the originator is known). “Whakaora nga moemoea o nga tupuna – living the dreams of the ancestors” is a whakatauaki articulated by Whaea Moe Milne, which was identified as helpful in influencing the strategic planning thinking and decision-making process for He Kākano. This whakatauaki enabled the identification of shared goals, values, beliefs, behaviours and an action plan. The existing and ongoing relationship with Whaea Moe Milne was identified as an important element in the way in which the whakatauaki was received and reflected on. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions: Use of tikanga Māori, in this case, whakatauaki, was helpful in developing future planning for He Kākano. This suggests that use of tikanga may be beneficial in other settings where planning for sustainable Māori responsive services is undertaken. Further work in this area is likely to benefit service development, strategic planning, workforce development and have an impact on improving health outcomes for Māori. </jats:p>",

The three joints of the robot arm are driven with reduction gears and DC motors. In the trajectory planning using a genetic algorithm, the magnetic object is assumed to be transferred along a linear trajectory, and the trajectory of the robot arm is formulated by use of a chromosome consisting of two genes. Then, the fitness function of the genetic algorithm for a quasi-minimum time trajectory planning is defined using two kinds of the constraint conditions as to the allowable maximum moment applied to the magnetic object and the allowable maximum DC motor torque. Furthermore, the numerical calculations and the experiments have been carried out, and the usefulness of the present quasi-minimum time trajectory planning method is confirmed theoretically and experimentally.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Highways are increasingly understood as barriers to wildlife and pedestrian movement and as significant causes of landscape fragmentation–-especially in suburban and periurban areas. FHWA's Transportation, Community, and System Preservation (TCSP) Program encourages innovative solutions to reduce the impact of highways on the communities they link and traverse. This paper is based on research and public participation as part of an FHWA–TCSP sponsored feasibility study for a combined wildlife and pedestrian crossing to mitigate highway impacts on wildlife and recreation, and on the communities of Concord and Lincoln, Massachusetts. The interdisciplinary study team included representatives from landscape architecture, urban planning, wildlife biology, civil engineering, and landscape history. The study included diverse public participation and collaboration throughout the project. The paper defines significant planning issues likely to pertain to similar projects and offers a transdisciplinary method for conducting planning or feasibility studies for combined wildlife–pedestrian crossings. The method is innovative for its interdisciplinary integration and its inclusion of public officials, nongovernmental representatives, citizens, and other stakeholders. The study is being considered for further research and possible implementation by FHWA with support from the host communities and a private conservation organization. </jats:p>",
