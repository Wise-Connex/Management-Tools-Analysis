      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Quantitative forecasts of sub-surface productivity underpin prospect appraisal and development planning, yet the uncertainties intrinsic to those forecasts are difficult to predict. Moreover, the uncertainties invariably remain commercially significant throughout the field life cycle. This paper supports a case for the application of process-based logic to uncertainty handling, expressed in terms of independent, deterministically designed, concept-based development scenarios. Case studies of scenario-based logic are given, applied to 3-D reservoir modelling and simulation for a new, ‘greenfield’ site in Oman and a mature, ‘brownfield’ asset in Thailand. In both cases, uncertainty ranges are generated which provide a quantitative link between subsurface unknowns and commercial decisionmaking.</jats:p>",

This article addresses an annual competency evaluation of perioperative staff members relating to age‐specific criteria. Several types of case scenarios were developed and given to staff members (eg, RNs, surgical technologists, OR assistants, postanesthesia care unit attendants) according to their specific job descriptions and responsibilities within the surgical services department. A case scenario format was used because of the variety of health care personnel and the ability to manipulate the scenarios according to the needs of patients, staff members, and the institution. The evaluation tools were meant to adequately assess staff members' abilities to care for patients throughout the life span. <jats:italic>AORN J</jats:italic> 67 (March 1998) 634–642.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
