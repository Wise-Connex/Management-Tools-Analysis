      "abstract": "<jats:p> The notion of transport disadvantage and how it is addressed by planners in the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom are examined in this paper. Key groups of transport disadvantaged people are identified, which leads to a discussion of the importance of the concept of mobility and access for all members of the community. The second part of the paper suggests that the provision of transport can be used as a tool to advance equity in a population. Given that government subsidies are often associated with the promotion of equity, the effects of transportation subsidies are discussed. The third section of the paper examines some possible remedies for transport disadvantage in both an operational and policy sense. Non-mainstream transportation solutions are examined and their place in the overall system identified. The chief strength of much paratransit its close ties to local planning processes is compared with traditional transport planning approaches. Finally, a case is made for more public participation in transport planning and the development of local planning processes. </jats:p>",

After describing the project's history, we analyze three key areas of conflict and controversy that the partnership faced: arguments over the role of planning in economies with private markets and democratic governments; differing educational philosophies; and conflicts within the Russian group over interpersonal and bureaucratic politics. While the character of these conflicts had much to do with the design of the specific project, they also raise issues about pedagogy, change, and uncertainty that are likely to be widespread in regions of the former Soviet Union. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Local governments seem to be continually strapped for funds. While the revenue-generating role of their planners is often discussed, it is rarely investigated in any detail. We address this research gap by considering the fiscal nature of land use policy in transitoriented development. A massive and influential literature has explored the potential for leveraging rail system investments by locating high density residential developments near commuter rail stations. The feasibility and focus of these strategies have been questioned, however, in the face of evidence that local government support for these projects is mixed at best. To explain this behavior, we examine the role basic fiscal conditions play in the decision to zone land near all existing and proposed commuter rail stations in southern California. The analysis indicates that stationarea zoning depends significantly on community public finances. The results underscore how the practice of transitoriented development must account not only for travel behavior and the broader goals of any given urban design, but also for the selfinterested nature of municipal planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Improving strategic information systems planning (SISP) remains a critical concern of both practitioners and academics. To date, a rather large number of studies have examined or proposed analytical techniques, frameworks, and tools for developing strategic plans. As a direct consequence of this emphasis, methodologies have often become the basis for characterizing the entire process of SISP within the information systems literature. Recent theoretical work suggests that such characterizations are unnecessarily narrow and that planning activities within organizations can be more accurately conceptualized as systems of behaviors, agendas, or process dimensions. Working within this contemporary theoretical perspective, the findings of this study suggest that SISP can be operationalized along distinct dimensions of comprehensiveness (extent of solution search), formalization (rules and procedures to guide activities), focus (creativity or control), flow (top down, bottom up), participation (number and variety of planners), and consistency (frequency of planning cycles). Similar to previous theoretical work and case studies, higher order factor modeling of these dimensions suggests that planning systems that exhibit aspects of rationality (high comprehensiveness, high formalization, control focus, top‐down flow), and adaptation (high participation, high consistency) are positively associated with planning effectiveness.</jats:p>",

Striving for balance, it calls for more or less of particular types of systems without examining whether those elements should instead be reconfigured. Urban consolidation plans in Sydney, as part of an effort to bring about this balance, illustrate what Christopher Alexander calls the yearning for the physical and plastic characteristics of the past. The diverse and overlapping urban interaction patterns of the automotive age-which the plans fail to recognize as natural and not to be transcended by physical planning manipulations-show why Sydney needs a more sophisticated approach. Transportation planners must move from attempting to shape lifestyles in ways which cannot succeed to appreciating the many dimensions of how people have chosen to live and interact across space and how this relates to their aspirations for life in the future. </jats:p>",

This article reports on qualitative research of two edge cities in the San Francisco Bay Area Walnut Creek and San Ramon investigating the empirical issues of their growth and analyzing the broader issues of metropolitan planning. I specifically examine the roles of California general plan law and local land use planners in the development of the two edge cities, where planners used the general plan as early as the 1950s to set aside areas of each community for economic diversification. This study finds that the California General Plan law failed to provide regional coordination for edge city growth, particularly on issues of transportation, infrastructure, housing, and environmental quality. In addition, it finds public land use planners took a proactive role in maintaining long-term visions, forming relationships with developers and becoming involved in the physical planning of these new urban centers. The larger issues raised by these case studies are the uncoordinated metropolitan impacts of edge-city development under a state-mandated, locally implemented, general plan, along with the shift of public planners from their traditional regulatory role to consensual roles with developers. </jats:p>",

Lack of professionally accepted techniques is a principal factor responsible for many inefficiencies. Often, decisionmakers do not fully appreciate or capitalize on the true potential NEPA provides as a platform for planning future actions. New approaches and modern management tools must be adopted to fully achieve NEPA's mandate.</jats:p><jats:p>A new strategy, referred to as Total Federal Planning, is proposed for unifying large‐scale federal planning efforts under a single, systematic, structured, and holistic process. Under this approach, the NEPA planning process provides a unifying framework for integrating all early environmental and nonenvironmental decisionmaking factors into a single, comprehensive planning process. To promote effectiveness and efficiency, modern tools and principles from the disciplines of Value Engineering, Systems Engineering, and Total Quality Management are incorporated. Properly integrated and implemented, these planning tools provide the rigorous, structured, and disciplined framework essential to achieving effective planning.</jats:p><jats:p>The goal of a Total Federal Planning strategy is to construct a unified and interdisciplinary framework that substantially improves decisionmaking, while reducing the time, cost, redundancy, and effort necessary to comply with environmental and other planning requirements. At a time when Congress is striving to re‐engineer the governmental framework, and process, a Total Federal Planning philosophy offers a systematic approach for unifying the disjointed and convoluted planning process most federal agencies use. This philosophy has widespread implications in the way federal planning is approached.</jats:p>",

However, there has been a considerable change in the recent past. Condoms have become much more widely promoted, fuelled by messages about HIV infection, and research continues for a reversible form of male contraception. Efforts are similarly being made to deal with male subfertility which makes a contribution in up to 30% of subfertile couples, and there has been a flurry of interest in the recent reports of falling sperm counts. This chapter presents the current state of the art: often enough knowledge to understand what is going on without always being able to remedy it, and a clear understanding of spermatogenesis without, as yet, a usable form of reversible contraception. Nevertheless, there are still some yawning gaps: for example, what is the psychological effect of infertility among men and how do they cope?</jats:p>",

Once the obvious physical requirements and constraints are known, several techniques can be used to produce a specification for the new layout. Stakeholder analysis reveals the requirements of the users of the new space, and also serves to gain involvement and commitment from staff. Link analysis represents connections between elements in the office design, and can show the importance of these connections. This article outlines some of the issues involved in office layouts and space planning and demonstrates how ergonomics can be used to make such work a success. It explains how to use stakeholder and link analyses and describes an example of office planning in practice. To conclude, an ergonomic checklist is given which summarises some of the issues to consider when planning a new or revised layout.</jats:p>",

Coiled tubing drilling technology may not be the technology of choice for drilling surface hole or for large diameter wellbores, except in exceptional cases, but may be the best technology for managing the drilling environment within the reservoir, especially in horizontal wells. The growing proliferation of \"hybrid\" drilling/coiled tubing rigs would tend to support this belief.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Since coiled tubing has typically been implemented as a live well intervention tool, this technology has always been linked with underbalanced drilling. However, crossroads have been reached and the process of implementing this technology in a commercially viable manner has begun. Of course, there is still a need for projects which push the envelope and help define the outer limits of the technology, but there is a growing need for the establishment of criteria to aid in the selection of the best technology to complete a given task.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>One of the first steps to be completed is the technical feasibility study. This is the science of determining whether the underbalanced drilling objectives can be met within the framework of existing equipment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The purpose of this paper is to discuss the cause and effect relationships of the independent and dependent variables which must be considered when performing a technical feasibility study, particularly when multi-phase flow is involved. Topics such as hole cleaning, weight on bit profiles and wellbore geometry are studied for their effects on drilling performance. The use of computer modeling is highlighted as a powerful tool to complete this initial study phase.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 181</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Viele Kunden orientieren sich weniger an objektiv vorhandener Erreichbarkeit und tatsächlichen Parkmöglichkeiten als vielmehr an ihrer subjektiven Wahrnehmung, die durch veröffentlichte Meinung und vom Hörensagen geprägt wird. Einvernehmliche Maßnahmen und gemeinsame Werbung von Stadt und Einzelhandel sind für den Standort Innenstadt nützlicher als die Forderung nach mehr Parkraum oder die Ablehnung von Verkehrsberuhigung.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The results show\n      that about 60 percent of the couples have given similar responses\n      (agreeing either positively or negatively) to several fertility-related\n      questions, whereas the remaining 40 percent differ in their attitudes.\n      Multivariate analyses indicate that a couple’s joint approval of family\n      planning, husband’s desire for no more children, and spousal discussion\n      about family planning stand out as the strongest predictors of\n      contraceptive use. These findings clearly suggest that the role of\n      couple agreement is important in promoting the use of family planning,\n      and that men should be made as equal targets of such programmes in\n      Pakistan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Over recent years, the development of strategies in schools and colleges to support individual student needs and encourage autonomous learning has influenced the work of most teachers and tutors. Personal Development Plans (PDPs) draw on good practice in careers guidance and on many of the educational initiatives introduced over the past decade, particularly, Records of Achievement (RoAs) and the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative (TVEI). The focus of PDPs is a dialogue between student and tutor which clarifies choices, identifies goals and plans appropriate actions. This process aims to raise personal understanding and motivation and, ultimately, school effectiveness. This article arises from an evaluation of the Personal Development Plans (PDP) project in Wiltshire.</jats:p><jats:p>The Wiltshire project was initiated in January 1992, and was a joint venture by the Careers Guidance Service, the local authority advisory service, TVEI and Wiltshire Training and Enterprise Council (TEC). These agencies perceived PDPs as a co‐operative project which, first, could make a highly positive contribution to the TEC's aim of promoting and sustaining a lifelong learning culture in the county; second, could provide the impetus to attain the National Targets for Education and Training (NTETs) which have been articulated for the year 2000 (DES, 1991) and hence, increase school effectiveness; and third, would ease the introduction of youth credits in the county by enabling 16‐year‐olds to make well‐informed decisions (Ruthven and Pike, 1993). Findings from the evaluation of Wiltshire PDPs are discussed. Positive strategies for supporting PDPs are suggested, the nature of the one‐to‐one dialogue is probed, and a hierarchy of concerns for practitioners is suggested.</jats:p>",

Langfristig können sich neue Distributionskonzepte zudem erheblich auf die Entwicklung der Stadtstruktur auswirken, indem sie die klassische Marktfunktion der Städte räumlich neu definieren. Aktivitäten der räumlichen Planung zum Umgang mit dem Logistiksystem sind zwischen Strategien der Expansion und der planerischen Integration angesiedelt. Ihre Steuerungserfolge waren bisher begrenzt. Anforderungen und Ziele der Planung sind vor diesem Hintergrund vorrangig darauf gerichtet, Güter- und Wirtschaftsverkehr zum Abwägungsbelang in der räumlichen Planung zu machen.

As the proposed neural networks can be trained with data obtained from exciting the robot with given torque inputs, they will capture the complete dynamics of the robot system. Threfore, the trajectories generated will be mo\nre realistic than those obtained by using nominal dynamic equations based on nominal parameters. Time-optimal trajectories are generated for a PUMA robot to demonstrate the proposed method.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Purcell Mountains of southeast British Columbia support a population of mountain caribou near the southernmost extension of their range. This ecotype is dependent upon late-successional forests, largely because such stands provide arboreal lichen for winter forage. Recent provincial forest practices legislation and land-use planning initiatives have provided the impetus for developing an interim caribou habitat assessment model for use as a planning tool. We applied an HSI (habitat suitability index) model developed for a nearby population as a testable hypothesis of caribou habitat selection in the southern Purcells. In a study area of about 6000 km2, 512 radiolocations were obtained for 22 animals from 1993 through 1995. Seasonal selectivity was assessed for the following model variables: elevation, slope, habitat type/current cover type, overstory size class, canopy closure, and age of dominant overstory. Caribou were most selective for stand age, which the model also defined as the greatest determinant of habitat suitability. However, we did not judge overall model output to be an adequate predictor of habitat selection by southern Purcell caribou. Seasonal ratings for each variable were therefore modified to better reflect selection patterns by animals in this study, and subjectively adjusted to ensure that potentially limiting habitat types were rated highly. An evaluation of the adjusted model established its efficacy as an interim decision-support tool. Selection analyses of spatial habitat distribution levels indicated a preference by caribou for landscapes with at least 40% suitable habitat per 250 ha and per 5000 ha. From this, it is apparent that suitable habitat is highly fragmented in this study area.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Radiation therapy treatment planning and treatment delivery are in the process of changing dramatically over the next several years. This change has been driven in large part by continued advances in computer hardware and software and in medical imaging. Three-dimensional radiation treatment planning systems are rapidly being implemented in clinics around the world. These developments in turn have prompted manufacturers to employ advanced microcircuitry and computer technology to produce treatment delivery systems capable of precise shaping of dose distributions via computer-controlled multileaf collimators which cause the beam intensity to be varied across the beam. Image-based 3D planning and beam intensity modulated delivery systems show significant potential for improving the quality of radiotherapy and improving the efficiency with which radiation therapy can be planned and delivered. However, significant research and development work on these systems and their clinical use remains to be performed. The techniques used for the treatment planning and the methods used for quality assurance procedures and testing must all be revised and/or redesigned to allow efficient clinical use of these technological advances. Although much of the current 3D radiation therapy process requires interactive tasks (and some still very laborious) the path is clear toward solving the technological obstacles so that a nearly automated planning, delivery, and verification system will become a reality over the next decade. Such systems will allow radiation oncologists to significantly increase dose to many tumor sites while concomitantly lowering doses to critical organs-at-risk. Most of the tasks will be automated, thus lowering the overall costs currently needed to provide high-quality external beam radiation therapy. </jats:p>",

The algorithm is three‐dimensional and does not explicitly depend on beam energies and modalities. It allows a single prescription dose or a window of acceptable doses to be specified for the target, with additional constraints to account for under‐ or over‐dosing. For the protection of organs at risk, it provides maximum‐dose and dose‐volume constraints. The latter apply to the entire volume of the organ exposed to the corresponding dose levels. Several levels of each type of constraint, with varying penalty weights, may be specified for each organ. The objective function that serves as the measure of the goodness of the solution is of the least‐squares type and is minimized using conjugate gradient methods. Typical clinical cases involving 40 000 points and 4 000 rays to be determined require about 10 min of CPU time on a DEC AlphaStation. Results are presented for two clinical sites, prostate and lung. The optimization algorithm yielded plans that featured higher target dose homogeneity, compared with the human planner's plan, while selectively sparing more of the normal organs at the desired dose regions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Ports and industrial waterfronts today face complex problems associated with environmental contamination and habitat loss that affect the ability of local governments to plan and carry out dredging and waterfront development projects. In the USA, separate regulatory programs exist to address source control, cleanup of contaminated sediments, navigational dredging projects, habitat restoration, and shoreline development projects, each with its own set of agencies, permits, and regulatory requirements. In some areas, these overlapping and often conflicting requirements and interests have led to extreme difficulties in completing port development and cleanup projects, even when these projects could have substantial benefits to the environment. This paper presents a shift in regulatory approach toward in-water projects currently being tested by the Department of Ecology and other federal, state, and local agencies in Washington State. Three projects are described that provide regulatory streamlining in exchange for integration of cleanup and habitat restoration needs into Port navigation and waterfront redevelopment projects. In addition to providing significant benefits to both navigation/commerce and the environment, substantial cost savings can be realized in comparison to traditional approaches to these projects.</jats:p>",

The results of the analysis confirm that similar youths living in different metropolitan areas will make different activity choices. Furthermore, black male youths are found to be substantially more sensitive to metropolitan context than white male youths. The analysis also suggests that black and white disadvantaged youths respond differently to metropolitan context in terms of the trade-offs between activities. Disadvantaged black male youths are highly unlikely to be employed in all metropolitan areas and tend to trade-off staying in school with idleness, whereas disadvantaged white male youths tend to trade-off employment with idleness, depending on the metropolitan area they live in. This research confirms the importance of incorporating geographic context into our theoretical understanding of male youths' behavior. We must also, however, continue to address the implications of race as it shapes the context-dependent labor-market experiences of male youths. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we present a fast and practical algorithm for moving a convex polygonal robot among a set of polygonal obstacles with translations and rotations. The running time is O(c((n + k)N + n log n)), where c is a parameter controlling the precision of the results, n is the total number of obstacle vertices, k is the number of intersections of configuration space obstacles, and N is the number of obstacles, decomposed into convex objects. This work builds upon the slabbing method proposed by Ahrikencheikh et al. [2], which finds an optimal motion for a point among a set of nonoverlapping obstacles. Here, we extend the slabbing method to the motion planning of a convex polygonal robot with translations and rotations, which also allows overlapping configuration space obstacles. This algorithm has been fully implemented and the experimental results show that it is more robust and faster than other approaches.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increasingly, globalization is being used to conceptualize ongoing transformations in agrofood production systems. One focus is to understand how globalization expresses itself at the local level. In this paper I contribute to the examination of this issue by analyzing how Japan's agrarian sector is being altered as a consequence of increased activity on the part of transnational corporations. By doing so, I address the question of whether Japan's national agricultural production system is being globalized, despite its comparatively unique agrarian history and Japan's role in the global agrofood trading system as a major food importing, rather than an exporting, nation. The evidence presented demonstrates that transnational firms are beginning to expand their presence in Japanese agricultural commodity production. As these are transnational firms, and as the result of this process is to force Japanese agriculture to compete against foreign agricultures for its ‘home’ market, it is argued that this process indicates that Japanese agriculture is being globalized, although in a manner that does reflect an adaptation to local conditions. </jats:p>",

However, when the tests are applied to 1967–91 Melbourne data, they are somewhat testing for the theory itself: there are certainly rent gaps, but they are unevenly distributed over space and time, not consistently associated with periods of gentrification but rather with more complex shifts at the level of demand, and to be viewed as just a minor phenomenon of the broader processes of continual spatial restructuring. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports calculations about reasons for the exceptional growth of Japan and for the slowdown in growth in the OECD since the early 1970s. The calculations are based on a multi-region off-equilibrium dynamic model of the two regions. It is argued that the exceptional rate of growth of Japan can be ascribed primarily to the fact that it has invested more of the OECD's capital than would be predicted simply on the basis of the relative capital stocks in the two regions; the fact that Japan's target rate of expansion of supply has far exceeded that of the rest of the OECD (ROECD), and, to a lesser extent, the fact that labour has been replaced in production faster in Japan than in the ROECD. Even if all exogenous variables and parameters had remained constant through the period 1960–90, rates of profitability, accumulation, and growth would have slowed, particularly in Japan. The Japan—ROECD system was on a trajectory far above dynamic equilibrium levels of profit, accumulation, and growth in 1960; to a large degree the post-1973 slowdown is simply the effect of the system returning to a trajectory that is nearer dynamic equilibrium. Superimposed on that internally driven slowdown have been the effects of changes in the proportion of investment that is allocated to the two regions and in the target rates of expansion of supply. This evidence argues strongly against theories of the Golden Age (regulation theory, the theory of industrial divides, theories of the organisation of capitalism) which identify special conditions that were operating in the 1950s and 1960s to raise rates of profit and growth. </jats:p>",

The objective of this research is to determine the merits of a major redirection for the design of manufacturing planning systems—a direction that more directly exploits the capabilities of modern computer technology. We test the relative performance of two fundamentally different classes of manufacturing planning systems: (1) those that make no use of sequencing and scheduling information in the planning of material deliveries (for example, traditional MRP‐based systems), and (2) those that use sequencing and scheduling information to plan delivery of materials. We first derive an analytical expression for the expected benefit (in terms of flow time reduction) of using scheduling information for a single machine system. We then describe and test a simple heuristic for predicting the improvement that could be realized in more complicated multimachine systems, under certain conditions. Results from controlled simulation experiments, over a wide range of operating environments, suggest that although the value of scheduling information is influenced by the operating environment, it could be substantial.</jats:p>",

The comparison is focused on two aspects: the rankings of the cities as a result of the different conceptualizations and the type of infrastructure involved; and the equity in accessibility given the conceptualization and the type of infrastructure. When one is interested in a ranking of cities in terms of accessibility the choice of the accessibility concept tends to be less important than the choice of the type(s) of infrastructure to be considered. When one is interested in inequalities in accessibility among cities, operationalization appears to have a much larger impact compared with rankings per se. </jats:p>",

In this paper two quality control (QC) procedures are reported. The first one concerns the QC of the dosimetry of small x-ray beams, generally carried out by using silicon detectors. The comparison of dose values obtained by a silicon diode, a diamond detector, and radiochromic films shows that for x-ray beams of high energy, the silicon diode can give an overestimation of the output factors in phantom, up to 4%. This is due to the higher than unit density silicon diode and the surrounding envelope that restore the lateral electron equilibrium. About the 3D algorithms for breast treatment planning, a quality control test has been adopted to verify the accuracy of the computed dosimetry when “loss of scatter” occurs. The results show a sensible agreement (within 1.5%) between computed and experimental data. </jats:p>",

Attention is focused on the interplay between different scales of identity constructs: national-scale constructs of English and Welsh identities; regional constructs of Welsh identity; and more localised identity constructs. In the context of the first of these identity constructs, we consider Cohen's notions of significant ‘others’ and symbolic boundaries as a means of understanding processes of English in-movement to areas of the Welsh countryside. </jats:p>",

In total, over 1000 health-care personnel across eight time zones participated. The event demonstrated that the quality of teleconferencing technology was suitable for medical teaching, for providing medical consultations to remote locations and for stimulating medical exchanges. In general, planning a telemedicine conference requires a longer lead time, a wider representation of expertise in the organizing committee and more financial resources than conventional conferences. It is recommended that the aim and format of a telemedicine conference be determined at least one year before the target date. Criteria for improving the preparation of such conferences have been identified and a set of guidelines for future conference organizers has been drawn up. </jats:p>",

Using survey data collected from a wide variety of firms and industries based in the United States, we empirically examined the antecedents and effects of integrating the natural environment into the formal planning process. These data were analysed using structural equation modelling with the LISREL technique.</jats:p><jats:p>Overall, our data provided strong support for the hypothesized relationships. Specifically, we found that the level of integration of environmental management concerns in the strategic planning process was positively related to financial and environmental performance. Furthermore, we found that the greater the functional coverage and the more resources provided to environmental issues, the greater the integration of environmental issues in the planning process. These results suggest that concern for environmental issues may yield competitive advantages in the marketplace as the natural resource‐based perspective suggests</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The regional literature suggests that local labor markets offer significant operating advantages to firms in knowledge-intensive industries and thus influence the development of contemporary industrial location patterns. Utilizing two data sets containing information on the employment changes of US semiconductor engineers during the critical formative period (1950–75), the author tests the pooling and anchoring hypotheses of urban economic theory while extending the theory to incorporate the effects of labor and firm specialization. Findings include: (1) moderate evidence of locality-centered labor pooling in this occupation during this early time period; (2) no evidence of anchoring by nonmarket actors, such as universities and government laboratories or by early labor markets; and (3) evidence that agglomerations of firms develop as a result of imperfect skill-opportunity matches. The results discount frequently offered explanations for the emergence of industrial agglomerations and suggest that agglomerations are not the outcome of firms' searches for operating efficiencies but may be a product of entrepreneurship induced by particular ‘permanently failing’ firms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to investigate three-dimensional spiral computed tomography (3DCT) as an adjunct to routine pancreatic CT scanning, with particular regard to the identification of surgically important hepatic arterial anomalies, correlated with conventional visceral angiography. 32 patients underwent spiral CT scans prior to pancreatic surgery using established protocols. Oral contrast medium was used throughout. 150 ml of intravenous contrast medium was given at 3 ml s-1 with a 24 s spiral CT sequence starting 35 s after the start of infusion. Two protocols were employed, both with a pitch of 1:3 mm table feed/collimation (n = 17) and 5 mm table feed/collimation (n = 15). Overlapping (1 mm minimum) axial reformats were reconstructed. 3DCT shaded-surface displays of the visceral arteries were assessed for visceral arterial anomalies. Visceral angiography (n = 23) was independently correlated. Satisfactory 3D angiograms were performed in all but one patient, in whom the coeliac axis was missed. (i) 3 mm protocol: 3DCT (n = 17) showed three anomalous right hepatic arteries (ARHA), one trifurcation anomaly and one splenic artery with an aortic origin. Angiography (n = 11) confirmed these findings, although one patient with an ARHA did not have angiography. A left gastric arterial supply to the left liver was not detected. (ii) 5 mm protocol: 3DCT (n = 15) showed two cases of ARHA. While confirming these findings, angiography (n = 12) showed a third case of ARHA, in which the coeliac and superior mesenteric artery had very close origins. A left gastric supply to the left liver was also missed. It is concluded that satisfactory 3DCT is possible without changing existing scanning protocols, although narrow sections are required for the confident assessment of right hepatic arterial anomalies, and any left hepatic supply via the left gastric artery was poorly assessed in this series.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the context of the continuance of mass high unemployment in the United Kingdom and considerable debate concerning the ‘real level’ of unemployment, the authors of this paper go beyond the official unemployment rate by focusing on the development of alternative indicators of labour reserve in the regions of the United Kingdom. They show how, on a step-by-step basis, successively ‘broader’ indicators of labour reserve (more specifically, those on government training schemes, various categories of those conventionally defined as economically inactive who would like a job, and those in part-time work because they could not find full-time employment) may be derived by means of data from the Labour Force Survey. They then go on to outline the key features of regional variations in the scope for additional labour-force participation. As labour supply is a dynamic concept, and the utilisation of the labour reserve implies transitions from unemployment and non-employment to employment, selected information on transitions between labour-market states and on the previous economic circumstances of the unemployed is presented. Some key features of the broad regional geography of those categorised as in employment, but ‘on the margins’ of the labour reserve, are highlighted also. Finally, the implications for policy of substantial labour reserves in many regions in the United Kingdom are explored. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Madagascar's biodiversity is of extremely high international significance, yet comprehensive efforts to assess current knowledge and set priorities have been absent until recently. Beginning in April 1995, a major participatory effort to assess the country's scientific and conservation priorities was undertaken in Madagascar. This process laid important groundwork for the revision of Madagascar's National Environmental Action Plan. The first stage of the process was a scientific priority-setting workshop. Over one hundred experts, organized in thematic groups, reached consensus on biodiversity priorities for the island, based on cross-discipline comparisons. A principal finding of the workshop is that many areas of outstanding biodiversity and research importance are located outside protected areas. Participants also agreed that corridors needed to be created between the high-priority protected areas in order to maintain gene flow and exchange of species. The second stage of the process was a stakeholder consultation which integrated scientific findings, national priorities, local stakeholder views, and donor input. The stakeholder consultation concluded that a collaborative, regional approach was needed to augment site-based conservation activities. Participants also emphasized that institutional strengthening in forestry and parks agencies needed much higher priority. The net result of the process was the adoption of a landscape approach to conservation which integrates regional planning, biodiversity monitoring and institutional strengthening.</jats:p>",

In the case of low‐intensity UV radiation the most important point is the correct determination of absorbed dose. The laser UV pulse energy is easily measured and the short‐pulse irradiation also has the advantage of \"freezing\" the conformation of complexes under study. However, the use of high‐intensity laser UV irradiation leads to realizations of two‐quantum processes both in nucleic acid chromophores–bases and in solvent–water, which complicates singificantly the processing of results. In this paper methods for calculating the absorbed dose and the quantum yield of cross‐linking for all above‐mentioned cases are given as well as practical advice.</jats:p>",
