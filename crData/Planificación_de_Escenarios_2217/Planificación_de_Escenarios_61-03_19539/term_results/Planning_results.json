They have caused him injury. They have caused him property damage and loss. And sometimes they have cost him life. Accidents often have been considered inevitable. In one sense, they are—they are the inevitable result of human failure.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Accidents have changed the course of history. They certainly change the course of our life if we are the injured or our property is lost or damaged. Accidents have increased to such a degree in modern life that they require our best efforts to prevent them. Much is available in the literature of the world on how to prevent accidents, and I am sure this paper will give nothing new in accident prevention. But if it re-emphasizes safety fundamentals, it will serve a useful purpose.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>There has been some tendency to limit accident prevention to study of injury-producing ones and to overlook accidents that cause damage or loss of property. This tendency is understandable. Personal injuries are rightly more demanding of our attention than destruction of property. But this limited view has delayed progress in accident prevention.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>I think it is appropriate to define the word \"accident\" as a professional safety engineer uses it:</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\"An accident is any unexpected event that interrupts of interferes with the orderly of production, activity, or process.\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Under this definition, an accident may cause damage to equipment or material or cause a production delay without resulting in an injury. It is here that the campaign to prevent accidents must start for almost every accident has the potential of causing injury.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The subject of industrial location, as an aspect of the\n      economic development of the country, is one to which frequent references\n      have been made in recent years by government officials and by the\n      writers of newspaper editorials. During the period of the First Five\n      Year Plan, the burden of such references was generally to the effect\n      that further industrialization should be fostered in backward areas and\n      that it should be discouraged or actually banned in Karachi, Lahore and\n      other cities believed to be overcrowded or vulnerable from a defence\n      point of view. More recently, the desire for the dispersal of industry\n      and for the provision of jobs in less developed areas has led to the\n      espousal of industrial estates as a means of solving the industrial\n      location problem1. The concern of officials and of editors with the\n      overconcentration of manufacturing#in a few cities and with the lack of\n      geographic balance in the location of industrial investments is well\n      founded. The problem is a serious one in Pakistan, as well as in almost\n      all countries in which a substantial amount of industrialization has\n      taken place. However, it does not lend itself to simple solutions such\n      as the banning of further investments in certain of the most advanced\n      areas or the proliferation of industrial estates in backward,\n      economically stagnant, or out-of-the-way towns. To say this is not to\n      criticize the use of industrial estates as a method of channeling\n      investment. These estates have a valuable function to perform if\n      employed in conjunction with other tools of investment promotion and as\n      a part of a systematic approach to the location of new industrial\n      activity.</jats:p>"

The present issue turns to progress and plans to make possible new opportunity for geophysical research in meteorology.</jats:p><jats:p>The establishment of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, after three years of planning, represents a dramatic step forward to meet vital needs for the progress of meteorology as a global science. The new laboratory will rise on Table Mountain at Boulder, Colorado, in close proximity to the National Bureau of Standards and the University of Colorado. It is sponsored by the 14 universities that grant graduate degrees in meteorology in order to supplement their individual facilities for advanced and World‐wide meteorological research. The AGU congratulates the leaders of these universities and their Corporation, the University Corporation on Atmospheric Research, the National Science Foundation, the High Altitude Observatory, the State of Colorado, and especially Dr. Walter Orr Roberts, who will direct this new meteorological center, for their solutions of difficult organizational problems, that have laid the foundations for this vital enterprise. The United States will now have access to facilities that are comparable to the scale of the problems of global meteorology, built in close juxtaposition to our related university facilities.</jats:p>",
