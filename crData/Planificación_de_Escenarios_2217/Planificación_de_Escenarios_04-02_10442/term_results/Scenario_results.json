      "abstract": "<jats:p> Riparian forest strips (RS) along lakes and streams have been incorporated in regulations on clearcuts to protect water quality and fish habitat. As well, upland strips (US) are used to limit the size of clearcut patches. We conducted a three-year study to evaluate if RS and US between adjacent cutovers in large clearcut landscapes could be useful for certain terrestrial wildlife. Our study was conducted in southcentral Québec on six landscapes (23–256 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) originating from black spruce (Picea mariana) forests that were recently logged (≤ 9 years). Residual uncut forest, mostly strips (width = 51–132 m), made up 31% of the productive forest area within these landscapes. RS and US were suitable habitat for red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and many species of birds including spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis). They provided marginal habitat for snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and were not preferred by moose (Alces alces) over clearcut areas in winter. One bird species, bay-breasted warbler (Dendroica castanea), was absent in forest strips during the last year. We concluded that leaving RS and US is a management scenario that enables maintaining certain wildlife species within clearcut landscapes, but that larger residual forest patches are needed to accommodate area-sensitive and forest-interior species. A portion of these patches should be allowed to develop into mature and overmature stages for old-growth forest species. Green tree and dead tree retention should also be incorporated in logging practices to accommodate species that need snags for nesting or feeding. In areas where wildlife use has a high priority, large clearcuts should be intermixed with dispersed patch cutting in order to gain social acceptance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We reviewed rates of nitrogen (N) removal in paddy fields and wetlands. Then we developed a numerical model to simulate N flow in an agricultural paddy field area and analyzed scenarios for recycling the agricultural run-off, including field drainage, from an agricultural area with an irrigation/drainage system. In it, we considered N removal in paddy fields, a regulating reservoir, and canals. The review showed that the rate constant for N removal in paddy fields and wetlands was 0.025 m/d under natural conditions and 0.01 m/d under dark conditions. The scenario analysis of recycling paddy field run-off within the model area indicated that a large amount of the effluent load occurred during the transplanting period and that recycling could reduce the effluent N load. The effluent N load would be equal to the inflowing N load at a 48% recycling rate. In this scenario, paddy fields accounted for most of the reduction in the effluent N load, and the mean removal rates per unit area of paddy field and regulating reservoir were 53.6 g ha-1d-1 and 222.6 g ha-1d-1, respectively.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The introduction of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) into a country free of disease without vaccination may have huge consequences in terms of both disease spread and economic losses. More quantitative insight into the main factors determining the probability of CSFV introduction (P<jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub>) is needed to optimally use resources for the prevention of CSFV introduction. For this purpose a spreadsheet model was constructed that calculates the annual P<jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub> into member states of the European Union (EU). The scenario pathway approach was used as most probabilities in the model are very small. Probability distributions were used to take into account inherent variability of input parameters. The model contained pathways of CSFV introduction including the import of pigs and pork products, returning livestock trucks, and contacts with wild boar. All EU member states were included as possible sources of CSFV. Default results for the Netherlands showed a mean overall annual P<jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub> of approximately 0.06, indicating that the Netherlands can expect CSFV introduction on average once every 18 years from the pathways and countries included in the model. Almost 65% of this probability could be attributed to the pathway of returning livestock trucks. The most likely sources of CSFV introduction were Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. Although the calculated probabilities were rather low when compared with expert estimates and recent history, the most likely causes of CSFV introduction indicated by the model were considered to be realistic. It was therefore concluded that the model is a useful tool to structure and analyze information for decision making concerning the prevention of CSFV introduction.</jats:p>",
