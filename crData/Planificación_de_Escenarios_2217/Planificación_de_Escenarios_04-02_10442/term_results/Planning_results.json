      "abstract": "<jats:p> That geometry is employed in architecture is well known. So too is its application known since antiquity to the layout of cities. Based on experiences as an architect who believed in a holistic approach to his art (referring to it as organic), Frank Lloyd Wright used simple geometry to rationalize fundamental physical and programmatic determinants. It is not surprising, therefore, that he applied geometry in community and city planning projects to define and enhance determinants such as land use, spatial configuration, transportation routes, and building mass and to anticipate social interactions. Four projects of the period between 1909 and 1935 are analyzed. </jats:p>",

Oral history as a technique can help access information from those “at the margins” of society who live in distressed neighborhoods. This article analyzes the potential benefits of oral histories for neighborhood planning. It also analyzes interviews conducted with board members of two Detroit community organizations to glean lessons about the importance of residents’ personal experiences within the neighborhoods. The author suggests that collecting such historical insights could become a productive part of neighborhood planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planners are increasingly turning to tourism as a viable economic development strategy, as many communities experience industrial restructuring. Consequently, many residents are exposed to tourism for the first time, whereas established destinations experience increasing volumes of tourists. Planners are now challenged with understanding how the public perceives tourism in order to gain local support for tourism projects and initiatives. By exploring the literature on resident attitudes toward tourism development, this article examines (1) resident attitudes toward tourism in relation to socioeconomic factors; (2) spatial factors; (3) economic dependency; (4) resident and community typologies; (5) measuring residents’ attitudes tourism development; and (6) theoretical perspectives such as community attachment, social exchange theory, and growth machine theory. This literature review provides planners with a basis for initiating citizen participation processes related to tourism issues and identifying groups of people concerned about, or opposed to, tourism planning and development in their communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many spatial datasets and spatial problems can be described with reference to regular lattice frameworks rather than continuous space. Examples include: raster scan and digital elevation model data, digital images, cost surfaces, cellular automata models, swarm models, and many others. This raises the question as to how distances should be measured in such cases and to what extent these relate to continuous space metrics. In this paper I show that a set of image processing algorithms known as distance transforms (DTs) may be applied to such datasets and can be extended to solve a wide range of 2D and 3D optimisation problems. These extended versions of the standard DT procedure have applications in many areas including location theory, path determination, planning, and decision support. As such I argue that they warrant consideration for inclusion as a standard set of tools within modern GIS and spatial analysis software packages. Sample pseudo-code for the transforms discussed is included in an appendix. </jats:p>",

Accessibility Analyst incorporates a number of accessibility measures, ranging from catchment profile analysis to cumulative-opportunity measures, gravity-type measures, and utility-based measures, contains several travel-impedance measurement tools for estimating the travel distance, time, or cost by multiple travel modes along actual travel routes, and interoperates with GIS data-management and data-integration, spatial-analysis, network-analysis, surface-modelling, and spatial-visualisation functions. Undertaking accessibility analysis with use of Accessibility Analyst allows the user to take full advantage of a GIS to produce spatial distributions of accessibility over a region. It can be applied to a wide range of issues in urban transportation planning, such as for studies on the relationship between transportation and land use, evaluation of transportation network efficiency, transportation infrastructure planning, and for impact assessments relating to transportation policies. </jats:p>",

Using Chicago as a case study, this article examines the early history of the planned district. Two aspects are emphasized. First, the article outlines the manner in which a coalition of business and political actors planned and created a new industrial landscape. Second, the article looks at the interaction between firm boundaries, industrial networks, and urban space. This interaction is illustrated through an examination of three aspects of the planned district: incubators, clubhouses, and factories. The article combines recent research on the dynamics of industrial activity with historical evidence on Chicago’s industrial districts. </jats:p>",

In addition, the article examines the relationship between growth management and such areas as biodiversity and endangered species, water policy, and farmland preservation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I discuss the digital city as a comprehensive, web-based representation, or reproduction, of several aspects or functions of a specific real city, open to nonexperts. Much more than a technical and practical issue, the digital city has dimensions that are social, cultural, political, ideological, and of course also theoretical. I explore these broader conceptual underpinnings of the digital city idea. More specifically: where do urban ideologies, urban structures and functions, and digital urban representations meet? How may the digital city relate to the real city? On the basis of what choices might the digital city be constructed? What might the digital city mean to people? To be answered, these highly involved and interrelated questions require a coherent conceptual framework. By considering an overview of digital-city realizations, issues, and critiques, I adumbrate a theory of the digital city, seen as lying at the intersection of three domains: a physical urban area, the communities of people associated with that area, and the possibilities and constraints (technological, but also socioeconomic and ideological) of the evolving information society. A rough sketch is all that can be offered at this point because proper theories of the digital city cannot be developed independently of comprehensive theories of the real 21st-century city. I close with a brief discussion of what these ideas might imply for digital-city designers. </jats:p>",

This representation gives a functional view in which vertices represent named streets and edges represent street intersections. A range of graph measures, including street connectivity, average path length, and clustering coefficient, are computed for structural analysis. In order to characterise different clustering degrees of streets in a street network they generalise the clustering coefficient to a k-clustering coefficient that takes into account k neighbours. Based on validations applied to three cities, the authors show that large urban street networks form small-world networks but exhibit no scale-free property. </jats:p>",

While accepting the logic of its role in planning for individuals, this commentary argues that PCP cannot fulfil a strategic planning role because the development of PCP on a wide enough scale to be useful for this purpose is itself a strategic development, which will take considerable time and resources to achieve. There is still a place for population‐based norms or targets based on available epidemiological data to indicate the needed scale of provision and associated resource requirement. Three illustrations are described. In conclusion, it is noted that the current lack of indicative provision targets is a weakness of recently issued policy, an absence which does nothing to safeguard the interests of those who depend on service support.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cities are central to the economic and social development of European society, not only because over 80% of European citizens live in urban areas, but also because cities are at the same time centres of production, innovation, employment, and culture, and loci of segregation, deprivation, and ethnic conflict. The emergence of a European-wide urban policy, has given new impetus to the need for comparable indicators of the quality of life to monitor development and policy implementation. This paper reviews the literature on quality of life indicators, and argues that traditional measures of the quality of life need to be supplemented with two new dimensions that reflect more recent postmodernist thinking about the composition of urban landscapes, and the contribution to the quality of life of the emerging information society. We argue that the challenges of building appropriate indicators reflecting these new dimensions are considerable, even in urban environments so rich in information systems and data sources, if they are to qualify as ‘digital cities’. There are difficulties in finding common workable definitions of the indicators themselves, as well as definitions of the relevant populations, including city residents, and users. By raising these issues and suggesting possible avenues for addressing these challenges we contribute to a much-needed debate on how to define such indicators, which is the prerequisite for their development and use. </jats:p>",

The need for urban management tools that are able to provide prospective scenarios is addressed. Urban simulations can represent a useful approach to understanding the consequences of current planning policies—or their incompleteness. Nevertheless, simulations of future urban growth are usually quite difficult without tools which embrace the complexity of the urban system. We describe an urban-growth simulation for the city of Lagos in Nigeria, in which an urban cellular automata (CA) prototype is used. We propose a bottom-up approach which integrates land-use factors with the dynamic approach of CA for modelling future urban land-use scenarios. The model for Lagos was calibrated and tested with the aid of measured time-series data on land use, through a set of spatial metrics and κ-coefficients. A twenty-year simulation, until 2020, was run. The simulation results are realistic and achieve a high level of detail, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Land-use-change patterns are the result of the complex interaction between the human and the physical environment. Case studies of the determinants of land-use change can help to analyse which theory is appropriate in a particular region and stimulate the development of new theoretic understandings. In this paper an empirical method is presented to analyse the pattern of land-use change that allows a wide range of factors, from different disciplines, to contribute to the explanation of land-use change. The method is applied to the Netherlands, based on an extensive database of land-use change and its potential determinants. Historic as well as recent land-use changes are studied. Historic land-use change is related mainly to the variation in the biophysical environment. Levels of explanation are low because of the inability to address the temporal variation in location factors. For the recent changes in land use high levels of explanation are obtained. The most important changes during this period are expansions of residential, industrial/commercial, and recreational areas. The location of these changes can be explained by a combination of accessibility measures, spatial policies, and neighbourhood interactions. On the basis of these results it is possible to define priority topics for in-depth analysis of land-use-change processes and suggest factors, relations, and processes that need to be included in dynamic land-use-change models that support land-use-planning policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The creation of the new Greater London Authority (GLA), with effect from June 2000, has provoked considerable interest in policy and academic circles. It stands as an innovation in London governance, an experiment with the mayoral system in British politics and another example of the New Labour programme of modernisation. For all these reasons, the GLA provides an interesting focus of study. The particular focus of this paper concerns the internal dynamics of the GLA as it strove to establish its policy agenda and modus operandi. We were not so much concerned with policy outcomes in terms of documentation and its orientation, but rather the developing nature of the GLA as an emerging organisation. To this end we analyse the first year of the GLA's operation using the perspective of cultural theory, emphasising the nature of the GLA as a set of overlapping institutions. Developing Hood's and Coyle's applications of cultural theory enables us to comment on the tensions apparent within the GLA in its first year and the prospects for integration across the GLA. It also enables a reassessment of the value of such a cultural theory framework in contexts of organisational evolution. </jats:p>",

The social sciences have developed weak analyses of the more distant yet intermittent connections that hold social life together. It is shown that intermittent bodily copresence resulting from travel and occasioned encounters is critically significant for social life. The importance of such copresence is characteristic even of virtual communities and of far-flung diasporic communities. But it is also shown that new ‘inhabiting machines’ are emerging, machines that undermine the distinction between ‘transportation’ and ‘communications’. These new machinic hybrids are reconfiguring relations at a distance and constitute something of an epochal shift. Although there have always been complex connections of presence and absence, the current century seems to be ushering in some exceptional changes in those recurrent patterns of presence and absence, through our dwelling within an increasingly populous world of inhabiting machines. </jats:p>",

Furthermore, I argue that disposal is not just about questions of waste and rubbish but is implicated more broadly in the ways in which people manage absence within social relations. I develop this argument through a critical engagement with the work of Mary Douglas, Rolland Munro, Michael Thompson, and Robert Hertz. I seek to show that disposal is never final as is implied by the notion of rubbish but involves issues of managing social relations and their representation around themes of movement, transformation, incompleteness, and return. I suggest that rather than see the rubbish bin as the archetypal conduit of disposal within consumer practices the door might be seen as a better example. This has implications for understanding questions of representation, ethics, and the management of social relations within the practices of consuming. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As practices of social coordination and connectivity shift in contemporary urban spaces, in part because of the increasing hybridisations of technologies and infrastructures of communication and transportation, public life is being reconfigured and respatialised. In this paper I argue that models of ‘publicity’ have paid insufficient attention to the ways in which publics are deeply embedded in social and machinic complexes involving the mobilities of people, objects, and information. The first half offers an overview of how the converging technologies of mobility and communication have created new temporalities and spatialities for public participation. In the second half I turn to a theoretical programme for rethinking public connectivity and disconnectivity not in terms of the conventional imagery of networks, but as more fluid and contingent social structures that Harrison White has described in terms of coupling and decoupling. Publics are becoming more ‘mobile’ in two ways: first, there is an increasing tendency to slip between private and public modes of interaction, as a result of the new forms of fluid connectivity enabled by mobile communication technologies; and, second, there are opportunities for new kinds of publics to assemble or gel momentarily (and then just as quickly dissolve) as a result of newly emerging places and arenas for communication. </jats:p>",

This issue has not historically been addressed as a health priority, but in recent years is receiving increased attention and funding. This ethnographic study on the experience of cervical cancer was conducted in Iquitos, Peru, between August 1998 and May 1999. Research methodologies included: (1) observation and household interviews to obtain background knowledge about the region, medical systems, and local cultural understanding of illness; (2) cancer experience interviews; and (3) case studies of women in various stages of cervical cancer or diagnosis. Findings are presented related to local knowledge and experience of Pap smears and cervical cancer and the ineffectiveness of a recently initiated cervical cancer screening program. The findings guide recommendations for interventions in the region in relation to: (1) needed changes in health education, (2) screening frequency and age, (3) sites for screening and treatment, (4) type and availability of treatment, (5) payment issues, (6) documentation of care, and (7) the potential of herbal remedies.</jats:p>",

I argue that the operating room is an effect of the interferences between different types of special relations. This is presented as a neo-monadology: I suggest that the interference between these four spaces is generative, not only of the surgical event but also of the differences between the topologies themselves.

Important features of the approach include the strain field calculation based on principal curvature formulation and minimal strain optimization, and scanning paths and heating condition (laser power and scanning velocity) determination by combining analytical and practical constraints. The overall methodology is presented first, followed by more detailed descriptions of each step of the approach. Two distinctive types of doubly curved shape, pillow and saddle shapes are focused on and the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by forming experiments.</jats:p>",

We know that, as well as including the local, whatever the global is it ‘is more than one but less than many’. But what is one? And where can the global one be found, and by whom? One can be studied only in its tensioned relation with the other. The suggestion is that the global and the local, and the large and the small, are effects of modes of ordering; that between them there is no more than ephemeral effects of scale, or effects of ever-changing contingent differences of relative quantities or positions (densities). But, then, how does the global end up being global or the large become large? I will explore this question by focusing on performances of mathematical discourses. How do mathematical discourses intermingle with heterogeneous networks conveying, shaping, and mobilizing intentional but nonsubjective strategies of framing the global as one? And how do heterogeneous networks always locally (partially) escape mathematical capture and constantly overflow often renewed mathematizing framings? </jats:p>",

The first part provides a capsule history of how a very few templates of position and juxtaposition have become powered up into a capacious and effective background. In the second part of the paper I argue that in recent years the practice of these templates has been changing as a full-blown standardisation of space has taken hold. This standardisation is gradually leading to the crystallisation of a new kind of technological unconscious. In the third part of the paper I argue that the traces of this new kind of unconscious are taking hold in social theory as well, leading to the assumption of a quite different event horizon which can be thought of as a different kind of materiality. </jats:p>",

Most captive populations are small and managers focus their efforts on reducing extinction risks by minimising loss of genetic diversity. To project changes in genetic diversity, managers use a genetic drift model. We used data from 40 managed captive populations to test whether this drift model is a good predictor of change in genetic diversity by comparing projected 10‐year trajectories of annual loss in expected heterozygosity with the changes estimated from pedigree analysis. We found that the drift model frequently overestimated the rate at which genetic diversity would be lost and could not predict increases, which we observed in 22 species. We suggest that the drift model does not adequately reflect the potential for management strategies, such as prioritised breeding recommendations and recruitment of potential founders, to slow the loss of genetic diversity. In many cases, the drift model may be overly pessimistic, leading managers to seek solutions such as importation, increased population size or the abandonment of a captive population, that may be unnecessary or premature. Managers should be cautious when interpreting results from genetic drift models, taking care to assess how management actions might lead to more optimistic prognoses.</jats:p>",

We focus our attention on the steps of the airline schedule planning process involving schedule design and fleet assignment. Airline schedule design involves determining when and where to offer flights such that profits are maximized, and fleet assignment involves assigning aircraft types to flight legs to maximize revenue and minimize operating cost. We present integrated models and solution algorithms that simultaneously optimize the selection of flight legs for and the assignment of aircraft types to the selected flight legs. Preliminary results, based on data from a major U.S. airline, suggest that significant benefits can be achieved. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Commercial air travel is a key global industry facilitating the complex daily movements of planes, people, goods, and services across the world. In this paper we analyse contemporary air travel through the conceptualisation of a culture of real virtuality. We contend that air travel now consists of passage through ‘code/space’. Such code/space includes travel websites, check-in, security checkpoints, flight decks, air-traffic control, immigration, and customs checkpoints, which together form assemblages that define the practices and experiences of air travel. Code/space is qualitatively different to coded space, in which software influences the production of space, in that code and space are mutually constituted—produced through one another. This mutual constitution is dyadic so that if either the code or space ‘fail’, the production of space ‘fails’. Our formulation of code/space is non-deterministic and nonuniversal, and how code/space operates and is experienced is embodied through the performances and interactions of the people within the space (between people, and between people and code). In this sense, code/space is constantly in a state of becoming. We illustrate the nature of code/space, and the discursive regimes that support its production, and demonstrate how the code/spaces of an air travel are simultaneously local and global and induce Castells' notions of ‘space of flows’ and ‘timeless time’. </jats:p>",

I argue that contemporary media-based analyses of communication technologies often fail to take into account the specific relational qualities attached to forms of ‘sound’ consumption. The meanings and uses attached to sound technologies are then conceptualised through reinterpreting three iconic historical moments of sound consumption in Western culture: Horkheimer and Adorno's account of the meeting between Odysseus and the Sirens in The Dialectic of Enlightenment, and early-20th-century accounts of the use of the phonograph and radio taken from the work of Kracauer and Taussig. One example is situated in the mythic prehistory of Western culture, the other two from its ‘heroic’ period of mechanical reproduction. These examples are used to point to what an analytical framework for understanding contemporary states of aural proximity and distance might look like. The paper points to the manner in which the use of sound technologies can be understood as part of the Western project of the appropriation and control of space, place, and the ‘other’. In particular I focus upon the specific relational qualities attached to sound through which subjects relate to their surroundings, others, and themselves, focusing upon the central role that aestheticisation plays as a strategy of the control of place and space. The analysis is contextualised through a contemporary analysis of that most mobile and privatised of media artefacts, the Walkman. </jats:p>",

The key findings are that pilots are primarily benefiting groups closest to the labour market and need to engage community-based organisations if they are to become more inclusive. Yet the risk remains that in using the hiring requirements of employers as a basic standard of job readiness such interventions may legitimate discriminatory behaviour which is a significant cause of the inequalities that some groups face in the labour market. </jats:p>",

Common sense, including a good deal of the common sense underlying network metaphors for complex globality, involves the assumption that the global is large, that it includes the (smaller) local, and that to understand it we need to adopt a holistic approach in which we look up to explore emergent complexities, and so obtain a provisional overview of the whole. In this paper I argue, following Chunglin Kwa, that this is a particular and romantic method for imagining complexity. I then follow Kwa by considering a baroque alternative. Instead of looking up, this looks down and discovers limitless internal complexity within, which is materially heterogeneous, specific, and sensuous. In this monadology there are no limits to complexity within, but neither is there any possibility of modeling and knowing that complexity in full. There is no overview and neither is there any assumption of coherence. In this way of thinking the global lies within each site and is small, sensuous, specific, heterogeneous, noncoherent, and cannot be more than patchily modeled. </jats:p>",

Based on the needs of running a construction enterprise, ERP shows potential applicability to the construction industry. This paper sought to quantify the benefits of ERP systems when applied to construction materials procurement. Specifically, this paper briefly described the business processes involved in construction materials procurement and illustrated how ERP systems could be implemented and the efficiency of the construction materials management system consequently enhanced. The transformation from a non-ERP system into an ERP system through application integration, internal integration, external integration, and automation were simulated. Results show that the individual task improvements of models can increase the productivity of the materials management cycle by up to 5.2%, 18.2%, 27.8%, 13.5%, and 79.2% through internal integration, external integration, application integration, automation, and ERP system, respectively, by automating most of the repeated transactions and reducing manpower required to perform the tasks.Key words: enterprise resource planning, materials management system, productivity, simulation. </jats:p>",

We too foresee a danger that system‐wide adoption of PCP will be characterised over zealous ‘selling’ of the purported benefits without sufficient attention to the difficulties and without the necessary changes to system architecture to ensure that those involved in PCP have the authority or resources to achieve the plan's goals. If so, PCP will become another fad, and service users, and their families will become even more discouraged, disheartened and alienated by a system characterised by rhetoric rather than meaningful action. Where we differ, is in the interpretation of the existing evidence regarding the impact of individual planning systems in general and, perhaps, in the way forward.</jats:p>",

Today, water utilities are faced with constraints beyond those associated with water quality and delivery. Through interviews with participating utilities, the authors identified a complex set of constraints including regulations, customer expectations, and environmental, political, and financial issues. Utilities reported that balancing these constraints while developing a better product in a competitive market is forcing them to reexamine how, when, where, and why resources are developed and managed. This article presents the Strategic Business Planning Model (SBPM) that was developed to enable utilities to integrate water resource development activities both within and outside the utility. The SBPM strategically integrates water resource planning elements and facilitates implementation of a holistic resource approach. The model is an iterative, long‐term method for integrating all utility elements into a strategic business plan that organizes the internal and external intricacies and interrelationships necessary to operate in a successful, businesslike manner.</jats:p>",

As a low-cost and universal communication tool, it enables actors to pass on information and to have transactions at a distance. However, research on telephone use in the professional sphere has been limited to the particular situation of call centres and has mainly investigated organisational and interactional issues. In this paper I attempt to broaden the scope of analysis and to characterise more generally the inscription of telephony in economic networks. I focus on the population of small businesses and draw on a project concerning 881 firms. The project enables me to combine telephone-traffic data and quantitative survey data concerning the engagement of the telephone in economic activities for these small businesses. A specific methodological standpoint is proposed to explore this empirical material and to characterise the particular nature of telephony in small businesses. The dynamic and asymmetric nature of telephony leads me to question the way in which communication tools can be integrated in an analysis of the spatial inscription of economic activity and networks. </jats:p>",

It provides evidence for the development of a ‘connected’ management of relationships, in which the (physically) absent party gains presence through the multiplication of mediated communication gestures on both sides, up to the point where copresent interactions and mediated distant exchanges seem woven into a single, seamless web. After reviewing some of the current social-science research, I rely on empirical studies of the uses of the home telephone, the mobile phone, and mobile text messaging in France to discuss how this particular repertoire of ‘connected’ relationships has gradually crystallized as these technologies have become widespread and as each additional communication resource has been made available to users. I also describe how such a ‘connected’ mode coexists with a previous way of managing ‘mediated’ relationships, in which communication technologies were thought to substitute or compensate for the rarity of face-to-face interactions. </jats:p>",

However, most empirical studies are descriptive and rely on bivariate analysis; multivariate analysis is scarcely used. Conventional Western research, in turn, mostly stresses the importance of structural factors in explaining migration in the Soviet Union. The author aims to look at the extent to which structural factors and personal characteristics determine the first residence and first migration of immigrants in Estonia after World War 2. Individual-level data of the Estonian Family and Fertility Survey (1994) on 1067 foreign-born females are used and multivariate analysis applied. The analysis shows that the first residence and first migration of the foreign-born population in Estonia differ significantly by immigration cohort—a variable reflecting structural factors. However, when the personal characteristics of immigrants are included in the model, the role of the immigration cohort (as a determinant of migration) decreases significantly. The results support the belief that migration in the Soviet Union is a complex outcome of the interaction between structural forces and the interests of people, as it is elsewhere in the world. </jats:p>",

This paper uses in-depth interviews with executives at ethnic-Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles to consider the comovement of people and money. We find that understanding the causes and consequences of this comovement requires adding both ethnic and macrostructural layers to discussions of financial globalization. The forces that have led to the rise of a Chinese-American banking sector and to the opening of twenty-one Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles are intertwined: immigration from the Chinese diaspora to the USA, the growth trajectory and financial transformation of East Asia, and the financial and economic evolution of Los Angeles. Ethnic-Chinese foreign-bank offices in Los Angeles have dual roles: they function both as global outposts managing their headquarters' cross-border financial flows, and as localized institutions that are gradually becoming incorporated into Southern California's internal banking and financial markets. Foreign and domestic ethnic-Chinese banks play complementary roles in facilitating ethnic-Chinese economic development in Southern California. Framing these cross-border money–population flows and this cross-border institution building, respectively, are macrostructural constraints rooted in aggregate net financial flows and the changing strategies of global megabanks. </jats:p>",

Its future depends on landscape linkages with other bear populations that are separated by denatured habitat. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to identify potential landscape linkages between this isolated population and six others in Florida. Pathway lengths ranged from 60–194 km with varying potentials for facilitating black bear dispersal. Each pathway incorporated 35–88% conservation land and encountered at least 11 dispersal bottlenecks. Even pathways that incorporated extensive conservation land encountered bottlenecks that make these linkages potentially unviable. All six pathways, however, passed through ≥95% core black bear habitat. Thus, the infrastructure for a conservation network is still largely intact. The Suwannee pathway provides the best opportunity to restore connectivity between the Greater Chassahowitzka Ecosystem (GCE) and a southward colonising bear population in the Big Bend region. However, intensification of development poses an immediate threat to maintaining connectivity between the GCE and other bear populations in Florida. Through immediate strategic planning and active conservation and restoration measures, many of the generated pathways can provide long‐term connectivity. Least‐cost path analyses can aid in the conservation of wide‐ranging animals by providing managers with a science‐based, empirically derived blueprint of potential landscape linkages.</jats:p>",

It focuses specifically on the concepts of space and place deployed within these strategies and the institutional work these concepts are called upon to do. It explores how far such concepts reflect the shift in geographical thought to a dynamic, dis‐contiguous, relational conceptualization of spatiality. These issues are explored through an analysis of three recent strategic planning episodes: The Netherlands Fifth National Policy Document on Spatial Planning, the Regional Development Strategy for Northern Ireland, and the Framework Document for Milan. All are innovative in their contexts in one way or another and provide exemplars of new ways of thinking about space and place, and the role of spatial strategies in contemporary governance contexts. All the episodes reflect in some way new relational geographical ideas, but many traditional planning ideas live on. The analysis highlights the political dimensions of developing new spatial vocabularies to guide urban and regional development and the significance of the institutional context in shaping and accepting new spatial planning concepts.</jats:p><jats:p>Cet article examine de récentes expériences de stratégies spatiales urbaines et régionales en Europe. Il s'attache aux concepts d'espace et de lieu appliqués à celles‐ci et au travail institutionnel qui leur est réclamé. Il étudie notamment dans quelle mesure ces concepts reflètent l'évolution de la réflexion géographique vers une conceptualisation dynamique, dissociée et relationnelle de la spatialité. Ce faisant, il analyse trois cas récents de planification stratégique: le 5ème Texte de Politique nationale des Pays‐Bas sur la planification spatiale, la Stratégie de développement régional en Irlande du Nord, et le Document‐cadre pour Milan. D'une manière ou d'une autre, tous sont novateurs dans leur contexte, et constituent des modèles originaux de réflexion sur l'espace et le lieu, ainsi que sur le rôle des stratégies spatiales dans le cadre des modes de gouvernance contemporains. Tous les cas traduisent par certains aspects de nouvelles notions géographiques relationnelles, la planification traditionnelle n'étant pas pour autant totalement évincée. L'étude souligne la portée politique des nouveaux lexiques spatiaux élaborés pour guider l'expansion urbaine et régionale, ainsi que l'importance du contexte institutionnel dans la configuration et l'acceptation de concepts de planification spatiale innovants.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A resurgence of interest in industrial agglomerations can be found among many different academic disciplines. This trend has been accompanied by a focus on how spatial proximity and the emergence of links between colocated actors may generate benefits for firms, namely, in the generation and diffusion of knowledge. By conceiving industrial agglomerations as territorially based networks, we argue that the dynamics in connections internal to those networks affect and are affected by local institutions as well as connections external to the territory. Our study of the injection mould industry cluster at Marinha Grande in Portugal suggests that firms profit from the emergence of relationships between colocated actors and other agglomeration benefits. However, we suggest that the potential of the industry to generate new knowledge appears to be founded on the patterns of interfirm connections, which selectively connect diverse capabilities both within and outside the agglomeration. </jats:p>",

The author argues that mainstream explanations of the water crises tend to reduce the problem to its economic, technological, and physical – natural dimensions. Although the relevance of these factors affecting the provision of efficient and universal water and sanitation service is recognized the emphasis is placed on the socioeconomic and political inequalities that determine the exclusion of large sectors of the population from full access to essential living conditions, including water services. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper compares British and US government policy initiatives to combat financial exclusion and promote community reinvestment. Financial exclusion, a general term for those who lack financial products, is concentrated in a small number of deprived urban areas in larger cities that are also starved of private sector investment. British policies, though they have drawn on US experience, predominantly treat exclusion as an individual problem and pay insufficient attention to the wider interconnections between people and place that underlie financial exclusion. These are more prominent in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) that has led to significant improvements in financial inclusion and community investment in the USA. The CRA is underpinned by a more compartmentalised and locally embedded system of financial regulation. Consolidation in the banking sector and the growth of competition between banks and other financial institutions in an increasingly integrated US financial sector threaten this. British policies seek to provide ‘joined-up’ solutions to financial exclusion in a manner that is more in tune with an integrated financial sector where a small number of large banks compete on a level playing field with other financial institutions. The paper highlights the difficulties that these policies face in enlisting the cooperation of financial institutions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The reform of the British welfare state through the Labour Party's welfare-to-work initiative is beginning to generate considerable debate. Research is revealing that, amongst other things, supply-side interventions are not sufficient on their own to build skilled, dynamic, and socially inclusive economies. Although there is an emerging consensus that welfare-to-work is deeply problematic, in UK debates there has been a degree of reluctance to discuss workable alternatives. This paper stimulates debate by focusing on Denmark's labour-market and welfare reforms during the 1990s. As part of a ‘welfare- through-work’ model, fostered on a negotiated and inclusive system of welfare reform, Denmark has followed a strategy that appears to deliver both economic competitiveness and social cohesion, and also raises critical questions around labour market inequalities and the distribution of work. We suggest that the Danish experience can shed light on tensions currently being experienced within Britain. Attention is specifically paid to the origins, development, and promises of job rotation—a radical work-sharing initiative that is being flagged by the European Commission as the good-practice model for ‘sustainable employment’ and ‘lifelong learning’. We argue that important connections exist between the structure of labour-market representation, which is mediated through the social and political forces that can gain access to the state apparatus, and the patterns of policy interventions and their outcomes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Farming enterprises throughout the European Union have traditionally been treated very differently by the state compared with their nonagricultural counterparts. Agricultural activities have been governed by a separate set of policy objectives, political institutions, and support agencies. However, this agricultural ‘exceptionalism’ is being steadily eroded as markets are partially liberalised, farmers are encouraged to pursue new forms of economic activity, and as government institutions are reformed. Farmers are being encouraged to see themselves as ‘entrepreneurs' to face fundamentally changed markets. There is, therefore, renewed attention to the existing levels of generic business skills within the farming sector and to the nature and effectiveness of business advice and support frameworks in enhancing these skills. The paper investigates the extent to which farmers have experienced different patterns of business support use and perceive themselves as having different generic skills needs in comparison with other rural microbusinesses and considers the attractiveness of different models of delivering business advice to the sector. A review is undertaken of the evolution of rural business support in England together with an analysis of data from a survey of almost 1800 rural microbusinesses in the northeast of England. It is concluded that there are a number of significant challenges facing the adjustment of the farm sector towards a more entrepreneurial model of business development arising from the sector's legacy of separation and exceptionalism within the support framework. In order to help encourage the development of generic business skills an ‘intermediary’ model of business advice is advocated, in which an intermediary agency acts as a bridge between farms and generic business support providers. </jats:p>",

In Slovakia political conditions early in the transition led to the relative neglect of revenue transfers from the center. This produced financial stress but also encouraged greater fiscal independence for local governments. It also forced them to seek maximal property tax revenues. The Czech Republic made more substantial transfers to local governments, but the development of fiscal autonomy was stifled as transfers reduced the need for own-source local revenues. The Czech real estate tax has remained nominal, as it was under central planning, and its administration is fraught with moral hazard problems. Thus, the property tax never became a vehicle for generating independent funds, but the prospects for the tax are much brighter in the Slovak Republic. This paper offers several views on why the property tax has been more successful in the Slovak Republic. </jats:p>",

One general way of describing the problem is to say that when planners design the program, processes, and business model, they often do not take into account the interests of all internal and external stakeholders. This article focuses on how planning models that foreground learning but neglect faculty, staff, and organizational interests undermine learning, because they undercut implementation and sustainability. Planning models that foreground and balance stakeholder interests support learning because they support implementation and sustainability. </jats:p>",

In the United Kingdom, the state's reluctance to manage or spatially redistribute growth in the South East has resulted in localised pressures on housing markets, the land-use planning system, infrastructure, and the environment, intensifying struggles between progrowth and antigrowth factions in certain places. In this paper the authors examine conflicts arising from the rapid growth of new economic spaces in and around the Cambridge subregion and explore various attempts by different branches of the state and locally dependent factions of capital to overcome barriers to further growth within existing and proposed frameworks for territorial management. A key arena of conflict in this instance centres upon land-use planning and provision of infrastructure. The Cambridge ‘growth crisis’ raises a series of issues about the ability of interests claiming to represent nationally important city-regions to detach such places from their formative local and national modes of regulation. </jats:p>",

We report such data collected between 1998 and 2002 from 201 schools and 68 communities across Uganda. In accordance with epidemiological expectation, prevalence and intensity increased with age, peaking at 10–20 years and thereafter declined moderately with age, whereas intensity declined more rapidly with age, and the prevalence of infection in a school was non‐linearly related to the mean intensity of infection. We used geographical information systems to map the distribution of infection and to overlay parasitological data with interpolated environmental surfaces. The derived maps indicate both a widespread occurrence of infection and a marked variability in infection prevalence, with prevalence typically highest near the lakeshore and along large rivers. No transmission occurred at altitudes &gt;1400 m or where total annual rainfall was &lt;900 mm; limits which can help estimate the population at risk of schistosomiasis. The results are discussed in reference to the ecology of infection and provide an epidemiological framework for the design and implementation of control efforts underway in Uganda.</jats:p>",

The primary end point must correspond to the specific aims of the trial. It should be objectively defined, quantifiable, reliable, and reproducible. Commonly defined end points in surgical trials include changes from baseline illness or disease severity scores, morbidity and mortality rates, and relative risks of reaching an end point with time. The statistical methods used for interim and final analyses are important. The effects of dropouts, crossovers, and missing data should be understood in the context of the final analysis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The challenge of remanufacturing is the production of quality products from returned discarded cores of unknown quality. Case studies and published literature reveal that there are no established processes tailored to the particular needs of product remanufacture. This paper outlines the difficulties associated with the planning and execution of product remanufacture. It then presents a systematic approach for the planning and execution of product remanufacture based upon the failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) method. The approach is demonstrated in case studies of the remanufacture of an air-conditioning unit and a turbocharger. The results from the case studies are discussed and conclusions are drawn. The wider issues associated with remanufacturing including reliability and safety, further research opportunities and the design of functional products are then discussed and conclusions drawn. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:title>Background and Objectives</jats:title><jats:p>Literature review suggests that the sentinel lymph node (sN) represents a reliable predictor of axillary lymph node status in breast cancer patients; however, some important issues, such as the optimisation of the technique for the intraoperative identification of the sN, the role of intraoperative frozen section examination of the sN, and the clinical implications of sN metastasis as regards the surgical management of the axilla, still require further confirmation. The authors aimed (1) to assess the feasibility of sN identification with a combined approach (vital blue dye lymphatic mapping and radioguided surgery, RGS) and the specific contribution of either techniques to the detection of the sN, (2) to determine the accuracy and usefulness of intraoperative frozen section examination of the sN in order to perform a one‐stage surgical procedure, and (3) to define how the sN might modulate the therapeutic planning in different stages of disease.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Materials and Methods</jats:title><jats:p>From October 1997 to June 2001, 334 patients with early‐stage (T<jats:sub>1–2</jats:sub> N<jats:sub>0</jats:sub> M<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>) invasive mammary carcinoma underwent sN biopsy; the average age of patients was 61.5 years (range, 39–75 years). In a subset of 153 patients, both vital blue dye (Patent Blue‐V) lymphatic mapping and RGS were used to identify the sN, and the relative contribution of each of the two techniques was assessed.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>In the whole group, the sN was identified in 326 of 334 patients (97.6%), and 105 of 326 patients (37.3%) had positive axillary lymph nodes (pN+). In 9 of 105 pN+ patients, the definitive histologic examination of the sN did not show metastases but these were detected in non‐sN, thus giving an 8.6% false‐negative rate, a negative predictive value of 94.5% (156/165), and an accuracy of 96.5% (252/261). As regards the specific contribution of the two different techniques used in the identification of the sN, the detection rate was 73.8% (113/153) with Patent Blue‐V alone, 94.1% (144/153) with RGS alone, and 98.7% (151/153) with Patent Blue‐V combined with RGS (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001). Noteworthy, whenever the sN was identified, the prediction of axillary lymph node status was remarkably similar (93–95% sensitivity; 100% specificity; 95–97% negative predictive value, and 97–98% accuracy) whichever of the three procedures was adopted (Patent Blue‐V alone, RGS alone, or combined Patent Blue‐V and RGS). Intraoperative frozen section examination was performed in 261 patients, who had at least one sN identified, out of 267 patients who underwent complete axillary dissection; 170 patients had histologically negative sN (i.o. sN−) and 91 patients histologically positive sN (i.o. sN+). All 91 i.o. sN+ were confirmed by definitive histology, whereas in 14 of 170 i.o. sN− patients (8.2%) metastases were detected at definitive histology. As regards the correlation between the size of sN metastasis, the primary tumour size, and the status of non‐sN in the axilla, micrometastases were detected at final histology in 23 patients and macrometastases in 82 patients. When only micrometastases were detected, the sN was the exclusive site of nodal metastasis in 20 of 23 patients (86.9%) while in 3 patients with tumour size larger than 10 mm micrometastases were detected also in non‐sN. Macrometastases were never detected in pT<jats:sub>1a</jats:sub> breast cancer patients; the sN was the exclusive site of these metastases in 30 patients (36.6%), while in 52 patients (63.4%) there were metastases both in sN and non‐sN.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Sentinel lymphadenectomy can better be accomplished when both procedures (lymphatic mapping with vital blue dye and RGS) are used, because of the significantly higher sN detection rate, although the prediction of axillary lymph node status remains remarkably similar whichever method is used. The intraoperative frozen section examination proved to be rather accurate in predicting the actual pathologic status of the sN, with a negative predictive value of 91.8%; in 35% of patients it allowed sN biopsy and axillary dissection to be performed in a one‐stage surgical procedure. Finally, specific clinical and histopathologic features of the primary tumour and sN might be used to tailor the loco‐regional and systemic treatment in different clinical settings, such as in ductal carcinoma in‐situ (DCIS), early‐stage invasive breast cancer, and patients with large breast cancer undergoing neo‐adjuvant CT for breast‐saving surgery as well as elderly patients with operable breast cancer.
