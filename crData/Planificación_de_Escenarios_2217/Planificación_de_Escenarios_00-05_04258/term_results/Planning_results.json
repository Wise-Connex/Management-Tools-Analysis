      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban scholars have recently begun to employ transaction costs as a heuristic device to understand the land use planning process. This emphasis on transaction costs can be traced to Ronald H. Coase’s “The Problem of Social Cost,” an article that calls into question the traditional market failure justification for public policy intervention. This article reviews the normative debate surrounding the Coase Theorem and the effects of this debate on positive analyses of the land use planning process. An emphasis on the transaction costs of public policy intervention provides a useful framework for understanding the private demand for land use plans, the organizational dimension of land use plan implementation, and the impact of alternate land use planning systems on the land development decisions of private landowners. </jats:p>",

The bibliography begins by reviewing literature that examines the transformation from regulating aesthetics for health, safety, and welfare purposes to the broadened notion of aesthetics being considered as a valid public purpose in and of itself; ultimately leading to a government’s ability to regulate solely for aesthetic reasons. It then examines literature discussing costs and benefits of enacting ordinances to control the aesthetic quality of an area and discusses literature that argues private efforts, such as conservation easements, will better control aesthetics. Another important topic includes powers granted to governments to regulate cellular towers for aesthetic purposes. The article concludes by reviewing literature discussing the limitations, such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and property rights issues, placed on government when controlling aesthetics. </jats:p>",

When and whereappropriate, dispersants may be the most viable response option available tothe offshore operator. However, the window of opportunity in which dispersantsare effective can be short-lived. Pre-planning is critical to ensure dispersantoperations are implemented in a timely and cost effective manner.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Significance</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Less than 10 years ago the use of dispersants was not widely accepted by theregulatory community. However, the oil &amp; gas and marine transportationindustries operating in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) have worked closely with stateand federal agencies to become the leaders in the development of dispersants asa primary response tool. While the successful use of dispersants in GOM Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) oil spills over the past few years has validated theirplace as an effective response tool, improper use or poorly applied dispersantscould reverse the acceptance of this valuable response tool.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>When an oil spill occurs, there are a number of response technologies thatcan be deployed. The three primary \"tools in the toolbox\" are mechanicalrecovery (utilizing boom and skimmers), chemical dispersants, and in-situburning. The success of each of these response options is highly dependent upontwo primary factors: the type and behavior of the oil spilled, and the level oflogistics preparedness necessary to support the response.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The model calculates the risk level as the product of failure consequences and failure probabilities. Failure consequences considered include financial aspects relating to repair, interruption and restoration; safety aspects related to platform and vessel occupants; and environmental aspects associated with spills. Distinction is made between small leaks, large leaks and ruptures, and the major failure causes (namely, corrosion and mechanical damage) are considered. The model quantifies the benefits associated with different maintenance alternatives by calculating their impact on the probability of failure and risk level. A formal decision analysis approach is then used to evaluate the costs and benefits associated with each alternative, and identify the best overall maintenance strategy.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This model differs from previous work in risk-based planning in that it:utilizes structural pipe failure models and reliability analysis techniques to calculate failure probabilities;quantifies the impact of maintenance on risk; andutilizes a methodology based on decision theory to identify optimal choices.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>It is applicable to various aspects of maintenance planning for offshore pipelines such as the selection of inspection tools, inspection intervals and defect repair criteria; and the optimization of damage prevention activities including mechanical protection, cover monitoring and public awareness programs.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper will include the results of simulations dealing with maintenance optimization for corrosion and mechanical damage. These results demonstrate that risk-based planning is a powerful tool for minimizing risk by maintaining high reliability at the lowest possible cost. The most significant aspect of this work is that it provides a novel approach to managing pipeline integrity in a cost-effective manner.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The goal of an effective pipeline integrity maintenance program is to ensure that the limited resources available are utilized most effectively in reducing the risks posed by pipeline failures to life, the environment and financial assets.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The uncertainties associated with making such an assessment has led to a recognition of risk analysis as a sound basis for making decisions on integrity maintenance. Risk, in this context, is defined as the probability of line failure multiplied by a measure of the associated adverse consequences. The risks associated with a pipeline system and its individual segments, and the potential risk reductions resulting from different maintenance activities can be used as a basis for evaluating different alternatives and developing an optimal maintenance plan.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper describes a comprehensive methodology for risk-based integrity maintenance optimization of offshore natural gas, crude oil and petroleum product pipelines. The methodology has been developed and implemented in a software package called PIRAMID?, (Pipeline Risk Analysis for Maintenance and Inspection Decisions) under a joint industry program sponsored by a number of transmission companies and government agencies (see Acknowledgements). The types of decisions addressed by the methodology include the choice of inspection methods (e.g., cover depth survey, in-line inspection) and inspection intervals, as well as the choice of maintenance actions (e.g., corrosion inhibition, hydro-test, coating reconditioning and replacement).</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

In previous chapters we have discussed some of the ways in which companies can help ensure that CEOs and boards will devote the needed time and energy to succession to create a reliable process. In addition to some of the factors we’ve already discussed—such as establishing regular timetables to identify and nurture talent as well as review the progress of potential successors—the right financial framework, with different incentives applying to each party, can help to establish a sound and orderly succession process and keep things on track. Just what those incentives should be and the philosophy underlying each is the subject of this chapter.</jats:p>",

The only active large multichannel reflection system deployed in the U.S. is on the R/V Maurice Ewing of Columbia University. Even though it is used only four months per year in this mode it continues to provide scientists the ability to conduct experiments in regions of the world not typically served by commercial operators. It provides a unique platform for scientists to work with new acquisition techniques and train students. Other countries experience similar usage levels for their acquisition systems. Combined worldwide activities of primarily academic systems are about 18 months per year for large MCS operations spread across 10 or more ships.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Scientific programs have included 3-D studies of active oceanic ridge crest magma chambers and fluid flow along the plate boundary faults beneath accretionary margins. Twodimensional surveys include studies of Jurassic stratigraphy in the deep oceans, architecture of oceanic plateaus, cross sections of major subduction zones, and the structure of thickly sedimented passive margins.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Scientific research objectives are well developed for the next decade, defining a growing role for sophisticated survey techniques at significantly smaller spatial scales. A recent workshop held to review academic seismic acquisition in the U.S. revealed a significant gap between the needs of the community and existing levels and types of acquisition that are realistically available. To achieve the stated scientific goals for the next decade will require more capable 3-D and 4-C systems. This will require a coordinated international academic response and cooperation with commercial contractors. The academic marine Geoscience programs need to foster fundamental changes in their operations, partnerships and budget levels to meet the challenges of the next decade.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In the United States, scientific planning activities within the marine geology and geophysics (MG&amp;G) and related communities have identified specific scientific goals for the next decade that require access to seismic acquisition facilities. Over the next decade the academic scientists will need high fidelity subsurface images of compressional and shear energy at all scales. At the same time, the number of academic Earth scientists and their students involved in marine data acquisition continues to drop. The declining numbers are due to the difficulty in using existing academic equipment, the lack of easy access to data collected by other investigators and funding levels.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>History of U.S. Seismic Acquisition</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>With the advent of seismic profiling in the 1960's and particularly the invention of the compressed air \"gun\" at Lamont- Doherty Earth Observatory (Lamont), seismic profiles were collected routinely into the mid-1970's using a towed single channel hydrophone array (SCS). The results were millions of kilometers of profiles of the thin sediments and sedimentary structures above the oceanic crust and continental and island arc margins around the world. In the late 1970's, the earlier SCS methods were upgraded to digital recording and became important for a variety of higher spatial resolution problems associated with paleoceanography and neotectonics when used in conjunction with new seafloor swath mapping tools.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

This paper examines the principles, practice and pitfalls of scenario building with the prime aim of presenting the technique as one singularly relevant to the study of future property investment, development and management decisions and land use policy formulation. The origins of the approach from its military‐based beginnings, through the popularised global environmental applications to the current widescale use by industry and commerce are traced. Some definitions are advanced to demonstrate the multi‐various nature of the method, and different types of scenario identified to show their adaptability and agility. The general purpose of the technique as a learning mechanism for organizations is explored, and the step‐by‐step process of scenario building specifically analysed. Conclusions are drawn which record the success of scenario building in many fields other than property and predict the adoption of the scenario approach as the principal behavioural technique for determining corporate real estate strategy in the future.</jats:p>",

We formalize the    intuition that expressive power is a measure of how concisely planning    domains and plans can be expressed in a particular formalism by    introducing the notion of ``compilation schemes'' between planning    formalisms.  Using this notion, we analyze the expressiveness of a    large family of propositional planning formalisms, ranging from basic    STRIPS to a formalism with conditional effects, partial state    specifications, and propositional formulae in the preconditions.  One    of the results is that conditional effects cannot be compiled away if    plan size should grow only linearly but can be compiled away if we    allow for polynomial growth of the resulting plans. This result    confirms that the recently proposed extensions to the GRAPHPLAN    algorithm concerning conditional effects are optimal with respect to    the ``compilability'' framework.  Another result is that general    propositional formulae cannot be compiled into conditional effects if    the plan size should be preserved linearly.  This implies that    allowing general propositional formulae in preconditions and effect    conditions adds another level of difficulty in generating a plan.</jats:p>"

These information systems must be well managed, cost‐efficient, legal, and safe. There is a growing reliance upon IT in many organizations to the point of mission‐criticality. Ideas from disaster recovery planning (DRP) can and should be applied to installed information systems and the new information services whose continuous and reliable functioning may be vital to the organization. This paper reviews the literature concerning the factors that have been identified as essential to the development of DRPs in organizations.

Using data from a survey of Alaskan residents in the Chugach National Forest plan revision process, the relationship between attitudes toward forest management actions and forest values is examined using a variety of statistical procedures. Key findings indicate that: (1) survey respondents were able to identify with 13 distinct forest values based on a modified forest value typology developed by Rolston and Coufal (1991), (2) no obvious latent structure of variables or constructs emerged from factor analysis of the 13 forest values indicating that the forest value typology may not be easily simplified without compromising the exclusiveness of measured forest values, (3) small, but statistically significant correlations were found between attitudes toward specific forest management practices such as logging and mining and held forest values, and (4) forest values are modestly predictive of respondent preferences for specific forest planning decisions.

Urban land cover types were delineated as the underlying spatial units, characterized by physical and landuse attributes such as the percentage cover of built-on land and vegetation. The urban forest was described as the cover of trees and shrubs and the maximum age of trees. The survey was coupled with statistical databases and environmental data such as a habitat survey and thermal infrared photography. Trees and shrubs covered approximately 5,400 ha (13,300 ac) of land, or 18% of Munich's surface area. The spatial pattern of the urban forest was closely linked with the general zoning of different land use and building density. The relationship between cover, size, and age of woody vegetation and the incidence of woodland indicator birds was used to assess the role of the urban forest for urban nature conservation, and potential habitat links of closely neighboring woodlands were identified by means of the GIS. Furthermore, it was shown that the urban forest can effectively reduce air temperatures during hot summer days. Specific urban forestry programs and quantitative targets were proposed for urban zones. These would increase the forest cover to 22% of the city's surface area. An estimate for the overall costs for the establishment of the additional forest areas is given.</jats:p>",

This definition ignores the risk-averse attitudes of many decision-makers when dealing with low probability/high consequence events. We suggest that avoiding a catastrophe (an incident with a very large consequence) may be a relevant issue in routing hazardous materials, and we introduce three different catastrophe-avoidance models. In the first model, catastrophe avoidance is achieved by minimizing the maximum population exposure. In the second model, the variance of the route consequence is incorporated into the decision. In the third model, an explicit disutility function is used. We show that all three models reduce to a standard shortest path problem. Each model avoids high-population areas of the transport network. We give numerical examples and discuss the similarities and the differences among the three models. The first of the three models suggested may be the most intuitive, and is the most tractable computationally. Implementation of the other two models may be difficult due to scaling issues. Nevertheless, these models offer theoretical insight that may be valuable to researchers. </jats:p>",

Research in LPP is divided into three historical phases: (1) decolonization, structuralism, and pragmatism; (2) the failure of modernization, critical sociolinguistics, and access; and (3) the new world order, postmodernism, and linguistic human rights.

The articulatory features of the consonants are those of the kinematics of the articulators; that is, the position and velocity of the articulator. The model first recovers the kinematic features from the acoustic segment for the vowels using the acoustic-to-articulatory inverse mapping method [S. Suzuki et al., Proc. ICSLP 6, 2251–2254 (1998)]. Using the kinematic features of the vowels together with those for the consonants, the model determines the minimum-acceleration trajectory that coincides with the extremum of the time integral of the square of the magnitude of acceleration of the articulator [T.

The physical planning in radiosurgery treatment involves selecting among a large collection of beams with different physical parameters an optimal beam configuration (geometries and intensities) to deliver the clinically prescribed radiation dose to the tumor volume while sparing the nearby critical structure and normal tissue. The proposed mixed integer programming models incorporate strict dose restrictions on tumor volume, and constraints on the desired number of beams, isocenters, couch angles, and gantry angles. The model seeks to deliver full prescription dose coverage and uniform radiation dose to the tumor volume while minimizing the excess radiation to the periphery normal tissue. In particular, it ensures that proximal normal tissues receive minimal dose via rapid dose fall‐off. Preliminary numerical tests on a single patient case indicate that this approach can produce exceptionally high‐quality plans in a fraction of the time required using the procedure currently employed by clinicians. The resulting plans provide highly uniform prescription dose to the tumor volume while drastically reducing the irradiation received by the proximal critical normal tissue.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Network perspectives have recently been proposed as a theoretical base for research in economic geography. However, there is an unclear relationship between the advocacy of network approaches and the development of methodological tactics to frame related empirical research. By reference to one episode of corporate spatial behaviour—the establishment of a manufacturing facility in Thailand by the US-headquartered breakfast-cereal company, Kellogg—an organising framework for network-inspired economic geography is suggested. Kellogg's entry into Thailand is analysed in terms of the construction and mobilisation of relational networks producing five overlapping geographies: (1) geographies of place; (2) geographies of intrafirm trade and relations; (3) regional geographies of accumulation; (4) geographies of interfirm relations; and (5) geographies of consumption. </jats:p>",

The woodworking industry is geographically concentrated; its location is influenced by the source of its primary inputs as well as by the location of growing economies with high construction activity. The industry tends to follow the business cycle, but its domestic growth opportunities are increasingly infringed upon by rising wood products and furniture imports. How successfully the U.S. woodworking industry holds its market share will increasingly depend on the implementation of advanced woodworking machine tools within its production approach. This article concludes by discussing how successful “growing” of the woodworking industry may be for the regional economies that are seeking to do so. </jats:p>",

A survey of Japan's aid is helpful in any attempt to understand the impact of aid on China's national and regional development and on state strategies. Japan's aid is closely tied to the health of Japan's economy—the second largest economy in the world. Though certainly not unique in this regard, Japan's aid has a reputation for serving Japan's own national interests at the expense of the recipient nation's environmental and social conditions. The results of this survey reveal: (a) clearly defined and specific geographic patterns to Japan's aid to China; (b) changing sectoral patterns in Japan's aid to China; (c) important institutional changes underway in Japan's aid programs; and (d) a transfer of capital from Japan to China which serve the divergent goals of each state, though not necessarily in ways intended by each state. </jats:p>",

The analysis suggests that temporary migrants are more likely to migrate than are comparable permanent migrants or nonmigrants. The results also indicate that males are more likely to migrate as individuals than are females. Although age has a great deterrent impact on family migration, being married shows a much greater negative effect on planning an individual migration. Also, family network proves to be more important for determining individual migration than family migration. The results lend support to the notion that temporary migrants in cities do consider themselves as temporary residents and are therefore more likely to migrate again in the near future. They also confirm the argument that different factors play significant roles in individual versus family migration, and highlight the importance in distinguishing the two in empirical studies in developing countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author seeks to contribute to the debate on embeddedness, milieu, and innovation in industrial districts through a case study of high-technology firms in Richardson, an inner-ring suburban city of the Dallas–Fort Worth Metropolitan area. Richardson is important because it can be clearly defined as an industrial district, with over 600 high-technology firms and 70 000 employees. The results suggest that the district is robust and highly innovative with considerable capacity for self-sustaining growth. The firms are well integrated, locally and nationally. Despite extensive formal connections, firms' relationships are not very embedded locally. The link between embeddedness and innovation is subtle at best, and is confined to a small set of the most highly innovative firms. Similarly, evidence of a well-established industrial milieu was not forthcoming, although it may be emerging. The relationship between milieu and innovation was vague and was confined to the most innovative firms. The long-term viability of the district is closely tied to the economic health of the metropolitan economy, suggesting that development strategies focused on the district per se are likely to meet with limited success. </jats:p>",

These algorithms overcome a number of difficulties which arise when a large number of catheters are present. These include situations with intersecting catheters and with loop techniques. The time required for the catheter reconstruction process using our autoreconstruction method is significantly reduced.

It argues that pollution prevention, through planning for closure, can lead to cost‐effective strategies for sustainable minerals development and viable future land use. This seems to be most true for greenfield sites since, generally, the earlier closure planning and pollution prevention is built into a project, the more cost‐effective and environmentally benign closure will be. Further, for greenfield sites, pollution prevention techniques can be employed from the outset, at the stages of exploration and mine development, and then monitored and improved through the operation stage to closure, and can be kept in place to manage future land use.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper discusses how global changes in the industry, following the liberalisation of investment regimes, and mergers and strategic alliances between key firms, has, by virtue of the diffusion of new technology, led to further opportunities to prevent pollution and optimise future land use through planning for closure from the outset. The objectives and components of closure plans are also reviewed as the paper draws on case studies to highlight some of the possible constraints and challenges to pollution prevention that may be faced at the level of both public policy and corporate strategy. The article concludes by suggesting a forward‐looking approach to integrated environmental management and viable future land‐use planning based on a dynamic model for environmental management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The strong performance of Singapore's chemical industry in recent years has increased public awareness about the importance of this obscure sector in the Singapore economy. In the public rhetoric, much of this robust growth is attributed to the industrial policies implemented by the Singapore government. However, the ultimate decision to built a multibillion dollar chemical-processing plant in resource-scarce Singapore still depends very much on the global strategies of transnational chemical firms (CTNCs). The authors propose a firm-level perspective to aid in understanding the development of Singapore's chemical industry. They argue that the global strategies of CTNCs have a vital role to play in promoting growth within the Singapore chemical industry cluster. Conceived under the 1991 Strategic Economic Plan, the idea of clustering represents a radically different approach to the development of the petroleum-refining, petrochemicals, specialty chemicals, and pharmaceutical industries where previously each was deemed a separate activity. Based on field research into over forty subsidiaries and local suppliers of CTNCs in Singapore, the authors highlight the importance of two major contextual influences on the global strategies of CTNCs: rising global competition and the huge market potential offered by developing countries. Given these circumstances, CTNCs have relied on their established capabilities to formulate spatial strategies for increasing global competitiveness. In Singapore, subsidiaries of CTNCs have tapped into cluster-based advantages to enhance their capabilities, thereby contributing to the further growth of Singapore's chemical industry cluster. </jats:p>",

Elaborating on Shotter's idea of knowledge-from-within, we argue that knowledge-cultures are social achievements that equip those who embody them with a relational–responsive kind of understanding of events and surroundings built on multiple knowledge-forms. To explore this contextual nature of knowledge-culture construction and illustrate our arguments, we draw on detailed empirical research of farmers' experiences with the precision-farming technique of yield mapping in the English counties of Lincolnshire and Suffolk. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a useful technique for exploring spatial nonstationarity by calibrating, for example, a regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. In this line of research, many spatial data sets have been successfully analyzed and some statistical tests for spatial variation have been developed. However, an important assumption in these studies is that the disturbance terms of the GWR model are uncorrelated and of common variance. Similar to the case in the ordinary linear regression, spatial autocorrelation can invalidate the standard assumption of homoscedasticity of the disturbances and mislead the results of statistical inference. Therefore, developing some statistical methods to test for spatial autocorrelation is a very important issue. In this paper, two kinds of the statistical tests for spatial autocorrelation among the residuals of the GWR model are suggested. Also, an efficient approximation method for calculating the p-values of the test statistics is proposed. Some simulations are run to examine the performances of the proposed methods and the results are encouraging. The study not only makes it possible to test for spatial autocorrelation among the GWR residuals in a conventional statistical manner, but also provides a useful means for model validation. </jats:p>",

The lower mobility rates can be viewed as outcomes of a ‘tight’ housing market. It can be hypothesized that, because ethnic minorities (‘foreigners’ in German terminology) have lower incomes and face discrimination, they are likely to be more constrained than the native-born German population, and so have even lower mobility rates. The authors use data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and a series of logistic regression models to examine the interaction of nationality and residential mobility. They show that in fact the foreign-born population is slightly more mobile than the native German population, and that the constrained housing market does not appear to affect the foreign-born population differentially. At the same time, the greater mobility of the foreign-born population can be explained by their attempts to overcome higher rates of crowding. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper, an effcient neural network approach to real-time path planning with obstacle avoidance of holonomic car-like robots in a dynamic environment is proposed. The dynamics of each neuron in this biologically inspired, topologically organized neural network is characterized by a shunting equation or an additive equation. The state space of the neural network is the configuration space of the robot. There are only local lateral connections among neurons. Thus the computational complexity linearly depends on the neural network size. The real-time collision-free path is planned through the dynamic neural activity landscape of the neural network without explicitly searching over neither the free workspace nor the collision paths, without any prior knowledge of the dynamic environment, without any learning procedures, and without any local collision checking procedures at each step of the robot movement. Therefore it is computationally efficient. The stability of the neural network is proven by both qualitative analysis and the Lyapunov stability theory. The effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated through simulation studies.</jats:p>",
