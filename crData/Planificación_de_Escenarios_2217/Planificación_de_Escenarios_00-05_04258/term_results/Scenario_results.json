      "abstract": "<jats:p>The scenario method has been widely used by decision makers in business, industry and government for over 30 years as an unrivalled technique to learn about the future before it happens. This paper examines the principles, practice and pitfalls of scenario building with the prime aim of presenting the technique as one singularly relevant to the study of future property investment, development and management decisions and land use policy formulation. The origins of the approach from its military‐based beginnings, through the popularised global environmental applications to the current widescale use by industry and commerce are traced. Some definitions are advanced to demonstrate the multi‐various nature of the method, and different types of scenario identified to show their adaptability and agility. The general purpose of the technique as a learning mechanism for organizations is explored, and the step‐by‐step process of scenario building specifically analysed. Conclusions are drawn which record the success of scenario building in many fields other than property and predict the adoption of the scenario approach as the principal behavioural technique for determining corporate real estate strategy in the future.</jats:p>",

The format of scenarios is discussed and the potential for using the methodology creatively is explored. It is concluded that scenario methods are useful in developing such skills as time management, cognitive mapping, mediation, team management, and decision making under stress. A brief example of an emergency training scenario is presented and evaluated in terms of its teaching potential. Finally, scenarios are assessed in relation to other forms of modelling and simulation, such as table‐top games and field exercises, which are commonly used for training emergency managers.</jats:p>",

The origins of the anisotropic magnetotransport evidenced near Curie temperature and at T=30 K are shown to strongly differ. Quantitative magnetic simulations of the angular dependence of the magnetization at T=30 K were used to evaluate the anisotropy energy in low field. A rotation of the in-plane easy axis induced by high fields at T=30 K is attributed to the magnetostriction caused by the praseodymium ions. Furthermore, a model taking into account this plausible magnetostrictive effect is shown to qualitatively reproduce the observed low temperature transport anisotropy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To study the pattern of interaction between minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) abundance and the main fisheries in the Greater Barents Sea, a simulation experiment was carried out. The population model involves 4 species interconnected in a food web: cod (Gadus morhua), capelin (Mallotus villosus), herring (Clupea harengus) and minke whales. Minke whales are preying on cod, capelin andherring; cod are preying on (young) cod, capelin and herring; herring in the Barents Sea are preying on capelin; while capelin is a bottom prey in the model. The consumption function for minke whales is non-linear in available prey abundance, and is estimated from stomach content data and prey abundance data. The model is dynamic, with a time step of one month, and there are two areas: the BarentsSea and the Norwegian Sea. Minke whale abundances are kept on fixed levels, while recruitment in fish is stochastic.Cod and herring fisheries are managed by quotas targeting fixed fishing mortalities, while capelin is managed with a view to allow the cod to have enough food and leaving a sufficient spawning stock of capelin. The model is simulated over a period of 100 years for a number of fixed levels of minke whaleabundance, and simulated catches of cod, herring and capelin are recorded.The experiment showed interactions between whale abundance and fish catches to be mainly linear. For cod catches, both the direct effect of whales consuming cod, and the indirect effect due to whales competing with cod for food and otherwise altering the ecosystem, are linear and of equal importance. The net effect on the herring fishery is of the same magnitude as the net effect on the cod fishery, witheach extra whale reducing the catches of both species by some 5 tonnes. These conclusions are conditional on the model and its parameterisation.</jats:p>"

The model explicitly considers two objectives: (1) maximize the expected revenue from the sale of interruptible water while reliably maintaining firm water supply, and (2) maximize recreational benefits. Input data can be represented by a scenario tree, built empirically from a segment of the historical flow record. Thirty‐scenario instances of the model are solved using both a primal simplex method and Benders decomposition, and results show that the first‐stage (‘here and now’) decision of how much interruptible water to contract for the coming year is highly dependent on the initial (current) reservoir storage levels. Sensitivity analysis indicates that model results can be improved by using a scenario generation technique which better preserves the serial correlation of flows. Ultimately, it is hoped that use of the model will improve the LCRA's operational practices by helping to identify flexible policies that appropriately hedge against unfavorable inflow scenarios.</jats:p>",

The study attempts to assess the depth and breadth of IT usage in business. The parameters such as organizational (size, sale or profitability and type of business) and chief executives (educational level and computer literacy, ownership of PC and computer experience) are studied.
