      "abstract": "<jats:p> About two-thirds of spiral galaxies are classified as barred: only one-third is very strongly barred (SB) and the other is classified as \"intermediate\" SB galaxies, i.e. galaxies with a faint bar. Bars are quasi-stationary density waves originated by swing amplification mechanisms. We use smooth-particle-hydrodynamical simulations to give insights into the role triaxiality of the halo on triggering the bar instability and to investigate how tidal interactions act on the bar evolution. We argue that the triaxiality of the primordial halo and the weight of the halo have a fundamental role in monitoring the incidence of the bar instability in spiral galaxies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Angiotensin converting enzyme is a key component of the renin angiotensin system that plays an important role in cardiovascular regulation. It seems to modulate cardiovascular growth by virtue of its role in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and degradation of kinins. A deletion polymorphism localized in intron 16 of the human angiotensin converting enzyme gene, corresponding to a 287 bp long <jats:italic>Alu</jats:italic> repetitive sequence, was found to be associated with increased risk of myocardial infarction in various subgroups, including European, French and Japanese coronary patients. This angiotensin converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism was examined by the polymerase chain reaction in a cross-sectional study of 201 healthy Indian subjects and 150 patients (angiographically proven cases of coronary artery disease) whose serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels were concomitantly measured. The D/D, I/D and I/I genotypes were found in 20.66 %, 46.66 % and 32.66 % of the Indian coronary heart disease patients and in 23.38 %, 49.75% and 26.86 % of controls respectively. One of the reasons for not finding an association between the D allele and coronary artery disease in this study could be the ethnic heterogeneity and disease status heterogeneity among the patients and controls. However the phenotypic variance of serum angiotensin converting enzyme levels is strongly influenced by this polymorphism. In the Indian population, the angiotensin converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism is not associated with risk for coronary artery disease although it is associated with plasma angiotensin converting enzyme activity. Hence the angiotensin converting enzyme gene I/D polymorphism does not seem to be a useful marker for coronary artery disease in the Indian population.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> DRB1*1506, a new allele of DR2, differs from DRB1*1501 only at codon 50 in the second exon, where the nucleotide sequence has changed from GTG to GCG resulting in an amino acid substitution from valine to alanine in DRB1*1506. Since codon 50 was considered non‐polymorphic until the discovery of this new allele by sequence‐based typing, it became necessary to study what fraction of subjects thought to have DRB1*1501 actually had DRB1*1506. For this purpose, 116 DNA samples with DR2 coming from normal healthy individuals, leprosy patients and childhood tuberculosis patients were amplified using PCR and hybridized with <jats:sup>32</jats:sup>P‐labeled probes specific for DRB1*1501, DRB1*1502, DRB1*1503, DRB1*1506, DRB1*1601 and DRB1*1602. The oligonucleotide probe for DRB1*1506 was designed to span codons 47–52 based on the published nucleotide sequence. DRB5, DQA1 and DQBl‐specific amplifications and hybridizations were also carried out to study the diversity of DR2 haplotypes. It was found that 21 % of the samples identified previously as DRB1*1501 were actually DRB1*1506. DRB1*1506 was found to be associated with DQBl*0502 and DQB1*0601. Haplotypes of DRB1*1501, DRB1*1502, DRB1*1506 and DRB1*1602 showed a marked heterogeneity. Besides the rare haplotypes which have not yet been reported in any other populations, haplotypes characteristic of different ethnic groups, such as Croatians, South Chinese and Gypsies, were also found in the North Indians, suggesting the extent of racial admixture and migrations to and from India.</jats:p>",
