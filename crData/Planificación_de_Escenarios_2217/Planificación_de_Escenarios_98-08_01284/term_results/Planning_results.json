There is no universal way of defining the neighborhood as a unit, and selecting and defining target neighborhoods is a highly political and negotiable process. This article suggests a heuristic approach to defining neighborhoods that is guided by explicit programmatic aims, informed by a theoretical understanding of neighborhood and the elements it may include, and based on descriptive information on local context. </jats:p>",

Peripheral locations invariably figure as being of low accessibility and consequently as possible receptors for new investments, even though they may already have a very good provision of transport infrastructure. In this paper an accessibility indicator is formulated that neutralizes the effect of geographic location. To this end, the customary notion of distance (length, time, or costs) is substituted by another which expresses the ease of access in terms of network efficiency. This indicator can be useful to assist decisions to invest in transport networks, as it is more sensitive than the potential model to the transport infrastructure needs of each individual region. It has been tested by application to the current Spanish Infrastructure Master Plan. </jats:p>",

We believe that the first important step in this process is to define a simulation tool to plan and optimize the placement of containers in the terminal. The decision about where a container is to be placed in the terminal yard depends on many parameters: the present occupancy level of the container area (or cluster), the final destina tion of the containers, the best position to dock the ship, the container's size, the container's content and so on. The problem is difficult be cause of the competing nature of these param eters and because the containers arrive some weeks before the ship's actual arrival date. In this paper, we describe the use of genetic algo rithms (GAs) to perform two tasks: planning (or scheduling) the cluster creation and optimally locating the clusters in the yard. We discuss each GA in detail and present preliminary results. </jats:p>",

The main objective of the post-Mao population policy is to limit population growth rates and ultimately to stabilize population at zero growth. The main remedial measure for reaching these targets has been to lay down a fertility limit of one child per couple. Although, especially since 1984, this limit has been revised so that the rural majority of the Chinese population are permitted to give birth to two children per couple when the first child is a girl, the fertility limit in cities, and especially among state employees, has consistently been one child per couple.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers are now taking the problematic of corporeality seriously. ‘The body’ is becoming a preoccupation in the geographical literature, and is a central figure around which to base political demands, social analyses, and theoretical investigations. In this paper I describe some of the trajectories through which the body has been installed in academia and claim that this installation has necessitated the uptake of certain theoretical legacies and the disavowal or forgetting of others. In particular, I trace two related developments. First, I point to the sometimes haphazard agglomeration of disparate theoretical interventions that lie under the name of postmodernism and observe how this has led to the foregrounding of bodily tropes of fragmentation, fluidity, and ‘the cyborg‘. Second, I examine the treatment of the body as a conduit which enables political agency to be thought of in terms of transgression and resistance. I stage my argument by looking at how on the one hand Marxist and on the other queer theory have commonly conceived of the body, and propose that the legacies of materialist modes of analysis have much to offer current work focusing on how bodies are shaped by their encapsulation within the sphere of the social. I conclude by examining the presentation of corporeality that appears in the first volume of Marx's Capital. I do so to suggest that geographers working on questions of subjectivity could profit from thinking further about the relation between so-called ‘new’ and ‘fluid’ configurations of bodies, technologies, and subjectivities in the late 20th-century world, and the corporeal configurations of industrial capitalism lying behind and before them. </jats:p>",

In much of this literature it is presumed that the body is some kind of social construct at the same time as it is a locus and a measure of both the material and the social world we inhabit. The author situates this idea against the background of Marx's representations—too often by-passed in recent literature—in order to show how Marx's concept of variable capital contains a theory of body formation under capitalism at the same time as it lays the groundwork for understanding how political persons act as moral agents to try to change the conditions under which laboring occurs. The struggle for a living wage in Baltimore is then used as a concrete example of how this form of body politics operates under contemporary conditions, illustrating how the body that is to be the measure of all things is itself a site of political-economic contestation over the very forces that create it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A decision support system for management of an intermodal container terminal is presented. Among problems to be solved are the spatial allo cation of containers in the terminal yard, the allo cation of resources, and the scheduling of opera tions to maximise a performance function based on economic indicators. These problems are solved using techniques from optimisation, such as job-shop scheduling, genetic algorithms or mixed-integer linear programming. At the termi nal, the same problems are usually solved by the terminal manager, using only his experience. The manager can trust computer-generated solutions only by validating them by means of a simulation model of the terminal. Thus, the simulation tool also becomes a means to introduce new ap proaches into traditional settings. We focus on the resource allocation problem and describe our modules for optimisation of the allocation process and the simulation of the terminal. The former is based on integer linear programming; the latter is a discrete-event simulation tool based on the pro cess-oriented paradigm. The simulator provides a testbed for checking the validity and robustness of the policy computed by the optimisation module. </jats:p>",

This concept has been partially developed in the literature, and an attempt is made to specify this further by means of the illustration of gold. The message is that the ‘geographies of consumption’ literature is insufficient by itself but becomes stronger when joined with a materialist commodity-chain analysis. The author moves from a deconstruction of the images of men and women in gold advertisements, at the consumption end, to the various places of production, beginning with Italian gold jewelry factories, then South African gold mines and apartheid, and third Lesotho, where Basotho men migrate to South African gold mines leaving behind ‘gold widows‘. The material reality of these gold widows stands in contrast to the ‘gold windows' of Tiffany's and the images of women and men in advertisements for gold. The author opines that this sort of analysis necessitates a politics of consumption in which the two ends are reconnected; and that this could lead to a new ‘commercial geography‘. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The organisation of the British National Health Service (NHS) has been hierarchical and based on defined geographical areas [for example, health authorities (HAs)]. These areas have formed the basis of local health systems in which the social relations between individuals and agencies were contained within the territorial boundaries of the respective organisation and thereby engendered, in most eases, a degree of trust and cooperation. The introduction of quasi-market mechanisms in the NHS in 1991 inferred that the social relations between local actors were not essential and hence transactions could be independent of them. Economic transactions need not therefore be confined to the local area. However, social relations have continued in various forms since the quasi-market was implemented as manifested through, inter alia, the persistence of localism in the market. Localism is evident, for example, in HA expenditure, which remains highly skewed towards local providers and, it is argued here, is a function of social relations between purchaser and providers. Localism and the social relations associated with it exemplify the relational nature of the quasi-market, which has shown signs of moves towards longer term contracts, risk-sharing and cooperation (rather than competition). Thus, by noting the persistence of localism and social relations, the author suggests that the quasi-market has yet to evince the paradigm shift intended by the 1991 reforms. </jats:p>",

(1994, 1998, respectively). The multistage stochastic linear program incorporates Yasuda Kasai's asset and liability mix over a five-year horizon followed by an infinite horizon steady-state end-effects period. The objective is to maximize expected long-run profits less expected penalty costs from constraint violations over the infinite horizon. Scenarios are used to represent the uncertain parameter distributions. The constraints represent the institutional, cash flow, legal, tax, and other limitations on the asset and liability mix over time. </jats:p>",

A model for studying the changing age composition of neighborhoods is developed, and alternative scenarios characterized by the nature of in-movement and out-movement are examined to make statements about the age of householders in neighborhoods. We find that high rates of mobility may serve to bring about a relatively youthful equilibrium age structure quite rapidly, whereas low rates lead to a higher mean age and to damped harmonic fluctuations both in the mean age of householders and in the magnitude of the age heterogeneity of the neighborhood. In addition, we compare the evolutions of age structure in neighborhoods with age patterns of in-movement and out-movement that could typify areas of renters and areas of homeowners. </jats:p>",

In the first part of the paper I explore the technological shifts supporting blended ‘surveillant simulation’ and review how the emerging links between surveillance, simulation, and material geographies have been addressed in recent debates on society, space, and cultural change. In the second part I go on to explore four examples in detail where widespread electronic surveillance systems are providing the captured data and images to produce electronic simulations of the ‘real world’ in near ‘real time’—virtual banking, retailing and ‘reality’, crime control and electronic tagging, road transport telematics, and ‘smart’ utility systems. Attention is focused on how such simulations of the real world are then used to support new spatial practices based on the fine-grained allocation of goods and services, and intimate patterns of attempted social control, in real time, through the time–space fabric of material geographies. I conclude by analysing the implications of surveillant simulation for theories of technology, space, and place, for social polarisation in cities, and for considering opportunities for resisting the spatial practices of dominant organisations. </jats:p>",

She argues that these theories can complement each other in providing empirically grounded analyses at the urban level. By means of the rational choice approach, she considers the choice situation facing local and central government in dealing with urban air pollution. However, forestalling some central criticisms made of the rational choice approach, she also considers the way in which the problem of urban air quality is constructed and the rhetorical structure of the policy solutions that can be discussed. It is shown how the constrained-choice situation of key policy actors meshes with the construction of the problem as one of urban air-quality management and the preferred policy solution of enhanced monitoring. This is characterised as diversionary and symbolic policy action which devolves much policy responsibility to the level of the individual—a potentially contradictory strategy for government. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A key task of advertising media planners is to determine the best media schedule of advertising exposures for a certain budget. Conceptually, the planner could choose to do continuous advertising (i.e., schedule ad exposures evenly over all weeks) or follow a strategy of pulsing (i.e., advertise in some weeks of the year and not at other times). Previous theoretical analyses have shown that continuous advertising is optimal for nearly all situations. However, pulsing schedules are very common in practice. Either the practice of pulsing is inappropriate or extant models have not adequately conceptualized the effects of advertising spending over time. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper offers a model that shows pulsing strategies can generate greater total awareness than the continuous advertising when the effectiveness of advertisement (i.e., ad quality) varies over time. Specifically, ad quality declines because of advertising wearout during periods of continuous advertising and it restores, due to forgetting effects, during periods of no advertising. Such dynamics make it worth-while for advertisers to stop advertising when ad quality becomes very low and wait for ad quality to restore before starting the next “burst” again, as is common in practice. </jats:p><jats:p> Based on the extensive behavioral research on advertising repetition and advertising wearout, we extend the classical Nerlove and Arrow (1962) model by incorporating the notions of repetition wearout, copy wearout, and ad quality restoration. Repetition wearout is a result of excessive frequency because ad viewers perceive that there is nothing new to be gained from processing the ad, they withdraw their attention, or they become unmotivated to react to advertising information. Copy wearout refers to the decline in ad quality due to passage of time independent of the level of frequency. Ad quality restoration is the enhancement of ad quality during media hiatus as a consequence of viewers forgetting the details of the advertised messages, thus making ads appear “like new” when reintroduced later. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed model has the property that, when wearout effects are present, a strategy of pulsing is superior to continuous advertising even when the advertising response function is concave. This is illustrated by a numerical example that compares the total awareness generated by a single concentrated pulse of varying duration (blitz schedules) and continuous advertising (the even schedule). This property can be explained by the tension between the pressure to spend the fixed media budget quickly to avoid copy wearout and the opposing pressure to spread out the media spending over time to mitigate repetition wearout. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed model is empirically tested by using brand-level data from two advertising awareness tracking studies that also include the actual spending schedules. The first data set is for a major cereal brand, while the other is for a brand of milk chocolate. Such advertising tracking studies are now a common and popular means for evaluating advertising effectiveness in many markets (e.g., Millward Brown, MarketMind). </jats:p><jats:p> In the empirical tests, the model parameters are estimated by using the Kalman filter procedure, which is eminently suited for dynamic models because it attends to the intertemporal dependencies in awareness build-up and decay via the use of conditional densities. The estimated parameters are statistically significant, have the expected signs, and are meaningful from both theoretical and managerial viewpoints. The proposed model fits both the data sets rather well and better than several well-known advertising models, namely, the Vidale-Wolfe, Brandaid, Litmus, and Tracker models, but not decisively better than the Nerlove-Arrow model. However, unlike the Nerlove-Arrow model, the proposed model yields different total awareness for different strategies of spending the same fixed budget, thus allowing media planners to discriminate among several media schedules. </jats:p><jats:p> Given the empirical support for the model, the paper presents an implementable approach for utilizing it to evaluate large numbers of alternative media schedules and determine the best set of media schedules for consideration in media planning. This approach is based on an algorithm that combines a genetic algorithm with the Kalman filter procedure. The paper presents the results of applying this approach in the case studies of the cereal and milk chocolate brands. The form of the best advertising spending strategies in each case was a pulsing strategy, and there were many schedules that were an improvement over the media schedule actually used in each campaign. </jats:p>",

Results from empirical studies, however, have rendered only modest support for this view. The author examines the role of residential satisfaction and mobility intentions vis-à-vis structural variables in migration decisionmaking with the aid of data drawn from the 1985–1989 waves of the American Housing Survey. A conceptual model is derived which is based on behavioral theories developed in social psychology, namely the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior. Several previously ignored links among structural variables, mobility predispositions, and moving behavior are incorporated. Empirical analyses show that, although satisfaction and intentions are important predictors of mobility, most of the structural variables that are commonly known to be related to migration also have direct effects on subsequent moving behavior, independent of satisfaction and intentions. The theories of reasoned action and planned behavior provide a theoretical framework for a better understanding of the complex relationships between structural variables, residential satisfaction, mobility intentions, and behavior. </jats:p>",

They recognise explicitly that the user and investment markets in office property influence trends in development and that development activity in turn affects office use and investment. This theoretical premise suggests that an analysis of these separate components of the market can make a significant contribution to a fuller understanding of office market dynamics, including swings in development activity. In the European context, there is a lack of research on modelling the functional elements of the office market individually, although such modelling is more common in US studies. Furthermore, most quantitative empirical work lacks an examination of the investment market for property and its intertemporal effects on development activity. In this paper, the authors estimate econometric models for rents, capital values, and development activity in the national office market in Great Britain. The results establish the significant influence of demand-side economic forces in the user market and the importance of use and investment market signals in the determination of office building output. However, the findings also strongly suggest that the investment market needs to be explored in more detail in order to identify and document the nature of the forces which interact in this sector of the office market. </jats:p>",

Taxes on immovable property are dominant as are unconditional block grants in state budget transfers. Another characteristic is a clear geographical differentiation in most municipal revenue components. The importance of local government expenditure in relation to total government expenditure is one of the lowest in Europe. The reform in preparation will result in an increase in local government expenditure as a proportion of total public expenditure, the percentage being expected to double to 15%, representing an increase in the overall weight given to local taxes and a diversification of taxes.

To investigate such motor planning in a natural environment, we examined the kinematics of reaching movements made around a visual obstacle in three-dimensional space. Within each session, the start and end points of the movement were uniformly varied around the obstacle. However, the distribution of the near points, where the paths came closest to the obstacle, showed a strong anisotropy, clustering at the poles of a preferred axis through the center of the obstacle. The preferred axes for movements made with the left and right arms were mirror symmetric about the midsagittal plane, suggesting that the anisotropy stems from intrinsic properties of the arm rather than extrinsic visual factors. One account of these results is a sensitivity model of motor planning, in which the movement path is skewed so that when the hand passes closest to the obstacle, the arm is in a configuration that is least sensitive to perturbations that might cause collision. To test this idea, we measured the mobility ellipse of the arm. The mobility minor axis represents the direction in which the hand is most inertially stable to a force perturbation. In agreement with the sensitivity model, the mobility minor axis was not significantly different from the preferred near point axis. The results suggest that the sensitivity of the arm to perturbations, as determined by its inertial stability, is taken into account in the planning process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research undertaken in the Oaxacan (Mexican) indigenous community of Santa Cruz indicates that gender differences in technology acquisition derive in part from locally unique gendered patterns of labor participation. Previous studies have identified constraints on women's adoption of technology which stem from women's relative resource poverty and mode of insertion into the labor process. In the present comparative gender analysis labor-process theory is extended to argue that Santa Cruz men's engagement with communal labor (from which women are spatially and socially excluded) provides men with: (1) gender-specific sociocultural tools transferable to value-added-commodity production, and (2) a social space for discourse on labor-organization technology. Santa Cruz women's (socially constructed) involvement with household production, by contrast, isolates women, fragmenting the social space necessary for reworking labor-organization technologies. Women, however, contest men's advantages: the social organization of production which excludes women also empowers. Over the eight-year course of a men's cooperative production project, women creatively and successfully utilized their control over key steps in the household labor process to exact concessions collectively from men and to create a separate space for a women's production co-op. Nevertheless, women continued to confront workplace-organizational problems as a result of their village-structured experience. Initiatives designed to promote women's technology acquisition must not depend on the assumption of workplace-organizational tools in either men or women, but must identify and address gender disparities in workplace-organizational technology. </jats:p>",

Building upon this literature, in particular the writings of Lefebvre and Harvey, I investigate the implications of the contradiction between fixity and motion in the circulation of capital—between capital's necessary dependence on territory or place and its space-annihilating tendencies—for the production of spatial scale under capitalism. I elaborate the notion of a ‘scalar fix’ to theorize the multiscalar configurations of territorial organization within, upon, and through which each round of capital circulation is successively territorialized, deterritorialized, and reterritorialized. These multiscalar configurations of territorial organization position geographical scales within determinate, hierarchical patterns of interdependence and thereby constitute a relatively fixed and immobile geographical infrastructure for each round of capital circulation. Drawing upon Lefebvre's neglected work De l'État, I argue that the scalar structures both of cities and of territorial states have been molded ever more directly by the contradiction between fixity and motion in the circulation of capital since the late 19th century, when a ‘second nature’ of socially produced sociospatial configurations was consolidated on a world scale. On this basis a schematic historical geography of scalar fixes since the late 19th century is elaborated that highlights the key role of the territorial state at once as a form of territorialization for capital and as an institutional mediator of uneven geographical development on differential, overlapping spatial scales. From this perspective, the current round of globalization can be interpreted as a multidimensional process of re-scaling in which both cities and states are being reterritorialized in the conflictual search for ‘glocal’ scalar fixes. </jats:p>",

The analysis is set in the context of literature about the need to widen participation in the determination of Local Agenda 21 policies, and the drive for more inclusionary forms of communication in planning and politics. Workshop members discussed the results of surveys and in-depth discussion groups with local residents which had revealed considerable scepticism and mistrust of environmental communications and environmental expertise. Three themes are explored. First, there is consensus in attributing responsibility for public alienation and resistance to environmental communications to the content and styles of media reporting. Second, there are contrasting discursive constructions of the ‘public’, which reflect different political cultures—with the Nottingham workshop supporting a strategy to share power and knowledge more widely than hitherto, whereas the Eindhoven strategy proposed greater rigour, clarity, and authority from the local state. Third, responding to evidence of public resistance to calls for more sustainable practices, workshop participants in both cities focused on what institutions themselves can and should do to progress environmental goals. Workshop participants in both countries acknowledged the urgent need for public, private, and voluntary sector organisations to match their own practices to their environmental rhetoric. </jats:p>",

It is concluded that, despite the perverse incentives, recipients had not generally moved to take advantage of the scheme, had shopped around for accommodation, and were not paying a ‘housing benefit premium’. Although some recipients were paying over the odds for their accommodation this reflected their poor position in the housing market compared with nonrecipients rather than a deliberate attempt to take advantage of the scheme. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We used birds, butterflies, tiger beetles, mean annual precipitation, and spatial statistical models to investigate the applicability of using indicators of species richness for conservation planning on a continental scale. The models were applied to data collected on three grids of squares (each square 275 or 350 km on a side) covering North America, the Indian subcontinent, and Australia. We applied spatial statistical modeling techniques to determine the viability of using a single or multiple indicators to predict spatial patterns of species diversity of ecologically and phylogenetically unrelated taxa. Spatial models are optimal for these analyses because species data typically are not spatially independent, primarily owing to dispersion effects. Furthermore, spatial models can be used to predict species numbers in areas where no observed data are available. We found that the number of tiger beetle species is a useful indicator of the number of butterfly species in North America and of the number of bird species on the Indian subcontinent, but it is not so useful as an indicator of either the number of bird or butterfly species in Australia or of the number of bird species in North America. We also found that the number of butterfly species is a useful indicator of the number of bird species in North America and Australia and that mean annual precipitation is useful for predicting the number of butterfly species in Australia. Although the general model used on all three continental areas is the same, the relative importance of potential indicators in predicting spatial patterns of other taxa changes from continent to continent. We attribute this change largely to differential biogeographical and ecological history, which must be taken into account in the selection and testing of potential indicators.</jats:p><jats:p> Patrones Globales de Riqueza de Especies: Modelos Especiales para la Planificación de la Conservación Usando Datos de Bioindicadores y Precipitación </jats:p><jats:p>En este estudio utilizamos aves, mariposas, escarabajos tigre, la precipitación media anual y modelos estadísticos espaciales para investigar la utilidad de los indicadores biológicos de riqueza de especies para la planificación, a escala continental, de la conservación. Los modelos estadísticos se aplicaron a datos obtenidos en cuadrículas (cada cuadrado con 275 o 350 km de lado) que abarcaban Norte América, el Subcontinente de India y Australia. Los modelos estadísticos espaciales permiten determinar la viabilidad del uso de indicadores simples o múltiples para predecir patrones espaciales de riqueza de especies ecológica o filogenéticamente no relacionadas. Los modelos espaciales son óptimos para este tipo de análisis debido a que los datos de las especies no son independientes del espacio donde éstas se encuentran, debido básicamente al efecto de la dispersión. Estos modelos también son utilizados para predecir el número de especies en áreas donde no hay datos disponibles. Los resultados mostraron que el número de especies de escarabajos tigre es un indicador útil de la diversidad de mariposas en Norte América y de aves en el Subcontinente de India, pero no es tan útil como indicador de aves y mariposas en Australia ni de aves en Norte América. El número de especies de mariposas es un indicador útil de las aves en Norte América y Australia. La precipitación es útil para predecir las mariposas en Australia. Aunque el modelo general utilizado en las tres áreas continentales es el mismo, la importancia relativa de los indicadores potenciales para predecir patrones de distribución espacial de otros taxones varía según el continente. Este variación se atribuye principalmente a diferencias en la historia biogeográfica y ecológica. Estas diferencias deben ser consideradas cuando se prueban los indicadores potenciales.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Stimulated by the European integration process, the need for high-grade transport connections between the major European urban agglomerations is growing. Coinciding with the reurbanisation efforts of the major cities, the high-speed train (HST) is eminently suitable to fill that need, as it essentially connects urban centres, and is relatively environment-friendly. The authors set out to analyse how the HST can make an optimum contribution to the development of welfare in urban regions. The paper is based on an international comparative investigation in fourteen European cities: Amsterdam, Antwerp, Brno, Brussels, Cologne, Geneva, Liège, Lille, Lyons, Marseilles, Nantes, Rotterdam, Strasbourg, and Turin. Some criteria have been derived for the successful integration of the HST system in an urban area: accessibility, economic potential, the quality of the living environment, a balanced spatial distribution of activities, a balanced social distribution of effects, and organising capacity. HST integration should contribute to harmonious long-term urban development, and a balance should therefore be struck between, among other elements, internal accessibility and the quality of the living environment. There is no such thing as a standard solution for optimum HST integration in a city. Each individual city must take account of its own spatial-economic structure and the criteria identified to find out what solution will contribute most to a balanced development of urban welfare. A clear vision of and a well-considered strategy for HST integration remains essential, in order not to lose out on the profitable prospects of economic development opened to the urban region. </jats:p>",

At all levels of policymaking a major emphasis has been placed upon the local scale as the most appropriate for the delivery of such policies and initiatives, with a particular stress upon local authorities as the major delivery mechanism. Though it is often assumed that this integration is relatively unproblematic, this paper indicates that this is not the case. The paper draws upon research with urban local authorities in England and Wales, which reveals that there are varying interpretations of the environment within local authorities, reflecting environmental and economic development perspectives. In each case, however, these are effectively interpretations which tend towards the ‘weak’ end of a sustainability spectrum and it is suggested that such divergent interpretations of sustainability are hindering integrative activity and the potential for introducing ‘strong’ sustainability measures.</jats:p>",

The first, which we call the pick and link technique, repeatedly picks pieces from the given path, and tries to replace them by more feasible ones.

From this road map we retrieve a new, more feasible path. </jats:p><jats:p> In the intermediate levels, we plan paths for what we refer to as semiholonomic subsystems.

The author assesses the extent to which associations offer solutions to collective action problems. Business directories and other sources are then used in order to assess the role played by UK associations. All major business associations are examined: trade associations, professional associations, associations of the self-employed or sole traders, and Chambers of Commerce. This paper contributes the first assessment of the population of associations. The author concludes that, although there are strong contrasts between types of association, they are all strongly focused on one or a few services, and there is considerable fragmentation and range of size of associations which appear to relate to two overlapping submarkets (one for ‘collective’ goods, another for selective ‘services’). Associations appear to be quite stable over time, demonstrating a strong path-dependency. The author concludes that if government wants associations to play a larger role in economic development little more will be achieved by voluntary action alone. </jats:p>",

A newly emerging literature on EC public policy is beginning to address this imbalance, but it is largely focused on the development of policy outputs culminating in the adoption of policies by the Council of Ministers, rather than the long-term outcomes of policy at the national and subnational levels. This paper develops a multitheoretical framework and applies it to a case study of the implementation of the Directive on bathing water in the United Kingdom and France to reveal the sort of intriguing questions and puzzles which emerge in the ‘postdecisional’ phase of the EC policy process. The study draws comparisons between implementation in the two countries, showing that policy ‘making’ and retuning continued long after the formal point of adoption. As in national systems, policy implementation and the interpretation and evaluation of policy outcomes in the EC are just as much part of the political process as agenda setting and policy framing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban policies which include energy and environmental objectives are seen as potentially effective instruments in the quest for urban sustainability. Recent consensus is that the modern city region forms an important focal point for assessment and implementation of energy strategies, facilitating practical solutions to local problems as well as providing beneficial additions to national policies. Reducing the carbon intensity of economies both prevents environmental degradation and supports the regional economy in the medium to long term. The authors look at the construction of a CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> inventory for the Greater Manchester region, an urban conurbation set for economic growth after recent restructuring and diversification. The authors argue that, by providing an indication of the localised carbon flows specific to the region, it is possible to target problem areas, prioritise carbon-reduction strategies, and recommend policies that will case the transition to a more sustainable urban settlement. The increased focus on finding ‘local’ solutions to the reduction of carbon intensity has coincided with privatisation of much of the energy industry. The newly competitive energy market conflicts with the shift to local-scale evaluations and has resulted in energy details at the regional level becoming increasingly harder to obtain. The problems experienced in the construction of this inventory will be common to other cities in the United Kingdom and will have to be addressed if the ‘local’ approach is to be as effective as is hoped. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Methods are presented for planning individual catch-sampling, tagging, and field-sampling programs to estimate salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) harvest in recreational and commercial fisheries from several hatchery-produced and wild cohorts through recovery of coded-wire tags. We show how to determine sample sizes sufficiently large to detect harvest and link sample sizes to expenditures through linear and allometric cost functions to determine optimal tagging and catch-sampling rates. Sample sizes that will minimize bias and variance are charted for field-sampling programs designed to estimate the fraction of a cohort with tags. We describe sampling strategies that can be used to detect or to minimize bias in harvest estimates from tag loss, tag-induced mortality, tag-induced straying, and nonrandom sampling. Methods are demonstrated with data on cohorts of chinook (O. tshawytscha) and coho salmon (O. kisutch) from Alaska. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an instrument measuring adult educators' power and influence tactics in program planning practice. The study started with the formulation of a theoretical framework which links program planning behaviors and political contexts. Eight power and influence tactics were hypothesized to reflect different planning behaviors, and seven of them were found to represent distinctive underlying dimensions. A pilot study with 102 adult educators suggested that a reliable scale could be developed to measure these seven tactics. A validation study was conducted for the scale with a total number of 226 adult educators and trainers. Supporting validity evidence for a final version of the instrument was obtained from several sources, including construct validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and nomological validity. Moderate to high reliability estimates were obtained for the seven proposed dimensions of the construct for the instrument. Consequently, the instrument, Power and Influence Tactics Scale (POINTS), is recommended for use in research regarding practice in program planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A near time-optimal inspection-task-sequence planning for two co operative industrial robots is outlined. The objective of the task- sequence planning is not only to find a series of near time-optimal final configurations for two arms where the inspection operations are undertaken for segment motions, but also to find a near time-optimal task sequence of inspection points. </jats:p><jats:p> A time-efficient, continuous joint-acceleration profile is proposed for a class of general industrial robots, and simplified by suitably choosing the time intervals of the profile for each segment motion between any two points to be inspected. The optimization problem to find near time-optimal final configurations is solved using the non linear optimization method of sequential quadratic programming (SQP). The computation overhead arising with this approach is suc cessfully dealt with. The task-sequence planning is formulated as a variation of the travelling salesman problem, and simulated anneal ing is used to find a near time-optimal route. The near time-optimal task-sequence planning and time-efficient trajectory planning are effectively integrated with the related computational problems ad dressed and solved. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed method is applied to an environment containing two RTX SCARA-type industrial robots with six joints. Computations have been carried out for moving points in a route, as compared with the same fixed points in a route where only one arm moves. The conclusion is that it is much more efficient if two robot arms work in a cooperative mode. A speed increase by a factor of close to 3 has been achieved through effective use of joint capabilities in the cooperative system. Experiments have also been conducted on the RTX system, yielding satisfactory results that are consistent with those obtained by simulation. </jats:p>",

The trajectories of the mobile robot are described by uniform B-spline curves and these control points are optimized using the complex method. The complex method is very effective for this type of optimization of nonlinear problems because it does not require any computation of the gradient of performance index. B-spline curves have advantages for trajectory generation in that they guarantee the continuity of trajectories and the order of trajectories can be changed easily. Effectiveness is also confirmed by trajectory planning simulation of a two-dimensional mobile robot.</jats:p>",

This exploratory investigation examined travelers who requested on-line infor mation about a potential vacation destination using the Internet. Results of this investiga tion suggest that Internet \"users,\" when compared with \"nonusers,\" are more educated, have higher household incomes, use commercial lodging accommodations while travel ing, tend to travel by air, and spend more money on travel-related expenses on a per diem basis.
