The original plan was to develop the field with three platforms but further studies indicated that two platforms would reach all reserves utilizing higher angle wells. The production facilities include a manned central processing platform, Semangkok A, with gas re-injection facilities and an unmanned satellite platform, Semangkok B. Remote operation of the unmanned satellite platform is accomplished by a telemetry system operated from the central platform. Crude production is pumped to the onshore Trengganu Crude Oil Terminal (TCOT) via a pumping platform. Development planning had to consider the high CO2 content of Semangkok gas which required careful selection of materials in the facilities design.</jats:p>",

Commercial quantities of oil are found in two of the sandstone units in this field. These two primary reservoirs, E-6/16 and E-34/36 sandstones, are interpreted to be delta plain bar and channel deposits. Group E strata consist of sandstone, plain bar and channel deposits.

In this paper, we review some of the uses and limitations of integer programming-based approaches to network design, and describe several discrete and continuous choice models and algorithms. Our objectives are threefold—to provide a unifying view for synthesizing many network design models, to propose a unifying framework for deriving many network design algorithms, and to summarize computational experience in solving design problems. We also show that many of the most celebrated combinatorial problems that arise in transportation planning are specializations and variations of a generic design model. Consequently, the network design concepts described in this paper have great potential application in a wide range of problem settings. </jats:p>",

Two complementary studies (the authors' 1979 survey investigating the hospitalization policies of prepaid group practices, and AMPI's study of all HMO applications submitted to HSAs from 1975 through mid-1978) provide information about the extent of HMO applications to planning agencies, the rate of rejections, the burden of the planning process on HMOs, and the possibility that negative perceptions of regulation may have led HMOs to refrain from activities requiring planning approval. Both studies reveal that health planning review was detrimental to 20 to 30 percent of HMOs. Thus data collected during the period of extensive HSA regulation of HMOs seem to justify the current policy that gives HSAs only very limited authority over HMOs.</jats:p>",

He argued that it was important to analyse the operation of these markets and the extent to which they operate to reinforce social inequalities. In this paper, it is argued that, although the issues Thorns raises are important ones, his analysis and conclusions are marred by his treatment of regional differences and trends in the rate of house price inflation over time. By generalising from data over a single year, Thorns sought to show that there was a strong link between the gains received from the labour market and those from the domestic property market. </jats:p><jats:p> Although there is no evidence at the regional level to support Thorns's assertions regarding the growth of interregional differentials in average house prices over time (if anything the evidence shows the reverse), it is suggested that the regional scale may not be the most appropriate scale of analysis, and some evidence is presented which indicates the possibility of growing inner-city/suburban differentials. </jats:p><jats:p> Finally, it is argued that the concentration on owner occupiers may well obscure the equally, if not more important, changes which are occurring in the distribution of owner occupiers and council tenants.
