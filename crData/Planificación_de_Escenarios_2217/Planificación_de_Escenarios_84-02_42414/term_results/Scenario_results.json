      "abstract": "<jats:p>The very first issue of this journal struck an important and vibrant chord. It contained a series of “statements of concern” by a number of the members of the editorial board. Many, if not nearly all, of the statements expressed concern with the impacts and potential ill effects of technology on people. Among the concerns expressed were: (1) there was worry that the field of office automation was or would be dominated by technologists and vendors with a limited point of view to push; (2) there was worry that current designers are generally insensitive to broader human needs; (3) there was concern that current conceptions of office design and technology embody a naive and simplistic view of the user, and that they contribute to an inflexible and mechanistic concept of work; (4) considerable concern was also expressed that current thinking contributes, whether unconsciously or not, to a further invasion of personal privacy; in general, current conceptions pose a threat to personal freedoms; and finally (5) concern was expressed that we need more systematic and sustained study of a topic that has heretofore just barely risen above the plane of consciousness, i.e., the psychoses of system design; for instance, what drives the designers of large scale computer systems to produce systems such that they are user unfriendly and even user threatening; and strangely enough, why do the users of such systems buy into the psychoses of their designers?</jats:p>",
