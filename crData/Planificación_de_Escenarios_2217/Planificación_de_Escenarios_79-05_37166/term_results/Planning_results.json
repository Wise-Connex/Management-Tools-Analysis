Throughout the planning process there are, and have to be, many judgments that go beyond what might be termed “rational,” in the stricter, relatively value‐neutral sense of this word. More than lip‐service should be paid, then, to the maxim that planning is an art as well as a science. An acute need persists for creative imagination.</jats:p>",

A step-by-step planning procedure which includes all interactions among facility levels is applied. First, by means of an iterative algorithm, the sizes and locations are obtained for each chosen number of facilities. Next the optimal system is determined by evaluating alternative systems according to their effectiveness, in terms of cost and utilization criteria. A numerical example is given to illustrate the computational procedure. </jats:p>",

While sipping brandy after dinner, the American asked the Israeli what he was going to do during the last 30 days. The Israeli said he planned to make his peace with God. The French scientist, asked the same question, said he was going to take all of his money out of the bank and throw a 30‐day party, enjoying wine, women and song. Then they asked the American what he was going to do. He replied that he was going to spend his time learning to live under water. This story illustrates two points about planning:</jats:p>",

Omitted elements, in fact, may imply that an optimal planning solution lies within the inferior region of a multiobjective analysis instead of along the noninferior frontier. The role of optimization methods should be re-thought in full recognition of these limitations and of the relevant planning process. They should be used to generate planning alternatives and to facilitate their evaluation and elaboration; they should also be used to provide insights and serve as catalysts for human creativity. As illustrated by recent examples, these roles may require the use of several models as well as new types of optimization formulations and modified algorithms and computer codes. </jats:p>",

By use of empirical evidence from an establishment survey conducted in the Northern Region of England it is argued that the role of independent (not externally owned) establishments in explaining variations in office employment has been underestimated. Further, by use of concepts derived from the organisational-science literature, a more complex explanation for variations in office employment is presented. </jats:p>",

To develop an overall structure for management planning and control is the purpose of this study.

Several conceptual and operational planning models are examined, and a structure similar to the consensus emerging from these is presented. Decisions and decision models are examined and integrated with the various levels of the management process and thus an overall framework is developed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a formal derivation of the condition identified by Schinnar (1978) in which the prediction of nonbasic employment in models of the Garin–Lowry type can be independent of the spatial distribution of basic employment. The distributional invariance which determines this result is also a feature of the series-expansion form of model, which is characterised by the Markov property. It is shown that, in the limit, the invariant distribution is equivalent to the steady state of a finite Markov chain, and convergence to this limit is then traced by use of the spectral decomposition of the distribution. This leads to a new interpretation of the model based on spatially dependent and independent components, and statistics are suggested which measure the degree of invariance in any application. Finally these ideas are given substance by recomputing Schinnar's (1978) example in terms of its spectral decomposition, and this leads to several suggestions for future research which are drawn together in the conclusion. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the rapid pace of urbanization the structure of cities in developing countries is subjected to the very strong pressures of rapidly increasing population, rising incomes, and shifting factor prices. The standard procedure to document shifts in the structure of cities has been the use of density gradients. There is a quasi-universal tendency towards decentralization and the flattening of population-density gradients in all cities of the world. The shifting of density gradients is of great empirical importance to policymakers and we need to know more on how various economic and demographic forces operate to yield decentralization. Using a unique set of structural estimates for the housing and residential-land markets in Korea, this paper shows how an estimable structural model can be used to explore the specific economic forces affecting the shape of density gradients of Korean cities. Crucial estimates of the elasticity of substitution for housing in various Korean cities are presented. The indirect estimates of the shifts in the density gradients derived from the structural model are compared with the trends yielded by directly estimated density gradients. The implications of the analysis for our understanding of density gradients are drawn. </jats:p>",

The complexities of the British urban system pose difficulties for any approach which prohibits overlapping areas, multinodal regions, and recognition of the differing travel patterns of social groups. No single, simple algorithm can cope consistently both with the major metropolitan regions and with the peripheral areas. To overcome these problems, the additional concepts of ‘self-containment’ and ‘metropolitan dominance’ are introduced into the consideration of journey-to-work patterns. These developments result in a regionalisation which takes the form of an urban hierarchy by creating a two-tier structure in the densely populated parts of the country, and free-standing daily urban systems elsewhere. </jats:p>",
