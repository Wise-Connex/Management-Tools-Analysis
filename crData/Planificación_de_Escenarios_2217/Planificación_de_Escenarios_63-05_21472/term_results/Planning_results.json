      "abstract": "<jats:p>A method of programme planning, partly similar to the techniques developed by Johnson and Giaever, is used to calculate a near optimum (production) plan for a mixed farm of 12 hectares. The techniques and principles of gross margin analysis and mathematical elements of linear programming are used, and the results are compared with an optimum plan, derived by means of linear programming. This method does not provide an exact picture of enterprise relationships such as can be obtained by linear programming, but is shows which enterprises are blocking the plan and where adjustments can be made. Differences in results between near optimum and optimum plans are so small, that the method may be considered to be accurate enough for use in empirical work. R.v.H.

This article concerns itself with the problem of forecasting weapon markets. The needs for such forecasts are discussed and it is shown that mere reliance on official military plans, programs, statements, and “requirements” is a poor guide for long-range planning in the defense industry. It is further shown how system research studies can improve the forecasts sought. The proper conduct of such long-range-planning-oriented studies is outlined in some detail. </jats:p><jats:p> Management Technology, ISSN 0542-4917, was published as a separate journal from 1960 to 1964.
