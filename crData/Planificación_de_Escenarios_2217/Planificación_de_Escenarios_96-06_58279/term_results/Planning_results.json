EHS laws and regulations can differ from one country to another in several ways. For example, laws can be different, they can be at separate levels of development, and they can be implemented in different ways and under variable timetables Some other factors affecting exploration and production companies include the need to satisfy other entities. Other entities may include international agencies, lending institutions and activists in the exploration and production company's home countries.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Companies operating in areas new to them need information on the laws and what they require, regulations and the system for implementing them, timing for obtaining permits and approvals, the level and availability of infra-structure, and the impact of social issues on their projects. These needs will be discussed and contrasted using examples from Russia, Venezuela and the United States. Failure to understand the specific EHS requirements can result in equipment and manpower standing by to proceed, and long waits before permits can be obtained to proceed.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>EHS compliance needs in foreign countries can generate problems for exploration and production companies in scheduling, planning and costing projects This paper discusses these problems and provides insight into obtaining information that will help ensure EHS compliance and satisfy all concerns as well as giving the exploration and production companies the tools to conduct their business efficiently.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Oil and gas companies need information on environmental issues to enable them to develop realistic costs and timing estimates on which to base decisions in their bidding processes and future operations. Issues of concern (such as obtaining a permit) can be an immediate, an ongoing, or a long term issue which can be influenced by the government, the public, lending agencies, and social issues. For example, in the environmental area an environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an immediate issue that may be influenced by lending agency requirements and public perception. Abandonment costs however, are a long range factor that may be influenced by government policies that could change over the life of the project.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Multi-disciplinary teams that include environmental and safety representation have become commonplace. However, the emphasis is usually on simply complying with the rules and regulations, instead of using compliance to the company's benefit. Formulating a successful bid on new properties requires certain essential information. The primary factors that need to be addressed are the laws and regulations of the country, the permit structure, and the established infrastructure. Project planning goes further than just requiring information on the laws and environmental regulations. It also needs information on the complexity and timing of the permitting process, as well as the supporting data required. In addition, the operator should try and anticipate any future changes in the regulations and requirements in order to determine long-term risk. With the answers to these questions the operator can determine the level of training needed, the cost, and the appropriate timing.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>External standards can often also play a major role, in regulatory compliance. In many instances, companies contract with international lending organizations. Most of these organizations have EHS standards that must be followed.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 371</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Compares the practices in three companies which were successfully turned around with a company in which turnaround attempts did not come to fruition. Finds that successful turnaround managers go through an elaborate process, “destiny development”, to establish the foundations of a turnaround plan. The turnaround plan relies heavily on sound and innovatively generated information. Explores the destiny development concept for theoretical and practical purposes.</jats:p>",

Data were collected via a mailed questionnaire from 150 randomly selected teachers. Agriculture teachers who taught in multiple teacher departments, subscribed to The Agricultural Education Magazine, and counted their students SAEPs as part of their grade in agricultural education classes had more positive perceptions regarding planning activities. Agriculture teachers who were not enrolled in agricultural education courses while high school students, counted their students SAEPs as part of their grade in agricultural education classes, and had a class period during the school day for SAEP supervision had more positive perceptions regarding supervision strategies. Recommendations include encouraging local school systems to consider having multiple teacher agricultural education departments, conducting research to determine if there are benefits of counting students' SAEPs as part of their grade in agricultural education, and determining of there are benefits of providing teachers with a period for SAEP supervision during the school day.</jats:p>"

Because maintenance budgets are limited by economic constraints, operators must decide on how to best allocate the available maintenance resources. Optimal resource allocation involves the identification of high risk segments, and the determination of integrity maintenance activities for those segments that will lead to the highest reduction in overall operating risk.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To identify high risk segments it is necessary to quantify the probability of line failure and to evaluate the consequences associated with different types of failure. To identify optimal maintenance activities for high risk segments it is also necessary to quantify the reductions in failure probabilities associated with various candidate integrity maintenance activities. Under the sponsorship of a number of pipeline companies and Government Agencies, C-FER has initiated a Joint Industry Program (JIP), to develop quantitative risk-based models and software tools for estimating the current level of operating risk and the risk reduction potential associated with distinct segments of pipe within a pipeline system.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The key steps in the methodology are system prioritization and maintenance optimization. At the prioritization stage, segment-specific attributes are processed to provide an estimate of the failure rate for individual segments, and an estimate of the potential consequences of line failure. The failure rates are then combined with the loss potential into a measure of risk, and used to rank segments according to the calculated level of operating risk. At the maintenance optimization stage, a formal decision analysis approach is employed to identify the best maintenance strategy for high risk segments based on a comparison of the costs and risk reductions associated with each available option.</jats:p>",

Therefore, it is recommended to carry out seismic and geotechnical microzonations to assess the vulnerability of existing structures, and optimize the earthquake resistant design of new ones. This information together with the facility inherent data are used in a Geographical Information System (GIS) to allow for better managing of the seismic hazard and its associated human, environmental, and economic risks.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Venezuela is a region of moderate to high seismicity (Fig. 1), where several destructive earthquakes have occurred in the last 500 years. Probabilistic seismic hazard assessments revealed expected horizontal peak ground accelerations of more than 0.25 g3 in western and over 0.35 g4 in eastern Venezuela for the 500 year return period earthquake (Fig. 2). Because the majority of Venezuela's oil facilities are in areas of moderate to high seismic risk, it is recommended to carry out seismic and geotechnical microzonation studies in order to evaluate the seismic vulnerability of existing installations, lay down mitigation measures, and optimize the seismic design of new structures.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The potential of a Geographical Information System (GIS) and the technological advances of the computer science (e.g. in data base management) permit the processing of large data sets, their fast graphical analysis and appropriate presentation in two or three dimensions (2D or 3D, respectively).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The proposal of the application of GIS technology will be exemplified by means of an oil refinery. Because GIS is a complex tool, a three-stage installation of the system has been developed in order to guarantee its operation from the beginning on. Each new level includes a larger data base which permits more complex queries, so that it can address problems from basic engineering design (BED) to on-line emergency response. (1) At the first \"static\" level, all the results of the microzonation will be loaded in data base of the GIS, e.g. soil profiles, dynamic soil response, and design spectra. Thereafter, it is possible to obtain different maps, as needed for projects like BED, retrofitting, and land use. (2) The second \"interactive\" level would add information on dynamic interaction of soil-structure and associated risks like possible number of affected persons, economic losses, and environmental impact in case of an emergency. At this stage, the proposed method gives interactively graphics, depending on given seismic hazard scenarios, in order to define areas with different characteristic risks and to calculate potential damages to structures. Therefore, the system will support decisions about mitigation measures as well as improvements on emergency plans. (3) At the third \"dynamic\" level, the GIS will have a module which processes on-line information about meteorological and seismological data, as well as transient operation and production data. Thus in the case of a strong earthquake, the GIS can display in real time maps of probable damages, fires, and numbers of affected persons. In summary, GIS will help in the decision making process before, during, and after an earthquake, and will help to mitigate its negative social-economic impacts.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:sec>\n                        <jats:title>Geographic Information System (GIS)</jats:title>\n                        <jats:p>The GIS is a computer technology which permits the solutions of complex planning and management problems by means of spacial autocorrelations, functions and processes to calculate, manipulate, process, analyse, change, and present spacial data in a graphic form.

Social scientists, geographers, architects, urban planners, and designers use the term space in their academic and professional involvement with the city. But when they meet each other their discourse seems to be handicapped partly because of a difference in their usage and understanding of the concept of space. I will argue that to arrive at a common platform in which a meaningful communication can become possible, we need to confront such fragmentation by moving towards a more unified concept of space. I will argue for a concept of space which would refer to our objective, physical space with its social and psychological dimensions, a dynamic conception which accommodates at the same time constant change and embeddedness, and that can only be understood in monitoring the way space is being made and remade, at the intersection of the development processes and everyday life. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Street names are ostensibly visible, quintessentially mundane, and seemingly obvious. This might be the reason why social scientists have hardly addressed the issue of street names in their studies of the structures of authority and the legitimation of power. In this paper the author explores the semiotic and political operation of commemorative street names. He sheds light on the procedures of the naming and the renaming of streets and the utilization of street names for commemorative purposes as a fundamental feature of modern political culture. Further, he elaborates on how street names, in addition to their fundamental role in the spatial organization and semiotic construction of the city, are also participants in the cultural production of shared past. In addition, the author uncovers commemorative street names as a powerful mechanism for the legitimation of the sociopolitical order. Commemorative street names provide for the intersection of hegemonic ideological structures with the spatial practices of everyday life. Therefore they are instrumental in rendering natural the official version of history which they incorporate into the urban setting. The author concludes that the power of (commemorative) street names stems from their ability to implicate the national narrative of the past, though in a fragmented manner, in numerous narratives of the city. </jats:p>",

I infer intrastate mobility by comparing the county of diagnosis on an individual's AIDS case report with that on the matched death certificate; this allows the measurement of migration within the state of Florida for 4393 people through October, 1989–46% of the total cases by that time. Out-migration rates in rural counties are very high, approximately 50%, whereas those in large metropolitan counties are less than 10%; however, these rates depend on race. The data show that migrants moved to places with concentrations of health-care facilities, and that there is a flow of migrants from rural to urban places, particularly to large metropolitan areas. The results suggest that the spatial distribution of people with AIDS changes in the period after diagnosis, becoming more concentrated in places where there are good health-care facilities. There is descriptive evidence to suggest that the orientation of flows changes with the deteriorating health status of migrants from a distinctly rural to urban axis to a more diffuse pattern, but the statistical test for this change is inconclusive. </jats:p>",

This structure involves strategic contractual relationships between companies and contractors. On Alaska's North Slope, BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. has formed alliances to engineer and develop its Badami and Northstar oil fields. These fields are small in comparison to Prudhoe Bay and Endicott and their economics cannot support high capital and operating costs. Costs, reserves, and permits are the three major building blocks of a successful oil development project. The alliance structure presents some special challenges and opportunities in successfully designing an environmentally sensitive project and obtaining permits. On the Badami project, permitting has required that alliance members, the regulators, and BPXA environmental personnel develop a mutual understanding and integration of engineering and environmental constraints and opportunities. Part of the communications challenge has resulted from the differing mandates and boundaries of the alliance and the external requirements of environmental laws and regulations. The lessons learned on Badami have been adopted in environmental planning and permitting the Northstar project.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Corporations, including oil and gas companies such as BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc. (BPXA), are increasingly forming strategic business relationships - called alliances - with other companies to accomplish specific projects. Such arrangements are used for a variety of reasons, but most particularly to address the competitive challenges of the business environment. Low world oil prices have challenged the oil industry economically. In Alaska, the problem is exacerbated by the high cost of transporting oil to market and the economic premiums of development in the harsh Arctic environment.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>On Alaska's North Slope, BPXA established an alliance with contractors in 1994 to develop the Badami oil field, which is located about 25 miles east of Prudhoe Bay (Fig. 1 and 2). In 1995, BPXA initiated another alliance to develop its Northstar oil field, located in the Beaufort Sea about 6 miles offshore of the Prudhoe Bay oil field. An array of major permits is needed for construction and operation of both projects thus requiring a significant environmental planning effort. Concurrently, project engineering and design, and reservoir access depletion planning needed to be integrated to ensure full project coordination. The alliance structure involves contractual, project management, and other business arrangements different from those typically involved in relationships between an oil company and its contractors. This structure presents a number of special opportunities, challenges, and problems to incorporation of environmental features in design and the successful acquisition of project permits.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>After a brief review of the Badami and Northstar alliances, this paper reviews these aspects of engineering and design and the lessons learned to date of these projects. The lessons learned on the Badami development are being applied to the Northstar project, which is currently in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) phase of environmental review and permitting.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>The Badami Development and Alliance Organization</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In 1993, BPXA purchased the majority interest in the Badami Unit from Conoco (Fina is BPXA's partner in Badami). Located 25 miles east of the existing Prudhoe Bay infrastructure, the Badami oil field is economically marginal by North Slope standards, in spite of recoverable oil reserves currently estimated at approximately 100 million barrels. The reservoir is located mainly offshore in Mikkelsen Bay, but most of the reservoir can be reached from onshore (Fig. 2). P. 815</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Simple rules of aggregation are provided for use when analysis of such groups is performed. The expectations of common statistics such as means, variances, regression and correlation coefficients, are not affected by aggregation. However, the variation of these statistics is affected, mainly as a result of changes in the number of groups. This variation is related solely to random fluctuations associated with the generation of variate values. Weighting by the group population sizes is shown to be important in the calculation of statistics. Generally, unweighted statistics have larger variation than the corresponding weighted version, and the variation depends not only on the number of groups but also on the distribution of group population sizes. Methods for conducting statistical analysis of aggregate data in this situation are described and statistical inferences based on unweighted statistics are shown to be invalid. </jats:p>",

As a prerequisite he outlines the nature of the property-development decisionmaking process. In the subsequent analysis of the funding-appraisal process of urban regeneration projects he considers a number of issues about the level of the developer's profit, land values, and the value of completed projects.

In both areas fish is the major source of dietary protein. The average hair mercury content was 38.6 ppm (1SD = 14.1) in Barreirinha, where the diet contains a high proportion of carnivorous fish, and 5.6 ppm (1SD = 3.1) in Iranduba, where the diet contains more herbivorous fish. The levels found in women's hair in Barreirinha are particularly critical in view of the evidence that peak maternal hair mercury levels above 70 ppm are associated with 30% of risk of neurological disorder in the offspring, and that 5% risk may be associated with a peak mercury level of 10–20 ppm in the maternal hair (WHO 1990).</jats:p><jats:p>The health of many people, and thus forest preservation, are threatened. An environmental monitoring and health programme is urgently needed for the Brazilian Amazon. Dietary assessment could be a useful indicator of the risk of mercury poisoning, if taken together with periodic analysis of mercury contents of commonly eaten fishes and of scalp hair, particularly that of young and pregnant women. Environmental monitoring is pointless if not directed at effective action; and a planning approach to this is suggested which includes a major educational component.</jats:p>",

Using data derived from the 1986 Canadian census, I will study the effects of expected wage differentials in determining the return or onward migration decision of nonnative adults aged 20 to 64 years. Evidence was found that return migrations were in the ‘right’ direction, as they are observed to respond to provincial economic variables (that is, average employment growth and income levels) in a rational manner. After accounting for self-selectivity, I found that results indicate that return migrants (individuals migrating back to their province of birth) are negatively selected, and experience lower income levels, following the return migration, than onward migrants would have, had they chosen the return migration option. This drop in expected wages decreases the propensity associated with making a return migration. Despite this drop in income, the large proportion selecting the return migration option suggests the importance of the province of birth in the mental map of nonnative migrants. </jats:p>",

An effective program addresses these areas: 1) food supplies, protection, storage, preparation, display and transportation, 2) food handler’s health, personal cleanliness, clothing and work practices, 3) equipment and utensil cleaning, sanitization and storage, 4) water supply, plumbing, and toilet facilities, 5) insect and rodent control, 6) construction and maintenance of physical food service facilities, and 7) work practice evaluations. Work practice evaluations are an essential component of an effective program since the prevention of enteric (diarrheal) diseases by their nature, involve behavioral change. Food sanitation programs are necessary for these projects because enteric diseases, especially diarrhea, are among the most severe health problems in the developing world where extensive oil and gas exploration now occurs. Intestinal parasites are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the areas, affecting over three billion people. A subset of this population includes those workers who are employed as food handlers and food service managers at remote work camps housing oil exploration and production workers in Latin and South America, Sub-Sahara Africa, and Asia- Pacific.1</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The incorporation of food sanitation standards in the request for proposals (RFP) process for camp facilities contractors clarifies up front the corporate expectations in this area. Standards are contractually specified and are easier to measure and manage. The implementation of an effective food sanitation program will create both short term improvements in camp operations (prevention of short term morbidity) and sustained improvements over the long term due to higher overall workforce productivity.</jats:p>",

Where writings exist, they are somewhat divorced from the recent theoretical and methodological questions which have rejuvenated social and cultural geography. In this paper one arena which geographers can develop in their analysis of popular music, namely, the exploration of local influences and global forces in the production of music, is focused upon. In analysing the music of Dick Lee, a Singaporean artiste, I illustrate how music is an expression of local/national influences. At the same time I discuss how Lee's music is also reflective of the power of globalising forces, illustrating the ways in which local resources intersect with global resources in a process of transculturation. Then I discuss the ways in which musical analysis offers a handle on larger political, economic, and sociocultural developments in Asia. Lee's search for a regional sound parallels the shift in many other spheres of Asian existence whereby a new cultural assertiveness has emerged, founded on the notion of Asian values and an ‘Asian Way’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors developed and tested 12 neural networks of different architectures to make lower-third-molar treatment-planning decisions, using a software-based neural network (Neudesk 1.2, Neural Computer Sciences, Southampton, UK). Network train ing was undertaken using clinical histories from 119 patients (with 238 lower third molars) referred for treatment planning (79 females and 40 males, mean age 25 years) together with output data consisting of actual treatments planned by a senior oral surgeon. Both the input clinical data and the consultant decisions were treated on a tooth-wise basis and were coded to numerical values. Binary data (e.g., present/ab sent) were coded to 1 and 0, while quantitative data (e.g., age) were scaled to fall between 0 and 1. A network based on the optimal architecture was trained and then interrogated with test data derived from a further 174 patients (119 females and 55 males, mean age 26 years) with 348 lower third molars. Network decisions were di chotomized with a threshold of 0.8. With no knowledge of the network decisions, the senior oral surgeon indicated his preferred treatments. The teeth were then assigned to \"gold-standard\" categories of indications present or absent based on National In stitutes of Health consensus criteria. Against this, the network achieved a sensitivity of 0.78, which was slightly inferior to that of the oral surgeon (0.88), although this difference was not significant, and a specificity of 0.98, compared with 0.99 for the oral surgeon (p = NS). Agreement between the oral surgeon and network decisions was very high (kappa = 0.850). This study demonstrates that it is possible to train a neural network to provide reliable decision support for lower-third-molar treatment planning.

This preliminary research was conducted to assess the range and structure of planning attitudes and equity and ethical considerations which might be relevant to the general public's evaluation of water allocation systems. The relationship of these to priorities for water allocation were also examined. The results showed a complex structure for planning attitudes. There were also generalized but clearly defined community approaches to water allocation. A number of significant relationships between planning attitudes and philosophies of allocation were shown. Planning attitudes also related to priorities for water allocation. In practical terms the research provides some preliminary, ethically based evaluative criteria which could be applied to allocation decision‐making systems.

These vehicles are distinct from traditional wheeled systems since they have the ability to actively adapt to variations in the terrain and they can actively influence the forces at the wheel-terrain contact locations. They also possess special mobility capabilities such as obstacle climbing and self-recovery from an over-turn failure. The problem of solving for the configuration of these vehicles on uneven terrain has been addressed in detail. The displacement analysis leads to multiple solutions due to the inherent nonlinearity in the position kinematic equations. Geometric reasoning has been used to identify the particular configuration that represents the “correct” vehicle geometry on the terrain. Applications of the displacement analysis algorithms to vehicle planning on uneven terrain have been discussed. An obstacle climbing maneuver of a three-module actively articulated wheeled vehicle has been described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the few areas of consensus in the research on Israeli politics is that of the political weakness of the Israeli business sector during the first two decades of statehood. The author claims that this consensus does not, however, justify the avoidance by scholars of the Israeli polity of conducting a systematic research into the factors that shaped the weakness of such an important sector, and therefore aims to suggest an explanation of the power of the Israeli businesses through an examination of the role and the behaviour of one of the leading interest groups in Israeli society—The Manufacturers' Association of Israel (MAI). The passive role played by the MAI in shaping the industrial-development policy during the period 1956–65 is analysed through: (a) analysis of the organisational resources of the MAI; and (b) examination of the MAI's role in two cases of public-policy making, namely the Textile Industry Development Plan and the Trade Liberalisation Program. The current political science literature regarding the factors that are often mentioned as shaping the power of business only partially explains the weakness of Israeli businesses. The author's main arguments are that nationalism can explain the weakness of the MAI better than can any other factor, and that the literature concerning the power of business should therefore pay more attention to the relationship between nationalism and the power of business. In the concluding part of the paper the findings are used as a basis for a discussion of the weakness of the Israeli civil society, and of the role played by nationalism in shaping this weakness. </jats:p>",

Specifically, fundamental issues arise concerning what assets should be apportioned, how assets should be valued, and whether division formulas prescribed by state statutes achieve their stated objective of dividing according to past contribution. In this paper these issues are addressed by means of simple present-value formulas, and it is demonstrated that most state statutes only rarely achieve their stated goals.

In this paper I focus on four of Pasolini's films, Mamma Roma, Theorem, Arabian Nights, and Saló, in order to explore the innate tension in his work between nature and culture emerging from his search for cultural authenticity and artistic autonomy. I show that his earlier concern with the superiority of rural life evolved into an emphasis on the body and sexuality as an ontologically privileged and prelinguistic source of meaning in his ‘cinema of poetics’. I suggest that Pasolini never successfully resolved the problematic place of the cinematic medium in relation to culture as a contested historical process of ideological signification. I conclude that the contradictions within Pasolini's work have implications for the contemporary critique of occularcentristn under Western modernity. </jats:p>",

For efficient use of manufacturing resources and increased flexibility, it is necessary to migrate to a distributed information processing system in which individual entities can work cooperatively towards overall system goals. The next generation of manufacturing systems requires such an information technology framework to integrate the system components and activities into a larger collaborative enterprise. This paper describes a multi-agent approach to concurrent design, manufacturability analysis, process planning, routing and scheduling. A heterogeneous multi-agent concurrent engineering system consisting of multiple feature-based design sub-systems, multiple simulated shop-floor resource groups, a supervisory control interface and the coordination mechanisms for multi-agent cooperation, has been developed. The architecture of this distributed system and the associated implementation issues are discussed. </jats:p>",

Hospital administrators are being pressured to improve the quality of services and to curb costs ‐ two primary themes within the field of operations management. This leads us to wonder to what extent operations are considered within the strategic planning process and what impact it may have. By surveying the literature, we identify a pattern in hospital management research, and identify articles which address the operations capabilities of quality, flexibility, delivery and cost control. These articles can serve as a springboard for research in hospital operations strategy, an area that is largely neglected in the literature. We also provide examples of how hospitals are addressing operations capabilities, and conclude with implications for hospital administrators and a research agenda for researchers.</jats:p>",

Four of the five scales demonstrated strong reliability, and confirmatory factor analyses fit a four-factor model to the data (goodness-of-fit [GFI] = .94). Validity analyses confirmed hypothesized expectations of differences in multiple role planning among groups varying in proximity to multiple role involvement and by compatibility of work—family plans. The ATMRP scales can be used to supplement research that examines how women negotiate the career-family interface. </jats:p>",

Basing our study on a comparative analysis of the locational, sectoral, and organizational characteristics and performance variation of industrial firms invested by overseas Chinese and other foreign capital, we posit that effective manipulation of state action holds a key to the economic success of foreign-invested firms in post-Mao China. The role of social networks in influencing the selection and outcomes of foreign investors' strategies, which is emphasized by some existing studies, should be assessed not only in terms of its importance to market transactions, but more importantly, in terms of its utility in gaining ad hoc redistributive advantages and minimizing or containing unfavorable treatments from the still potent yet increasingly porous and localized state apparatus. Disaggregate data from a national industrial firm data set and a survey on the investment activities of Hong Kong manufacturers in China are used to test hypotheses derived from case-study findings with respect to three existing perspectives on the subject. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is widely recognized that employers' hiring standards and spatial search radius are closely linked to their recruitment decisions. A strategy to identify the right people in the right place may save firms a substantial amount of effort and financial resources. Unfortunately, economic theory has often neglected this item when dealing with spatial search and recruitment issues. In this paper firms' recruitment strategies and channels of recruitment are addressed in relation to the spatial search radius for new employees. The spatial radius is linked to the employer's attempt to convey the vacancy-related information to a targeted group of potential applicants, with a focus on the distribution of the distance between the location of the firm and the place of residence of the hired applicant. In this framework, a new statistical model is developed in order to investigate the impact of different recruitment strategies—which differ with respect to both the spatial search radius and the type of information used—on the probability of a match between the vacant position and an applicant located at a given distance from the firm. The model is implemented and tested by means of an extensive micro data set on the recruitment behaviour of Dutch firms. It is found that job requirements with respect to educational level and required working experience are important elements in the recruitment procedure, as they significantly affect the spatial dimension of search. Moreover, the use of interactive information through informal communication channels seems to be effective for short-distance matches, thus suggesting the relevance of local contact networks. </jats:p>",

The emphasis throughout this paper will be on the design and analysis and hieiaichical implementation of our route planner. This work was motivated by anticipation of the need to search a grid of a trillion points for optimum routes. This cannot be done simply by scaling upward from the algorithms used to search a grid of 10,000 points. Algorithms sufficient for the small grid are totally inadequate for the large grid. Soon, the challenge will be to compute off-road routes more than 100 km long and with a one or two-meter grid. Previous efforts are reviewed and the data structures, decomposition methods and search algorithms are analyzed and limitations are discussed. A detailed discussion of a hieraichical implementation is provided and the experimental results are analyzed. </jats:p>",

We evaluated these surfaces in an effort to describe the main rainfall period (October to March) for Zimbabwe in terms of rainfall variability. Our results were then put into the context of an agroecological study which produced a Natural Regions map for Zimbabwe. GIS technology enables the synthesis and integration of many more data than was possible in a pre‐computer era and robust rainfall variability surfaces contribute towards improved agroecological and agroclimatological classifications for planning (natural resource management and agricultural) purposes. GIS technology also enables a shift in the design of such agroecological or agroclimatological studies: dynamic characterization can readily produce objective specific classifications, classifications which use the wealth of data readily accessible in a GIS to produce maps and databases reflecting specific boundary conditions.</jats:p>",

We begin by classifying costs as either “global cost” or “local cost” according to whether or not input prices are exchange‐rate sensitive. This classification is analogous to the familiar variable/fixed cost classification based on the cost sensitivity to volume change. Data for the U.S. and Japanese steel industries are used to illustrate the approach. We then combine the conventional Profit‐Volume analysis with the Profit‐Exchange‐Rate analysis to form a composite model, called Profit‐Volume‐Exchange‐Rate (P‐VER) analysis, where both volume and exchange rate vary. We show that this composite approach suggests the use of a single rate‐volume variable, similar to “person‐hours,” as the key planning‐control variable for international operations.</jats:p>",

The abortion rate ranged from 8/1000 to 14/1000. Childbirths decreased, particularly at the beginning of the study period, while abortions declined sharply towards the end of the period. In 1986‐88, the abortion ratio exceeded 100 in all provinces except two. In the 1990s, it dropped below 100 again except in the capital province.

We localise this discussion by examining the way in which the recent (since 1991) health reforms in New Zealand have incorporated this ideology and added impetus to earlier (unsuccessful) moves to bring corporate interests into the field of primary health care. We then test the contention that patients ‘shop around’ for doctors by examining the utilisation behaviour of patients at two recently developed private accident and medical clinics in Auckland, New Zealand. Our analysis of data from a sample of 205 patients suggests that, despite some price discounting by these clinics, patients appear to ‘shop around’ only modestly and largely use clinics because they are convenient and because of the perceived ambience of these new medical environments. We conclude that for those in more desperate financial circumstances, choices for health care continue to be made on the pragmatic basis of physical access. Although ‘doctor shopping’ may exist, health care reforms based on the assumption that this is widespread behaviour will do little to improve the access to, or quality of, care for those who need it most. </jats:p>",

Simultaneous planning and execution is the process of taking an implicit task description, planning a sequence of explicit execution commands (e.g. for robots) and monitoring their execution. As the execution planning process is run completely on-line, during the execution of the assembly task, the planning process is highly reactive, based on sensor information about the robot's present environment. In order to meet the problem that medical data are usually complex and need time-consuming preprocessing, an appropriate architecture for evaluating sensor data has been developed. In this paper, a detailed presentation of the phases of execution planning and sensor data evaluation is given. As an example, the execution of a LeFort I osteotomy is presented. </jats:p>",

Adult males who stutter, matched for age, gender, and educational level with a group of control speakers, were tested on naming words and symbols. In addition, their ability to encode and retrieve memory representations of combinations of a symbol and a word, was tested in a recognition task, using manual reaction times and sensitivity scores, as defined in signal detection theory, as performance measures. Group differences in muscle command preparation were assessed from electromyographic recordings of upper lip and lower lip. Results indicated no interaction between group and word size effects in choice reaction times or a group effect in the ability to recognize previously learned symbol-word combinations. However, they were significantly different in the timing of peak amplitudes in the integrated electromyographic signals of upper lip and lower lip (IEMG peak latency). Findings question the claim that people who stutter have problems in creating abstract motor plans for speech. In addition, it is argued that the group differences in IEMG peak latency that were found in the present study might be better understood in terms of motor control strategies than in terms of motor control deficits.</jats:p>",

Preferences and choice behaviour are assumed to be independent of context. The constraints that individuals face are not modeled explicitly in the residential choice literature. In this paper we aim to propose and demonstrate how discrete choice experiments and universal logit models may be used to estimate choice models that permit one to measure and test the effects of constraints on housing choice behaviour and residential preferences. In particular, we wish to test whether preferences of divorcees are invariant with differential access to housing-market segments. The empirical findings obtained in the present study of residential choices of divorcees generally support the idea that access to particular segments affects the preference for other segments differentially. Estimated attribute effects were in anticipated directions, although not all were significant. The choice model, including the effects representing access to particular housing-market segments, outperformed the multinomial logit model at conventional probability levels, and odds ratios were shown to change dramatically as a function of the constraints on residential choice behaviour. </jats:p>",
