Swedish first‐language speakers, fluent in English, were given simulated information‐seeking scenarios and presented with retrieval results in both languages. Twenty‐eight subjects in four groups were asked to rate the retrieved text documents by relevance. A two‐level work‐task scenario description framework was developed and applied to facilitate the study of context effects on the assessment process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Relevance assessment takes longer in a foreign language than in the user first language. The quality of assessments by comparison with pre‐assessed results is inferior to those made in the users' first language. Work‐task scenario descriptions had an effect on the assessment process, both by measured access time and by self‐report by subjects. However, effects on results by traditional relevance ranking were detectable. This may be an argument for extending the traditional IR experimental topical relevance measures to cater for context effects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>An extended two‐level work‐task scenario description framework was developed and applied. Contextual aspects had an effect on the relevance assessment process. English texts took longer to assess than Swedish and were assessed less well, especially for the most difficult queries. The IR research field needs to close this gap and to design information access systems with users' language competence in mind.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

It is proven that such an assumption can be made in fast ignition scenario conditions. The formalism is applied to the two-stream, the filamentation, and the two-stream∕filamentation instabilities, the latter instability being a mixture of the former two, and is the fastest growing one. The results are restricted to collisionless plasmas and nonrelativistic beam and plasma temperatures. Filamentation instability is reduced by the density gradient and eventually does not develop in the core, whereas two-stream and two-stream∕filamentation instabilities should saturate even before they feel the gradient. Various effects connected to the density gradient are discussed. It is found they should be negligible as long as these later instabilities remain in their respective linear regime.</jats:p>",

This powerful tool can be used by strategic planners to frame the future and is useful in guiding representatives of the public water supply community when planning for future uncertainty. This article presents five scenarios that were discussed at a 2002 AWWA Research Foundation workshop in which participants evaluated societal, business, and utility trends and used scenario planning to craft a water utility strategy for future success. A complete scenario regarding global warming is presented in the article, along with four condensed scenarios dealing with how utilities will assimilate developing technology, the effects of changes in the population on demands exerted on utilities, the development of creative partnering and regionalization, and water utility response to catastrophic events.</jats:p>",
