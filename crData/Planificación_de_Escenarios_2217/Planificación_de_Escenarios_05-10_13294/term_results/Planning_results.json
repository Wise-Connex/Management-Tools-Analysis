Currently, it is believed that marketing planners are out of step with new customer behaviours growing out of the changing consumer technological environment. Left Brain Marketing Planning emphasises the need, opportunity and the means by which planners can adopt more analytical procedures to improve marketing planning by greater use of data‐driven approaches that permit the selection and allocation of marketing resources based on an holistic picture of customers across all points in the buying process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A two stage approach adopted by Forrester Research. First, a marketing allocation tool was devised using Forrester's Consumer Technographics<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> data to understand how consumers interact with 13 media. These were used to index each medium against four marketer inputs: business goals, target audience, product type, and targeting approach. Second, interviews were conducted with marketers and agencies to understand current marketing planning processes and best practices and their response to the marketing allocation tool. Interviews were also held with marketing planning experts for additional perspectives around how they anticipate marketing planning will change over the next five years.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Principally, current marketing planning processes are based on traditional approaches that take too little account of the new realities brought about by technological change. The media selected in the marketing planning process do not reflect the media habits of today's consumers. New technology has changed customer behaviour and new technology holds the means by which this can be monitored and evaluated to assess the effectiveness of marketing plans as they are implemented. Changes need to be made, and the means are at hand to achieve such changes, that allow more analytical approaches to marketing planning in understanding what is happening in today's marketplaces and not just an emphasis on marketing metrics for the purpose of meeting internal financial imperatives.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>There is much debate about the dynamics in marketing planning between creative approaches and a greater emphasis on marketing metrics to ensure greater marketing accountability. This paper highlights the importance of analytical approaches that do not, of themselves, limit creativity. While encouraging the use of measurement and analytical tools, the paper emphasises the need to use these throughout the planning process and exploit the facilities enabled by new technology to assist in the process of better understanding consumers and communications and buying processes.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

One technique for measuring enclosure is the mathematical construct of an isovist. An isovist is the set of points visible from a location. This paper reports analyses of 15 521 environments, ranging from cabin configurations in space stations to site plans for cities. Although results have been reported for twenty-five variables, it appears that only a few would be sufficient to distinguish between isovists. The most plausible variables are horizontal size and concavity. Judged enclosure was most strongly related to horizontal size, but it was also correlated with the variation in distance from the observation point to the isovist boundary, with boundary predictability, and with concavity. Numerical estimates of effect sizes are reported to assist in the efficient planning of future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nearly half the world's population lives in urban centers, and these areas are increasingly important components of regional and global land cover. However, their ecological attributes are often overlooked, despite the presence of species, ecosystem services, and risks associated with the spread of pests or threatening processes such as fire. Movement and dispersal of organisms contribute to species persistence in urban landscapes; however, landscape patterns that promote ecological connectivity may also facilitate the spread of undesirable organisms or processes. I investigate how urban form can be used to predict ecological connectivity and assist in prioritizing urban landscapes for conservation activities and risk management. I examine the value of qualitative and quantitative descriptions of urban morphology as predictors of ecological connectivity by comparing sixty-six cities in the USA. Results show that qualitative categories are not adequate for describing ecological connectivity; multivariate descriptions are much better predictors, with urban area, number of urban patches, urban patch extent, level of aggregation, and perimeter area fractal dimension composing the significant synthetic variables. The dominance of area as a differentiating variable led to the development of a new urban connectivity index using a combination of urban area and state population size. This metric, based on readily available aspatial data, explains 78% of variation in ecological connectivity. These results provide a simple but novel tool for beginning to understand the role of urban morphology in promoting desirable environmental outcomes and managing environmental risks in urbanizing landscapes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper deals with the influence of the organization of an agent's ethnic identities on ethnic residential patterns by extending the Schelling model to include a further hierarchical level; that is, the agents' ethnic identities are organized in a two-level hierarchy (each agent belongs to an ethnic group and subgroup). Agent-based simulation reveals that the residential pattern created at given levels of ethnic residential distribution can also be a response to intolerance behaviour at another level. The simulation experiments also show that these patterns can qualitatively change in response to different intensities of intolerance at both and/or either level. However, as a result of the asymmetric nesting of agents' ethnic identities and the tangible residential patterns subsequently established, top-down and bottom-up influences are generally displayed in the following form; intolerance behaviour at the top level strengthens the segregation observed at the bottom level whereas intolerance behaviour at the bottom level tends to weaken the segregation observed at the top level. This means that intolerance-motivated segregation between a minority and a majority in a city tends to strengthen segregation between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority community. Conversely, mutual intolerance between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority tends to moderate residential segregation between that minority community and the majority population. I suggest that these conclusions can be used empirically to evaluate the consequences of individual preferences for the ethnic composition characterizing residential patterns. </jats:p>",

Challenges with consistency and aggregation persist in the integration of urban models between socioeconomic and environmental systems, and between the micro and macro scale. Using an econometric model as a foundation offers a flexible structure, with low data requirements, that might potentially be integrated with microlevel process models. Such an econometric model is developed and verified for the economy of the Toronto region. The economic model is integrated with a greenhouse gas emission model that simulates emissions from the residential, transportation, and solid waste sectors. Emissions are simulated to 2010 for optimistic and pessimistic exogenous economic climates. In the absence of technological change, emissions will increase in the order of 30%, largely as a result of population growth (22%–23%), which is relatively insensitive to economic growth. The potential to decrease emissions through changing land-use development and increased recycling of solid waste is examined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cellular automata (CA) are individual-based models in which states, time, and space are discrete. Spatiotemporal dynamics emerge from the simple and local interactions of the cells. When using CA in a geographic context, nontrivial questions have to be answered about the choice of spatial scale, namely cell size and neighbourhood configuration. However, the spatial scale decisions involved in the elaboration of geographic cellular automata (GCA) are often made arbitrarily or in relation to data availability. The objective of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of GCA to spatial scale. A stochastic GCA was built to model land-cover change in the Maskoutains region (Quebec, Canada). The transition rules were empirically derived from two Landsat-TM (30 m resolution) images taken in 1999 and 2002 that have been resampled to four resolutions (100, 200, 500, 1000 m). Six different neighbourhood configurations were considered (Moore, Von Neumann, and circular approximations of 2, 3, 4, and 5 cell radii). Simulations were performed for each of the thirty spatial scale scenarios. Results show that spatial scale has a considerable impact on simulation dynamics in terms of both land-cover area and spatial structure. The spatial scale domains present in the results reveal the nonlinear relationships that link the spatial scale components to the simulation results. </jats:p>",

In a previous study Nasar, using self report of behavior, found that segmentation (measured through the number of buildings) along the route affected choice of parking garage and path from the parking garage to a destination. We recreated that same environment in a three-dimensional virtual environment and conducted a test to see whether the same factors emerged under these more controlled conditions and to see whether spatial behavior in the virtual environment accurately reflected behavior in the real environment. The results confirmed similar patterns of response in the virtual and real environments. This supports the use of virtual reality as a tool for predicting behavior in the real world and confirms increases in segmentation as related to increases in perceived distance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the wayfinding criterion always to ‘proceed in the direction of the target’, which is the core of the least-angle strategy, is examined. Although human route-selection behavior is much more complex than this, results of empirical studies presented in the literature suggest that preference for most direct direction plays an important role in human route choice within street networks. The least-angle strategy can be applied once the navigator knows the direction of the destination, and is therefore an appropriate temporary heuristic for situations where the navigator lacks more detailed information about the environment. To assess the effectiveness of the least-angle strategy in urban environments, an agent simulation has been performed on the urban street networks of two cities for three different modes of transportation—pedestrian, bicycle, and car. The results of the simulation are analyzed. </jats:p>",

The model proposed here subdivides loyals in Dick and Basu's categorisation based on behaviour and attitudes. Four categories of loyalty are proposed: captive, contented, convenience‐seeker and committed. Each is described and discussed, and their management implications and research agendas identified. It is noted that any one individual is likely to exhibit the characteristics of each of these categories in relation to different products, services, outlets, and their associated brands.

The process is illustrated by optimizing well locations in an initial development planning context. The process involves planning a set of wells on a static reservoir model using an automated well planner. These locations are then optimized with dynamic flow simulation to achieve higher recovery or economic benefit. In this work, we present the framework for optimizing many well locations simultaneously, with reservoir simulation and economic analysis. This method is demonstrated byapplying it to a field-scale simulation model with water injection.</jats:p>",

Participants had to grasp a hexagonal knob using one of five possible grasping patterns as quicklly as possible following a starting cue (condition I), and sometimes, they had to rotate it subsequently either 60˚ or 120˚ clockwise or counterclockwise (condition II). In the first condition, the HCP participants appear to anticipate the comfort of the different grasping patterns before movement onset, as controls did. However, when the task consisted of more than one movement part, HCP participants did not complete their planning processes before movement onset, which was contrary to controls. Instead, the results suggest that they use a step-by-step planning strategy, that is, they planned the latter parts of a movement sequence as the movement unfolds. The results are discussed in the light of possible capacity limitations of an internal model for grip selection, and a recent model on the planning and on-line control of movement performance.</jats:p>",

The paper is based on a study on cows, farming technology, and farming science, and is empirically based on an anthropological fieldwork in modern, computerized cowsheds. By exploring differences in interactions between human beings and cows, on the one hand, and between human beings and computers, on the other, I argue that the partly common natural history of human beings and cows, and the lack of such a history in human–computer interactions, makes it impossible to be agnostic about where to find subjectivity in such a place as a cowshed. Animal bodies (including human beings) demand certain kinds of interactions, and thus produce certain distributions of subjectivities. The boundary of animality is not a purely ‘cultural’ distinction, and cannot be deconstructed as such. </jats:p>",

Changing the process domains later increases the product development cycle and the product development cost. Therefore, determining the most appropriate manufacturing processes at the beginning stages of the design process becomes critical. However, high-level process planning systems have traditionally lacked integration of design synthesis and design evaluation. The objective of this paper is to propose a CAD-based high-level process planning system that will help designers decide whether or not the designs are worth pursuing. A hybrid approach incorporating design by feature and feature recognition approaches is proposed and implemented. Synergizing both advantages of both approaches will reduce the complexity of feature recognition algorithm without sacrificing the flexibility in creating a part model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite recent progress in AI planning, many benchmarks remain challenging for current planners. In many domains, the performance of a planner can greatly be improved by discovering and exploiting information about the domain structure that is not explicitly encoded in the initial PDDL formulation. In this paper we present and compare two automated methods that learn relevant information from previous experience in a domain and use it to solve new problem instances. Our methods share a common four-step strategy. First, a domain is analyzed and structural information is extracted, then macro-operators are generated based on the previously discovered structure. A filtering and ranking procedure selects the most useful macro-operators. Finally, the selected macros are used to speed up future searches.  We have successfully used such an approach in the fourth international planning competition IPC-4. Our system, Macro-FF, extends Hoffmann's state-of-the-art planner FF 2.3 with support for two kinds of macro-operators, and with engineering enhancements. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our ideas on benchmarks from international planning competitions. Our results indicate a large reduction in search effort in those complex domains where structural information can be inferred.   </jats:p>"

By using the notion of qualculation, a neologism coined by Cochoy, we redefine the notion of calculation to include judgment. We then argue that making qualculability is not trivial: that it takes effort to create calculation and judgment. But it also takes effort to consider nonqualculability. Two strategies for achieving nonqualculability are identified, those of rarefaction and proliferation. Rarefaction, illustrated by the cases of Quaker worship and selfless love or agapè, works by withdrawing all qualculative resources. Conversely, proliferation, illustrated by the attribution of cause and responsibility after railway accidents, and by a major television fund-raiser, the ‘Téléthon’, works to impede calculation by an overload of qualculative resources. </jats:p>",

While research on customer satisfaction has emphasized the need to account for the non‐linear and asymmetric relationship between attribute performance and overall satisfaction, no effort has been made to disseminate these insights fully among practitioners. Since understanding the relationship between attribute performance and overall satisfaction is paramount if resource allocation to improve attribute performance is to be prioritized correctly, there is a pressing concern to move customer satisfaction programs closer to the theory predictions. A range of measurement procedures is reviewed and compared. Through this work, academics and practitioners may gain further insight into procedures for measuring customer satisfaction and an understanding of the relative benefits and limitations of the procedures that may be adopted.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The expedition was foremost among those dispatched around the same time in establishing basic knowledge of the continent. Followed by the second Scott expedition and those of Shackleton and Mawson, a cadre of able and enthusiastic scientists was established. </jats:p><jats:p> The second involvement of the Discovery in Antarctic exploration was planned without quarrels and with unusual understanding of science by a government department, resulting in a massive accumulation of knowledge about the Southern Ocean. United States expeditions began in 1928, introducing modern technology, thereby extending greatly the scope of Antarctic research. The Norwegian-British-Swedish expedition of 1949–1952 put planned science before geographical exploration. The International Geophysical Year of 1957–1958, supported by governments and planned by international committees, achieved great success. Science has flourished in Antarctica with unplanned and serendipitous findings emerging, for example, the structure of the magnetosphere, collection of meteorites by ice movements, the microbial life of the apparently sterile Dry Valleys and the discovery of the ozone “hole”. </jats:p>",

We based our simulation on the Via Point notion, which postulates that the reach motion planning is divided into successive positions of the arm. In order to determine these particular positions, some specific parameters have been extracted from an experimental protocol and constitute the pertinent parameters to be integrated into the model.

By the 1960s, however, family planning had come to be identified with disciplined, abstemious, bourgeois domesticity. This article explores some dimensions of this transformation. Rather than see this shift as the continuous expansion of ‘enlightened consciousness’, we turn to less-noticed transformations in notions about the functions of sexual activity, the family, etc., to highlight the calcification of modern patriarchy in a socio-cultural milieu in which bourgeois values were inching towards hegemony. The article also shows how the Family Planning Programme itself served to further modern patriarchy in Kerala. This is evidenced in the authority claimed by educated men in designing and overseeing the process of ‘women's liberation’. In thus highlighting the ambiguities of the ‘liberation’ of women via modernity in Kerala, I seek to challenge the historical linearity that is so firmly entrenched in the ‘Kerala Model’ of social change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore the relationship between the UK New Public Health Policy and one of its enactments. I outline a crucial policy document, Saving Lives (Department of Health, 1999, HMSO, London), and consider the practices that constitute a localised initiative called The Heart of the Shire. This initiative aims to train all members of a rural community in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation in order to prevent deaths from cardiac arrest. I argue that Saving Lives promises a new approach to public health that transgresses traditional boundaries and collapses conventional dualisms. Yet, at the same time it privileges biomedical interventions and conventional modes of care. I argue that the policy is full of incompatibilities but that these incompatibilities are not destructive. Rather, they create a series of tensions that, in turn, expose the fluidity of boundaries and work against the stability of categories and in doing so afford the promise of the policy. I go on to describe the key practices of The Heart of the Shire, focusing on how the tensions of the policy are played out in practice. It seems that the promise of the New Public Health Policy does not survive its practices. The practices are creative and varied and are deeply embedded within the community in ways that make them ‘new’, yet they also enact ‘old’ boundaries and conventional dualisms. They smooth out the incompatibilities that characterise the policy and thereby solidify boundaries and stabilise categories. Hence, my argument is that it is the making of consistencies that leads to the (re)construction of conventional categories and boundaries. I conclude by suggesting that Saving Lives offers us a glimpse of the conditions of possibility for a promising approach to public health but that the practices that constitute The Heart of the Shire suggest the tremendous amount of work that would be required to enact it. Drawing upon Helen Verran's insight about ‘hardening of the categories’ I suggest that the practices of The Heart of the Shire are lazy in their refusal of the vulnerability (and the promise) of tensions and that consequently the approach to public health that is enacted is characterised by stabilised categories and impermeable boundaries. </jats:p>",

Specifically, it investigates whether providing planning time and reducing the number of visual chunks in bar and line graphs help mitigate the influence of graph familiarity on language performance on graph description tasks. These research questions were explored using a structural equation modeling approach in a framework of the influence of the interaction between task characteristics and test-taker characteristics on task performance. It was found that graph familiarity affected the overall communicative quality of participants’ performance on these graph description tasks. Graph familiarity thus represented a potential source of construct-irrelevant variance. However, reducing the number of visual chunks in a graph and providing planning time positively impacted the perceptual and cognitive processes involved in graph comprehension and helped mitigate the influence of graph familiarity. Practical and theoretical implications of this study are discussed. </jats:p>",

Personal trust and reputation rather than price are examined as key mechanisms of foreign market entry and penetration. Empirical case studies in London, Frankfurt, and Madrid produce three findings. First, enduring client relations and client referrals facilitated most foreign firm entries and the majority of local client acquisition. Second, interview findings imply a critical assessment and reconceptualisation of trust and reputation. Empirically, goodwill trust and networked reputation are substantiated as particularly important transaction mechanisms. Third, a triangulation of interview and survey data reveals a causal relation between trust and reputation that enhanced a cumulative growth of social networks within the new host markets. This research points to the importance of social practice institutions for economic organisation and exchange across geographic distance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The long‐term benefits conveyed by intact ecosystems to human development can be considered as an innate “natural” capital investment. A number of UK environmental management agencies have commissioned a practical realization of this concept, partly as a basis for public participation, successively titled “Environmental Capital” and “Quality of Life Capital”. Hydrological concepts are particularly appropriate to an evaluation of natural goods and services; intact natural systems provide flood and pollution controls which need costly artificial replacement when lost or damaged. There are obvious opportunities, therefore, to incorporate assessments of environmental capital as part of the public participation in river basin planning demanded by the European Water Framework Directive. This contribution examines the effectiveness of “Quality of Life Capital” as an information pool and decision‐support mechanism in two catchment‐scale initiatives (sponsored by the European Union), aimed at community involvement in integrated land and water management. Firstly the conceptual and practical justifications for considering river basins as “multistakeholder platforms” are reviewed, followed by a comparison of the two trial applications in the north of England – to the headwater catchments of the rivers Wharfe and Coquet. What emerges from the comparison and from evaluations of other integrated river basin and coastal zone projects is the importance of information (and its management), continuity and facilitation by project management and a lasting system of monitoring to support adaptive management. The spatial scale of most river basin units defined under the Water Framework Directive is possibly the biggest barrier to widespread adoption of the approach.</jats:p>",

The analysis is based on a databank set up by CRENoS on regional patenting at the European Patent Office, spanning 1978–2001 and classified by ISIC sectors. The first step is an exploratory spatial data analysis of the dissemination of innovative activity in Europe. The goal of the rest of the paper is to analyse to what extent externalities that cross regional boundaries can explain the spatial association process detected in the distribution of innovative activity in the European regions. The framework given by the knowledge-production function together with the use of spatial econometrics techniques allow us to look for insights on the mechanics of knowledge interdependences across regions, which are shown to exist. Empirical results point to the relevance of internal regional factors (R&amp;D expenditure and agglomeration economies). Moreover, the production of knowledge appears also to be affected by spatial spillovers due to innovative activity (both patenting and R&amp;D) performed in other regions. Additional results show that spillovers are mostly constrained by national borders within less than 250 km, and that technological similarity between regions also matters. </jats:p>",

It examines the barriers placed on such parents and recommends strategies to enhance the partnerships between parents and school programs during the transition period. </jats:p>",

In both cases, its real novelty has been questioned. We focus on this last issue. In particular, we argue that many NEG ideas have been around for a long time in the works of economic geographers and location theorists. However, NEG has the fundamental merit of having framed those ideas within a general equilibrium model encompassing most of these ideas. This has drawn economic geography and location theory from the periphery to the center of mainstream economic theory. More importantly, it has made already existing ideas more amenable to empirical scrutiny and policy analysis. </jats:p>",

In both countries CI‐activities are usually not organized in a separate department and, if they are, CI is mostly done in the marketing and sales department. Managers from both countries consider similar types of information important, and they rely on similar sources of information. Although the responsibility for CI is more a top management issue in Flanders than it is in South Africa, South African companies have on average a longer tradition of organized CI‐activity and more full‐ and part‐time staff is involved in CI‐activity.

In this paper we do two things. First, we add to the sense that urban living spaces involve much more than human worlds and are often prime sites for human and nonhuman ecologies. Second, we experiment with what is involved in taking these nonhuman worlds and ecologies seriously and in producing a politics for urban wilds. In order to do this we learn how to sense urban wildlife. In learning new engagements we also learn new things and in particular come to see urban wilds as matters of controversy. For this reason we have borrowed and adapted Latour's language to talk of wild things. Wild things become more rather than less real as people learn to engage with them. At the same time, wild things are too disputed, sociable, and uncertain to become constant objects upon which a stable urban politics can be constructed. So a parliament of wild things might be rather different from the house of representatives that we commonly imagine. It may be closer to what Stengers (1997, Power and Invention University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis, MN) has characterised as cosmopolitics, a politics that is worked out without recourse to old binaries of nature and society. Using empirical work with urban wildlife-trust members we muddy the clean lines of representational politics, and start to grapple with issues that a reconvened wild politics might involve. </jats:p>",

As a result, a consumer may find an acceptable product in one retailer but nevertheless purchase nothing, opting to search other retailers for an even better product. We study several models of retail assortment planning, some of which explicitly account for consumer search and one that does not, which we call the “no-search” model. Even though the no-search model never includes an unprofitable variant in the assortment, in the presence of consumer search, it may indeed be optimal to include an unprofitable variant. Furthermore, we find that the no-search model can lead to an assortment with an expected total profit that is significantly less than optimal. In the extreme, the no-search model may recommend closing down a category (i.e., carry no variants) even if a profitable assortment exists (a 100% profit loss). We conclude that failing to incorporate consumer search into an assortment planning process may cause a retailer to underestimate the substantial value a broad assortment has in preventing consumer search. We discuss how the insights from our stylized models may apply to actual assortment planning processes. </jats:p>",

Yet this sudden socioeconomic and political change did not produce any immediate impact on institutional arrangements or policy instruments within the urban policy field. In this context, the implementation of the European Community Initiative URBAN, between 1994 and 1999, offered an opportunity to actors who were willing to challenge the existing balance of power to contest the legitimacy of preexisting interests and representations. The author argues that, in a context of competing interpretations of the issues raised by segregation processes which have left pockets of poverty in both parts of the city, the URBAN programme has managed to become an important driving force behind an underlying process of change. Its innovative approach to urban poverty and social exclusion exerted an impact on the parameters of this process of change, exacerbating existing political and organisational conflicts and challenging local networks, sources of legitimacy, and policy instruments. </jats:p>",

With the use of a SURE model and time-series data for eight European Union (EU) member states, we test directly for the validity of two competing hypotheses: the neoclassical (NC) convergence hypothesis originating in the work of Solow and the cumulative causation hypothesis stemming from Myrdal's theories. We also account for changes in the external environment, such as the role of European integration on the level of regional disparities. Our findings indicate that both short-term divergence and long-term convergence processes coexist. Regional disparities are reported to follow a procyclical pattern, as dynamic and developed regions grow faster in periods of expansion and slower in periods of recession. At the same time, significant spread effects are also in operation, partly offsetting the cumulative impact of growth on space. Similar results are obtained from the estimation of an intra-EU model of disparities at the national level, indicating that the forces in operation are independent of the level of aggregation. Our findings challenge the view of economic growth as the main driver for a reduction of regional disparities and contribute to the growing scientific evidence that points towards the need to rethink current EU-wide regional development policies. </jats:p>",

This, in turn, makes Yucca Mountain an interesting vantage point from which to (re)view the traditional ontological and epistemological preoccupations characteristic of social science, not so much in terms of abstract theory but rather in terms of concrete practical problems of spatial and temporal organisation. </jats:p>",

The key finding which emerges is that support is characterised by a number of fundamental weaknesses which risks perpetuating the myth that offenders are natural risk takers capable of turning small amounts of financial capital into thriving businesses, whilst consigning many to insecure, low-paid forms of employment. </jats:p>",

These financial ratios are tracked for 2 years for a group of companies that adopted ERP systems versus a group of companies that did not adopt ERP. Both univariate and multivariate statistics are used to test for differences. The key result of the present study is that the adoption of ERP systems leads to sustained operational efficiencies and improved overall liquidity.

Only economic geography and regional economics discuss firm-location behaviour at the subnational regional level, whereas international trade theory and traditional international business analysis focus only on firm locations at the level of a country. Where subnational regional locations have recently been discussed in international business analysis, this has been done primarily by incorporating the Porter ‘clusters' literature. However, by adopting a transactions-costs approach, we show that such a ‘clusters' concept is unable to distinguish between whether a multinational enterprise should or should not locate in a particular region. In addition, we use this approach to point to directions of research fruitful for reconciling these various different traditions of location analysis. </jats:p>",

In Experiment 1, children with hemiparesis collided more frequently, and controlled velocity less appropriately compared to typically-developing children. Children with LHD initiated their movement later than children with RHD. Experiment 2 compared the preferred and non-preferred hand of children with LHD and RHD. Children with RHD crossed less with their non-preferred hand, while children with LHD initiated later than children with RHD. Moreover, the groups showed differences in velocity control.

The boundaries of what counts as the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are always shifting. The regular appearance of new members, new patients, and new technologies means that much effort must be expended to hold the unit together as a functional entity. We examine how the baby (the neonate receiving care) acts the ‘object’ around which the unit is continuously ordered. The identity of the baby—what it is, what attributes are considered important, what effects it generates—is changeable. We present an argument, drawing variously on debates in the sociology of translation (that is, John Law, Bruno Latour, Kevin Hetherington and Nick Lee, Annamarie Mol, and Marilyn Strathern), the monism of Henri Bergson, and the ‘objectivity’ of Michel Serres, which identifies two ‘functionally blank’ actors in the NICU—a bilirubin machine and the baby itself. Both act to slow down and to stabilise networked relations. However, the ‘hybrid agency’ of the baby also acts as a resource that enables the network to turn back on itself or to be ‘cut’. We outline how this process appears to operate and the way in which it serves to resolve issues of accountability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many countries have undergone a broad retreat from the use of indirect (supply) subsidies to meet low-income housing-affordability problems, shifting to direct subsidies often linked to means-tested income-maintenance systems. Although the reasons for this change of direction are well documented, the efficacy of direct housing subsidies in terms of tackling affordability remains in question. The authors examine in detail one such system, Australia's Rent Assistance (RA) programme, making use of a microsimulation model of the Australian housing market linked to a model of the social security system. It is found that there is considerable targeting error because many low-income renters are ineligible for direct subsidies. It is also found that RA is relatively ineffective in overcoming affordability problems in high housing cost areas of Australia. Although RA does not of itself contribute much to poverty-trap problems, it may deter unemployed households from moving to areas where job vacancies exist. The authors conclude that future comparative work could usefully analyse the distributional and behavioural impacts of different forms of housing allowances. Moreover, alternative policies could be recalibrated within the microsimulation model in order to examine the first-round impacts of policy design change. </jats:p>",

In the first instance, flows of capital and the corrosive forces of global economic competition are assumed to drive institutional convergence. In the second instance, the stability of relationships and inherited institutions presupposes the necessity of path dependence. There is hardly ever dialogue between these camps except for mutual disregard and antagonism. In this paper we seek a rapprochement between these two world-views. In doing so, we focus on recent developments in continental Europe and particularly in Germany. In contrast with Anglo-American expectations, we argue that the German model is hardly a model at all; it has a distinctive economic geography apparent in capital market structure and performance. We also argue, moreover, that the past is not the future: there is evidence of the adoption of financial practices and institutions consistent with the Anglo-American model and inconsistent with the inherited German model. Our goals are twofold. We demonstrate the significance of economic geography for understanding German capital market structure and we seek to explain how path dependence may unravel and the forces driving institutional convergence can emerge within the context of the past. In this respect, our goals are both empirical and theoretical and have implications for conceptualising the status and significance of economic geography. </jats:p>",

Scrutinizing a set of input, throughput, and output indicators as well as information on cooperation characteristics, we try to evaluate (a) if the spatial pattern of more (intense) innovation activity in Europe when compared with Southeast Asia is still valid; and (b) if there are reasons to believe that R&amp;D units of multinational corporations in Europe are concerned mainly with the enhancement of the knowledge base and the development of future competitiveness by tapping into localized knowledge and using the particular host regions' innovation systems, whereas multinational corporations in Southeast Asia use R&amp;D to support existing production facilities in order to exploit an existing competitive advantage. We are able to show that there is still a major gap in innovation performance between Southeast Asia and Europe and that there are indeed indications that R&amp;D units in Europe are orientated more towards the augmentation of the company's knowledge base. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Decentralization reflects a global trend to increase the responsiveness of state and local governments to economic forces, but it raises the challenge of how to secure redistributive goals. Theoretically, as the equalizing impact of federal aid declines under devolution, we expect subnational state-level government policy to become more important, and geographic diversity in local governments' efforts to raise revenue to increase. In this paper we explore the impact of state fiscal centralization and intergovernmental aid on local revenue effort with the aid of Census of Governments data for county areas from 1987 for the Mid-Atlantic and East North Central region of the United States, with particular attention paid to rural counties. The 1987 period was chosen because it is the first year in which state policy trends diverged from federal decentralization trends and both state aid and state centralization increased while federal aid to localities continued to decline. Using a neural-network approach, we explore the spatially differentiated impact of state policy and find complementary responses in effort among some localities and substitution responses among others. Classification-tree analysis of this diversity suggests that decentralization and the competitive government it promotes are likely to exacerbate inequality among local governments. </jats:p>",

ECE countries have rapidly adopted ‘Western’-style place-marketing policies to attract FDI. However, little is known about place marketing under postsocialism, and particularly in the context of an enlarged European Union; hence the author presents an analysis of the supply-side policies which Hungary has developed in response to its rapidly changing position with regard to FDI. In particular, he examines the strategies developed by two key agencies responsible for attracting inward investment, the Ministry of Economy and Transport and the Hungarian Investment and Trade Development Agency. Hungary's current position in respect to patterns of attracting FDI is evaluated and, through outlining the key changes in the nature of FDI, a set of key issues which must be addressed in any place-marketing strategy in ECE is developed. The author then analyses how these two key agencies have responded to this new FDI context. The author assesses how Hungary has been able to address the new FDI context and also considers how FDI and attempts to attract it is reshaping supply-side policies, and postsocialist states themselves.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we document current research into new forms of public engagement presently taking place in UK biodiversity policy. This involves locating the main participants in such patterns of engagement; namely nature, amateur naturalists, and professional biologists and conservationists. Two interwoven and mutually interdependent perspectives or ‘imaginaries’—the ‘cartographic’ and the ‘ethnographic’—are presented in the paper to explore the shaping and interpretation of such new forms of engagement. However, in this context the interest lies in the ways in which either perspective is foregrounded or backgrounded by the different parties involved. The described shifts and movements of a range of actors and processes being studied demonstrate the fluidity and instability of networks of ‘knowing nature well’, whose stability is often assumed. The tracing of two constants— expertise and exchange—within networks inhabited by nature and by amateur and professional naturalists allows for an exploration of ways in which social/natural inclusions and exclusions occur in new participatory practices designed as part of biodiversity action planning. </jats:p>",

They examine the desirability of policy focusing on the promotion of key sectors. It is suggested that the tools used to identify, and then to justify, key sectors are generally underdeveloped. The authors provide a review of selected methods to identify and classify key growth sectors, and their strengths and weaknesses. Given the weaknesses inherent in these approaches, it is particularly important for policymakers to consider methods which can test and extend key-sector evaluation. The authors suggest that MSQA provides an effective and policy-relevant means of forming conclusions on sector potentials, and report on a pilot exercise undertaken in the Welsh economy. </jats:p>",

Single-subject ABCBC designs were used to demonstrate a functional relationship between student responding and function-based and non—function-based behavior intervention plans. Results indicated that the use of FBA-based intervention plans was associated with greater improvements in lowering the number of problem behaviors.

We formally link language acquisition of immigrants to the relative size of the immigrant stock, employing a microeconomic trading framework. Our model allows for spatial interaction going beyond the immigrant's area of residence, and explicitly incorporates spatial segregation. In addition, behavioral differences of immigrants with respect to their level of assimilation into the host country, as well as differences in networking within their own ethnic community, are accounted for. We test our model for four non-Western immigrant groups in the Netherlands at two different spatial scale levels. The empirical results reveal that there is only ambiguous support for the inverse relationship between size of the immigrant community and language acquisition or language proficiency in The Netherlands. We find instead that there is strong support for language acquisition and understanding being positively influenced by assimilation to the host country's culture. </jats:p>",

However, ongoing financial restraint, failure to include the full range of health services under the regional board mandate (including physician and pharmaceutical services), uncertainty regarding the level of authority the regional boards had for decision-making, and unclear accountability mechanisms between the regional boards and the provincial Ministry of Health limited the extent to which broader expectations related to development of a population health focus, and improved continuity of care for individuals and families was achieved. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> Implications for policy-makers were identified in four main areas: alignment between health policy goals and the governance structure; clarification of authority and accountability relationships; clarification of roles and responsibilities among all key actors; and strengthening of mechanisms that support accountability. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

The computer-aided fixture design technique is being rapidly developed to reduce the lead-time involved in manufacturing planning. An automated fixture configuration design system has been developed to select modular fixture components automatically and place them in position with satisfactory assembly relationships. In this paper, an automated fixture generation system for prismatic components is presented. Sequential steps for automatic fixture layout planning for machining setups, focusing on determining the most suitable locating and clamping positions in accordance with the 3-2-1 configuration, considering geometrical and dimensional constraints are presented. A software has been developed which takes two-dimensional-manufacturing drawings of the prismatic components as input and generates fixture design automatically. The modularity concept is incorporated in the developed software application and enables locating positions to be as wide apart as possible. The clamping positions are obtained directly opposite to the respective locators as far as possible. The software is tested successfully with numerous examples of prismatic parts involving similar design characteristics. </jats:p>",

In this formulation, the driving principle is based on controlling the position of the center of mass of the object, exploiting non-holonomic rolling constraint to propel the hemisphere. The principle is tested under simulation using two motion planning algorithms. The simulation results show the possibility of steering the loocmotion system to the desired configurations by moving the center of mass through multiple generalized figure eights on the main hemisphere plane.</jats:p>",
