Since the impact on the overall cost of production of designing a product for ease of assembly was realized, feedback from assembly planning to the design process has become important for improving the design. Traditionally, planning for assembly takes place after the design of the product has been completed. Often it proves necessary to modify a design, because some aspect is not particularly convenient or efficient under the available assembly facilities. However, considerable time and cost savings can be made by making assembly‚Äêplanning information available to design engineers, so that they can take account of assembly factors when designing a product.</jats:p>",

Its largest reservoir, the J-18/60 which contains about 47 percent of the field's total original oil-in-place, has a relatively thin oil column (19 to 36 meters) overlain by multiple large gas caps and underlain by an active aquifer system. The sandstone thickness and reservoir quality vary across the field. Three other major oil-bearing reservoirs also have thin oil columns and gas caps. The J-18/60 is being produced via a combination of gas cap expansion and waterdrive mechanisms. Optimum recovery will depend upon proper balancing of crude withdrawals and gas injection. The production strategy is also complicated by the fact that the aquifer underlying the major J-18/60 reservoir is common to other fields which have been on production for several years.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper discusses: 1) the reservoir development planning of Seligi, which involved the development of a very large computer simulation model to assist in addressing the numerous complex factors that influence oil recovery and hence development decisions, 2) evaluation of horizontal wells to optimize recovery from the thin oil column and experience in drilling the first horizontal well in the field, and 3) challenges in facilities planning for development of the field.</jats:p>",

A rapidly growing community of approximately 480,000 residents, located in the state of Virginia on the south‚Äêeastern seaboard of the United States, Virginia Beach is a major tourist centre and derives much of its income from the thousands of tourists who flock to her beaches in the summer. As a fast growing community, Virginia Beach is trying to plan for its future and recognizes that it must prepare for the economic, social and demographic changes that are rapidly occurring.</jats:p>",

In resource-oriented parallel planning, goal states are grouped into a collection of goal state subsets, each of which consists of those goal states associated with a particular resource. A subplan is generated for each goal state subset by planning the flow of the corresponding resource, and thus satisfying the constraints specified by each of the goal state subsets. A complete plan is then constructed by synthesizing individual subplans based on the synchronization among subplans. </jats:p><jats:p> A distinctive feature of RP<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> is that each subplanner generates a conflict-free subplan by controlling the flow of a particular resource while synthesizing a complete plan in cooperation with other subplanners.

Popular opinion is sharply divided about the value of this approach. In this paper, an examination is made of five ways in which property could contribute to urban economic regeneration: through the direct employment effects of construction-related activity; by accommodating the expansion of indigenous firms; by attracting inward investment; by revitalising run-down neighbourhoods; and by initiating area-wide economic restructuring. Appropriate property development can have positive economic effects but it has to be part of a more holistic approach that embodies concerns for people living in deprived areas and for the underlying condition of the local economy. Unrestrained market-led development may have detrimental consequences for the economic fabric of cities and for the quality of life of their residents. </jats:p>",

First, a general framework for transforming a model for a single community into a multiregion counterpart where the frequency of contact between susceptibles and infectives is some inverse function of distance is described. Different spatial interaction representations of the accessibility of the regional populations to one another are shown to induce variations in the temporal behaviour of the disease model which are conditional on whether the specification allows for a single infectivity rate or a set of regionally variable rates. The second of these specifications is shown to induce lead and lag times between the simulated regional disease-incidence and the average study-area cycle. In the central section of this paper, the relationship between these temporal effects and the accessibility of the region which is the source of the simulated epidemic is analysed. Last, the assumption of a static equilibrium is relaxed to allow for the combined effects of population distribution and regional accessibility on the consistency of the alternative specifications to be assessed. </jats:p>",

Key achievements include an innovative relief-well strategy, locating and tracking the target casing with electromagnetic ranging and conventional surveying techniques, and integrating kill pumping units and associated equipment on a semisubmersible. This was the first known instance of relief-well intersection and kill without a plugback and redrill after ranging. The techniques and equipment, plus good teamwork, provided the necessary ingredients to place a bit into a 215.9-mm open hole 5 km away and to regain well control successfully.

Saga was drilling from a semisubmersible in 68 m of water to evaluate the Jurassic hydrocarbon potential 300 m deeper. This exploratory well was the first drilled to such a depth in the prospect.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Drilling continued through the Cretaceous with 215.9-mm bits and water-based mud. A sharp transition occurred and formation pore pressure increased from an estimated 1.65- to 2.11-g/CM3 equivalent mud weight (EMW) near the reservoir top. Formation integrity at the casing shoe was 2.18-g/CM3 EMW. The hole penetrated several potentially weak formations above the objective, and while drilling near-balanced, narrow margins between influx and lost circulation were encountered.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>On Jan. 11, 1989, the crew observed a 1-m drilling break at 4733 m. The well began to flow immediately. The upper annular blowout preventer (BOP) was closed and attempts were made to establish circulation with the driller's method and to bullhead, but without success. After fighting simultaneous loss and influx for several days, the bottomhole assembly (BHA) was cemented at 4700 m, and a backoff and sidetrack planned. The drillstring, however, became plugged, requiring a coiled-tubing operation to remove the obstructions. Well control was lost on Jan. 20, malting it necessary to shear the 127-mm drillpipe with 4482 m of coiled tubing inside. Wellhead pressure increased to a maximum of 70.3 MPa.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An attempt was made to bullhead down the kill line but the flex hose burst at the slip joint. The well flowed for approximately 1 minute before being shut in by the fail-safe valves. The crew disconnected the riser and moved the rig off location (Fig. 1). The subsea stack was vertical. No hydrocarbons were discharging into the sea.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Saga, with cooperation from partners Statoil A/S, Amerada Hess Corp., and Elf Aquitaine, immediately formed an internal task force to manage the operations and to regain control. This task force studied project management, engineering, field supervision, rig mobilization, and blowout and relief-well specialists.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Choosing the Kill Method</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The flowing reservoir consists of fine- to coarse-grained sandstone with an estimated 100-md permeability. The fluid was light oil or gas condensate with a high GOR and a reservoir pressure estimated at 98 MPa. Bottomhole static temperature (BHST) was 167 degrees C.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>From data before the pipe was sheared, the team decided that the annulus around the BHA probably was sealed (by cement or settled barite) and that flow was passing through the bit and up the drillstring to the wellhead. The annulus contained 2.09-g/CM3 mud. The introduction of 70.3 MPa on the surface might have fractured the formation at the casing shoe. There was no significant wellhead pressure drop (during the 16 hours from shearing the pipe to leaving the location) that would indicate a casing rupture and underground blowout. However, because a similar blowout in 1984 held at 82.7 MPa for 6 days before rupturing its casings, a rupture was anticipated.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Operators facing a blowout must choose how many relief wells to start and how to use them (Table 1). Two simultaneous, redundant, intervention projects historically prove sufficient. The team decided that a single relief well, designed for a worst-case scenario, would act as a backup to surface intervention. The team designed two extra relief-well geometries.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Surface Intervention. The task force, assisted by Boots and Coots Inc., adopted a surface intervention plan. The operation would use the existing subsea BOP, combined with a custom-built stack and high-pressure riser system designed for a snubbing unit. This stack and riser maintained pressure integrity from the seabed to the jackup, Nedrill Trigon.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The surface team intended to latch on to the severed drillpipe with a custom-made packoff overshot and to fish out the coiled tubing.

These changes mandate that pharmacists become strategic thinkers, capable of designing and implementing plans that can integrate biotechnology products into their institutions' practices in a way that both enhances patient care and maintains or promotes financial stability. A strategic plan model incorporating the components of environmental scanning and strategy formulation, implementation, and analysis can be applied to the recombinant colony‚Äêstimulating factors.</jats:p>",

It is argued that the federal structure of the USA, the present political climate, and the mobility of capital combine to produce a situation of positive feedback leading to everincreasing subsidies. The situation constitutes a classic prisoner's dilemma. Decreased competition would be in the interests of all units of government. However, there is no way that a state or local government can opt out of the competition unilaterally and no mechanism by which collective action can be taken to reduce the intensity of competition. Also considered in this paper are the aggregate effects of local economic development programs in terms of taxes and public expenditures, efficiency, and equity, and several less commonly discussed considerations. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we develop a new trajectory planning method by proposing a traffic control schemes. The traffic controller determines the next positions for each robot based on the motion priority and path direction subject to the collision-avoidance conditions and the robots' physical limits. The problem of determining the next positions is formulated and optimized. Algebraic expressions for collision avoidance between every-pair of links ‚Äì one from the first robot and the other from the second robot ‚Äì are derived in<jats:italic>configuration space</jats:italic>. These algebraic expressions are then used to solve the problem of determining ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù (in the sense of path direction and motion priority) robots' trajectories. A solution procedure is developed using a nonlinear programming (NLP) solver. The main advantage of our approach is that the two robots' trajectories can be determined simultaneously without requiring any<jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic>path information. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

The rolling horizon framework includes a stationary scheduling model which uses the ‚Äútime fencing‚Äôconcept by partitioning the planning horizon into three sections. The lengths of these sections and the frequency at which the stationary problem is updated and resolved are discussed as parameters of the rolling horizon model. Two different interpretations of the freeze interval parameter are examined, enabling confirmation and clarification of results presented in an earlier study. Details are given for three methods of calculating safety stocks as a function of rolling horizon parameters, including a method which results in optimal safety stock levels. A comparison of the safety stock methods shows that the constant safety stock method can result in inventories that are significantly above optimal under certain conditions, whereas the constant service level method consistently yields nearly optimal results.</jats:p>",

The concern is to establish whether these changes are enabling a greater localisation or globalisation of intrafirm and interfirm relations and, associated with this, greater scope for local economic development. The paper begins with a critical survey of an influential paradigm in which it is sustained that the transfer from Fordism to post-Fordism implies a return to regional economies. It is then argued that contemporary restructuring in Europe is very much a matter of a global extension of old and new forms of industrial organisation‚Äîa process which does not augur well for self-sustaining development at the local level. This thesis is further sustained and elaborated through a consideration, in the second half of the paper, of the implications for less-favoured regions related to the transition to market forms of spatial governance at the level of the nation-state, and, at the level of the European Community, the policy reforms connected to the completion of the Single European Market. </jats:p>",

Tax sharing on VAT does not necessarily imply the harmonisation of tax rates, however. Other options for revenue equalisation schemes are the transfer of tax bases to the centre that exhibits implicit distributional effects. </jats:p><jats:p> It is argued that capital taxation is the Achilles heel of any future tax system given the fact that‚Äîin globalised capital markets‚Äîeffective marginal tax rates will more and more influence the international flow of capital, a phenomenon that forces governments into tax competition through market processes. A cash-flow corporation tax seems to be likely to become more and more prominent as an alternative to comprehensive capital income taxation. Applied at the Community level such a tax could serve as an implicit equalisation scheme that fosters developing regions by exempting new investment while taxing the proceeds from the more mature economic areas in the EC. It would also be neutral as to investment and financing decisions and it would attract savings funds from abroad to be invested in the Community. </jats:p><jats:p> As far as explicit equalisation is concerned, it is argued that differentials among regions are best dealt with by a system of matching grants that concentrate on aspects of allocation rather than by general-revenue redistribution. </jats:p><jats:p> Harmonisation of personal income taxation in Europe could also be achieved by introducing a piggyback tax onto the income tax system which taxes personal consumption at a flat rate. Shifting the centre of gravitation within these two-tiers of income‚Äìconsumption taxation would allow national governments to maintain their sovereignty as regards allocative and distributive policy. The consumption tax part could also form the nucleus of a future supranational direct tax. </jats:p>",

The ‚Äòtransfer‚Äô of value is imputed from the differential movement of house prices between 1970 and 1988 for geographical submarkets within the Adelaide Metropolitan Area. </jats:p><jats:p> Although the interpretation of the regression models is complicated, the evidence for a tilting of the ‚Äòvalue transfer‚Äô gradient from an inner-outer bias, to an outer‚Äîinner bias, can be statistically inferred from the processes of restructuring that have redirected capital flows within the built environment of Australian cities such as Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne in the course of the last two decades. Thus the uneven capital formation that characterises urban restructuring and is ultimately capitalised into real changes in house prices is a significant source of the added wealth that is accumulated from homeownership. By this means it is possible to bridge the two ‚Äòislands‚Äô of theory: Smith's account of urban restructuring and Saunders's concern with the sources of wealth accumulation within the housing market. </jats:p>",

At the same time the levels of segregation in residential neighborhoods has remained stable. A specific analysis of school attendance patterns in Amsterdam shows that the reason for the increasing segregation in schools is that there is a strong tendency to choose schools of the same ethnicity. The choices both by Dutch and by immigrant parents are serving to increase levels of separation but until there is evidence of educational inequality as a result we argue policy intervention should proceed with caution.

Risk factors for Ct infection were assessed in 6810 consecutive asymptomatic young women seeking contraceptive advice. All women filled in a questionnaire and were offered Ct testing. </jats:p><jats:p> Of the 5785 who consented to testing, 425 (7.3%) were Ct culture positive. Four variables were significantly related to increased risk of being infected: age 18‚Äì23 years, duration of present relationship &lt; 1 year, non-use of condoms, and a history of not having had a previous genital infection. </jats:p><jats:p> It is not possible to devise screening criteria that would effectively identify women at high risk. Therefore a screening programme should be targeted at all sexually active young people. However, if after some years the programme succeeds in lowering general Ct prevalence, these factors may be important when selecting patients for Ct testing. </jats:p>",

The system is tailored especially to planning of disposal sites in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania based on a decision support system framework. Emphasis was placed on: applicability for users without particular computer knowledge, a simple and comprehensible system for solid waste planners to use, stressing environmental impact, and introduction of subjective judgements. As an important element of problem formulation and problem solving, the involved decision processes are elaborated. The entire system is implemented within a Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet environment. The developed model illustrates that it is possible to include and emphasize several features that are lacking in many existing commercial computerized models. </jats:p>",
