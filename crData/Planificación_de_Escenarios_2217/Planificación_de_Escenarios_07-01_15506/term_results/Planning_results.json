      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Recent large-scale disasters have increased awareness of the fundamental need for employee crisis communication and disaster assistance planning. For example, following the US Gulf Coast hurricanes in 2005, many employers faced challenges locating and communicating with employees. As a result, business continuity plans were impaired, and excessive amounts of money, time and resources were spent trying to locate and communicate with employees. To improve business continuity programmes, organisations should evaluate available resources and ensure their business continuity plans address how the employer and employee can exchange important information before and after a disaster. Organisations should also plan to provide disaster recovery assistance to employees by having appropriate human resource representation on planning and response teams to address employee concerns such as payroll, work schedules, benefits and wage continuity. This paper will explore pre- and post-disaster resources for employee support; programmes to facilitate response activities related to incident management; warning and risk communication; employee tracking and post-disaster employee reporting programmes; enquiries from loved ones; and organisationally sponsored aid for immediate housing, re-employment and emergency financial assistance to employees.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>People often fall in love with a business—just as they fall in love with a house—and forget to use their heads as well as their hearts to assess the property. Asking the right question at the right time can save potential buyers a bundle of money or help them avoid making a major mistake. In this completely revised edition ofDue Diligence Techniques and Analysis, published in 1996, Bing breaks down the due-diligence process in detail and shows readers how to investigate, step-by-step, a business with an eye to buying or investing in it. In addition, the author identifies the techniques to employ, the questions to ask, the documents to review, and the issues to explore to reach intelligent conclusions about an acquisition. In a 30-year practice as a deal maker representing buyers and sellers, Bing knows where the bones are buried in many deals, providing invaluable insights and expert opinion readers can use to arm themselves when faced with a tough buying decision.</JATS1:p>\n\t\t\t\t\t<JATS1:p>Fifty chapters cover the different aspects of a typical business up for sale, such as ownership, management, marketing, accounting, environmental issues, and culture. The questions and topics discussed in each are preceded by commentary that highlights major areas for study, objectives, and common problems. In this book, you will find: —The most comprehensive, powerful, up-to-date set of due-diligence questions ever assembled. —Invaluable insights for those contemplating buying or investing in a business, new executives who need to get up to speed on a company or division, anyone conducting forensic investigations, and financiers wondering whether it's time to lend more or pull the plug. Most acquisitions that fail can be traced to failures of due diligence. This book will enable buyers to avoid problems and spot opportunities quickly, making business success much more likely.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>E-planning is the e-government concept applied to urban and regional planning. It is the widespread use of information and communication technologies (ICTs), especially the Internet, in the planning system. A planning portal is the access point in the Internet, frequently in the context of a public digital city project. E-planning allows the municipality to carry out a new set of activities or to implement traditional procedures in a new form, due to geographical information systems, computer aided design and database systems, among other tools mentioned, for example, in Mohamed, Meng, and Abdullah (2003), Budthimedhee, Li, and George (2002), Campagna and Deplano (2004), and Harrison and Haklay (2002). E-planning corresponds, therefore, to the passage from a paper-based urban management system to one based primarily on electronic means of information and communication. But it must be seen as more than a simple transfer to a computer system of the traditional paper based routines (Mohamed et al., 2003; Parsol, 2004), requiring also the re-engineering of procedures, the development of a fully integrated ICT back office and, as Harrison et al. (2002) suggest, changes in the nature of the planning process itself. The aims of e-planning, such as more generally all the other components of e-government (for example, OECD, 2003; Pascual, 2003), are to provide better public services, more efficiently, with lower costs and, at the same time, to do that through more participative, transparent and more accountable decision-making processes. In its more basic level, the e-planning system only offers information and is, therefore, easier to implement. In its more advanced versions, where all or most of the planning services are delivered electronically, its implementation and daily management is not only a more complex task but it also involves more investment, as Couclelis (2004) notes for digital cities. According to the standards of e-Europe, the European Union (EU) initiative for the information society (CEC, 2000, 2002), the availability of public services online can be measured in relation to a framework of four levels of e-government maturity (CEC, 2004). Applying this scheme to the planning sector, we can consider that the first level—information—consists only in the publication of digital information through the Internet, with few or no capacities to interact. In the second level of maturity—interaction—users of the system can communicate directly with the planning department by electronic mail (one-way interaction); it is possible to download planning applications, for example. In the third level—transaction—users and the planning department communicate electronically with each other (two-way interaction); it is possible to process planning applications and to authenticate them. In the fourth level—integration—there is a full electronic handling of all planning functions. </jats:p>"

One manifestation of NPM in health care is activity‐based financing. The first purpose of this paper is to describe what impacts activity‐based financing has had in Sweden's public health service. The second purpose is to explain why the application of the payment model has been gradually changed. The basis for the paper comprises research done on activity‐based financing. The review of the development within Swedish health care regarding activity‐based financing shows that effects appear. But it also becomes evident that the models often are adjusted and that the adjustments, for example the introduction of a production ceiling, changes the effects. The fundamental dilemma appears to be finding a balance between production efficiency and total cost control. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The history of strategic planning begins in the military. According to Webster’s New World Dictionary, strategy is the science of planning and directing large-scale military operations, of maneuvering forces into the most advantageous position prior to actual engagement with the enemy (Guralnic, 1986). Although the way we conceive strategy has changed when applied to management, one element remains key: the aim to achieve competitive advantage. Strategic planning in organizations originated in the 1950s and was very popular and widespread from the mid 1960s to mid 1970s, when people believed it was the answer to all problems and corporate America was “obsessed” with strategic planning. Following that “boom,” strategic planning was cast aside and abandoned for over a decade. The 1990s brought the revival of strategic planning as a process with particular benefits in particular contexts (Mintzberg, 1994).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>This book aims to serve the military profession, and so the national interest, by helping to generate intelligent reform of how the armed forces train, educate, and promote officers who shape our military strategy and write our war plans. Readers will discover the professional and intellectual improvement that wide reading in the masters of historical narrative offers to them. The first chapter, Lessons Not Learned, surveys our strategic documents-and their recent applications-and offers criticism and recommendations. The second chapter, Transformation Ballyhoo, evaluates our current efforts at military transformation and offers an alternative approach to rehabilitating our armed forces. The third chapter, The Brain of An Army, offers ideas on building a first-rate Joint War College. Chapters four through six focus on military campaigns: France 1940; Stalingrad; North Africa, 1940-43. The theme is that moral and intellectual qualities determine the fate of armies in war, and that material and bureaucratic machinery are not nearly so vital as we seem to think nowadays.</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article looks at the issue of sustaining funding for a public programme through the case study of the delivery exemptions policy in Ghana. The Government of Ghana introduced the policy of exempting users from delivery fees in September 2003 in the four most deprived regions of the country, and in April 2005 it was extended to the remaining six regions in Ghana. The aim of the policy of free delivery care was to reduce financial barriers to using maternity services. Using materials from key informant interviews at national and local levels in 2005, the article examines how the policy has been implemented and what the main constraints have been, as perceived by different actors in the health system. The interviews show that despite being a high‐profile public policy and achieving positive results, the delivery exemptions policy quickly ran into implementation problems caused by inadequate funding. They suggest that facility and district managers bear the brunt of the damage that is caused when benefits that have been promised to the public cannot be delivered. There can be knock‐on effects on other public programmes too.</jats:p><jats:p>Despite these problems, start‐stop funding and under‐funding of public programmes is more the norm than the exception. Some of the factors causing erratic funding—such as party politics and intersectoral haggling over resources—are unavoidable, but others, such as communication and management failures can and should be addressed.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Continuity of operations (COOP) planning, sometimes referred to as disaster recovery planning, business continuity planning, or business resumption planning, is a segment of contingency planning that refers to the internal effort of an organization, such as a branch of government, department, agency, or office, to assure that the capability exists to continue essential operations in response to a comprehensive array of potential operational interruptions. In government, COOP planning is critical because much of the response to an incident might include the maintenance of civil authority and infrastructure repair, among other potential recovery activities. All such efforts presume the existence of an ongoing, functional government to mobilize, fund, support, and oversee recovery efforts. In an emergency, government is likely to need to ensure the ability to communicate with internal and external constituencies. This function is becoming associated with electronic government. For example, many people in the United States and elsewhere, when searching for information and guidance following the September 11, 2001 attacks, turned to government agency Web sites. Beyond such extraordinary examples, the growing public expectations of e-government has put additional pressure on the need to reconstitute systems quickly after an interruption to minimize any disruptions and financial costs associated with a major infrastructure failure. Government COOP planning may be regarded as a “good business practice,” and part of the fundamental mission of agencies as responsible and reliable public institutions. Comprehensive contingency plans, perhaps once viewed, at the least, as optional and, at the most, as a prudent measure, are now seen as an integral part of developing and maintaining an agency’s capacity to carry out its essential functions. Continuity planning professionals assert that the perception of a changing threat environment and the potential for no-notice emergencies, including localized acts of nature, accidents, technological emergencies, and military or terrorist attack-related incidents, have increased the need for COOP capabilities and plans that enable agencies to continue their essential functions across a broad range of potential emergencies. COOP planning can be viewed as a continuation of basic emergency preparedness planning, including evacuation planning, and serves as a bridge between that planning and efforts to maintain continuity of government in the event of a significant disruption to government activity or institutions. In the aftermath of an incident, initial efforts typically focus on safeguarding personnel and securing the incident scene. Subsequently, attention focuses on reestablishing critical agency operations according to a COOP plan. Because the number and types of potential interruptions are essentially infinite, effective COOP planning must provide, in advance of an incident, a variety of means to assure contingent operations. In the context of e-government, the heavy reliance upon information technology to carry out mission critical tasks and provide other citizen services highlights the need to ensure these assets are robust, protected, backed up, and resilient to interruption. COOP is not a new idea. While contingency planning has gained considerable attention in recent years due to heightened security concerns and increased dependence on information technology, modern government continuity planning has been practiced, in one form or another, for several decades. What may now be emerging is a recognition that all organizational assets, in the case of government, this would include leaders, civil servants, and information infrastructures, must be incorporated into organization-wide contingency planning. </jats:p>"

Are certain forms of functioning necessary for self-governance? The basic issue is one about sufficient conditions for autonomy; and we should be alive to the possibility that there are, at bottom, several different forms of functioning, each of which is sufficient, but no one of which is necessary for self-governance. This chapter highlights the basic connection between planning agency, agential authority, and self-government. It also returns to an important practical pressure in the direction of conative hierarchy. It examines two prominent models of relevant forms of psychological functioning: hierarchical models that highlight responsiveness to higher-order conative attitudes and value-judgment-responsive models that highlight responsiveness to judgments about the good. The chapter solves these problems by drawing on planning theory.</jats:p>",

The original objectives for establishing PCOs in the two countries are assessed using published research evidence on the impact of PCOs covering: efficiency and cost containment; the development of clinical engagement and leadership; the development of primary care; and the purchasing of secondary and referred services. It is concluded that in both countries, progress has been made in aligning more closely the individual focus of general practice with the population perspective of the wider public health system. The New Zealand approach of using non‐governmental PCOs is judged consistent with harnessing the professional culture of general practice towards community‐based public health. By contrast, English primary care trusts (PCTs) are at risk of becoming remote from their origins as purchasers in primary care and general practice, unless the re‐introduction of practice‐level purchasing can provide GPs with new enthusiasm for local planning and service development.

Overpopulation will lead to starvation and war. Nuclear winter will kill all plants and animals. During the past fifty to one hundred years, Americans have heard many prophecies of doom, such as the Club of Rome report predicting the world economy would crash about the year 2020. These do not come as complete surprises without any warnings. Sometimes the United States simply ignores the threats, but other times it makes plans to prevent them. This provocative book asks whether American planning is different for dangers that are truly apocalyptic—ones that could end life on the planet or at least modern economic prosperity.</JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>This provocative book begins by asking whether American planning is different for dangers that are truly apocalyptic—ones that could end life on the planet or at least modern economic prosperity. It goes on to ask why Americans ignore so many problems like the greenhouse effect or an oil shortage or nuclear war, problems that have been forecast many times. Then when the United States does plan, why do those plans often go astray?</JATS1:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Innovative consultation practices between tribes, states, and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) within the transportation planning process are highlighted. The FHWA Office of Planning sponsored the development of six case studies that highlight a range of practices implemented by tribal and nontribal governments to advance tribal consultation in statewide and metropolitan transportation planning. These case studies demonstrate that effective tribal consultation results from the identification of common goals and the establishment of ongoing coordination procedures. Researchers obtained input from tribal, federal, state, and local representatives in the six cases; examined current practices and the outcomes of these approaches; and developed lessons learned. Three overarching themes emerged from the case studies: participation and support from tribes, FHWA, FTA, states, and MPOs; funding and resources; and safety issues. As the foundation for effective transportation planning, participation must involve all parties. This process requires commitment and involvement by leadership, communication, and personal meetings and interviews; networking and consortia development, involvement, and representation on appropriate boards and committees; and the critical role that individuals often play in building relationships. Funding and resources also are highlighted. Innovative funding and partnership practices are crucial, as are the resources and technical assistance that states and MPOs provide. Finally, the case studies illustrate the ability to address safety issues through transportation, corridor, and crash-reporting studies and the completion of highway improvements. </jats:p>",

This chapter explores the connections between strong forms of agency, the planning theory, and Lockean cross-temporal organization. It introduces the idea of higher-order self-governing policies concerning what to treat as reason providing. It also draws on a version of Harry G. Frankfurt's idea of satisfaction with such an attitude. What is basic is that these self-governing policies play relevant Lockean organizing roles in cross-temporal identity, not that their contents are explicitly a conception of one's “practical identity.” In addition, there is also room in the theory to accord agential authority to attitudes that play these cross-temporal roles but are not, strictly speaking, policies. Such attitudes would be “quasi-policies.”</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a primary health care strengthening intervention on bypassing behavior in Albania, a middle‐income country that has experienced substantial structural changes that affect PHC and where bypassing among health care clients is common. The intervention aimed to improve the quality of health care in low‐level facilities through improved availability and use of health information, the adoption of clinical practice guidelines, and provider training. The study employs a quasi‐experimental research design to evaluate the impact of the intervention on health care utilization. The survey findings suggest that the pilot areas outperformed the control areas with respect to a number of key population‐based indicators of health care utilization. For example, in the 2‐year period between December 2002 and December 2004, bypassing for treatment of simple acute health problems during the month prior to the survey decreased by 47%, and the percentage of chronically ill health care clients who utilized PHC facilities for treatment in the month prior to the survey increased by 29%. These differences, which are statistically significant at the 10% level or better, suggest that the improved performance in the pilot areas is attributable to the intervention.

Planning in complex and dynamic environments is learning. Plans are hypotheses proposed for execution. How is the system’s assistance to the human user related to the system’s ability to understand the user’s needs and desires? Inductive learning is identified as a crucial task of an intelligent computer assistant. In the area of therapy plan generation, inductive learning plays a particularly important role. Therapy actions planned have to be based on reasoning about executability conditions in the future. Estimates of several future parameter values are driving the inductive planning process. The issue of induction is only one among a variety of assistance features. The present approach has to be seen as a contribution to a larger concerted endeavor towards intelligent systems’ assistance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems consist of many software components, which provide specific functionality. As ERP systems become more complex, the financial expenditures that are associated with the application of such systems dramatically increase. Furthermore, ERP system development of nowadays is product-oriented and coordinated by only one instance at any one time. Consequently, each product has a separate data model, which is the basis for the integration of various types of business applications. Based on this fact, the selection of the covered functional enterprise sectors as well as the implemented functions is controlled by the respective vendor, too. Thus, enhancements and modifications of the standard software product are incumbent upon the software vendors. A cross-vendor standardization of data models for ERP systems and the establishment of unified architectural model, however, would change this situation. The new idea is to develop a novel ERP system architecture, which facilitates an overall reusability of individual business components (BC) through a shared and non-monolithic architecture based on Web services. The presented approach uses Web services to wrap up ERP components that are provided within a distributed system, which appears as an ERP community and serves as a vendor-independent platform.</jats:p>"

It describes the institution’s rationale for moving more strongly into e-learning, the processes followed by the institution to develop a plan and ensure its acceptance through the institutional community, and the factors that facilitated the process. It indicates that attention to objectives, core values and principles, and faculty development and training, are critical for the successful transition from mainly face-to-face teaching to e-learning. The development of key performance indicators will allow the success of the plan to be measured in 2010.</jats:p>"

Research in IS focuses in the search for techniques that allow the creation of systems that can generate stories that change as a consequence of a player's actions. There have been numerous articles attempting to reach this goal by employing a planning algorithm as part of the solution, but they typically do not discuss in detail why a given planning algorithm was used. Given this reality, this article makes two main contributions. First, it proposes an initial set of criteria that can be used to evaluate how well a given planning algorithm fits IS systems. Second, on the basis of these criteria, it presents an analysis using available planning systems.</jats:p>",

This was conditioned, along with the socio-economic factors, first of all by the positive role of the Islamic jurists in this process. Religious leaders' position on family planning and the circumstances, under which it can be practiced, has had a direct effect on how Iran has achieved the family planning targets. In this article, an attempt is made to explore religious leaders' views toward family planning after 1989. The verdicts or the Fatwas of the Mujtahids in the context of family planning and issues related to it are discussed. After providing a brief review of different approaches on family planning in the Islamic tradition, the author elaborates the material through in-depth interviews with several prominent religious leaders including Mousavi Zanjani, Mousavi Ardabili, Ahmadi Miyanaji, Shobeiri Zanjani, and Ayatollah Sobhani to enrich the argument.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Perham Resource Recovery Facility (PRRF) in Perham, Minnesota receives and processes Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) from Otter Tail, Todd, Wadena and Stearns Counties. Combustion of the MSW provides the generation of steam for sale to two local industries. Under the terms of these steam sales agreements, the PRRF supplies the base load and peak steam required by these industries from a MSW boiler and/or a natural gas-fired auxiliary boiler. The City of Fergus Falls, Minnesota until recently operated the Fergus Falls Waste-to-Energy (WTE) plant. This facility received municipal solid waste (MSW) from Otter Tail and Grant County. The facility generated steam for use in the State Hospital, however, the State of Minnesota has decided to shut down the hospital and will no longer need the steam. As a result, on February 28, 2006, the Fergus Falls plant shut down. HDR Engineering, Inc. (HDR) working with the City of Perham and the participating counties, conducted a study to consider cooperative disposal of the waste currently processed in Fergus Falls. Three of the options considered included expansion of the PRRF. These options included salvaging of portions of the Fergus Falls WTE plant and providing pre-combustion processing of the waste to recover recyclables in order to maximize the Perham plant capacity. This paper describes the options and the conclusions of the investigations.</jats:p>",

Generally, the share of creative people is higher in cities as compared to the rural areas. The freelancing artists are a kind of exception in this respect; they constitute a relatively high share of the population in some rural areas. A high share of creative people in a region can be explained by a high level of public provisions and a high share of foreign born population, which can be regarded as an indicator of the “openness” in the local milieu. Good employment opportunities have only a relatively weak impact. Regions with a high share of creatives tend to have an above average level of new business formation, a high level of innovation and a relatively high share of employees in high-tech industries.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I argue that gentrification, despite the many arguments over its continuing validity as a concept, retains its key importance in understanding processes of class change. For some it is a process of colonising the city, for others a manifestation of belonging; for some the concept can be used as a radical critique of neoliberalism whilst for others this very critique is an exemplar of the hegemonising tendencies amongst (often radical) North American urban scholars. I argue that the concept has grown somewhat middle-aged and overendowed with its own history. I suggest that it needs to retain a focus on the implications of macro social change for individuals and social groups. In particular, gentrification needs to decouple itself from its original association with the deindustrialisation of metropolitan centres such as London and from its associations with working-class displacement. Recently, gentrification has occurred across the spatial scale—in second-order cities and in hitherto suburban locations as well as in the countryside. Processes such as ‘greentrification’, ‘gated communities’, and ‘studentification’ often coexist in quite close proximity to each other; the influence London exerts over the southern half of England is a good example of this. I argue that the concept of gentrification functions as an important way of understanding the mediations between global processes and flows, on the one hand, and the construction of identities in particular localities, on the other. With the decline of social class as providing an overall explanation of cultural, social, and spatial behaviour, this notion of gentrification as a form of ‘elective belonging’ has considerable potential for uniting geographical and sociological approaches to agency and structure. I illustrate this by drawing on three recent studies on the relationship between people and places. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<ja:p>This study divided the forest into raster cells and used these cells as  calculation units in optimisation instead of predefined stand  compartments. It was hypothesized that raster cells would result in  feasible treatment units and more efficient utilization of the  production potential of the forest when spatial optimisation is used to  compile the plan. The optimization problems of this study included both  ecological and economic objectives. The raster cells were hexagons (721 m)  and their data were derived from traditionally defined forest  compartments. Three forest plans were developed by using the rasterized  forest, and they were compared to the corresponding forest plans  developed by using compartments. Cutting areas were aggregated in all  plans, by maximizing the proportion of the boundaries between two  adjacent calculation units that were both cut during the same management  period, and by minimizing the proportion of cut-uncut boundaries. In  the first plan, only cutting areas were aggregated. In the second and  third plan, also old forests were aggregated by using two different  spatial objectives. The first maximized the proportion of the boundary  between adjacent calculation units that were both considered as old  forest. The second objective maximized the mean of the neighbourhood  minima of the calculation unitsâ old forest indices. The neighbourhood  included the calculation unit itself and all the adjacent calculation  units. The growing stock volume targets at the end of the 60-year  planning period and the cutting volume targets of the three 20-year  management periods were set to the same levels in all plans. The results  showed that the raster approach was able to aggregate old forest  patches and cutting areas similar in shape and size as the conventional  approach. When the aggregation of old forest was a management objective,  the total old forest area was larger in the raster forest but the mean  size of the old forest patches was larger with predefined compartments.  The trade-off curve between harvested volume and old forest area was  further from the origin for the raster forest.<ja:sup>2</ja:sup></ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To perform a cryosurgical procedure successfully, it is important to carefully design the optimal freezing parameters (such as the number of cryoprobes, the locations, the insertion paths and depths of cryoprobes) before cryosurgery. Failure to do so accurately could lead to either insufficient or excessive freezing. Due to the irregularly shaped tumors commonly encountered in clinics, multiple cryoprobes are often needed, which makes the parameter optimization rather difficult. Computerized planning tools would help to alleviate this difficulty. In this study, a three-dimensional cryosurgery planning tool is developed, based on the numerical algorithm presented in our recent works. This tool is developed with general purpose and applicable for the treatment planning of tumor with complex geometry. For demonstration purposes, several examples for typical cryosurgery cases using multiple cryoprobes are given and interpreted.</jats:p>",

However, there are no actual investigations for the whole country. We use data of the Federal Employment Office (Bundesagentur für Arbeit), which include all national insurance contributors, to estimate gravity models. These calculations show the willingness to travel from home to work for all employed persons as well as for sociodemographic subgroups. It can be stated that men are more prepared to commute than women if the distance is increasing, that Germans are more willing to commute than foreigners and that workers have a greater commuting resistance than other employees. A local analysis shows that the influence of distance on commuting is higher in East German regions than in West Germany. One reason for that result may be the lower wages in East Germany. Employees accept longer driving times to work in economically prosperous regions in West Germany.</jats:p>"

Special attention is given to the status of SEA regarding public participation in planning in Serbia. One of the conclusions of the paper is that by introduction of the \"Plan for public participation\" as a legal obligation, it could be the way for operationalizing pubic participation and further, enhancement of participation in planning. .</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Securing access to information is important for any business. Security becomes even more critical for implementations structured according to service-oriented architecture (SOA) principles, due to loose coupling of services and applications and their possible operations across trust boundaries. To enable a business so that its processes and applications are flexible, changes should be expected — both to process and application logic, as well as to the policies associated with them. Merely securing the perimeter with firewalls or routers is not sufficient for a flexible on demand business. Security must be factored into the SOA life cycle, reflecting that security is a business requirement, not just a technology attribute. This approach helps enable the capability to secure services. Another characteristic of SOA security is about rendering and using security functionality itself as security services. This paper discusses the SOA life cycle and security. It presents an SOA security model that captures the essence of security services and securing services. These approaches to SOA security are discussed in the context of scenarios, and observed patterns. The paper also introduces a reference model to address the requirements, patterns of deployment and usage, and an approach to integrated security management for SOA.</jats:p>"

The goal is to facilitate proper selections of the process parameters. Specifically, the axial depth of cut, the feed per tooth are critical in achieving performance objectives in terms of cutting forces, surface accuracy, tool life, etc. To this end, the finite element modeling was used to provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying science base for the micro-machining (e.g., chip formation mechanisms, minimum chip thickness effect, material deformation flows, stress, strain and temperature distributions). Further, a mechanistic time-domain simulation model was utilized to provide predictive capability in practical machining performance, such as cutting forces, tool vibrations, surface accuracy, and surface roughness. The generalized process planning strategy consists of two steps: roughing and finishing. In roughing, the objective is to control the cutting force within a predefined threshold to prevent premature tool breakage and to maximize the material removal rate. In finishing, the primary objective is to control the form error within the tolerance and to obtain satisfactory surface roughness. The proposed process planning strategy was applied for micro-milling of a mold cavity in AL2024-T6.</jats:p>",

It produces large amounts of byproducts that can cause a threat to the surrounding environment of the areas of production. Thus, there is a need for careful planning, particularly the selection of suitable locations for future CAFO development. In addition to Iowa state regulations, selection of locations for CAFOs require multiple parameters like, locations of manmade structures that include roads, residences, businesses, wells, etc., and location of natural features such as rivers and lakes. Currently, locations for CAFOs are chosen manually using paper hard copies with producer’s preference and are restricted by state of Iowa guidelines. There is no decision support system available to aid in selecting an appropriate location for the development of future CAFO structures. The purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how a decision support tool was developed to aid CAFO managers and producers in selecting appropriate locations for animal confinements using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and CAFO regulations in Iowa.</jats:p>"

I argue that, whilst a new middle class is reproduced in certain global cities, the diversity of aesthetic trajectories and the localisms of cosmopolitan knowledge suggest that the case for a global gentrifier class or urban new middle class is a weak one. Much more pervasive at a global scale is a conventional set of strategies of middle-class reproduction in preserving social distinction that now occurs in urban as well as suburban contexts.</jats:p>",

Under the aegis of the TSC, the Authorities maintain a framework for the management of operational disruption, within which they seek to identify and promote high standards of business continuity within the private financial sector, and to strengthen the ability of key participants to coordinate their responses to disruption. If there is operational disruption, the Tripartite's aims are primarily to keep payments and settlements systems open, to keep markets open if there is no threat to financial stability, and to facilitate an early return to normal trading. Recently, there has been much planning for the possibility of an influenza pandemic. This is a reminder that many threats are global in nature, and the lessons of the paper should therefore be of international relevance. In addition, steps are under way to enhance international cooperation in business continuity planning and crisis communications.</jats:p>"

When businesses fail, the economic repercussions add more negative consequences to a community already struck by disaster. One of the first needs in disaster recovery is distribution of goods and services. One of the first goals in reconstruction is regrowth of the economy. Both of these needs are served by business activity in the community. It is important, therefore, that government bodies assist and interact with affected businesses to increase their chances of survival. What helps or hinders business survival of a cataclysmic disaster? This paper uses business survivors of Hurricane Katrina to illustrate a timetable of business disaster response and similarities between disaster response and new business start-ups. In conclusion, the paper explores characteristics of government response that can help more businesses survive and prosper in the midst of a disaster.The concepts in this paper reflect ongoing research on business survival under crisis (Zolin and Kropp (2007) 'Communicable crisis: prevention, response and recovery in the global arena').</jats:p>"

Biodiversity entails at the macro level ecosystemic diversity (ecosystems and landscapes), specific diversity (the species of plants, animals and micro-organisms that surround us) and at the micro level it includes genetic diversity. Although less marked than on other continents, Europe's systemic diversity displays a number of particular characteristics. However, Europeans should seriously fear for the future of their wildlife. Indeed, many wild fauna and flora species today are passing through a period of major crisis. As most natural or semi-natural, continental and coastal ecosystems are now undergoing significant modifications as a result of human activity (fiagmentation, isolation, intensification, ... ), animal and plant species are suffering an unprecedented rate of extinction. To make matters worse, this negative trend is compounded by an array of additional threats (poaching, excessive hunting, disturbance inflicted by tourism, collision of birds with power-lines). Last, on a more global scale, global warming and the depletion of the ozone layer risk precipitating much more profound changes to the distribution, structure and functions of European ecosystems. Given that this issue has been identified as a pressing concern by the EC institutions, the aim of the present article is to highlight the different strategies, plans and programs as well as the main directives and regulations that were enacted with the aim of conserving biodiversity.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The final REACH Regulation is well balanced and will provide a workable framework for managing chemicals for the next 25 plus years. Compared to current legislation it has many beneficial features, not least a simplification over the 40 odd pieces of the current legislation. However, even though the work to agree REACH has been completed, the Commission has been given a number of tasks such as reviewing a number of the Annexes and to set up the European Chemicals Agency in Helsinki. The work continues.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The alignment traverses geologically young Himalayas through active land slide zones and tectonically complicated geological conditions due to presence of Main Boundary Thrust. Main Boundary Thrust has been responsible for an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 on Richter scale in Oct 2005, with epicenter about 150 km away from site resulting in loss of more than 75000 lives. Owing to poor geological formations and difficult terrain, more than 73% of alignment passes through tunnels and further 10% portion of alignment on bridges or viaducts.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Planning &amp;amp; Design of bridges for rail alignment crossing deep valleys with steep unstable slopes is a daunting task. The curved rail alignment alongwith unstable, young geological formations, coupled with severe seismicity of area pose unique challenges while deciding upon the bridge configurations. The paper highlights various considerations in choosing bridge structural alternatives/configurations and materials for crossing such a difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;\n</jats:p>"

It argues that e-learning must be integrated as a process of innovation in the institution for it to become a factor of improvement in the quality of higher education. Transition from conventional education to any model of e-learning demands a well-founded planning strategy to ensure quality in education delivery. Consequently, drawing up strategic plans for the integration of e-learning in our institutions is fundamental. The authors consider there is an obvious need for a greater study into the use of instructional design models and techniques in the sphere of e-learning. The selection of the most suitable instructional design model should allow researchers and practitioners to increase the quality of the educational offerings.</jats:p>"

The EU therefore introduced ambitious limit values for particulate matter (PM10) in ambient air as early as 1999: an annual limit and a daily limit that can be exceeded on up to 35 days a year. These values are binding since 2005. The daily limit is still exceeded in many cities throughout Europe. Heated debates on the future of the daily limit are taking place at all levels of the EU in the context of the negotiations on the Commission's proposal on a new Air Quality Directive. Suggestions range from allowing a compliance time extension to increasing the number of days the daily limit can be exceeded, and abolition of the daily limit value. The deliberations have not yet been concluded, but the decisive European institutions have voiced support for keeping the daily limit while at the same time extending the compliance deadline. In this article, we will make the point that the problem can most probably be solved by allowing a compliance extension of around 5 years after the new directive enters into force. This would give the competent local authorities and the EU the time necessary to intensify their measures in order to comply with the daily limit in most areas where it is currently exceeded. An increase in the number of days the limit values may be exceeded, as called for by the European Parliament (EP), would therefore amount to an unnecessary lowering of the limit value.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

We  expanded on this work and applied the model (in a modified form) to a  problem that had both wood flow and area restriction adjacency  constraints, then tested the problem formulation on six hypothetical  forests of different sizes and age class distributions. Threshold  accepting and tabu search were both applied to the problems as well. The  modified raindrop methodâs performance was best when applied to forests  with normal age class distributions. 1-opt tabu search worked best on  forests with young age class distributions. Threshold accepting and the  raindrop method both performed well on forests with older age class  distributions. On average, the raindrop method produced higher quality  solutions for most of the problems, and in all but one case where it did  not, the solutions generated were not significantly different than the  heuristic that located a better solution. The advantage of the raindrop  method is that it uses only two parameters and does not require  extensive parameterization. The disadvantage is the amount of time it  needs to solve problems with area restriction adjacency constraints. We  suggest that it may be advantageous to use this heuristic on problems  with relatively simple spatial forest planning constraints, and problems  that do not involve young initial age class distributions. However,  generalization of the performance of the raindrop method to other forest  planning problems is problematic, and will require examination by those  interested in pursuing this planning methodology. Given that our tests  of the raindrop method are limited to a small set of URM and ARM  formulations, one should view the combined set of work as additional  insight into the potential performance of the method on problems of  current interest to the forest planning community.</ja:p>"

Its main target is the development and optimization of inspection and monitoring strategies. In project field A1 of the CRC, a framework for risk-orientated planning of SHM is developed. The basis of the framework are probabilistic models of the concerning structure, which are analysed with reliability methods. Recommendations for the monitoring process can be derived from the results of the analyses. Vice-versa data from SHM is used to assess the safety of the structure anytime during its usage. This paper describes the methodology of the framework which is currently implemented in the program system called PROBILAS. It will assist engineers in the assessment of structures and the planning of monitoring measures.&lt;/p&gt;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The robotic motion planning criteria has evolved from kinematics to dynamics in recent years. Many research achievements have been made in dynamic motion planning, but the externally applied loads are usually limited to the gravity force. Due to the increasing demand for generic tasks, the motion should be generated for various functions such as pulling, pushing, twisting, and bending. In this presentation, a comprehensive form of equations of motion, which includes the general external loads applied at any points of the system, is derived and implemented. An optimization-based algorithm is then developed to generate load-effective motions of redundant manipulators (single-loop and tree-structured chains) that guarantee the execution of the generic tasks under limited actuator capacities. It is shown that if the external loads are not incorporated in the motion planning formulation, then the generated motions do not always guarantee the execution of the task, especially when a large load is desired. By using our algorithm, the load-effective motions can be found that are executable for given external loads. The proposed method is also applicable in predicting realistic dynamic human motions. Some dual-arm human tasks are simulated to show different motions to sustain different amounts of external loads. Our formulation for general external loads will further advance the current motion planning methods for redundant manipulators.</jats:p>",

Much existing work employs receding-horizon optimization, where an objective function is repeatedly optimized over some short lookahead length. The use of receding horizon optimization often results in ad-hoc methods for dealing with the problem of myopic lookahead, where no value is visible in an agent’s planning horizon. This work examines the use of an algorithm for receding-horizon optimization that explicitly accounts for myopia by allowing for a variable lookahead length. Cooperation is maintained by ensuring that all agents plan to the same horizon, potentially with different strategies. This algorithm is used to develop trajectories for a team of unmanned vehicles searching for a target using a probabilistic framework. Simulation results are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

During the first years of use of the BMS, the inventory and calibration phases were completed, and currently the system database contains information on the condition and reliability for almost the entire stock.

Using this information we can now simulate long-term scenarios for infrastructure development, and critically compare alternative maintenance, repair and reconstruction (MR&amp;amp;R) strategies.

In February 2007, the European Commission presented a proposal for a Directive on Environmental Crime. This is not the first legislative instrument in the area at the level of the European Union. But for reasons that go far beyond the environmental content of this proposal, its discussion in the Council, which was taken up in March 2007 under the German Presidency, will be most controversial and of particular interest not only to environmental lawyers.' The following article aims at providing some background on the fight against environmental crime at the international and European level by giving an overview over the content of the draft directive (I) with a focus on particularly controversial aspects (II) and finally looking at the institutional setting in which discussion of the proposal will take place in the Council and in the European Parliament (III).</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The correct choice of toolpath patterns will make it possible to build a fully dense and functional metal part. The major consideration when selecting a toolpath pattern is the complete coverage of the to-be-deposited geometry which means no voids should happen. This paper presents the research on the toolpath coverage efficiency and the strategies to predict the possibility of the occurrence of deposition voids so that the appropriate toolpath pattern can be applied to avoid deposition voids. The contour-parallel offsetting pattern and the adaptive zigzag toolpath pattern will be applied as the alternate options and the final adaptive deposition coverage toolpath will be the combination of these two basic patterns depending on the prediction results of the occurrence of the deposition voids. The experiment has demonstrated that the adaptive toolpath pattern can greatly improve the reliability of the coverage path planning in deposition processes.</jats:p>",

Beginning with listing rules and market disclosures, it then analyses disclosure from the viewpoint of accountancy standards, corporate governance and requirements for pension fund trustees, and finally, voluntary standards of disclosure and de facto or ad hoc disclosures occurring in different sectors of industry. It is argued that it is beyond doubt that environmental information is an important source of financial information. As such, it should be disclosed in a uniform manner and on a regular basis because of its potential impact on investment decision-making, company value and the viability and profitability of businesses. It follows that there should be an end to the uncertainty concerning the question of the \"materiality\" of environmental information, its disclosure and an acceptance of the need to disclose it. The failure to require specific disclosure of environmental information, and the general failure by corporations to accept the materiality of environmental information in light of other legislative developments in the field of investor protection, is viewed as a major weakness. Providing such important information to investors ought to be an obligation on listed companies. To overcome this significant weakness, specific and if possible, uniform disclosure rules for environmental information must be adopted generally.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

This work was aimed at  evaluating the suitability of ACO for optimizing the clear-cut patterns  of a forest landscape when aiming at simultaneously minimizing the risk  of wind damage and maintaining sustainable and even flow of periodical  harvests. For this purpose, the ACO was first revised and the algorithm  was coded using the Visual Basic Application of the ArcGIS software.  Thereafter, the performance of the modified ACO was demonstrated in a  forest located in central Finland using a 30-year planning period. Its  performance was compared to simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm.  The revised ACO performed logically since the objective function value  was improving and the algorithm was converging during the optimization  process. The solutions maintained a quite even periodical harvesting  timber while minimizing the risk of wind damage. Implementing the  solution would result in smooth landscape in terms of stand height after  the 30-year planning period. The algorithm is quite sensitive to the  parameters controlling pheromone updating and schedule selecting. It is  comparable in solution quality to simulated annealing and genetic  algorithms.</ja:p>"

The text and history of Article 9 (2) Aarhus Convention and of Directive 2003/35/EC on public participation seem to recognise this German concept. However, a closer examination of the objective of wide access to justice and of the case law of the European Court of Justice reveals a clear need for changes with regard to the application of this concept by the German courts. In this context, the interrelation of limited rights of action with the depth of judicial control has to be regarded, as well. New German legislation does not satisfy the need for a reform.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper introduces a novel distributive path planning method, the bending beam method, for mobile robots moving in environments monitored by wireless sensor networks. The proposed method is inspired by the deflection analysis of bending beams. The initial and goal positions of a mobile robot are connected by a virtual beam. The in-between obstacles are replaced with the effective loads acting on the beam. The resulting robot path is represented by the deflection curve of the beam under those loads. Following the principle of superposition, the beam deflection under all the loads is equal to the sum of the deflections caused by the individual loads acting on the beam separately. In an environment covered by a wireless sensor network, each sensor node monitors the obstacles (stationary and moving) in its neighborhood. By letting each sensor node compute the deflections of the virtual beam caused by only those neighboring obstacles, the computation load for the global robot path planning can be distributed among the sensor nodes. Thus, the path planning becomes a highly parallel computation procedure. The robot only needs to collect the results from the sensor nodes and sum them up to generate its path. Moreover, the robot path can be dynamically modified by the sensor nodes in the case of moving obstacles. As a result, the proposed method may substantially reduce the time complexity of the sensor-based motion planning for mobile robots in dynamic environments, with the assistance from sensor networks.</jats:p>",

Also we introduce a new homotopy approach which uses potential fields to find paths in polynomial space. We use the homotopy approach for changing the group shape of the mobile agents and at the same time treat the group as a single agent by finding a bounding disc for it to plan the motion of the group through obstacles. A time varying polynomial is constructed, the roots of which represent the current positions of the mobile agents in a frame attached to the bounding disc. The real and imaginary parts of the roots of this polynomial represent the x and y coordinates of the mobile agents in this frame. This polynomial is constructed such that it avoids the discriminant variety or the set of polynomials having multiple roots. This is equivalent to saying that the mobile agents do not collide with each other at all times. The bounding disc is then used to plan the motion of the agents through obstacles such that the group avoids the obstacles at all times.</jats:p>",

One striking example for this is at present coming into focus in East Germany, where the huge crater-like holes remaining from the massive open cast lignite mining activities in the former GDR are to be recultivated and rehabilitated. However, birds have nonetheless already begun to settle and habitats have formed in some parts of the areas in question, so that the designation of the areas as 'Special Protection Areas' (SPAs) and 'Special Areas of Conservation' (SACs) within the meaning of the Birds and Habitats Directives seems indicated. On the other hand, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to realise the intended recultivation and rehabilitation measures in SPAs or SACs. The same dilemma may be encountered in other regions of Europe, especially in Eastern Europe, where former mining, industrial or military sites or similar areas are being subjected to a sea change. In this connection, the question arises of whether such areas in the process of conversion are eligible to be considered as SPAs and SACs at all.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two severe problems may arise, while planning a path for a parallel manipulator. First, it might be impossible to reach a desired configuration at all, and second, any possible path leading to a desired configuration might cross a parallel singularity, which could provoke the loss of platform control and jeopardize the structural integrity of links and actuators. These two problems are strictly related to the topological properties, connectedness in particular, of the configuration space and of the singularity locus. This paper presents a new numerical method based on differential topology, which is able to identify and count the disjoint regions composing the configuration space, and the disjoint regions into which the configuration space is split by the singularity locus. After this classification, it is always possible to find a path connecting any two configurations, if any exists. This path is singularity-free, if any singularity-free path exists. The method is applied to 3RRR planar manipulators, with actuators on the middle joint of each leg.</jats:p>",

Inadequately prepared to continue normal operations in the face of the enormity of the Gulf Coast disaster, which destroyed or disabled hospitals and other vital infrastructure, in addition to generating large numbers of patients, individual healthcare organisations in the Gulf Coast region had no hope of expanding their personnel surge capability and operational capacity. Public health and infectious disease clinical experts continue to express concern over predictions that the next influenza pandemic could affect 15–40 per cent of the US population through hospitalisations and outpatient visits. Hospital emergency management plans should therefore include a strategy for the integration of volunteer healthcare personnel who are prepared to assist with meeting the challenges of a sudden surge in patient volume.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the analysis work underlying the path-planning algorithm for a robotic painting system. The system requires no bespoke production tooling and fills an automation gap in rapid prototyping and manufacturing technology that is currently occupied by hand painting. The system creates images by exposing individual pixels of a photographic coating with a robot-mounted laser. The painting process requires no physical contact so potentially images could be developed on any shape regardless of its complexity: As objects can only be “painted” when their surface can be “hit” (i.e. exposed) by the light beam the system requires six degrees of freedom to ensure all overhanging or reentrant areas can be exposed. The accuracy of serial robots degrades with the length of the kinematic chain (in other words six axis robots cannot position themselves with the same accuracy as four axis ones). Consequently to ensure high precision in the location and orientation of the light source, the object being exposed is mounted on a rotary tilt table within the workspace of a four-axis robot. This gives a six-degree of freedom positioning system composed of two separate kinematic chains. Although the resulting system is accurate the problems of constructing a coordinated path that allows the light beam to efficiently sweep (i.e. cover) the surface regardless of its geometry are challenging. This paper describes the difficulties and, after reviewing existing path planning algorithms, a new algorithm is introduced firstly by describing the nature of the system’s configuration space and then further developing this concept as an alternative to a previously described planning algorithm. Having outlined the approach the paper presents a kinematic model for the system and compares the configuration space approach to a purely Cartesian planning approach.</jats:p>",

This article is concerned with key legal and regulatory issues associated with establishing and operating geosequestration projects in Australia. It highlights the recent increased interest in, and raised profile of, using geosequestration as a greenhouse gas abatement measure in Australia. It reviews the cooperative efforts of the States, Territories and the Commonwealth to develop a nationally consistent regulatory framework for geosequestration projects, using existing petroleum legislation. These efforts have been driven by a lack of existing Australian legislation that provides an adequate and discrete regime dealing with the issues of responsibility and liability for geosequestered gas, although the release of draft legislation in this area is now imminent. It assesses some State legislative attempts to allow for the underground storage of carbon dioxide, and argues that these fail to satisfactorily deal with the long term (indefinite) nature of the storage aspect of geosequestration projects. Finally, this article examines the States' and Commonwealth's powers to legislate in respect of the injection and storage of carbon dioxide.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Safe and simultaneous arrival of constant speed, constant altitude unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) on target is solved by design of paths of equal lengths. The starting point for our solution is the well-known Dubins path, which is composed of circular arc and line segments, thus requiring only one simple maneuver—constant rate turn. An explicit bound can be imposed on the rate during the design and the resulting paths are the minimum time solution of the problem. However, transition between arc and line segments entails discontinuous changes in lateral acceleration (latax), making this approach impractical for real fixed wing UAVs. Therefore, we replace the Dubins solution with a novel one, based on quintic Pythagorean hodograph (PH) curves, whose latax demand is continuous. The PH paths are designed to have lengths close to the lengths of the Dubins paths to stay close to the minimum time solution. To derive the PH paths, the Dubins solution is first interpreted in terms of differential geometry of curves using the path length and curvature as the key parameters. The curvature of a Dubins path is a piecewise constant and discontinuous function of its path length, which is a differential geometric expression of the discontinuous latax demand involved in transitions between the arc and the line segment. By contrast, the curvature of the PH path is a fifth order polynomial of its path length. This is not only continuous but also has enough design parameters (polynomial coefficients) to meet the latax (curvature) constraints (bounds) and make the PH solution close to the minimum time one. The solution involves the design of paths meeting the curvature constraint and is followed by producing multiple paths of equal length by increasing the lengths of the shorter paths to match the longest one. The safety constraint, intercollision avoidance is achieved by satisfying two conditions: minimum separation distance and nonintersection at equal distance. The offset curves of the PH path are used to design a safety region along each path.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographers and sociologists have recognised the emergence of new variants of the middle-class neighbourhood characterised by a strong focus on the development of human capital, a high level of connectedness to global networks, and a strong sense of identity based on aesthetics and taste. Such neighbourhoods are typically associated with the inner areas of ‘metropolitan’ centres and, according to Bourdieu, are manifestations of ‘milieux’ in which residents increasingly use taste as a basis for the ascription and enjoyment of status by way of contrast to residents in neighbourhoods in ‘suburban’, ‘provincial’, and ‘small-town’ settings where status continues to derive primarily from occupation and/or the ownership of key consumer products. This paper explores the extent to which qualitative evidence for the existence of these different milieux can be supported by quantitative evidence, using classifications of residential neighbourhoods originally developed by commercial organisations to assist marketers target the promotion of consumer products. The paper uses a study by Peter Hall, which locates urban centres in England and Wales on a central place hierarchy, to differentiate those types of middle-class neighbourhood whose location is characteristically inner metropolitan from those principally associated with suburban and/or small-town locations. These types of neighbourhood are then contrasted in terms of their residents' role within the urban system, in terms of their spatial distribution, and in terms of their consumption of products and media. Results from similar classification schemes developed in other countries are used to evaluate the extent to which these types of metropolitan habitus are characteristic of other advanced industrial societies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Industrial robots are frequently used in the manufacturing process. One important aspect in the manufacturing process design is to assure that there exists a collision-free assembly path for each part and subassembly including the assembly equipment, e.g. a robot. In order to reduce the need of physical verification the automotive industry uses digital mock-up tools with collision checking for this kind of geometrical assembly analysis. However, in real production, all equipment, parts and subassemblies are affected by geometrical variation, often resulting in conflicts and on-line adjustments of off-line generated assembly paths. This paper presents a variation analysis toolbox for path planning for industrial robots. This toolbox can help to avoid problems with on-line adjustments. The variation analysis includes the variation in joints and actuators in the robot and can also be used by robot manufacturers when designing new robots. A new tool for variation analysis of a robot path is presented. Also, variation analysis of the product at the assembly line is used to enhance the off-line generated assembly paths. With better knowledge of the variation in the robot and product we can allow the assembly path to reach closer to areas of low variation, while avoiding areas of high variation. The proposed approach is illustrated with test cases.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt; Foreign accent syndrome (FAS) is a rare speech disorder that usually follows from damage to the motor speech areas of the language-dominant hemisphere. Recently, a vascular FAS patient was reported in whom a close parallelism was found between the infratentorial perfusional changes on SPECT and the regression of FAS symptoms. Based on the correlation between the near remission of a right cerebellar hypoperfusion and the near remission of FAS, it was hypothesized that the ‘linguistic cerebellum’ might be involved in the pathogenesis of motor speech planning disorders [Clin Neurol Neurosurg 2006;108:518–522]. &lt;i&gt;Aim:&lt;/i&gt; In this article the presumed role of the cerebellum in FAS is further investigated on the basis of an additional FAS case. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; Phonetic, neurobehavioral and neuroimaging data were analyzed and clinical-anatomical correlations were investigated. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; In both patients, a close correspondence was found between the neurolinguistic findings and the functional neuroimaging data. &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc ECD SPECT follow-up studies demonstrated that clinical recovery of FAS symptoms was accompanied by a remission of a right cerebellar hypoperfusion. &lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt; The present study, in which the data of a new FAS patient are discussed, corroborates the view that FAS may follow disruption of a close functional interplay between the supra- and infratentorial motor speech centers.</jats:p>"

Clearly, there are lessons to be learned from this and other atrocities. However, there is a dangerous tendency to focus too much on past terrorism scenarios when deciding how to address future terrorism concerns for our schools. While it is always crucial that we examine previous events and learn from them, our extensive research, training, and formal work experience in the field of antiterrorism in schools shows that an excessively scenario-driven approach is affecting many communities. This article explores how using a reality-based, functional approach to school antiterrorism measures will yield better results than in-depth analysis of previous instances of school-related terrorism.</jats:p>"

In this research, a case-based retrieval method, called the DFM (Design For Manufacturing) framework, that retrieves previously formulated process plans is proposed to support process planning. To support the DFM Framework, we have developed an information model (ontology) of manufacturing process knowledge in the domain of additive manufacturing processes, including design requirements, process plans, and rules that map requirements to plans. Description Logic (DL) is identified as an appropriate mathematical formalism to encode the ontology and realize the computational mapping between the design and manufacturing domains. Storage and retrieval algorithms are presented that, first, structure the repository of previous DFM problems and, second, enable DFM problems to be retrieved.</jats:p>",

The problem is classified as a weighted multi objectives two-staged guillotine two-dimensional Cutting Stock Problem “CSP” of Dyckoff’s type 2/V/D/M. This paper presents a tailored metaheuristic solution using grouping genetic algorithms (GGAs). Overlapped Chromosome representation is newly developed for optimization. Developed also an especial database to create the cutting patterns of resulting solution. The objective in this application is to minimize the total cost, which includes the total material cost required to achieve a lot size, the cost of selecting reels set size, and the cost of cutting lengths from these reels “sheet set size”. An industrial case study is considered. The attained optimum cutting plan provides an overall improvement of 4.3% over the current professional cutting plan. The reduction in the reel set size is from five to an optimum of three reels. The developed procedure also provides reduction of trim loss of 4% over the current plan. The developed approach also proved to be faster than the currently used techniques.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Biopharmaceutical companies with large portfolios of clinical and commercial products typically need to allocate production across several multiproduct facilities, including third party contract manufacturers. This poses several capacity planning challenges which are further complicated by the need to satisfy different stakeholders often with conflicting objectives. This work addresses the question of how a biopharmaceutical manufacturer can make better long‐term capacity planning decisions given multiple strategic criteria such as cost, risk, customer service level, and capacity utilization targets. A long‐term planning model that allows for multiple facilities and accounts for multiple objectives via goal programming is developed. An industrial case study based on a large scale biopharmaceutical manufacturer is used to illustrate the functionality of the model. A single objective model is used to identify how best to use existing capacity so as to maximize profits for different demand scenarios. Mitigating risk due to unforeseen circumstances by including a dual facility constraint is shown to be a reasonable strategy at base case demand levels but unacceptable if demands are 150% higher than expected. The capacity analysis identifies where existing capacity fails to meet demands given the constraints. A multiobjective model is used to demonstrate how key performance measures change given different decision making policies where different weights are assigned to cost, customer service level, and utilization targets. The analysis demonstrates that a high profit can still be achieved while meeting key targets more closely. The sensitivity of the optimal solution to different limits on the targets is illustrated.</jats:p>",

The grasping planning method is devised through modeling and simulation and experimentally verified using physical prototype. The paper presents the method for forward and inverse kinematic solutions of the BH-4 robot 4-DOF finger, including transformation matrix between the palm coordinate system and the finger base coordinate system. In addition, the method of the idiographic manipulation is presented using example of ball grasping. The simulation results and physical experiment verify that the inverse kinematic solution is correct, and kinematic grasping and operating planning is valid and feasible. Finally, the experiment with the complex system integrated robot arm with dexterous hand is carried out. Experimental result shows that the more complicated grasping task can be done by a dexterous hand integrated in the robot arm system.</jats:p>",

This paper reports on a research study that examined a range of pre-service teacher education initiatives, both in Australia and internationally, that were seeking to reorient teacher education towards environmental sustainability. This paper reports on six factors utilised across the initiatives that were critical to their success. These were (1) the nature and length of funding arrangements; (2) the range and quality of partnerships and networks; (3) the curriculum focus and the teaching and learning processes used; (4) the nature of, and incentives for, participant engagement; (5) the level at which a change was being sought; and (6) the use of evaluation as a tool for learning and ongoing improvement. This paper discusses why and how each of these six factors proved critical and explores the implications for initiatives seeking to reorient teacher education towards environmental sustainability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper is concerned with path planning for mobile robots. Specifically, the discussion is related to the following problem: Given an ordered sequence of points on the plane, construct a path that fits these points and satisfies certain smoothness requirements. These requirements may be different in different problems and imply basically that the constructed path is to be realizable. Such a problem arises, e.g., when it is required to follow in an automated mode a path stored as a discrete set of points, which, e.g., were collected by a GPS receiver installed on a car when it followed this path for the first time. Due to errors inherent in the data points, the shape of the curve approximating the desired path turns out often inappropriate. The shape of the curve can be improved by applying the so-called fairing, which consists in moving the original data points with the aim to minimize some fairness criterion. Adequate small variations of the data points preserve the proximity of the resulting path to the original data points and make it fairer. In the paper, a new global fairing method is proposed. It reduces the problem of constructing a fair cubic B-spline curve to solving a quadratic programming problem with simple constraints. The fairing criterion is based on minimizing jumps of the spline third derivative. The discussion is illustrated by numerical examples of fairing two actual paths constructed by data points collected by a GPS/GLONASS receiver mounted on a moving vehicle.</jats:p>",

Base on the linear and angular momentum conservations of the system, the system state equations for control design are established, so the nonholonomic motion planning objective of attitude control of space robot system is translated as the solution of a canonical nonlinear control problem. An optimal control scheme of the system proposed is studied, using radial basis function approximation; a numerical algorithm for computing approximate optimal control of the system proposed is developed. The optimal motion planning approach proposed above possesses the advantages that it can obtain the desired angles of the base’s attitude and arms’ joints only by controlling the arms’ joints motion. A planar free-floating space robot system with dual-arms is simulated to verify the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has recently come into question whether the term ‘gentrification’ can capture the wide array of contemporary demographic processes in the inner city. There is also a need to extend the gentrification debate beyond the Anglo-American context, while understanding the urban implications of contemporary demographic processes. In response to such challenges we examine the changing population geographies of the city of Bologna, with the aim of establishing, whether the concept of ‘reurbanisation’ can provide a more useful encapsulation of its recent sociospatial transformations. Upon investigating the spatial patterns and movements of relevant population structures at various scales within the city, we have found that Bologna is the site of multifaceted and multidirectional demographic trends. In their entirety, these dynamics are leading to the social diversification, ‘residentialisation’, and fragmentation of the urban fabric. Such processes cannot be subsumed under the notion of gentrification because they do not involve major housing renovation and are spread throughout the inner city in a diffused and fragmented manner. ‘Reurbanisation’ is a more appropriate term to describe them. </jats:p>",

Dividing environmental damage into three different categories (biodiversity, water and soil), the Directive's concept is based on a mixed liability system following the US-American example while stressing the polluter-pays-principle. Member States have to incorporate the Directive's provisions into national law by 30 April 2007. Yet the efficiency of the measures is still doubtful. The following article illustrates the Directive's provisions and highlights its problems, particularly those resulting from exemptions, concluding that further instruments are necessary in order to achieve comprehensive nature protection.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In contrast to the previous legal regime, the Regulation dismisses the so called authorship rule, which aligns it with recent developments in the field of the law of transparency and, notably, of international environmental law (Aarhus Convention). The European institutions are hence tasked with making all documents accessible to the public, which include both those originating with them and those from third parties. Yet unlike the Aarhus Convention, the Regulation has a blind spot, which leads to the important question of whether a Member State can simply order the institutions to withhold any of its documents whenever it chooses to do so. For the first time, the European Court of Justice is being asked to hand down a judgment on this question. The author suggests that the Court may wish to consider an interpretation of Regulation 1049/2001 that adjusts it further to the international standard as set by the Aarhus Convention.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is growing recognition that patients should have greater opportunity to plan their future care, a process known as advance care planning. The aims of this phase I qualitative focus group study were (1) to explore the acceptability of an interview schedule, designed to encourage conversations regarding future care; and (2) to explore the suitability of such discussions and inquire about their possible timing, nature and impact. Purposive sampling was used to achieve a balanced sample of 22 palliative care and oncology patients, relatives and user group members. The results showed that, although some patients welcome the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care, others may not feel ready or able to do so. The timing of a discussion is likely to influence its acceptability and effect. A discussion might best be initiated after recurrence of disease. The person initiating discussion should be skilled in responding to the cues of the patient, and should enable the patient to close the topic down at the end of the discussion, in order to avoid dwelling too much on the end of life. Advance care planning should take place over a number of meetings, and be conducted by an appropriately trained professional with sufficient time to talk through the issues raised, and with the knowledge and skills to answer questions, tailor the discussion to the individual, and avoid destroying hope. Advance decisions to refuse treatment should not be the focus of the discussion, but one component of a broader conversation about end-of-life issues. If patients make an advance decision to refuse certain treatments, they should be given the opportunity to change their minds in the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In previous works, we treated the collision-free path-planning problem for a nonholonomic mobile robot in a cluttered environment. We used a method based on a representation of the obstacles on the robot's velocity space. This representation is called Feasible Velocities Polygon (FVP). Every obstacle in the robot's influence zone is represented by a linear constraint on the robot's velocities such that a collision between the robot and the obstacle could be avoided. These constraints define a convex subset in the velocity space, the FVP. Every velocity vector in the FVP ensures a safe motion for the given obstacle configuration. The path-planning problem is solved by an optimization approach between the FVP and a reference velocity to reach the goal. In this paper, we have extended our work to an articulated mobile robot evolving in a cluttered environment. This robot is composed of a differential mobile robot and one or several modules that together form the trailer which are linked by off-center joints. This kind of robot is a strongly constrained system. Even in a free environment, under some circumstances, the robot may be blocked by its trailers in its progression towards the goal. The proposed approach, compared to other methods, has the main advantage of integrating anti-collision constraints between the articulated robot itself and the environment, in order to avoid and resolve dead-lock situations. For moving to the final position, the articulated mobile robot uses the FVP and a reference control law, to formulate the constraints method as a problem of minimal distance calculation. This formulation is then solved with the algorithm of minimal distance calculation proposed by Zeghloul (Zeghloul and Rambeaud, 1996). When a dead-locking situation arises and according to the robot–obstacle configuration, we have developed three different modules to solve these conditions. Each module uses a different approach to resolve the blocking situation. In order to show the capabilities of our method to lead the articulated robot to the final position in a stable way, a numerical result is presented.</jats:p>"

The theory is based on the solution to the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the proton distribution function. The resulting analytical expression allows one to calculate the SOBP proton energy spectra for the different beamlet sizes and modulation depths that can be readily implemented in the calculation of energy and intensity modulated proton dose distributions. Since the practical implementation of energy modulation for proton beams is realized through the discrete superposition of individual Bragg peaks, it is shown that there exists an optimal relationship between the energy sampling size and the width of the initial proton energy distribution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, I examine the local expression of a global phenomenon: gated communities in Montevideo, Uruguay. Focusing on the residents' perspective, I investigate microlevel processes of class segregation. I analyze residential and class trajectories, motivations for moving, and consequences of the move. I rely on interviews with residents, developers, architects, and real-estate agents; advertisements; and ethnographic field notes. A major finding is that gated communities do not always increase social and residential segregation. In Montevideo, families in these neighborhoods were already segregated from lower classes. Residents experienced changes in family and community life, but those changes rarely corresponded to changes in their class segregation. This challenges the central focus of the literature on gated communities: a presumed effect on increased class segregation regardless of the context. Another major finding is that residents moved to new neighborhoods to secure class reproduction and gain control over their immediate environment, something that they saw the open city was threatening. Surprisingly, these motivations are very similar to those reported in studies of gentrification. Rather than calling for yet another stretching of the meaning of gentrification, based on these similarities I argue that comparative urban research would profit from a more acute focus on underlying social processes rather than on manifest physical forms. </jats:p>",

The greatest health benefit (HIV infections averted) occurred when efficient allocations were made at both levels. When funds were allocated proportionally at the higher level and efficiently at the lower level, the health benefit was about 5% less than when efficient allocations were made at both levels. When funds were allocated efficiently at the higher level and proportionally at the lower level, the health benefit was 15% less than when efficient allocations were made at both levels. The least health benefit (23% less than when efficient allocations were made at both levels) occurred with proportional allocation at both levels. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. Efficient allocation only at the higher level cannot overcome poor allocations at lower levels. Moreover, efficient allocation at the lower level is likely to yield greater gains than efficient allocation at the higher level. Thus, upper-level decision makers, such as donor organizations, should develop incentives to promote efficient allocation by lower-level decision makers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The category of gentrification has only recently began to be used for the study of French cities. The process through which working-class neighbourhoods became areas of upper-middle-class residence was earlier discussed as embourgeoisement, largely referred to as state intervention and seen as the effect of the permanent preference for central locations of higher categories. The detailed empirical examination of the Paris metropolis shows that such changes have indeed been occurring steadily over the last decades, but that the largest number of neighbourhoods experiencing that change of social profile are to be found in the first ring of banlieues and not in the central city. The analysis of the social profile of gentrifiers shows that it differs substantially between areas. Three main types of processes are identified: the first is the expansion of upper-class areas into adjacent working-class neighbourhoods, with an influx mainly of private-sector professionals, managers, and engineers; the second is upward social mobility of working-class areas, spatially and socially distinct from upper-class ones; and the third, which is found in a minority of cases only, resembles more the dominant model of gentrification, with a substantial contribution of professionals in public, scientific, media, and artistic occupations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The distribution of school provision in the greater Paris metropolitan area, including the availability of certain courses and study programs, is strongly correlated with the social profiles of the different localities and corresponds to sharp disparities. The highly diversified, attractive school options in localities whose residents are highly privileged in socioeconomic and occupational terms stand in contrast to the less diversified educational resources, including fewer course and study-program options, and reduced private school presence in more markedly working-class municipalities. Different approaches to school choice are strongly linked to parents' socioeconomic status but do not amount merely to practices for avoiding stigmatized middle schools in working-class localities. Those approaches make sense when considered in relation to what may be tightly circumscribed social and school environments and differentiated social positions and demands. The results presented here call into question the effectiveness of school-districting rules in France aimed at regulating the social profile of middle schools. As in London, Amsterdam, and Madrid, school dynamics and urban space in the outskirts of Paris are closely intertwined and increasingly interact in producing segregation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> New-build city-centre residential development in the UK has increasingly been identified as a form of ‘third-wave’ or ‘postrecession’ gentrification. The aim of this paper is, first, to extend our understanding of new, developer-led, residential development in the context of nonmetropolitan urban areas in the UK, which it does by means of a case study of the city of Bristol. The second aim is to revisit the issue of whether such residential development should be seen as a form of postrecession gentrification and to question the meaning of the term ‘gentrification’ as it has been increasingly used in a global context. This discussion draws both on a detailed case study of Bristol and on a critical reading of Davidson and Lees (2005, “New build ‘gentrification’ and London's riverside renaissance”, Envronment and Planning A 37 1165–1190) account of new-build ‘gentrification’ in London's riverside. In conclusion, it is argued that these forms of residential development and investment flows reflect a powerful and complex set of processes which it is important to understand. In contrast to Davidson and Lees, however, the conclusion is also that the extension of the term ‘gentrification’ to embrace such forms of development stretches it beyond the point at which it retains utility or meaning. </jats:p>",

At present the lack of a stable, long-term regulatory and incentive policy framework for CCS projects acts as a barrier to investment. This is compounded by the cumbersome and fragmented approval process. This article explores the current regime and approval process, which requires developers to seek approval for seabed access, electricity generation, marine works and pipelines, coast protection works and onshore works. The article also explores the UK Government's proposed changes to the regulatory regime. The article considers the key elements of the proposed CCS regime contained in the Marine Bill White Paper, released in March 2007. The UK Department of Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (\"DBERR\") has indicated that a new tailored CCS legislative regime will complement the existing regime. The White Paper includes options for modification of the existing legislation to make it better suited to CCS regulation, or alternatively CCS regulation via secondary legislation. The article concludes that UK Government's proposals for a new regime do complement the existing approval regime: however, there is still significant scope to amend existing legislation to further reduce the regulatory burden on CCS developers.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In previous works, we treated the collision‐free path‐planning problem for a nonholonomic mobile robot in a cluttered environment. We used a method based on a representation of the obstacles on the robot′s velocity space. This representation is called Feasible Velocities Polygon (FVP). Every obstacle in the robot′s influence zone is represented by a linear constraint on the robot′s velocities such that a collision between the robot and the obstacle could be avoided. These constraints define a convex subset in the velocity space, the FVP. Every velocity vector in the FVP ensures a safe motion for the given obstacle configuration. The path‐planning problem is solved by an optimization approach between the FVP and a reference velocity to reach the goal. In this paper, we have extended our work to an articulated mobile robot evolving in a cluttered environment. This robot is composed of a differential mobile robot and one or several modules that together form the trailer which are linked by off‐center joints. This kind of robot is a strongly constrained system. Even in a free environment, under some circumstances, the robot may be blocked by its trailers in its progression towards the goal. The proposed approach, compared to other methods, has the main advantage of integrating anti‐collision constraints between the articulated robot itself and the environment, in order to avoid and resolve dead‐lock situations. For moving to the final position, the articulated mobile robot uses the FVP and a reference control law, to formulate the constraints method as a problem of minimal distance calculation. This formulation is then solved with the algorithm of minimal distance calculation proposed by Zeghloul (Zeghloul and Rambeaud, 1996). When a dead‐locking situation arises and according to the robot–obstacle configuration, we have developed three different modules to solve these conditions. Each module uses a different approach to resolve the blocking situation. In order to show the capabilities of our method to lead the articulated robot to the final position in a stable way, a numerical result is presented.</jats:p>",

This is seen as part of a wider process of change from industrial to postindustrial land uses and is a physical counterpart of the economic and occupational class transformation of these cities towards the growth of professional and managerial workers working in financial, business, and creative services. The paper focuses on loft conversions in Clerkenwell, adjacent to the City of London which are shown to be initiated by changes in the commercial property market, particularly the rise and fall of the secondary office market and the need to find alternative uses for commercial property. The apartments have been marketed in terms of their architectural distinction, their centrality and the social attributes of city-centre living. Their residents are professional and managerial workers with a strong orientation towards centrality, many of whom see themselves as pioneers of a new form of city-centre living. </jats:p>",

This is already the second time the current government has amended the rules and procedures regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The new draft is aimed at fulfilling the government coalition agreement to advance research and application of biotechnology in Germany. This article will provide an overview of the proposed amendments and briefly analyse to what extend the aim of advancing biotechnology has been achieved. The author argues that the draft introduces a number of amendments with the potential of advancing biotechnology research and of appeasing the farming community on the issue of cultivation of GMOs. However, a number of fundamental policy choices regarding biotechnology have been left unaltered. The author therefore concludes that this draft does not lead to a paradigmatic change regarding biotechnology policy in Germany.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Previous fixture design systems rarely consider the assembly tool accessibility. Current methods of assembly tool accessibility analysis mainly depend on simulation-based or user-interactive approaches which rely on users’ judgment. This paper presents a new approach to tool accessibility analysis for fixture setup planning. The fixture workspace around a tool is represented by a newly defined global accessibility sphere with depth of a truncated half-line. The assembly tools are modeled as five articulated parts to fully describe the tool characteristics. Accessibility analysis is executed to verify assembly tools’ feasibility applied on a fastener. In particular, both tool motion and tool placement constraints during tool applications are integrated into the tool geometric reasoning. The example demonstrates the fast computing speed and intuitive simulation of several assembly tools in fixture setup planning.</jats:p>",

The lack of availability of critical parts and technologies poses a challenge not only to the acquisition community, but to customers of products that must be maintained for long periods of time. Technology obsolescence has an especially serious impact on systems that have significant electronics content because electronic parts are quickly obsoleted in favor of newer, higher performance components. In this study, market availability data was analyzed for operational amplifiers, a technology integral to most electronic products, and for flash memory devices. Procurement lifetimes are shown to have shrunk since operational amplifiers emerged on the market. Algorithms for forecasting electronic part obsolescence are proposed and the ramifications of electronic part obsolescence on product design planning are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The research reported in this chapter studied the relevance of the application of network quality of service (QoS) technologies for modern enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, explored the state-of-art for QoS technologies and implementations, and finally provided a framework for the provision of QoS for ERP systems that utilise Internet protocol (IP) networks. The motivation for conducting this research has been the fact that, to date, there is a dearth of literature on the realisation of network QoS for mission-critical ERP systems. Nor have the current implementations of QoS been studied with the objective of developing a practical framework, based on the knowledge and experiences of the practitioners, to allow a structured approach for the provision of QoS for modern ERP systems. Due to the intent and the nature of the research, an interpretivist research paradigm underlies the work and informed a qualitative research method. Based upon the research problem and the context of research, a case study research method has been selected. Four individual cases—including both leading ERP vendors and network technology vendors—were conducted. The primary data collection was done using semi-structured interviews and this data was supplemented by an extensive array of secondary material. The case data collected was then analysed using qualitative data analysis strategies derived from the existing literature. Cross-case analysis confirmed that the traditional approaches for ensuring the performance of ERP systems on IP networks do not address network congestion and latency effectively, nor do they offer guaranteed network service quality for ERP systems. Moreover, a cross-case comparative data analysis was used to review the pattern of existing QoS implementations and it concluded that while QoS is increasingly being acknowledged by enterprises as an important issue, its deployment remains limited. The findings from the cross-case analysis ultimately became the basis of the proposed framework for the provision of network QoS for ERP systems. The proposed framework focuses on providing a structured, yet practical approach to implement end-to-end IP QoS that accommodates both ERP systems and their Web-enabled versions based on state-of-art traffic classification mechanisms. The value of the research is envisioned to be most visible for two major audiences: enterprises that currently utilise best-effort IP networks for their ERP deployments and ERP vendors.</jats:p>"

Although it is well known that the learner’s motivation and emotional state in educational contexts are very important, they have not been fully addressed in intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In this paper, a method for integrated motivation diagnosis and motivational planning is described in a manner applied to an operable system. For the motivational diagnosis rules, three different channels of data (performance from interaction with the system, verbal communication, and feedbacks) are combined. For the motivational planning rules, four different strategies (different learning process, helps, different teaching strategies, and arousal questions or feedbacks) are combined. By applying the mechanisms, a tutoring system for the topic of perspective projection with motivation diagnosis and motivational planning on a multiagent system with fuzzy logic has been implemented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>1. Systematic conservation planning is a process widely used in terrestrial and marine environments. A principal goal is to establish a network of protected areas representing the full variety of species or ecosystems. We suggest considering three key attributes of a catchment when planning for aquatic conservation: irreplaceability, condition and vulnerability.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Based on observed and modelled distributions of 367 invertebrates in the Australian state of Victoria, conservation value was measured by calculating an irreplaceability coefficient for 1854 subcatchments. Irreplaceability indicates the likelihood of any subcatchment being needed to achieve conservation targets. We estimated it with a bootstrapped heuristic reserve design algorithm, which included upstream–downstream connectivity rules. The selection metric within the algorithm was total summed rarity, corrected for protected area.</jats:p><jats:p>3. Condition was estimated using a stressor gradient approach in which two classes of geographical information system Layers were summarised using principal components analysis. The first class was disturbance measures such as nutrient and sediment budgets, salinisation and weed cover. The second class was land use layers, including classes of forestry, agricultural and urban use. The main gradient, explaining 56% of the variation, could be characterised as agricultural disturbance. Seventy‐five per cent of the study area was classified as disturbed.</jats:p><jats:p>4. Our definition of vulnerability was the likelihood of a catchment being exposed to a land use that degrades its condition. This was estimated by comparing land capability and current land use. If land was capable of supporting a land use that would have a more degrading effect on a river than its current tenure, it was classified vulnerable (66% of the study area). 79% of catchments contained more then 50% vulnerable land.</jats:p><jats:p>5. When integrating the three measures, two major groups of catchments requiring urgent conservation measures were identified. Seven per cent of catchments were highly irreplaceable, highly vulnerable but in degraded condition. These catchments were flagged for restoration. While most highly irreplaceable catchments in good condition were already protected, 2.5% of catchments in this category are on vulnerable land. These are priority areas for assigning river reserves.</jats:p>",

This move has led to the development of regional NRM plans. Native vegetation and biodiversity conservation, along with soil, pasture and water resources, are key components of the regional NRM plans in Queensland's extensive rangelands. This paper outlines and applies a set of criteria for evaluating the native vegetation and biodiversity content of accredited regional NRM plans for Queensland's rangelands. The evaluation showed considerable variation in the comprehensiveness of the information and knowledge base and management action targets among plans, including the poor articulation of impacts of excessive grazing pressure on biodiversity. The NRM plans lacked effective integration of natural resource, native vegetation and biodiversity conservation targets and actions. Several regions had too many biodiversity targets, many of which were poorly integrated. This is symptomatic of a limited understanding of rangelands as ecological systems and the lack of an integrated planning framework. We conclude regional NRM planning is not a ‘silver bullet’ for biodiversity conservation in the rangelands, but rather, it is the beginning of a long road to address complex, multi‐scale problems at a regional level.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With drilling and exploration occurring in ever deeper waters and harsh environmental conditions, the ability to properly plan critical operations such as deployment and retrieval of the drilling riser becomes increasingly important. Particularly in deepwater high current environments, deployment and retrieval operations can be limited by the length of time it takes to deploy or retrieve the riser and the danger of the riser joints binding in the diverter housing. These limitations can have significant impact on both operations and riser integrity. Drilling contractors have devised a number of means of conducting operations in high current environments in order to increase operational up-time and mitigate the risks involved. One approach is drift-running, where the drilling rig is positioned upstream of the well at the start of the deployment operation and the rig is allowed to drift in a controlled manner to the well as the riser is deployed. This procedure effectively reduces the current loading on the riser, thereby allowing the riser to be deployed without risk of binding in the diverter housing. This paper describes an on-board simulation tool designed for use on dynamically-positioned (DP) drilling rigs that can be used to plan deployment/retrieval and drift-running operations. The tool is a development of an on-board drift-off simulator that has been in operation on-board the latest generation of DP drillships for some time. The simulator uses a fully-coupled 3D finite element (FE) model of the riser system, thereby allowing accurate determination of the riser response to current loading. The simulator computes the angle of the riser in the diverter housing throughout the deployment/retrieval process. Additionally, the simulator can compute the optimum drift speed of the vessel to minimise the riser angle. Based on the results of these simulations, the on-board tool can determine the feasibility of deploying or retrieving the riser and can compute the required vessel track for carrying out drift-running operations. The tool allows on-board personnel to plan these operations using either prevailing or forecast metocean conditions. The key features of the on-board simulator are discussed, with particular emphasis on the procedure used to compute the drift-running track for the drilling rig during riser deployment. The benefits of the system in planning deployment/retrieval operations are illustrated by means of a number of case-studies.</jats:p>",

In bypassing the formal metropolitan planning process, these taxes appear to put important regional policy goals at risk. The extent to which key policy issues (e.g., the equity, environmental, and regional transportation impacts of projects) were considered within the planning processes is examined, by drawing from archival research and interviews, for four of these tax measures at a critical stage, when they were becoming dominant in California. How these processes exhibit characteristics associated with “the new regionalism”–consensus building, proactive visioning around untraditional policy goals, informal governance, and network-like organizational approaches–also is described. </jats:p>",

Considerando que os alunos são reflexos dos professores, foi possível concluir que é urgente a necessidade de se reformularem currículos e, paralelamente, de se investir na capacitação dos professores, elementos-chave de qualquer mudança, cuja formação defasada e às vezes divergente não permitirá uma reforma curricular plena.</jats:p>"

The approach consists of a dynamic model of the power plant, reformulated as an index one differential algebraic equation (DAE) system. A dynamic optimization framework is developed where the constraints include the dynamic model of the plant. The system model is then discretized using Radau collocation on finite elements and formulated in the AMPL modeling environment. This allows for the straightforward solution of dynamic optimization problems using large‐scale NLP solvers. IPOPT is the NLP solver used in this study. Program links were provided to Matlab/Simulink to visualize and interpret the results. The formulation of a dynamic optimization problem was focused on determination of optimal operating trajectories for tracking power plant load variations. Efficiency measures were also included as a part of the dynamic optimization problem to maximize efficiency while tracking the desired load profile. Results from 18 case studies show that the dynamic optimization can be performed quickly with excellent results. The applicability of the dynamic optimization framework for the estimation of feed fuel concentrations is also demonstrated. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007</jats:p>",

The artificial muscle used for this underwater application is an Ionic Polymer Metal Composite (IPMC) which can generate bending motion in aquatic environments. In this research, the double ring structured nonlinear neural oscillator is proposed for the undulatory motion in the actuator. The overall dynamic model of the flexible IPMC actuator including its fluid interaction terms is used for the motion planning and open-loop controller design. The IPMC used in this study is a patterned or segmented type where the electrode surface of the actuator is encoded such that each segment can be controlled independently for effectively generating an undulatory motion in the water. Computer simulations show that the proposed neural oscillator based controller can be effectively used for the underwater locomotion applications, and can be extended to the closed-loop controller where the precise maneuver is needed in the unstructured aquatic environments.</jats:p>",

The design of time-optimal path-constrained trajectories for robotic applications is discussed in this paper. To increase industrial applicability, the proposed method accounts for robot kinematics together with actuator velocity, acceleration and jerk limits instead of accounting for the generally more complex dynamic equations of a manipulator with actuator torque and torque-rate limits. Besides actuator constraints also constraints acting on process level are accounted for. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using a cascade of genetic algorithms and Nelder-Mead’s method. Simulations performed on a Puma 560 manipulator model show that for a proper choice of the kinematic constraints results can be obtained that match the quality of those obtained using the more complex dynamic constraint approach.</jats:p>",

The report indicates key changes in how the World Bank intends to engage with its clients in low- and middle-income countries with respect to its transport lending program. Investment in transport infrastructure and improved transport services are crucial for meeting the millennium development goals. Low-volume rural roads have been, and continue to be, an important component of the World Bank's transport development program. The recently developed rural access index is a useful indicator of the need for improved accessibility. Research has shown the importance of rural roads in stimulating both economic growth and social development. Effective planning and implementation of good rural road projects depend on a combination of adequate planning tools, worthwhile community consultation, a flexible approach to engineering design, and reliable data. New economic planning criteria need to be developed to reflect new thinking in transport appraisal and to capture fully the social and economic benefits of roads. The results-based approach for monitoring and evaluation can be particularly valuable within the roads sector. Similarly, substantial benefits can be gained from adopting a holistic approach to planning rural infrastructure service delivery including a more detailed consideration of rural transport services and the planning of different types of rural infrastructure together. Underfunding and poor organization of rural road maintenance need to be recognized and addressed. </jats:p>",

However, filling this technological promise requires resolution of key regulatory and legal uncertainties surrounding both human and ecological health, integration within a larger climate policy, and clear assignment of responsibility and liability for long-term care. Deployment of CCS projects in the European Union (E.U.) and the United States (U.S.) may be technologically similar, but will be contextually different. In this paper, we explore the existing energy, policy, regulatory and legal climates that will necessitate different approaches for deployment. The high U.S. dependence on coal makes CCS very important if the U.S. is to achieve deep emissions reductions, while in the E.U. an established climate policy, the importance of off shore projects, and a supportive political climate are favorable to CCS deployment. Additionally, in Europe, regulators must clarify the classification of CO2 within E.U. and international regulations governing on and offshore projects, whereas in the U.S. subsurface property rights, abandoned wells, and state-level jurisdictional difference will play important roles.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

While one of the most salient manifestations of this trend, the creation of markets for tradable emissions quota, has been widely applied in the areas of air pollution and greenhouse gas regulation, it has yet to be introduced as a policy instrument for the management of watercourses. A great diversity of abatement costs for pollution of the Baltic Sea through nutrients that result in eutrophication suggests the introduction of a system of tradable quota as an attractive management tool. The following article provides a brief introduction to the challenge of nutrient accumulation in the Baltic Sea, and shows that the legislative framework currently governing its pollution does not categorically preclude the introduction of a nutrient trading scheme. A number of design issues would require clarification prior to the introduction of such a scheme, including the definition of the tradable commodity, the scope of participation, the initial allocation of quota, and monitoring and enforcement provisions. While the article concludes by affirming the fundamental viability of a nutrient trading scheme in the Baltic Sea Area, it identifies challenges in accommodating the trading scheme alongside existing emission limit values, state aid concerns, and the inclusion of states that are not Members of the European Union.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Policy integration, i.e. the co-ordination of policies by different levels of government and government departments, has received growing attention at a time of growing interdependency between countries and regions yet increasing fragmentation of responsibility, sharpening goal conflicts and diverging interests between countries, regions, government agencies and public, semi-public and private stakeholders and the emergence of new, over-arching policy challenges, such as climate change and energy scarcity. A book on the state and future prospects of policy integration in three critical areas of policy making, land use, transport and environment, is therefore more than welcome. The book reviewed here aims at exploring the necessary conditions for integration between the three policy fields and the mechanisms or tools that may support policy integration from a sustainability perspective. The book presents results of a study funded by the Netherlands Agency for Energy and the Environment as part of their Regional Transport Performance research programme. It is the work of an international team of researchers led by editors associated with the OTB Research Institute for Housing, Urban and Mobility Studies at Delft University of Technology and the Faculty of Social Sciences of Erasmus University Rotterdam.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses on processes of studentification, and explores the link between higher education students and contemporary provincial gentrification. The paper provides two main, interconnected, contributions to advance debates on gentrification. First, the discussion appeals for wider temporal analyses of the lifecourses of gentrifiers to trace the formation and reconfiguration of the cultural and residential predilections of gentrifiers across time and space. With this in mind, it is argued that there is a need to rethink the role of students within the constraints of third-wave gentrification, and to consider how ‘student experiences’ may influence the current and future residential geographies of young gentrifiers within provincial urban locations. Drawing upon recent studies of studentification, it is asserted that this profound expression of urban change is indicative of gentrification. Second, the paper advances Clark's recent call to extend the term gentrification to embrace the wider dominant hallmarks and tendencies of urban transformations. Controversially, in light of a deepening institutionalisation of gentrification, we contend that gentrification can be most effectively employed at a revised conceptual level to act as a referent of the common outcomes of a breadth of processes of change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Office was established in 1982 to carry out the federal government’s responsibilities for low-level radioactive (LLR) waste management in Canada. In this capacity, the Office operates programs to characterize, delineate, decontaminate and consolidate historic LLR waste for interim and long-term storage. The Office is currently the proponent of the Port Hope Area Initiative; a program directed at the development and implementation of a safe, local long-term management solution for historic LLR waste in the Port Hope area. A legal agreement between the Government of Canada and the host community provides the framework for the implementation of the Port Hope Project. Specifically, the agreement requires that the surface of the long-term LLR waste management facility be “conducive to passive and active recreational uses such as soccer fields and baseball diamonds.” However, there are currently no examples of licensed LLR waste management facilities in Canada that permit recreational use. Such an end use presents challenges with respect to engineering and design, health and safety and landscape planning. This paper presents the cover system design, the environmental effects assessment and the landscape planning processes that were undertaken in support of the recreational end use of the Port Hope long-term LLR waste management facility.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The province of Darfur, Sudan, has been in the news for several years because of civil unrest and the suffering of its population. The Darfur region is defined as the triangular area connecting El Fasher, Nyala, and Geneina (on the Chad border). The road system is rudimentary at best. Transport development in Darfur is more difficult than in other regions of the country because of its location at the western extreme of the country and its geologic complexity. Data are presented from the Sudan Road Survey, which is one of the best sources of geotechnical data needed for the planning of low-volume roads in Sudan. The fieldwork took 18 months and covered the central and northern portions of the country, from the Ethiopian border to westernmost Darfur and from the Nuba Mountains southwest of Khartoum to the Egyptian border. The aim was to produce basic engineering data for road design, including estimation of construction and maintenance costs. In addition, the original field logs contain personal commentary that provides insight into the difficulty of conducting field research in Sudan at that time. </jats:p>",

One of the participants in the initiative was a group of UK universities providing transport master's courses, the Universities Transport Partnership, which has been working with TPS in the development of the profession, in part through its employers' forum. Having identified the need for a stronger professional identity for transport planning, TPS has been working in liaison with employers, professional institutes, and the skills sector on the development of a set of transport planning skill requirements (National Occupational Standards) and qualifications. </jats:p>",

This paper describes a task planning method for minimizing trial and error to reduce the development time in large-scale and complicated product development at the early stage of product development. The proposed method matches the group of product components according to geometry and determines the development sequence of each component to minimize the amount of feedback information across task groups. The method applies as evaluation index for task prioritization the product-sum of engineering interaction among components and worth of each component, the “worth flow.” The paper shows with an example of the generic hair drier with simple mechanical structure that this method contributes to the reduction of the size of task group by 22% and amount of information required for setting the interface links by 65% compared to the conventional planning methods.</jats:p>",

Similarly, inter-cultural conversations on values about and priorities for biological resources and habitat protection remain under-developed. This essay begins with a rhetorical question. Will it be possible to forge successful ecosystem recovery strategies, to maintain all elements of local biological diversity through land use planning, without far deeper cognizance of the aboriginal legacies in Canadian landscapes? I do not think so. This discussion, from the drier enclaves on the south coast of British Columbia, centres on a federally funded ecosystem recovery team in the first four years of its operation from 1999 to 2003 and the near total lack of outreach to, and engagement with, aboriginal people and First Nations.

We suggest, however, that the driving force of gentrification in these areas is not the local government's need to strengthen its tax base or developers' pursuit of profit. Gentrification is also not a response to the housing demands of a new middle class. Instead, we conceive of state-led gentrification in the Netherlands, and perhaps elsewhere as well, as an attempt by a coalition of state actors and housing associations at generating social order in disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Gentrification is used to pacify tensions and to reduce concentrations that pose a problem for authorities. In many cases, residents support this strategy, either actively or passively. But, at the same time, interaction between low-income and higher-income households, and between renters and homeowners, in restructured neighbourhoods are often superficial at best and hostile at worst. Thus, gentrification undermines social cohesion and thereby reduces the chance that residents will find solutions for tensions in the neighbourhood. </jats:p>",

At the same time, however, the newly established legislative competence of \"divergent state legislation\" (Abweichungsgesetzgebung) allows the Federal States (Leinder) to enact laws deviating from federal legislation in certain areas. On the one hand, the strengthening of legislative competencies of the Federation with regard to environmental issues enables the enactment of a Federal Environmental Code, which has been under discussion for many years. On the other hand, deviating provisions of the Federal States could undermine the integrative effects of such a code. However, the vast majority of national environmental regulations are mandatory implementation of European law. Thus, the question arises whether the new legislative competence of \"divergent state legislation\" will even become relevant in practice and whether it will actually impede an integrative Federal Environmental Code, or if the duty to observe European law will serve as a corrective influence and prevent the Federal States from undermining a Federal Environmental Code by precluding them from making extensive use of their powers to enact divergent legislation.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The ultraviolet emission is intense enough to harm human tissues if it is used as tissue compensator. Intense ultraviolet emission is observable even if the concentration of gadolinium is less than 0.5%. Thermal annealing further enhances the intensity of ultraviolet emission, indicating that longer use of such tissue compensators or collimators containing gadolinium ions will provide more harm and damage to human body. Radiation Therapists, Oncologist and industries making tissue compensators and collimators are strongly suggested to test any compensator or collimator for gadolinium impurities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The impacts of disasters have recently attracted increased attention from researchers and policy makers. However, there has been little consensus about how an efficient inventory management model can be developed for postdisaster conditions. Victims of a disaster are generally gathered into shelters during and after a severe disaster to ensure their security. Many evacuees do not have the financial resources to leave the disaster area or to find food, drugs, and other necessities. Hence, their vital needs should be supplied efficiently throughout the disaster and postdisaster periods. Without an adequate stock of goods, satisfying the daily requirements of the victims without disruption might be problematic. To solve this problem, humanitarian inventory control models that can aid in adequately responding to a disaster or a humanitarian crisis are needed. In this context, response represents preparedness, planning, assessment, appeal, mobilization, procurement, transportation, warehousing, and distribution. This paper is concerned with the development of a subproblem of the general humanitarian supply chain problem: an efficient and quick-response humanitarian inventory management model able to determine the safety stock that will prevent disruptions at a minimal cost. The humanitarian inventory management problem is first mathematically formulated as a version of the Hungarian Inventory Control Model. A solution to this time-dependent stochastic model is then proposed by using the p-level efficient points algorithm. The single commodity case results are given, and a sensitivity analysis of the model vis-à-vis various model parameters that affect safe inventory levels is conducted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A mixed integer programming model that aims at supporting the tactical wood procurement decisions of a multifacility company is presented. This model allows for wood exchanges between companies. Furthermore, the material flow through the supply chain is driven by both a demand to satisfy (\"pull\" strategy) and a market mechanism (\"push\" strategy), enabling the planner to take into consideration both wood freshness and the notion of quality linked to the age of harvested wood into log, chips, and end-product demands. An inability to consider alternative plans for implementation, and the difficulty of assessing the performance of these plans in an uncertain environment, are two shortcomings of the manual planning process. A planning process, based on human planner – decision support system interactions that allows a company to overcome these shortcomings is therefore presented. The process combines Monte Carlo methods and an anticipation mechanism that will, in the long term, enable the company to take into account equipment transportation costs. The proposed planning process leads to a multicriteria decision-making problem where the human planner has to select a plan to implement from a set of candidate plans. A hypothetical test case shows that it is possible to manage the wood flow from stump to end market in such a way as to preserve freshness and extract higher value from the logs processed in the mills. The test case also shows that the proposed planning process achieves an average profitability increase of 8.8% compared with an approach based on a deterministic model using average parameter values. Finally, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the accuracy of standing inventory on harvest blocks and the anticipated market conditions are the most important parameters to consider in selecting a good wood procurement plan. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To plan a reaching movement, the brain must integrate information about the location of the target with information about the limb selected for the reach. Here, we applied rapid event-related 3-T fMRI to investigate this process in human subjects ( n = 16) preparing a reach following two successive visual instruction cues. One cue instructed which arm to use; the other cue instructed the location of the reach target. We hypothesized that regions involved in the integration of target and effector information should not only respond to each of the two instruction cues, but should respond more strongly to the second cue due to the added integrative processing to establish the reach plan. We found bilateral regions in the posterior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the medial frontal cortex, and the insular cortex to be involved in target–arm integration, as well as the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and an area in the right lateral occipital sulcus to respond in this manner. We further determined the functional properties of these regions in terms of spatial and effector specificity. This showed that the posterior parietal cortex and the dorsal premotor cortex specify both the spatial location of a target and the effector selected for the response. We therefore conclude that these regions are selectively engaged in the neural computations for reach planning, consistent with the results from physiological studies in nonhuman primates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Years of experience have provided substantial evidence of persistent planning problems that are common to many proposals for major transit investments. These problems frequently are rooted in the system-level planning performed at the scale of the metropolitan area or region. This area is the scale at which different transportation services and modes form an interrelated system for moving people and goods between origins and destinations where the household, employment, and commerce activities occur. System planning provides the big-picture context for foundational planning elements, such as developing a coherent vision for the region's future and translating that vision into concrete goals and objectives, which provide the basis for identifying transportation needs and problems. The usage of potential new transportation infrastructure and major services should be forecasted at the regional level to capture essential travel behavior characteristics. Five system planning activities are particularly necessary to provide the necessary groundwork underpinning successful projects: regional needs identification and prioritization, land use planning coordinated at the level of the metropolitan area, technical analysis and forecasting, early consideration of environmental issues, and financial planning and fiscal constraint. The components of these activities that are most critical to developing successful large-scale transportation projects are discussed, along with associated strategies for improving the linkage between system-level planning and the development of individual projects. </jats:p>",

In contrast, the models’ bus speeds are typically not calibrated. As a result, it is difficult to assess accurately the impact of future traffic conditions and project alternatives on future bus speeds; this in turn makes it difficult to plan for a more multimodal transportation system in the long term. To address this issue, the department sponsored simultaneous speed and delay studies in 2005 in the Jacksonville region for the automobile and bus modes. Four sets of models were developed from the collected data, which estimate bus speeds as functions of both auto speeds and planning-level attributes (e.g., daily traffic volumes, roadway functional class, and area type), for roadway segments and entire bus trips. The study found a linear relationship between bus and auto travel times (and speeds) across the range of sampled travel times, unlike the current regional model structure, which uses three different linear functions for various ranges of auto speeds. Bus travel times were a consistent proportion of auto travel times during peak and off-peak periods, although absolute travel times were longer during peak periods. Finally, the current model structure was found to underestimate the maximum observed bus speeds in the field. These results are consistent with those of a study conducted in the Tampa Bay area in 2003. </jats:p>",

Then a new attractive force based on fractional potential was introduced, with the aim to extend the method to dynamic obstacles characterized by fractional potential fields. In this paper a comparison between each classical attractive force is presented. Then the new attractive force based on fractional potential is introduced.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Corridor mobility improvements require a new approach to corridor management planning and operations. Recent investigations are aimed at improving the safety and efficiency of existing transportation systems by integrating state-of-the-art operational analysis (such as microsimulation) into more traditional corridor planning. One of the important elements in developing corridor management improvements is better bottleneck analysis. Such analyses play a crucial role in corridor management planning for both performance assessment and simulation model calibration. New approaches are proposed for bottleneck identification and calibration in simulation. Identification is conducted with percentile speeds based on data from multiple days. It turns out that this method is more appropriate for urban congested freeways than use of single-day data. The algorithm for bottleneck calibration represents the first attempt to rigorously calibrate bottlenecks in microsimulation. It is a three-step process–including visual assessment, bottleneck area matching, and detailed speed calibration–aiming to calibrate bottlenecks in three levels of detail. With the I-880 corridor network in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, it has been shown that the identification method can adequately identify corridor bottlenecks; the calibration procedure complements and improves the current practice of simulation calibration. </jats:p>",

Several conflicting definitions of equity are offered, as are applications for each within the context of environmental justice. The importance of choosing a correct unit of analysis is discussed, with particular emphasis on how the geographic unit of analysis is a poor proxy for the group unit, which is theoretically required, as the analysis's purpose is to compare performance measures across groups. The primary goal of this paper is to explore challenging topics such as these raising questions and concerns.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> International experience suggests that in the realm of urban transport a public participation process can be a valuable complement of the technical planning process in generating good projects with widespread distributional benefits that minimize the concentration of adverse impacts. If properly designed, participation processes also offer an opportunity to incorporate the interests of vulnerable groups into the planning process. Laobaixing is Chinese for “common people.” In Liaoning, China, the successful development of a meaningful public participation process influenced project design on a World Bank–financed urban infrastructure improvement project to address the broad needs of the project beneficiaries better. In particular, the participatory process significantly influenced the project design and raised the sensitivity of city leaders to public needs. Through the process, the project shifted focus from major road expansion to secondary road improvements. In addition, the participation processes grasped latent issues to address better the needs of nonauto users, women, and other vulnerable urban residents. The outcomes of the Liaoning participatory project indicate that a mainstreamed participatory process offers the potential to systematically reveal and address critical issues and public needs early in the planning process; this leads to higher value projects to accomplish investment goals. </jats:p>",

Through use of a data set of 21 systems at various stages of development, the study shows that initiatives under way involve 64 corridors, tracks of 21 freight railroads, and 15,552 unique mi of route. Findings show that these corridors reach 163 of the 250 largest metropolitan areas in the continental United States. More than 87% of the existing railroad mileage identified for high-speed service is operated by freight-oriented railroads, with 74% being single track. The choice of technology and the need to acquire nonrailroad land to support the development of corridors differ sharply between interstate and intrastate routes. These and other findings illustrate the many opportunities—and challenges—facing proponents of HSR throughout the country. </jats:p>",

Some Stakeholders have suggested that technology, cost and legal questions around CCS are all but solved. However, while policymakers embark on the agreement of national, European and international legislation on CCS, a number of challenges arise. This paper reviews the progress of CCS towards a legally embedded mitigation option, and identifies three major conditions for the acceptability of CCS deployment: social acceptance by stakeholders and the lay public, robustness of economic and cost data, and legal and regulatory consistency. Technical maturity and reliability are important crosscutting issues that need to be fully addressed before any of the other areas can be solved. It is concluded that, although legal and regulatory issues are close to being resolved, the role that CCS may play in the global energy system has likely been overestimated in system models, which is partly due to transparency and information problems. In addition, resistance from environmental organisations may have to be reckoned with and social acceptance of CCS remains one of its most prominent unknowns.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The number of major cities and megacities is increasing globally. How the distinctive opportunities and risks of major cities and megacities are managed will either erode or enhance the quality of life for their communities. Whereas only one megacity existed in 1950, more than 20 megacities currently exist–and ongoing urbanization inevitably will ensure that several major cities achieve megacity status. The megaregion is increasingly important in infrastructure development that not only solves existing metropolitan problems in a transient manner but proactively recognizes and capitalizes on supraregional opportunities to create sustainable alternatives. Transportation planning and infrastructure delivery are recast in this context, with recognition of the specific changes necessary to support the emerging urban form of megacities and megaregions. Specifically, the scope of the long-range transportation planning framework, infrastructure performance reporting practices, and public-private partnerships (PPPs) is examined in relation to providing adequate transportation infrastructure for megacities. For supraregional planning that involves multiple states and a cohesive vision and standards for the national transportation system, findings indicate that sustainable solutions may involve extending geographic and temporal frames of reference for long-range planning and expanding performance measures to capture appropriate planning inputs that evaluate planning effectiveness according to desired outcomes, a public-sector commitment to involve the private sector in infrastructure delivery, and federal and state leadership to pass laws that create a PPP-enabling environment. </jats:p>",

The VISSIM traffic simulation tool was used to evaluate a current plan and alternative plans for the deployment of transit during an emergency situation in a transit facility such as a bus depot. Different strategies were simulated to study the effect of evacuation on the surrounding traffic network as well as to help the local transit company (LYNX) evaluate its evacuation plan and consider different possibilities without the risk and cost of actual evacuation drills. Nine evacuation scenarios were simulated and analyzed to reach the best evacuation strategy for the LYNX company's main bus depot. Evacuation strategies evaluated include traffic diversion, bus signal optimization, access restriction, different destinations, and evacuation of pedestrians. Total network delay for each scenario was compared with the base case, and results indicate that pedestrian evacuation was better than using buses. Traffic rerouting also could potentially reduce delays and evacuation clearance time. </jats:p>",

The process of identifying the feasible paths accounts for the delays caused by the different modes and the terminal switching. This algorithm is designed to constitute a component of an integrated web-based information gateway, aiming to provide information to travelers through the Internet for intercity trips using public transport. The algorithm identifies feasible paths according to compatibility of various modes, intermodal stations, and users' preferences. The multiobjective linear programming model that corresponds to this process is presented to prove the efficiency of the algorithm. An implementation for the proposed algorithm is designed, coded, and computationally tested in realistic-size networks. The computational complexity of the algorithm is proven to be polynomial. </jats:p>",

Traffic density, rail stations’ capacity and human criteria are main factors in order to develop and to obtain a useful tool for helping Railway Administrations in the decision making processes. In this sense, a tool is presented to operate off-line for planning and scheduling; and on-line for common operation on traffic central post. The architecture is oriented to save time in specific modules where operation tools are trained on different scenarios to solve particular ‘events’ which are defined to be critical for the line. The objective is the generation of an optimal operational plan to regulate the line with minimum train delay according to the characteristics of the line (stations, facilities) and vehicles. The results are proven useful for mass-transport, like underground, or open-line topologies with mixed traffic both passenger and freight.</jats:p>",

However, although a sense of urgency was present in many delegates individually, the conference proceeded with its usual diplomatic ritual at an almost surrealistic slow pace, apparently unaffected by time pressure. While it did see some progress on important issues for developing countries such as the Adaptation Fund, the Nairobi Work Programme on Impacts, Vulnerability, and Adaptation to Climate Change, and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), on questions regarding the future of the regime it proved to be at best a confidence-building session that served to hear further views.

(i)<jats:italic>The experimental analysis</jats:italic>: the barrel temperature, injection pressure, and flow rate are factors for powder injection moulding (PIM). Powder-binder mixture used as feedstock in PIM requires a little more attention and sensitivity. Obtaining the balance among pressure, temperature, and especially flow rate is the most important aspect of undesirable conclusions such as powder-binder separation, sink marks, and cracks in moulded party structure. In this study, available feedstocks used in PIM were injected in three different cavities which consist of zigzag form, constant cross-section, and stair form (in five different thicknesses) and their mouldability is measured. Because of the difference between material and binder, measured lengths were different. These were measured as 533 mm, 268 mm, 211 mm, and 150 mm in advanced materials trade marks Fe–2Ni, BASF firm Catamould A0-F, FN02, and 316L stainless steel, respectively. (ii)<jats:italic>The theoretical analysis</jats:italic>: the use of artificial neural network (ANN) has been proposed to determine the mouldability for feedstocks used in powder injection moulding using results of experimental analysis. The back-propagation learning algorithm with two different variants and logistic sigmoid transfer function were used in the network. In order to train the neural network, limited experimental measurements were used as training and test data. The best fitting training data set was obtained with three and four neurons in the hidden layer, which made it possible to predict yield length with accuracy at least as good as that of the experimental error, over the whole experimental range. After training, it was found that the<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"E1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math>values are 0.999463, 0.999445, 0.999574, and 0.999593 for Fe–2Ni, BASF firm Catamould A0-F, FN02, and 316L stainless steel, respectively. Similarly, these values for testing data are 0.999129, 0.999666, 0.998612, and 0.997512, respectively. As seen from the results of mathematical modeling, the calculated yield lengths are obviously within acceptable uncertainties.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A geographic information system (GIS) framework is appealing to model supply-side decisions because spatial relationships commonly used by developers to evaluate building sites, such as the proximity to transportation facilities, existing land uses, political boundaries, and environmentally sensitive areas, are defined precisely in the GIS layers. The GIS captures spatial synergisms that are lost in tabulations by traffic zone or larger forecasting districts. Further, the results are defined for individual parcels (grids). This method interfaces directly with the concerns of residents and other interest groups. Uncertainty and error in postmodel allocations from zones to parcels in existing land use models can significantly blur and degrade the relevance of forecasts made with existing models. The development patterns predicted by UPlan, a planning model, tend to be realistic and provide a basis for land use planning and evaluation. A GIS land use survey, supplemented with simulation model networks and census data, was used to calibrate the model. The calibrated UPlan model did a reasonably accurate job of allocating the various categories of land uses to predefined composite growth areas. The generalized UPlan model is applicable in a wide variety of rural, suburban, and urban settings. The model, as presented, was configured as a travel simulation integrated land use planning tool, but the method also can be used as the supply-side component within a comprehensive land use modeling framework. </jats:p>",

It was developed in response to safety-related provisions of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) of 1998, which required explicit consideration of safety in the transportation planning process. The problem of using accident rates in transportation planning is revisited, and a case history of applying safety-conscious planning methods by the Colorado Department of Transportation is reviewed. A two-phase process that has been used to evaluate the safety impacts of multiple design alternatives is introduced. The evaluation process is based on the available safety performance functions calibrated specifically for urban freeways in concert with diagnostic investigations, pattern recognition analysis, and detailed accident diagramming. The critical importance of accident diagramming is discussed in reference to examining safety history at complex interchange locations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The configuration, evaluation and selection of technology chains are some of the most critical tasks, regarding the determination of optimal product and production costs. Nonetheless, these process planning tasks are often still performed in a sequential way and are only unsatisfactorily considered within the process of product development. This paper presents a methodology to overcome these shortcomings, using an integrated configuration and evaluation of technology chains. Its implementation with a standard ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) System is shown. Basically, the proposed methodology consists of three components. The first one is a product-technology-matrix that specifies the correlations between a company’s products and its available or projected technologies. The second component is a modular generic technology chain model that enables a classification of technologies. A combined quantitative and qualitative evaluation model to calculate and compare different technology chains completes the proposed methodology. These three elements facilitate an appropriate knowledge management concerning products, technologies and their relations. Additionally, a fast configuration of alternative technology chains and a selection of the most adequate ones for newly designed products are addressed, reducing the time of planning processes by almost one quarter. The implementation of the methodology using a standard ERP system is illustrated by two representative use cases.</jats:p>",

In the present study, the extent to which goal clarity and financial planning activities predict retirement savings practices was examined among 100 working adults. Path analysis techniques were used to test two competing models, both of which were designed to predict savings contributions. Findings provide support for the model in which retirement goal clarity is a significant predictor of planning practices, and planning, in turn, predicts savings tendencies. Two demographic variables—income and age—were also revealed to be important elements of the model, with income accounting for roughly half of the explained variance in savings contributions. The results of this study have implications for the development of age-based models of planning, as well as implications for retirement counselors and financial planners who advise workers on long-term saving strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As congestion levels have grown on both urban and intercity highway routes, state and regional transportation planners are starting to look more broadly at alternatives that can hold down or reduce traffic growth. Planners have long considered modal diversion from road to rail for passenger travel, but less attention has been given to opportunities for modal shifting of freight as a means of addressing roadway traffic. Yet it is becoming increasingly clear that railroads can offer a potentially viable alternative to trucking in some situations. This alternative becomes of particular interest when expanded use of rail freight can reduce either existing traffic congestion levels or the need for expanding highway capacity in the future. This paper summarizes findings from NCHRP Project 8–42, which examined the feasibility and value of rail freight solutions as a means of reducing highway congestion, and these solutions’ implications for public planning. It defines the range of rail freight strategies that can be applied to mitigate the growth of traffic congestion and discusses the types of situations in which they can be most relevant. It describes the economic and institutional factors affecting the feasibility of diverting some truck freight to rail, and it lays out a structural framework for evaluating the relative benefits of these options. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Wasatch Choices 2040 was a partnership between Envision Utah and the two major metropolitan planning organizations along Utah's Wasatch Front. The purpose of the partnership was to involve the public through a scenario planning process and to consider the role of land use in developing the region's long-range transportation plan. Through 13 public workshops and 5 open houses held in 2005, members of the public expressed their preferences for transportation and land use in their communities. The input from the public informed the development of regional growth principles that have since been adopted by elected officials and will guide transportation and land use decisions in Wasatch Front communities. In addition, results from the public process were used to create four regional transportation and land use scenarios that ultimately led to the creation of a regional vision. Each scenario was tested by using the CentreSim forecasting model, and a vision scenario was created to depict one version of how the Wasatch Front could develop if guided by regional growth principles. Modeling of the regional vision demonstrates that it performs significantly better than the existing long-range plan for several quality-of-life measures, including traffic congestion. This process proved groundbreaking by reminding both land use and transportation professionals that futures cannot be planned in isolation. Transportation affects land use just as much as land use affects transportation. It is a circular relationship that must be accounted for. This process focuses on bringing all interests to the table concurrently to plan for a better future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban transportation planning has traditionally focused on capacity and congestion issues with some attention paid to operation and management and with the treatment of such issues typically made proactively. In contrast, road safety has received little attention in the planning process. Safety-conscious planning is a new proactive approach that incorporates safety issues into the transportation planning process. This approach requires a safety planning decision-support tool to facilitate a proactive approach to the assessment of safety implications of alternative network planning initiatives and scenarios. The objective of this research study is to develop a series of zonal-level collision prediction models that are consistent with conventional models commonly used for urban transportation planning. A generalized linear regression modeling approach with the assumption of a negative binomial error structure was employed for exploring relationships between collision frequency in a planning zone and some explanatory variables such as traffic intensity, socioeconomic and demographic factors, land use, and traffic demand measures. Planning-level safety models developed in this study with data for the city of Toronto, Canada, are presented with illustrative applications of how they can be used as decision-support tools for planners to explicitly consider safety in the transportation planning process. Macrolevel collision modification factors are presented to illustrate how the models can be used to examine the impact of each individual planning variable on the safety of an urban zone. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In most transport planning studies, one of the first steps is the definition of a zoning scheme into which the study area is divided and the corresponding space is discretized. There are no clear rules on how to carry out this operation in an optimal way, and the dominating practice is to proceed on the basis of experience, trying to mix a certain degree of within-zone homogeneity and the convenience of using administrative borders as zone limits. The potential errors generated with this operation were examined, both at the statistical level when trip matrices are based on sampling and at the geographical level when all trips starting or ending in a zone are assumed to do so at its centroid. A set of quality criteria for a general zoning scheme and an algorithm that constructs a basic zoning on the basis of a sample of geo-referenced trip extreme points and improves it in successive steps according to those criteria are presented. A case study based on the mobility survey for the Lisbon, Portugal, metropolitan area illustrates those steps and the improvements achieved in each step. The magnitude of those improvements is significant and shows that more attention should definitely be given to this initial process in the transport planning studies. </jats:p>",

The Tower of London (ToL), a task specifically devised to test executive functions of visuospatial planning and problem solving, has frequently been used in neuropsychological experiments, but rarely in the clinical ground. &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt; One hundred and sixty-one AD patients and 212 nondemented healthy controls were administered a simplified ToL version. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; AD patients were significantly impaired (p &lt; 0.0001) in all ToL scores and in the total execution time. The ‘accuracy’ score of ToL at a cut off of ≤29/36 yielded a sensitivity of 71.2% and a specificity of 76.4% (AUC 0.79) for the diagnosis of AD versus controls. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Visuospatial planning and problem solving are significantly impaired in early dementia of the Alzheimer’s type.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Maintaining gravel roads to an acceptable level with increasing traffic volumes and social and environmental needs on the one hand and decreasing budgets and availability of suitable material on the other hand requires innovation and long-term strategic planning to keep agency and road user costs as low as possible. These conditions were identified in the Overberg District of Western Cape Province in South Africa, where a huge backlog for regravelling of roads has developed because of limited funding and difficulties in obtaining suitable materials. District municipalities act as agents to the provincial government and are therefore responsible for the maintenance of provincial roads within their regions. The average gravel thickness of the gravel wearing course on divisional and main roads in Western Cape Province has dropped from more than 80 mm to less than 40 mm in the past 10 years. Intense involvement in the Overberg District Municipality (DM) with gravel road maintenance, upgrading, performance monitoring, the finding of suitable road-building materials, and approval for mining has led to the realization that existing strategies for gravel road maintenance are inadequate to deliver acceptable service to the road user and to ensure that available material sources are optimally used. From an evaluation of needs and constraints within the DM, several factors have been identified as important contributors in the long-term planning of road maintenance and material utilization. This resulted in (a) a subdivision of the area as based on material availability, land use, topography, climate, and so forth; (b) identification of life-cycle maintenance strategy categories; (c) alternative approaches for material source selection and longer-term usage; and (d) the introduction of initiatives that help to reduce material demand. The approach followed to optimize both material sources and service delivery to the road user and preservation of the environment is discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The challenges of maintaining traffic throughout the construction of a multibillion-dollar transportation improvement are immense. Managers are tasked with leading major construction efforts and implementing crucial traffic switches predominately during summer months when Interstate traffic volumes are typically higher than average. Traffic switches have many potential negative outcomes, including extensive vehicle queues and delays, safety concerns, and negative public perception. High expectations were rooted in the $2.4 billion Woodrow Wilson Bridge (WWB) project well before the record of decision. Input by elected officials and the public began over 10 years ago and continues today as project managers handle nearly 200,000 vehicles daily along Interstate 95 through the work zone near Washington, D.C. The new WWB was designed as a signature bridge near historic Alexandria, Virginia, and was the focus of high expectations from stakeholders. Keeping elected officials abreast of upcoming construction and traffic impacts, staying in touch with the affected communities, and maintaining positive public perception are vital to maintaining the on-time and on-budget status of this megaproject. The high point in meeting these expectations was best demonstrated during the traffic switch to open the new bridge during the summer of 2006. The switch involved the coordination of several government agencies, management of multiple contractors across jurisdictional lines, traffic analyses before and after the switch, extensive public outreach coordination, and traffic switch monitoring. Management of these efforts provided accurate expectations to project staff, media, and motorists before, during, and after the traffic switch. </jats:p>",

The MnPASS lanes were opened by the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) after a decade of study, outreach, and education that garnered political and community support for a demonstration project on value pricing in the state. Mn/DOT staff and their project partners faced new challenges when the Minnesota governor and legislature authorized the adaptation of the I-394 high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes to HOT lanes, and Mn/DOT leadership sought to implement the project as soon as possible. Without any existing toll roads in Minnesota, the team faced the challenge of delivering a project that was both publicly and politically supportable and technically sound.

This study analysed the spatial and temporal pattern of land use/land cover change in the Camili forest planning unit that includes  the Camili Biosphere Reserve Area within the Caucasian hotspot, in the northeast corner of Turkey. To assess the patterns during a 33‐year period, the necessary data were obtained from forest stand maps and evaluated with Geographic Information Systems and FRAGSTATS. Results showed that the total forested areas increased from 19 946·5 ha (78·6% of the study area) in 1972 to 20 797·3 ha (81·9 per cent) in 2005 with a slight net increase of 851 ha. Softwood cover types (411·8 ha) completely transitioned to other cover types over 33‐year period. In terms of spatial configuration, the total number of forest fragments increased from 172 to 608, and mean size of forest patch (MPS) decreased from 147·7 ha to 41·8 ha during the period. Nearly 84 per cent of the patches in 1972 and 93 per cent of them in 2005 generally seem to concentrate into 0–100 ha patch size class, indicating more fragmented landscape over time that might create a risk for the maintenance of biodiversity of the area. There were apparent trends in the temporal structure of forest landscape, some of which may issue from mismanagement of the area, social conflict, and illegal utilization of forest resources due to ineffective forest protection measurements. The study revealed that it is important to understand both spatial and temporal changes of land use/land cover and their effects on landscape pattern to disclose the implications for land use planning and management.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information and experiences about accelerated or fast-track portland cement concrete (PCC) paving projects from the airport pavement industry are presented. The focus is on steps that can be taken during the planning phase to accelerate airfield PCC paving projects; the presentation is based on detailed case studies that were developed under an Innovative Pavement Research Foundation project. These case studies were developed from an extensive list of accelerated projects compiled from sources within the airfield paving industry, including contractors, designers, owners, and industry representatives. The key to applying accelerated paving techniques for rigid pavements lies in understanding the available strategies and in knowing when and how these strategies should be applied. A range of materials is available for accelerating pavement opening times, which is most often thought of as accelerated paving. However, beyond the simple selection of appropriate materials, many other strategies can accelerate an airfield PCC paving or repair project, including thorough planning and coordination of project activities, considering procurement and contract factors, and application of appropriate phasing and scheduling techniques during the project planning phase. Strategies addressing design, construction, and ancillary issues are included in the Accelerated Practices for Airfield Concrete Pavement Construction final documents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines how the environmental management system (EMS) at departments of transportation (DOTs) has evolved and provides examples of recent developments and practices that other DOTs can consider and use as a source in an evolving EMS. A number of practical insights can be gained by examining EMS experiences at several DOTs. Generally, the EMSs that have delivered benefits have had successful mechanisms for monitoring effectiveness, incorporating lessons learned, and managing continual improvement. They have relied tactically on what exists already, are geared toward the organization's mission, and seek to support success in nonenvironmental areas. They build on vigorous environmental programs, have procedures that can be integrated as much as possible into current routine practices, and strive to demystify environmental compliance for both DOT and contractor personnel. DOTs in the vanguard have focused on increased compliance assurance and cost-effectiveness, adoption and development of best management practices and sustainability practices, enhanced land and resource use planning and management, accelerating and streamlining the project delivery processes, and improved intergovernmental relationships and stakeholder confidence. Challenges commonly include coping with the demands of intensive up-front effort with limited staff time, realistically quantifying resource requirements, and establishing straightforward metrics for monitoring. Effective management has been enhanced in some cases by using information technology tools, which facilitate the flow of environmental information; tracking metrics; tracking project schedules, budgets, and personnel; communicating corporate knowledge; analyzing impacts; and using geo-references for planning stage decision making. </jats:p>",
