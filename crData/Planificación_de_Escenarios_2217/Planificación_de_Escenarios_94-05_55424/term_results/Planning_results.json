For many operators there is a notional idea that when you are finished with an offshore production facility and structural steel jackets, they merely sails away over the horizon never to be seen or heard of again, but the real world dictates otherwise.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>For those that operate today in the Northern North Sea there is perhaps a uniqueness in character related to the design, fabrication, installation and operation of these Northern North Sea offshore production facilities. Approaching now for many the reality of abandonment, removal and disposal of these facilities, the oil and gas industries must now also recognise that unique methodology requires to be developed for implementation to overcome this daunting task of abandonment. Innovative and lateral thinking being employed by those companies and individuals who have risen to take up the challenge to achieve the goals and objectives, developing the ultimate solution to this enormous problem facing the oil and gas industry today.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Many common aspects and activities exist for operators to undertake jointly during the planning, engineering and the various implementation stages for this ultimate episode in field life.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\"GOING WHERE NO OTHER HAS GONEBEFORE\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Commendable words of introduction one might say! but how does one go about this planning exercise, being creative and having lateral thinking, receive participation from other operators within this industry to achieve a:</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\" SAFE AND COST EFFECTIVE DISPOSITION FOR SUCH A FACILITY\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The Oil and Gas industry until now has been rather slow and reluctant to respond to the idea that abandonment is right around the corner. A question that has been so prevalent in recent days, \"WHY PLAN\"?</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>\"Just because I never lead the industry in such circumstances, does not mean I am not responsible for planning them all well\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A deliberate Abandonment Plan is the most essential tool that must be developed at the outset of the abandonment project, ensuring that you have defined clearly your goals and objectives to produce a safe and cost effective disposition for the offshore production facilities and structural steel jacket. Planning allows for abandonment projects to :-Set out the strategy, philosophy, goals and objectives for the abandonment programme.Identify the requirements of the various legislation that must be adhered too.Identify the potential hazards, safety and environmental issues to be resolved.Identify the cost drivers.Communicate to your management the magnitude of the potential problems that must be overcome.Communicate to the relevant government departments the prospective options under consideration and the potential consequences</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Planning may be half the effort required to accomplish the goals and the objectives of the abandonment project, but it is only a fraction of the ultimate cost. Through careful and detailed planning exercises an opportunity exists to save millions of pounds that could be better invested in the development of new oil and gas fields.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

This paper will discuss the tools, technology and operational aspects of drilling an unconventional large-diameter short radius drain hole in competent formation and in an extremely deep water environment. Several world records were established and horizontal drilling technology milestones were achieved during the drilling of a drain hole by AGIP in the southern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Albania. Aquila 2, the name of this well, is the first short radius drain hole drilled from a semi-submersible rig. The well was drilled in 830m water depth, which is a world record for any kind of horizontal well. The drain was built to horizontal at 3953m TVD and achieved a horizontal displacement of 200m drilled in fractured limestone. A newly designed 6-1/2\" OD, field adjustable, short radius drilling system, incorporating a near bit inclination sensor and a short radius MWD tool was used in the project and achieved a radius of curvature of 30m in 8-3/8\" borehole.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Besides these technological achievements this project involved reservoir characterization, evaluation of the formation petrophysical properties and production performances from the appraisal well. Taken together, these efforts make the project a uniquely, multi-disciplined endeavor.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Encouraging production rates were achieved during an 85-day, Long Production Test (LPT) which will be used in planning and implementation of future activity in the basin.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The Aquila field/structure is located in the southern Adriatic Sea between Italy and Albania, approximately 45 km east of the Italian city of Brindisi, in 830m water depth. Hydrocarbon potential in the area was appraised since the late seventies. In particular, exploration wells showed the importance of the Scaglia Limestone as a reservoir.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data from the reference wells indicated that the most suitable zone for further investigation was the top 50m of the fractured Scaglia Limestone. However, due to substantially higher pore pressures above, and the fractured nature of the zone of interest, it was necessary to plan any future activity with a 9-5/8\" casing shoe set at the very top of the Scaglia. Drilling without severe losses cuuld then proceed in 8-1/2\" or 8-3/8\" hole size.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Data from reservoir engineering studies indicated that a 150m to 200m horizontal drain drilled perpendicular to the fracture system would be necessary for a meaningful long production test (LPT). To enable intersection of the top 50m of the Scaglia with an 8-1/2\" or 8-3/6\" horizontal drain, it became necessary to design a short radius drilling system that would allow kick-off below the 9-5/8\" casing shoe and build angle so that no more than 35m of True Vertical Depth (TVD) was consumed prior to achieving 90 degrees of hole inclination.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A 6-1/2\" OD, field adjustable, short radius drilling system along with the associated measuring instrumentation (MWD) was designed and tested prior to being applied in the Aquila 2 wellbore.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Aquila 2 was subsequently planned and drilled utilizing the semi-submersible drilling rig, Reading &amp; Bates \"Jack Bates\".</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

In other words, \"What is the most cost effective manpower level?\", and \"What is the most effcient way to organize this staff?\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The approach used BOTH qualitative and quantitative analyses to assess organizational alternatives and to determine optimum manpower levels. Since its implementation, the methodology applied in this case has brought significant operations improvement and reduction in total major cash spent.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INTRODUCTION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In recent year our industry has been challenged by the need for cost reduction and \"right-sizing\"(usually synonymous with \"down-sizing\") Many drilling groups have been impacted by organizational and manpower changes, and they will continue to revisit these complex issues in the future. As we strive to provide effective drilling results, which are a pivotal lever in the full-cycle economics of the exploration and production system, we must assess the organization design alternatives in terms of their relative monetary impacts.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In the case study, a multi-disciplinary task group was formed to develop methodologies to both qualitatively and quantitatively assess the monetary impact of several drilling staff organizations.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This study used a systems approach to establish causal relationships between engineering effort and its monetary impact, by laying out the entire analysis in small logical steps. in this way, we more easily pinpointed the real cause of any problems and all steps were open to full review and to modification by management and staff.

When the study's most successful respondents — those that had generated at least 20 to 25 percent of their revenues from new products — defined their total portfolio of products that had been launched over a five‐year time period, 39 percent of these new products were either new to the world or new to the company.

In diesem Beitrag wird versucht, ein verhaltenstheoretisches Konzept zu entwickeln, das von verschiedenen Grundmerkmalen ausgeht (individuelle Lebensstile, Organisationsmuster der städtischen Gesellschaft, Eigenschaften städtischer baulicher Strukturen). Urbanität wird definiert als Erlebnisinhalte (Lebensgefühle), welche Outputs von städtischen Aktivitätenmustern bilden und deren Intensität von der Existenz spezieller Raumstrukturen abhängt. Aus der genaueren Analyse dieses „Produktionsapparates“ werden Strategien zur Planung von Urbanität abgeleitet.</jats:p>"

It is suggested that technical change in key service industries caused an upsurge in building demand from the mid-1970s onwards. Shifts in employment patterns then generated repercussions in housing markets. The classic conditions were created for a ‘Kuznets style’ building cycle. The detailed effects of these changes in specific countries depended on the responses by agents involved in the process of building provision, which in turn were affected by the changing economic and institutional contexts that they faced. Property development, financial liberation, housing markets, property taxation, and land-use planning are all considered in this context, with examples drawn from several countries. </jats:p>",

It is argued that property must be viewed as a commodity with use-value and exchange-value aspects. Property has been affected by two developments in the 1980s: the shift to services (especially financial services) and waves of deregulation. The increase in demand during the 1980s boom stemmed both from investors such as property companies and from end users, especially those engaged in or expanding into securities business following Big Bang. As property markets, including the housing retail finance circuit, became increasingly intertwined with wholesale financial markets they became more susceptible to the vicissitudes of these markets and tendencies toward crisis. The exchange value of property became disengaged from its use value as property took on the attributes of a quasi-financial asset. </jats:p>",

Since the carrying costs increase from stage to stage, the standard production procedure, that is, to determine a total leadtime for the entire order by taking an appropriate percentile of the distribution of total processing time and then release the order immediately from stage to stage during the process, may not be optimal since it ignores inventory carrying costs. This article studies a per stage planned leadtime dispatching policy for such systems. The order will not be released immediately to the next workstation prior to a predetermined delivery time, or planned leadtime. The vector of planned leadtimes at workstations is to be determined by trading off expected holding costs at all stages and expected penalty costs for exceeding the total planned leadtime. We show that the optimal vector of planned leadtimes may be obtained efficiently by solving an equivalent serial inventory model of the type considered in Clark and Scarf (1960). </jats:p>",

Design review, narrowly conceived, is one of the formal mechanisms within the broader context of this social discourse. In this conception, the impact of design review on the physical environment is direct and immediate but specific and limited in scope. Altematively, it can also be considered as a generic process encompassing any or all instances of collective and critical reflection on design issues. These diverse processes may appear to lack coherence, but they have a much more fundamental and lasting effect because they shape the tacit assumptions and beliefs underlying our more direct actions. Here the broader context of design review will be considered. Following a discussion of the spatial scene, the evolution of three constructs during the past three decades-place, sustainability, and participation-into full-blown paradigms is summarized. It is shown that the three together are converging into a worldview that is taking hold globally. This emerging worldview, then, provides the grounds and the backing for substantive and procedural discussion of planning and design review. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Research on the changing geography of metropolitan corporate headquarters (CH) influence has pointed to a decrease in importance for national centers and an increase in the importance of regional centers throughout the country. Theoretical explanations of this change have posited a linear evolutionary sequence from spatial and hierarchical concentration to dispersal. In this paper, the nature of change in metropolitan CH influence between 1974 and 1989 is examined, with a focus on three aspects of this process. First, the detailed sequence of dispersal within types of metropolitan region is explored. Second, the issue of how metropolitan CH influence changes over space is examined. Third, the impact of the recent restructuring of the US economy on metropolitan corporate influence is investigated. The results suggest that the linear evolutionary sequence model needs some modification. The major proportional shifts in CH influence are from New York to a select set of diversified regional centers that may be emerging as national centers in their own right. Dispersion of CH influence is not simply a matter of shifts from one level of the hierarchy to another, rather it is the outcome of a continuous struggle by existing and new corporations in metropolises among and within all levels of the hierarchy to capture new growth opportunities as older opportunities decline. Finally, the impact of restructuring was twofold. Among some metropolitan regions dominated by sectors that declined during the period 1974–89 the consequences were a dramatic decrease in influence. The CHs of the new growth sectors were concentrated among national centers and hence contributed to increased influence at the apex of the hierarchy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a conceptual model of the individual decision to telecommute is presented. Key elements of that decision, including constraints, facilitators, and drives, are defined and the relationships among them described. The major types of constraints (if negative) or facilitators (if positive) include external factors related to awareness, the organization, and the job, and internal psychosocial factors. The major types of drives are work, family, leisure, ideology, and travel. It is argued that the absence of constraints is a necessary but not sufficient condition for telecommuting to be adopted by an individual. The presence of one or more drives, assumed to be associated with some dissatisfaction, is necessary to activate the search for a solution to that dissatisfaction. </jats:p><jats:p> The choice set contains those alternative solutions perceived to be feasible by the individual. It may or may not contain telecommuting (depending on whether all constraints are nonbinding or not), and probably contains other alternatives having nothing to do with telecommuting. Each alternative is evaluated in terms of how effectively it satisfies the drive, and the individual's attitudes toward it. The alternative (or bundle of alternatives) which maximizes individual utility becomes the preferred behavioral pattern. However, short-term constraints may prevent the preferred behavior from being chosen. The process is a dynamic one, in which previous choices affect attitudes and constraints and alter drives. Work directed by the authors is under way to operationalize the conceptual model. </jats:p>",

The investigation is focused specifically on the building boom of the 1980s, as that expansion has been the focus of recent theoretical and empirical work centered on the relation between urbanization and the restructuring of capital. Little support was found for the claim that capital switching has occurred, but the data do point to a delinking of real-estate investment from nonspeculative investment criteria and use-value considerations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper it is argued that more attention should be paid to the role of supply-side factors in accounting for the spatiotemporal evolution of urban office building cycles, particularly during the recent boom of the 1980s. Urban office building dynamics are critically related to changes in the structure and operation of finance capital, the development industry, and state intervention; changes which in turn are related to shorter term macroeconomic fluctuations and longer waves of economic and political restructuring at different geographic scales. A comparative analysis of the timing, periodicity, and magnitude of booms and slumps in downtown office construction activity between 1963 and 1986 in major metropolitan areas of the United States reveals a convergence in the timing of booms and slumps in downtown office construction between individual cities and on the national trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and a persistence of important differences in the relative volume of downtown office construction between cities. The convergence in timing can be traced to an increased degree of national and international integration of capital markets and the development industry, and the increased flow of capital into commercial real estate. Analysis of interurban differences in the volume of building activity suggest ways in which powerful international and national trends are mediated by locality-specific local economic and political structures and conditions. </jats:p>",

Using the interdependent data analysis (IDA) technique, a way is shown to provide the probability estimates necessary for the influence diagram. The IDA technique allows the use of expert opinions and intuitive judgements to develop the necessary probability estimates. A sample case study is presented where the issue of environmental impact from stack emissions is incorporated.

Mehrbetriebsunternehmen greifen bei Forschungs- und Entwicklungs-(FuE-)Aktivitäten eher auf internes Unternehmens-Know-how zurück, Einbetriebsunternehmen eher auf persönliche Kontakte zu Kunden, Zulieferern und Konkurrenten. Die Kunden sind vornehmlich außerhalb der Region lokalisiert, die Zulieferer in der Region. Trotz knapper finanzieller und personeller FuE-Ressourcen nutzen die KMU des Bodenseeraums und des Elsaß das Informationsangebot der Vielzahl von Forschungseinrichtungen, Transfer- oder Beratungsstellen in der Region nur wenig.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Study of the initial stages of HIV transmission along a ‘sociogeographic network’—a large, complex, spatially focused social network with possibly fractal geometry—is extended to include interaction between a low-dimensional ghettoized ‘core group’ within which the disease spreads very rapidly and a higher dimensional, more loosely structured ‘general population’ in which spread is relatively slow. A mathematical modeling exercise suggests that contextually modulated interaction between them can be highly nonlinear and may greatly increase the initial rate of disease transmission within the general population. This work contributes to a growing body of literature which suggests that programs to control HIV infection within the majority heterosexual population of the United States will fail spectacularly without particular focus on the coupled physical and social stabilization and rehabilitation of the urban ghettoes of marginalized populations which are the present, and rapidly expanding, disease epicenters. Evidence suggests their continued disintegration can both increase disease rates within the epicenters and increase the coupling between core groups and general populations by creating large numbers of spatially or economically displaced refugees. </jats:p>",

Seventy‐three Fallopian tubes were available for examination, of which 72 (98.6%) were successfully cannulated. Sixty‐eight ampullas were successfully visualized (94.4%). The mean duration of the examination was 24.7 minutes. Where proximal tubal disease was not suspected, 30.3% of oviducts were found to have a proximal lesion and 57.5% were found to have distal intratubal disease. Management was changed in 24 women (61.5%) on the basis of Falloposcopic information. These data demonstrate the clinical value of Falloposcopy.</jats:p>",
