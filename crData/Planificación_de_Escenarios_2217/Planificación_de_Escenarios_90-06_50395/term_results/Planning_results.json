Nurses, particularly in the critical care unit, frequently and closely support a patient and family through new and often difficult situations during hospitalization. The patient leaving the hospital with a new tracheostomy will face problems with secretion management, increased risk of infections, alterations in body image, and impaired vocalization. To ensure a safe transition from the hospital to home, the patient and family must demonstrate competence in all aspects of tracheostomy care, must be able to recognize signs and symptoms that should be reported to the physician, and must have adequate support at home (such as homecare nurses, properly functioning equipment, and access to necessary supplies). These \"musts\" form the basis of the discharge care plan. Nurses can help a patient successfully manage these problems through comprehensive discharge planning. Although the critical care nurses who initiate the multidisciplinary discharge planning process may not remain involved in that process throughout the patient's hospitalization, their early efforts can provide an orderly, comprehensive discharge plan optimally suited to ensure that the patient and family acquire the necessary skills, confidence, supplies, and support for the eventual transition home. The information, encouragement, skills demonstrations, and referrals to other resources that critical care nurses provide help the patient adjust to a new tracheostomy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This application paper shows how bankers who are planning to operate a local electronic funds transfer (EFT) network can use simulation and an expert system to improve their EFT decisions. The key to making good EFT decisions is understanding the tradeoffs between the costs and performance of different network possibilities. Being able to explore network choices in light of a bank's service and profit goals, prior to the actual commitment of resources, is essential to that understanding. However, there are no published EFT studies which attempt to combine both technical and economic con cerns, particularly the representation of intangible benefits and costs, in a single methodology. The simulation process de scribed here illustrates a computer model that approximates the performance and economics of alternative local EFT designs. Expert system technology is incorporated to give bankers the convenience of interacting with the model in a natural language format. It should be noted that the work described here is based on the author's current research and ongoing model development for client banks. Every attempt is made to be as informative as possible without breaching confidentiality. </jats:p>",

Although there are substantial differences in their positions, together they form the basis for elaborationg a depth hermeneutics which deploys the opposing attitudes of explanation and understanding into a comprehensive interpretive methodology. Thompson has set out a three-phase procedure which collectively constitute a depth hermeneutics. In the second section, these three phases and the way in which this method was applied in a field study of Somerset dairy farmers are described. It is shown that farmers' experience is both spatially and temporally organised through language. By means of examples from this analysis, it is suggested that Thompson's depth hermeneutic procedure may help one appreciate the way in which structures are reproduced through people's everyday (inter)actions. The paper concludes with an exploration of the implications for a critical human geography. </jats:p>",

The recent branch plant industrialization of Malaysia exemplifies a program of statist capitalism intended, among other things, to resolve internal political and social crises. Malaysia's New Economic Policy (NEP) encourages industrial investment in large-scale labor-intensive enterprises as a principal means of providing jobs for the urban poor while bolstering the economy in general. Although the NEP purportedly strives to achieve racial integration and equality at the modern industrial workplace, data from a rapidly urbanizing area suggest that the reality is one of increasing spatial and structural segregation of groups among various large and small-scale activities. The restructured local economy, on the one hand, conserves established sectors dominated by Chinese capital and labor, while, on the other hand, mobilizing migrant Malay labor for employment by large foreign-owned factories. </jats:p>",

Rather than distances being input as data into the analysis, however, the model is inverted to extract the implied distances embedded in the commuting flows.

Behavioural distances are found to outperform physical distances in the analysis of migration flows in the region. </jats:p>",

In this paper we study the problem of gaining a secure and enveloping grasp of a two-dimensional object by exploiting sliding at the contacts between the object and the hand. This is done in two steps:first, choosing an initial grasp with which the object can be manipulated away from the support, and second, continuously altering the grasp so that envelopment is achieved. The plans generated by our technique could be executed with only position control. How ever, it would be prudent to incorporate contact force sensing to prevent damage during unexpected events. </jats:p><jats:p> The main contributions of this paper are the derivation of liftability regions of a planar object for use in manipulation planning; the use of the lifting phase plane in manipulation planning; and the derivation of the quasi-static forward object motion problem, which provides a basis for general three- dimensional manipulation planning with rolling and/or sliding contacts. </jats:p>",

This myth is challenged by reviewing the role of the state in the financing of medical care. The Bismarkian model of medical-care financing is reexamined through the theoretical insights derived from bureaucratic authoritarianism. State concessions to the labor force in the form of medical-care benefits are now less crucial to labor's relationship with the state than they have been at any other time in the postwar period, and they remain independent of whether the military remain in power. Comparative aspects of medical-care financing, industrialization policies, and state–labor relations indicate that structural constraints—in the form of securing export-product niches, labor costs, and the threat of military intervention—have cast medical-care benefits in a relatively inferior position when the labor force bargains with management or with the state. Deindustrialization has forced thousands of workers into jobs that lack the comprehensive medical benefits that once characterized the traditional industrial sector. The welfare-state concept has given way to a new ideology that emphasizes individual choices in life-style and encourages medical-program affiliation according to income levels. </jats:p>",

Ostensibly, reserves were established to protect African-held land from encroachment by European settlers. However, it is apparent that there was a deeper motive: spatial segregation was part of a strategy of indirect rule and thereby lowered the cost to the state of social control. Furthermore, officials soon learned that by altering the size and pattern of reserves, aims of changing African society could be pursued by limiting land availability and forcing change in African land-use and trading patterns. The manipulation of space became one of the most important tools of colonial control and social policy. </jats:p>",

This research is an attempt to explore the relationship between these two aspects of IS. It analyzes, in an empirical setting, the contingent nature of some IS planning‐related variables in the context of the strategic relevance of an organization's IS. The basis for the empirical test is the IS strategic grid framework developed by Cash, McFarlan, McKenney, and Vitale [6]. A questionnaire survey method is employed to elicit information on the strategic orientation of IS and IS planning issues within respondent organizations. The difference in emphasis on various planning aspects in organizations with different IS environments is analyzed. Results of the analysis indicate that there is empirical support for the strategic grid framework and that there are differences in planning aspects among organizations, depending on their location in the grid. The implications of these findings for IS and IS planning are then discussed.</jats:p>",

It is found that local need and local political orientation have little bearing on local success in obtaining discretionary concessions over rules, allocation, and reporting of such funds. On the contrary, local actors are valued for their ability to circumvent national guidelines, often with the assistance of intermediate-level officials. Administrators are rewarded for their skills in exploiting national grants for local purposes and in interpreting complex rules to fit local preferences. Politicians tend to see themselves as troubleshooters, but generally prefer not to become involved in local social assistance problems. The results show that, despite efforts to cut back social spending, an important reservoir of professional and administrative talent exists at the local level which has probably helped preserve local social services during a period of cutbacks. In more prosperous times, these same persons will be poised to revive the surge of local social spending seen in the early 1970s and thereby extend the institutional intricacy of welfare states. </jats:p>",

This argument relies upon a theory of the state which preserves state autonomy, but which allows that outcomes, such as the Location, are the result of a variety of processes, including economic conflict. State territorial strategies abound both in the South African context and in the more general colonial context, and thus, in this paper I put forward a wide-ranging research agenda around the themes of the colonial or racial state, territoriality, and power-themes which have hitherto received little attention. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two major questions to which public policy analysis has been addressed concern the relative influence of economic and political factors upon governmental policy, and the degree of linkage between government spending and the policy outcomes produced by these outlays. These questions are examined with data on health care policy in Yugoslav local governments (communes). A causal model is constructed to estimate the relationships among five conceptual stages in the policy process: (1) socioeconomic context (regional culture and economic structure), (2) political context (liberalism and bureaucratism), (3) government spending level (health spending per capita), (4) policy outputs (hospital beds and doctors per capita), and (5) policy outcomes (percentage of births and deaths with medical attention, and infant mortality rate). The causal model shows that political determinants of policy are much more important than economic ones among Yugoslav communes. Bureaucratization and political liberalism are clearly much more important than development context in determining spending levels; and bureaucratization has by far the greatest impact on health outputs. Popular political culture, rather than economic context, furthermore, emerges as the predominant influence on health outcomes. These causal patterns also indicate the existence of substantial discontinuities among the three stages of the policy process because health spending has only a marginal influence on outputs and because outputs and outcomes are only slightly related at best. What Sharkansky calls the previous investment necessary to create bureaucratic complexes explains the first discontinuity, whereas the second results from different cultural mores about ‘health behavior’ and about interactions with governmental authorities and with the modern world in general. </jats:p>",

The robot arms and the carried object construct a 6-link closed chain. The path planning problem for the 6-link closed chain is solved by using two major algorithms: the collision-free feasible configuration finding algorithm and the collision-free path finding algorithm. The collision-free feasible configuration finding algorithm finds all collision-free feasible configurations (CFFCs) of the 6-link closed chain in each discrete interval of two joint angles. The collision-free path finding algorithm builds a connection graph by CFFCs and the transitions between any two groups of CFFCs at adjacent joint intervals. Then a graph search method is used to find a collision-free path for each joint of the robots. </jats:p>",

It is shown how the direction of the change in the limiting probabilities may be obtained from the original mean first passage matrix. The results are obtained by application of a single lemma, which expresses the effects of perturbations in a matrix on the Perron vector (that is, the eigenvector associated with the dominant eigenvalue).

Reform packages may be required at the level of the whole economy or at sector level. From the point of view of a financing agency the start of the planning process is the production of a policy document which can be called Economic Prospects and Country Programming. This sets the scene for possible programme loans and policy and institutional reform packages. Priorities are then agreed with government and a programme is identified, prepared and appraised. Practical issues include the composition of the preparation and appraisal mission teams, the programme description, the drawing up of a Matrix of Programme Policy and Institutional Outputs, the assessment of institutional capabilities in the borrowing country, the production of a List of Goods and Services, loan conditionality, the scheduling of loan disbursements, the arrangements to be made for the purchase of programme loan funds by users and the uses to be made of counterpart local funds, the procurement of goods and services and progress reporting and supervision.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Résumé: </jats:bold> Les préts du programme ont été concus pour faciliter l'adoption de réformes politiques et institutionnelles nécessaires dans le cas où un environment favorable devrait étre créé pour la réalisations de la relance é conomique, las crossiance économique soutenue et pour l'exécution réussie des projets d'investissement classiques.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> From the beginning of the early 1970s until the end of the 1980s, France developed an original style of economic regulatory policy which consisted essentially of smoothing economic shocks. This style has had several variations. This paper is an attempt to analyze these regulatory styles by comparing them with the policies followed by West Germany. The authors attempt to show that the abandonment of price controls as an instrument of economic policy, a decision taken by the Chirac government, marks the end of a unique French model of economic policy. </jats:p>",

Many of the coefficient estimates on the dwelling traits and neighborhood variables are robust, and where coefficients change there are obvious explanations. The most dramatic finding is that the distance to the CBD, with a weak but statistically significant influence in 1970, had no influence by 1980, and its declining role was paralleled by a rise in the spatial pull of several of the subcenters in the region. The tests reveal how the polycentricity of the Los Angeles region evolved during the 1970s. </jats:p>",

In a state or perfectly known world, this has been addressed using the configuration space representation and the A* search algorithm. However, when movement, changes, or unexpected obstacles occur in the environment, a new method, Differential A*, can adapt the solution to the current situation. It updates only the fraction of space that is critically affected. This technique can provide significant speed improvements, with the same desired results, compared to complete space regeneration. </jats:p>",
