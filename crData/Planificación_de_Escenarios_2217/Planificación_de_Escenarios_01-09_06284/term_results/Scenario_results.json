The Betic-Rif Internal zones derive from an exotic Alboran Terrane partly involved in a S-dipping Betic subduction during the Late Cretaceous ?-Eocene. Incipient collision of the terrane against Iberia triggered back-thrust tectonics south of the Internal mountain belt during the latest Eocene-Oligocene. A N-dipping Maghrebian subduction developed from that time up to Middle Miocene, responsible for the rifting of the internal Alboran Terrane. Docking of the extending Alboran Terrane onto the North African margin occurred during the Neogene through the closure of the Maghrebian Flysch oceanic trough, with southwestward growth of the external accretionary prism, and foredeep subsidence. Subduction zone westward roll back associated with delamination of the dense lithosphere seem to account for the Betic-Rif late orogenic evolution.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning in particular, is being used to create prediction, diagnostic, and treatment solutions for mental health care in light of the growing popularity of digital approaches to mental health. Due to their prevalence, depression and anxiety represent the two main mental health conditions that have been the subject of most digital phenotyping research.\nChatbots have been used for mental health issues since the 1990s, but their effectiveness remains unknown due to their early stages, though some early studies suggest improvement in anxiety and depression. ChatGPT and other AI platforms have potential applications in various industries, including mental health, and are rapidly expanding.\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve accessibility and reduce costs for mental health services by utilizing smartphones. With the increasing use of smartphones, AI systems can be used to diagnose mental illnesses, identify them at a prodromal stage, personalize medicines, and empower individuals in their care. However, AI must address challenges such as bias, privacy, transparency, and ethical concerns. These goals reflect human wisdom and the stronger connection between individual and community well-being than IQ. In the future, AI may develop technology that enables more empathetic and morally upstanding care for various groups, reflecting the importance of human wisdom in addressing mental health issues.\nMore work is required to bridge the gap between clinical treatment and AI in mental health research, while caution must be exercised to avoid overinterpreting early findings.</jats:p>"

Intelligent completion technology, a new concept for the oilfield, is one of the technologies that can support these needs. This well completion concept allows the operator to obtain real-time or near-real-time reservoir data, and then, to reconfigure the wellbore production/injection architecture to adapt to the information obtained.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Along with pipeline, platform, and subsea system synergies, three fields in the Gulf of Mexico — Aconcagua, Camden Hills, and King's Peak — are using intelligent completion technology to optimize a marginal reserve base. Located in Mississippi Canyon Blocks 173, 217, 305, 348 and Desoto Canyon Blocks 133 and 177 in 6200- to 7200-ft of water, the production from the three fields will be tied to the Canyon Station host platform, 55 miles from the most distant well location.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Though slight variations exist between the intelligent completion systems being installed in the three fields, the basic design in each consists of:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A production packer with a hydraulic and electric bypass A gauge package for measuring shut-in and flowing pressure from two sand-controlled zones 2 control valves with metal-to-metal seals to control flow from both production intervals A shroud to isolate flow between upper and lower production intervals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The piston-actuated control valves will be functioned through a direct hydraulic link from the subsea control module.
