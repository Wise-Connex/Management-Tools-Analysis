      "abstract": "<jats:p> Growing cultural diversity brings new challenges to the practice of planning. In participatory planning, this diversity poses challenges related to communicating across culture-based epistemologies and soliciting the voices of multiple publics. This article explores five challenges that planners face when working in communities where the cultural background of residents is different from one’s own. These challenges are (1) traversing interpretive frames embedded in culture, history, and collective memory; (2) confronting otherness in the articulation of cultural values and social identities; (3) understanding the multiple meanings of language; (4) respecting and navigating cultural protocols and social relationships; and (5) understanding the role of power in cultural translation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are clear benefits to the urban free-way mode of transportation, including increased mobility and accessibility. Historically, however, they have often brought adverse impacts to the communities that they traverse. There are signs that the 1990s generation of urban freeways has been more environmentally sensitive to neighborhoods. This study tests success in urban transportation planning by evaluating the impacts of the Squaw Peak Parkway in Phoenix, Arizona. Strategies within four thematic areas characterizing urban freeway planning are examined to explain success. The household survey in adjacent neighborhoods suggests that most freeway impacts were successfully mitigated. The article concludes that important lessons were learned from the earlier decades of freeway building. At the same time, broader issues surrounding more sustainable forms of transportation were not explored, and the authors speculate that success was obtained at the project level but question the freeway’s success at the larger urban policy level. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1994, Jain and Bruce proposed an index—HARI, an acronym for Helping Individuals Achieve their Reproductive Intentions—to measure success or failure of family planning programs with a reproductive health orientation. HARI applies the principle of individual rights and well‐being to the assessment of these programs. The index measures two components: the achievement of an individual's reproductive intentions and the avoidance of severe reproductive health problems associated with an individual's efforts to achieve her stated reproductive intentions. A family planning program can be deemed successful if an individual is able to avoid having an unintended pregnancy (or is able to have a wanted child) within the stipulated period and if she experiences no severe reproductive health problems in the process. If these conditions are not met, the program could be deemed a failure. The HARI index has not yet been applied infield conditions. This report illustrates the procedure for estimating HARI by using data from a panel survey conducted in Peru. It discusses the usefulness and limitations of the index in assessing the success or failure of a family planning program with a reproductive health orientation.</jats:p>",

The Rule, adopted in 1991, originally called for all localities to create plans in compliance with goals of a 20 percent decrease in vehicle miles traveled and a 10 percent decrease in parking spaces over a 30-year period, which has presented a challenge to policy actors. This article places the implementation process within the context of a modified corporatist paradigm involving three actors: a directive state, the private sector, and litigious public interest groups. The authors examine how recent amendments to the Rule illustrate tensions among these actors and conclude that three important factors account for the successes and failures in the Rule’s implementation: persistent negotiation, threat of lawsuit, and a shared commitment among all involved to “do the right thing.” </jats:p>",

The concept of clientelism, borrowed from the field of political science, can help to explain what the CBD agents are trying to achieve for themselves in their communities, at the same time as they promote the use of contraceptive pills and injections. CBD agents are concerned with building up their own stocks of prestige and respect from their community members, while avoiding blame for any possible negative outcomes of family planning.</jats:p>",

Data from the 1994 Demographic and Health Survey, Cote d'lvoire, obtained from monogamous husbands concerning their extramarital sexual behavior in the two months preceding the survey were linked to data reported by wives concerning postnatal abstinence over the same time period. Logistic regression was applied to assess the link between these two factors, net of the effects of possible confounders. A significant effect of postnatal abstinence on the probability that the husband reported at least one extramarital partner was found. Unprotected extramarital sex was two times more common among men who observed conjugal abstinence than it was among other men. Other predictors of extramarital sex were urban‐rural residence, region, education, and whether or not husband and wife had the same religious affiliation. Because condom use is low in this population, the protective effect of marital abstinence is offset by an increased probability that husbands will seek extramarital partners during the postpartum period. The results confirm the earlier findings for Benin and can likely be generalized to most of West Africa.</jats:p>",

The study reveals that more than two‐thirds of respondents were completely consistent in their survey and interview responses. Consistency was higher for women than for men, and it improved when a dichotomous measure (intended/unintended) was used rather than a more detailed variable that distinguished between intended, mistimed, and unwanted pregnancies. To the extent that the two data sources disagree, the interview transcripts suggest two possible reasons for inconsistent reports: deference to a spouse's perceived attitude or the respondent's ambivalence toward or ready acceptance of an unintended pregnancy.</jats:p>",

The project was initiated in response to continued high pregnancy rates among adolescents and growing numbers of new HIV infections among young adults. It sought to promote responsible sexual and health‐seeking behaviors among public secondary‐school students, including the use of public health clinics. The study design included a matched control group used to measure project impact. The findings indicate that the project was successful in increasing the flow of sexual and reproductive health information to secondary‐school students and that it had an impact on adolescents' intentions to use public health clinics in the future. No effects on sexual or contraceptive‐use behaviors or on use of public clinics were observed, however. Client exit‐interview data from a subset of project clinics indicate that adolescents who use clinic‐based services are overwhelmingly female and considerably older on average and much more likely ever to have been pregnant than are adolescents in the target population for the project.</jats:p>",

PbR    exploits declarative plan-rewriting rules and efficient local search    techniques to transform an easy-to-generate, but possibly suboptimal,    initial plan into a high-quality plan. In addition to addressing the    issues of planning efficiency and plan quality, this framework offers    a new anytime planning algorithm. We have implemented this planner and    applied it to several existing domains. The experimental results show    that the PbR approach provides significant savings in planning effort    while generating high-quality plans.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the overall process planning techniques are identified and analyzed. The data flow chart in layer-based machining is established. The concepts of “decomposition for accessibility” and “decomposition for manufacturability” are proposed to decompose the model into manufacturable parts, which is called slabs. Adaptive slicing and interference avoidance algorithms are developed to achieve the maximum accessibility. A method called stock layer combination is proposed to select available stock layers for the process.</jats:p>",

The importance of information from articles, books and television programmes is significantly associated with opinion leadership status. Furthermore, opinion leadership status is significantly associated with technical information on wines. This group, who tend to be the “heavy” buyers, is an important segment on whom producers should focus their attentions. Identifying them, however, cannot be undertaken demographically but, rather, they should be isolated by their information‐seeking behaviour.

The potential for such a utilisation is limited by three major problems. First, the problem of aggregating many separate indicators to finally one sustainability index, on which fiscal relations supposedly could be based, second the varying regional endowments which provide different starting points for sustainable developments, and finally the problem of cardinal or ordinal scale as many of the indicators discussed are only of qualitative nature. As a result we conclude that regional comparisons of sustainability suffer from substantial methodological and theoretical shortcomings even if improved regionalisations can be applied.  </jats:p>"

The critical tolerance feature sets of the part are first identified by comparing the tolerance specifications with the capabilities of machine tools. Then, based on the concepts of critical tolerance feature set, the feature model of the part is decomposed into a series of identical setup feature (ISF) sets, each of which corresponds to a setup candidate. Finally, according to geometric precedence and tolerance precedence among features, the reasonable machining operations of features with multiple machining operations are determined, the ISF sets are sequenced and merged. Compared to previous work, the approach can generate the setup plan by which the part can be machined to satisfy the required tolerances. The approach also has high efficiency.</jats:p>",

The approach constructs all the feasible fixture plans of a part with linear and circular edges by using the mechanism theory. Based on the geometric relationships between locator triplet and three boundary edges of a part, we classified the loading and unloading motion of the part into two kinds, i.e. translational motion and rotational motion. Moreover we put forward the notions of the locator visible cone and the pivotal locator, and utilize these notions to analyze the accessibility of locators. To effectively analyze the feasibility of clamping the part, and generate all of the feasible clamp positions, the notions of the triangle of instant rotational center and the same direction edge of the triangle are set forth and utilized. Finally, several criteria of evaluating fixture design are given for generating optimal fixture plan.</jats:p>",

A department of the Kuwait Oil Company is responsible for the development of these reservoirs and needed to determine the best order in which to develop these assets. In order to do this it was necessary to make judgements regarding how well any development option met a set of strategic criteria. At the individual reservoir level, it was also necessary to judge which development option best met a set of criteria for the development of specific reservoirs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A decision hierarchy was developed that reflected the ordering of the criteria and the specific alternatives. Pair-wise comparisons of the various criteria were made in order to determine how well they satisfied the overall objective. These judgments were evaluated using a judgment matrix to determine weights for the criteria. These criteria were applied to decisions to be made at the next lower level in the hierarchy. In this way, the decisions, which were judged to best meet the overall objective, were given the highest priority. This influence cascaded down through the hierarchy to rank the development options. With this structure it was simple to substitute one overall objective for another to determine whether this would cause a change in decision policy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The sensitivity of the decision outcome was also evaluated for its sensitivity to the range of values of the input factors. Since there were thirty-five factors to evaluate, a statistical design approach was used to evaluate factor effects. It is shown that the planning factors, planning horizon and the demand scenario used for planning purposes were significant in all cases evaluated, and highlighted the importance of testing the assumptions, criteria and objectives in a strategic planning exercise.</jats:p>",

A new workflow consisting in separating multidisciplinary feasibility evaluation from detailed engineering has now been used on several projects. This workflow decreases dramatically the necessary cycle time to plan a well since only those alternatives that are viable for all disciplines are going through detailed analysis.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The angle block of this method is the combination of a shared earth model with advanced three-dimensional visualisation techniques and quick, but precise evaluation tools. The use of constraints to define default values makes it simple to plan targets and wellbores only with 3D interactive graphic editing. Those constraints can themselves be relative to the structural geological model. Therefore the generated design is accurate enough to be trusted when used by the various evaluation functions. To assess the value and feasibility of a target/well solution, the asset team can use interactively drainable volume, wellbore position uncertainty, driller's target, wellbore collision and drillstring mechanical calculations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This approach has been used in different contexts for planning wells in an oil field in deep water western Africa and a gas field in Norway. For the field in the golf of Guinea, reservoir simulation has been used to define the location of horizontal drains. In Norway, an extended reach well has been planned using a 3D-reservoir model. The methodology has helped improve the overall understanding of the problem by sharing and explaining each other's constraints, thus improving the well planning quality and reducing the design cycle time.</jats:p>",

Presents empirical evidence from UK and Czech companies to challenge this view. In spite of consumer resistance to branding in the Czech Republic, and differing competitive environments, the contrast between national and smaller breweries in terms of brand development was found to be similar in both countries. Though ensuring distribution is critical, it is argued that smaller breweries in both countries have much to gain from a clearer understanding of customers’ perceptions of their brands.  </jats:p>",

Drawing on a case study located in the Cape Metropolitan Region of South Africa, this investigation illustrates how decision-makers have implemented a planning strategy referred to as integrated development planning (IDP) to aid post- apartheid urban reconstruction. In so doing, the paper shows how this mechanism draws upon the spatial imagination as a method of (re)directing the development of this city. Moreover, the case study demonstrates how an imagined urban space, expressed in the planning system of the IDP, functions as a device by which shared understandings of social justice are enabled. Finally, the paper reflects on how these findings might (re)direct the theoretical development of the social justice concept in geographical and urban planning debates. </jats:p>",

A major challenge of the study was to determine the optimal development and management strategy for maximising recovery of both oil and condensate, simultaneously. A full-field simulation model was constructed to accurately simulate the reservoir fluid phase behaviour, study the reservoir displacement and recovery mechanism and optimise the configuration and design of surface facilities. The reservoir fluid was adequately characterised using an 8-component Peng-Robinson equation-of-state model. The model was used to predict future reservoir performance under various developments and operating scenarios and to determine the optimum oil and condensate recoveries. The study showed that an integrated oil and condensate development strategy involving gas re-injection and partial cycling would lead to optimal oil and condensate recoveries of 63 % and 68 % respectively. Under natural depletion however, the recovery for oil would be 49 %, while condensate recovery would be relatively insignificant.</jats:p>",

There are a wide variety of examples where NMR logging has disclosed secrets of the well that were not discovered by conventional logs, e.g. low resistivity pay zones identified by NMR logs but completely overlooked or viewed as not economically viable by conventional log interpretation. In some complex environments, NMR logging may even be the only alternative available to assess critical formation parameters.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The interplay of rock and fluid properties, reservoir parameters, and NMR tool characteristics and settings shape the recorded NMR signals. Pre-job planning is critical for the success of the logging run especially now that NMR technology has gained more general acceptance and is being applied in complex environments. Integration of known parameters and estimated in situ properties may reduce the acquisition time, demonstrate the feasibility of a proposed logging run, and provide a handle to optimize the acquisition cycle.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As demand for online network services continues to grow, service providers are looking to meet this need and avail themselves of business opportunities. However, despite strong growth in demand, providers continue to have difficulty achieving profitability, customer churn remains high, and network performance continues to draw complaints. We suggest that strategic business planning for network services would benefit from a systems thinking approach that analyzes the feedback effects present in the underlying business process. These feedback loops can be complex and have significant impact on business performance. For instance, while the size of a provider's customer base depends on price and network performance, network performance is itself dependent on the size of the customer base. In this paper, we develop a planning model that represents these feedback effects using the finite difference equations methodology of systems dynamics. The model is validated by showing its fit with essential characteristics of the underlying problem domain, and by showing its ability to replicate observed reference mode behaviors. Simulations are then carried out under a variety of scenarios to examine issues important to service providers. Among other findings, the simulations suggest that (a) under flat-rate pricing, lowering price to increase customer base can hurt profitability as well as network performance; (b) under usage-based pricing, lowering price need not necessarily lead to a larger customer base; and (c) in addition to price, the customers' threshold of tolerance for performance degradation plays a significant role in balancing market share with profitability. We briefly present a prototype decision support system based on the systems thinking approach, and suggest ways in which it could be used to help business planning for network services. </jats:p>",

This analysis of discourses traces the shifts in patterns of perception, of ordering and of interpretation in spatial research and spatial planning with regard to suburban settlement development in both western and eastern Germany since 1990. It identifies a number of different normative positions („urban sprawl” vs. „newgestalt”), as well as pointing to the different courses of development which have taken place in western and eastern Germany.

This technology can be used to evaluate how humans interact with products before costly physical prototypes are built. One of the advantages of using VR technology in design evaluation is the ability to easily explore many different “what-if” design scenarios. One of the areas of current research in the use of VR is in assembly methods planning. As a result of prior work performed at Iowa State University, it became clear that collision detection is an important component in the development of virtual assembly methods planning applications. This paper describes the use of the Voxmap Pointshell method of collision detection as it is applied to a general purpose virtual assembly planning application.</jats:p>",

In order to drill these wells successfully, deepwater operators are required to focus planning efforts on the challenges posed by these extreme salt sections and well depths. Texaco recently planned and drilled two such wells in the Walker Ridge Area of the GOM. Both wells had salt bodies in excess of 10,000 ft. and were planned with total depths below 26,000 ft. The advantages of long salt sections are (1) high fracture gradients within the salt, which allows longer hole sections between casing strings and (2) insulation from typical well control problems associated with permeable formations. Disadvantages include (1) difficulty in predicting the pore pressure and fracture gradient in the sedimentary section below salt and (2) hole deviation and related directional control problems in the salt.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During the planning of these wells, drilling personnel focused on (1) the drilling of non-under-reamed hole sizes in salt for enhanced directional control, (2) use of new technology to increase ROP and directional control in the salt, (3) installation of heavy, longstrings of casing demanded by the long salt sections and (4) formation of contingency plans to account for the uncertain subsalt pore and fracture pressures. This paper outlines the approach taken in the planning of the two wells and discusses the lessons learned during the execution, most significantly: (1) long salt sections can be used to advantage to extend casing points and eliminate well control issues, (2) ROP in salt can be maximized through the use of conventional, non-under-reaming bits, stabilized bottomhole assemblies, and synthetic oil based mud, and (3) a detailed planning and quality control program is required for the successful running of heavy longstrings of casing.</jats:p>",

The principles and the planner focus on sequencing cutting operations within individual setups for three and five axis prismatic milling applications. There is no general agreement on ordering principles largely because different shops have very different needs. To address a wide range of users’ needs, we have designed both the ordering principles and the Intra-Setup Planner to support flexibility rather than providing a single one-size-fits-all prescription for operation ordering. The Intra-Setup Planner provides a convenient user interface, Rule Editor through which users can select the ordering principles that suit their own situation, an automated planner that will follow the user selected principles, and a Plan Editor to allow final adjustments. The combination of flexible principles and user control maximize the strengths of human and machine intelligence.</jats:p>",

To whom was science relevant and toward what ends? It is argued that in a practicing culture of science learning, science was relevant because (a) it was created from participants' concerns, interests, and experiences inside and outside science, (b) it was an ongoing process of researching and then enacting ideas, and (c) it was situated within the broader community. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

The DSM focuses management attention on the essential information transfer requirements of a project: finding essential tasks vital to begin early, developing project plans having improved throughput, removing unnecessary iteration, and simplifying project reviews, while at the same time preserving or improving deliverable quality. A DSM helps us decide what to assume and how and when to plan project reviews. Assumptions are among the greatest sources of project risks.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of ‘regional tourism’ has gained salience in Asia since the 1990s. The traditional practice of single-country tourism development is increasingly complemented by cross-border collaborations in planning and promotion. Through these transnational practices, new tourism spaces are being configured with region-states emerging alongside nation-states. In this paper I explore the concept of Asian regional tourism from the perspective of Singapore. As a city-state with scarce land resources, Singapore has turned to regionalism (or ‘regionalisation’) to overcome its spatial constraints, and to stimulate its tourism industry. I have two main aims in this paper. Conceptually, I argue that regional tourism takes a number of distinct spatial configurations, as exemplified by the case of Singapore. Empirically, I reveal that tourism regionalisation brings manifold opportunities to a small country like Singapore, but that it also generates many challenges hitherto never experienced. Political sensitivites within Asia, incompatible working styles between societies, and cultural differences emerge when countries interact with each other. </jats:p>",

In the framework of the Finnish BNCT project, new deterministic three‐dimensional radiation transport code MultiTrans <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0002\" /> has been developed at VTT Chemical Technology, based on a novel application of the tree multigrid technique. To test the applicability of this new code in a realistic BNCT dose planning problem, cylindrical PMMA (polymethyl‐methacrylate) phantom was chosen as a benchmark case. It is a convenient benchmark, as it has been modeled by several different codes, including well‐known <jats:sc>DORT</jats:sc> and <jats:sc>MCNP</jats:sc>. Extensive measured data also exist. In this paper, a comparison of the new MultiTrans <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0003\" /> code with other methods is presented for the PMMA phantom case. Results show that the total neutron dose rate to ICRU adult brain calculated by the MultiTrans <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0004\" /> code differs less than 4% in 2 cm depth in phantom (in thermal maximum) from the <jats:sc>DORT</jats:sc> calculation. Results also show that the calculated <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0005.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0005\" /> and <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0006.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0006\" /> reaction rates in 2 cm depth in phantom differ less than 4% and 1% from the measured values, respectively. However, the photon dose calculated by the MultiTrans <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0007.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0007\" /> code seems to be incorrect in this PMMA phantom case, which requires further studying. As expected, the deterministic MultiTrans <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp7716-math-0008.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp7716:mp7716-math-0008\" /> code is over an order of magnitude faster than stochastic Monte Carlo codes (with similar resolution), thus providing a very efficient tool for BNCT dose planning.</jats:p>",

The structure of the process of change is based on model-supported pro cesses as well as tools and techniques that are already in use. These include established discrete event simulation tools that have been used in the area of production and logistics planning for several years, and innovative visual ization techniques such as 3-D animation, Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). Visualization has become very necessary in the planning, realization and operation of a factory because the data for the different target groups within a company, from the operating staff up to management, has to be processed into realizable in formation. The authors, motivated by this initial situation, have placed the conceptual universality of the use of meth ods in the foreground, using distributed architecture and the targeted use of 3-D modeling in logistics planning as an add-on to discrete event simulation. This article intro duces a generally applicable concept for the user-defined mapping of discrete event simulation models onto anima tion models, describes the aspects of realization, and con siders integration into an animation pipeline. </jats:p>",

In order to better understand the nature of the planning-performance relationship, this paper developed and tested a structural model linking perceived environmental uncertainty, and managerial attitude, to strategic planning, non-strategic decision-making and organisational performance. Data was collected from over 140 respondents and results revealed that managerial attitude, rather than perceived uncertainty in both the task and general environments, is the largest determinant of the emphasis placed on strategic planning activities. The validity of strategic planning was confirmed as it was significantly and positively related to performance, while non-strategic decision-making had negative performance implications.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The control of operations, for example; the flow of materials, the scheduling of production, the planning of capacity – these are central problem in operations management. A substantial body of technique, with attendant technologies, has been developed to facilitate the problem of control of operations. One such technique is Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP). This technique has developed in power and scope in concert with the development of power in computer based technology. From the perspective of the operations management literature, MRP has evolved into MRP II, and now into Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). MRP, and MRP II are systems that are embedded within the operations function, and can be controlled legitimately by the operations function; ERP is fundamentally different. ERP systems in their model implementation are enterprise wide, integrated systems. As an enterprise wide system, ERP has created an opportunity to distance the power to influence operations actions from the location of the function. This change has significant implications for the companies adopting the technology, and more specifically, for the profession of operations management. This paper develops a framework of analysis for this change, presents a set of small cases, and discusses some implications that can be drawn from the analysis. The “three arenas of information use – sense making, knowledge creating, and decision making” (Choo 1998, p.3) must be allowed to energize each other and this can only happen if organization wide information systems, such as ERP, respect and empower situated action, enable ambiguity, and allow the use of multiple interpretive frames as managers interact with the situations of operations management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The state is increasingly understood as a collection of institutions that are continually reforming as a result of multiple influences. As a consequence, the form of the state is by no means coherent or stable. One type of influence shaping this ongoing reformation is state institutions themselves, for example, the continuing struggles over public service provision in the United Kingdom. It is this kind of internal state reformation with which this paper is concerned. The paper explores the shift within the British state towards ‘governance’ entailing the transfer of state activities to ‘nonstate’ organisations. It focuses on an initiative called Learndirect that is part of this transition and its local articulation in east London. It applies strategic relational state theory as a way to simultaneously consider the order and the contingency of processes surrounding this initiative. This reveals tensions between different spatial scales of the institutions involved and the struggles that ensue. The paper highlights the power relations shaping the form Learndirect is taking and how this privileges the provision of particular kinds of services. It is argued that analysing these networks of power can help to uncover the ways in which some institutions exert influence over others so as to enlist support for a particular agenda. At the same time, the author is careful to stress that politics is always an open-ended space; consequently, the state form that results is never completely knowable, but neither is it completely random. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the sources of rising manufacturing output and labour productivity across thirteen European Union states between 1978 and 1994. Despite the severe deindustrialisation trends of the past two decades, manufacturing output continued to expand and thus contribute to overall economic growth. The analysis here reveals several key aspects of this process. First, the geographical distribution of the sector across Europe for the entire period is characterised by considerable stability. Contrary to some initial fears, the slow but steady integration process has not led to the wholesale migration of manufacturing activity from one member state to another. Second, total factor productivity increases seem to account for most of the recorded output and labour productivity gains. Third, there is, however, significant spatial variation in the performance of individual industrial bases. Smaller countries' growth rates appear to surpass those of the larger states, and the European South demonstrates higher growth rates than the North. Nevertheless, and this is the final point, there is an absence of clear signs of convergence. Geographical inequalities continue to hold, as the technology gap between advanced and lagging economies remains as wide as ever. Such findings raise some important issues about the role of EU regional policies and the challenges that they face at the dawn of the 21st century. </jats:p>",

Ao application which requires high performance processing is that related to the control of the trajectory planning of a manipulator. There are several methods for conducting the trajectory planning. One of them is the Variational method. This method consists of an iteractive process for executing the calculations related to the configuration of joints of a redundant manipulator. As in every iteractive procedure, the Variational method demands high volume of processing, causing a delay that wouldn't allow a real-time system to work, and also its simulations. To solve this problem, parallel processing can be used. This paper presents a parallel processing algorithm to solve the trajectory planning problem, based on redundant manipulator joints. In this case, the Variational method is applied with the use of a parallel architecture.</jats:p>"

Landscape configuration and the demographic/dispersal characteristics of target species can govern the level of wildlife response to habitat restoration projects. This is particularly true for fragmented habitats in rapidly suburbanizing areas, where the widely held notion that wildlife can colonize any restored habitat is challenged by barriers to dispersal. Because habitat restoration is a passive means of restoring wildlife populations, equal weight needs to be given to the context (likelihood of site colonization by target species) as well as the content (habitat) of restoration projects. Defining spatial patterns of demography, dispersion, and dispersal allows restorationists to place projects where they can have the greatest impact on the threats and sensitivities of target species, and the greatest contribution to the persistence and/or recovery of populations. Further, it provides a means of evaluating the relative potential worth of different restoration sites. If passive wildlife restoration is to be successful, the constraints to colonization need to be interpreted with regional goals of ecosystem and species management in mind.</jats:p>",

The authors begin by examining alternative models of planning and delineating their implications for performance. Subsequently, the findings obtained in various studies of planning are reviewed with respect to 8 key questions ranging from when planning is useful to how errors in planning should be minimized. The implications of current answers to these questions are discussed in terms of research needs and development of a more comprehensive theoretical understanding of performance in planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sweden has long been an acknowledged leader in Europe in terms of its commitment to environmental protection linked with ecologically based technological innovation, and to social democratisation and high levels of welfare provision. Following the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development in Rio, Agenda 21 was received warmly as codifying an existing determination to pursue development which may be sustainable. However, over the last decade the economy has come under increasing pressure from globalisation and social change. Although the environmental agenda remains strong, a schism seems to be developing with key socioeconomic drivers. The Swedish government has responded with a policy framework of ecological modernisation, through which it hopes to regain the high ground economically, environmentally, and socially. We report on a study for the Swedish Research Councils in which we explore aspects of this national policy framework, and how it is being interpreted in selected projects in Sweden's three major cities and two case-study towns. We examine tensions in integration and implementation; and argue that Swedish norms may favour an unduly ‘expert’ and even ‘technocorporatist’ view of sustainable development which its current ecological modernisation programme does little to address. We discuss the cultural and institutional change which may be required if the current conception of ecological modernisation is to deliver development which is sustainable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses fuzzy evaluation issues as applied in a decision–making procedure of process planning. General framework of fuzzy partitioning of system variables, evaluation procedure, and system variables, evaluation procedure, and system parameters aggregation have been described in detail for two classes and three distinguishing types of evaluation. Classes of evaluation include (a) linguistic, and (b) fuzzy (Choquet) integral based evaluation. Within these classes we distinguish between: (1) single criterion evaluation, (2) global multicriteria evaluation, and (3) global integral evaluation. First type relates to fuzzification of system parameters and matching procedure of a system's parameters input values to linguistic values in pre–defined dictionary. Multicriteria evaluation provides aggregation protocol of an object's attributes values and their significance yielding its suitability measure. We can use this measure to select the most appropriate linguistic value from pre–defined dictionary for further propagation through reasoning system, as well as for ranking of possible alternatives since it provides their global rank. Both types belong to linguistic evaluation class. Finally, global integral evaluation employs fuzzy integrals (here Choquet integral) for overall assessment of alternatives status. This type of evaluation belongs to fuzzy integral based class. Each type of evaluation is illustrated by an example from the real industrial practice concerning metal cutting process planning. The whole methodology should be seen as an upgrade of traditional expert systems used for this purpose. Relaxation of some system constraints provides more generality to traditional approaches, puts more \"naturality\" in assessment of parameters values, and reduces knowledge bases. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICT) on the organisation and location of firms has been the subject of an important debate in economic literature. In contrast we focus in this paper on the effects of the organisational and spatial structures and behaviours of firms on ICT adoption. These effects are tested by means of an original data set of approximately 5000 French industrial firms, which enables us to combine the different components of the firms' internal and external modes of organisation and their relations to territories, notably by taking into account the diversity of their spatial environments (urban, periurban, or rural areas). Beyond the traditional structural determinants, results confirm that organisational factors play a significant part in ICT adoption. Among these factors, the internal and external modes of coordination of firms and the codification of knowledge, practices, and relations considerably influence the adoption of ICT. Results also confirm the importance of spatial factors such as the type of areas where firms are located, and more generally the importance of the firms' spatial structure. These results theoretically emphasise the need to depart from a vision of the firm as a single-unit entity. Empirically they suggest that ICT do not only enable the firm to manage problems of distance or of proximity, but also to manage new organisational modes in space. </jats:p>",

Landscape rehabilitation based on ecological planning and design can be used satisfactorily to restore degraded mining land to make it productive and reestablish a stable ecological equilibrium that is coordinated with its surroundings in order to attain ecological holism. Degraded mining land can be classified into diverse types, with different rehabilitation methods possible for each of the classifications. In addition, degraded mining lands are also associated with various types of landscape. Accordingly, landscape rehabilitation goals can only be realized by working out reasonable macrolandscape patterns and establishing suitable microecological conditions based on the landscape ecology.

Their governments and insurance industries are now being required to cope with rapidly increasing and unanticipated disaster expenditures. In some cases, disaster related claims have increased by more than a full order of magnitude in just a decade. It is important for local planners and governments to understand the general trend of disaster impacts in order to respond to them. To illustrate these trends, the increase in number and financial impact of the last decade of disasters in Canada are reviewed in this article along with some discussion of the impact on government and the insurance industry. In spite of the increasing impact of emergencies and disasters, Canadian local municipal governments have, in general, invested very little in emergency mitigation planning. Many municipalities have no emergency plans at all. Where plans exist, many only address a small range of possible threats, and many do not include any mitigation aspects. Emergency mitigation planning at the local municipal level is critical for effective mitigation and response. We review the general institutional context for local disaster and emergency planning in Canada, concluding that planners have sufficient tools available to begin to address the challenge. Political will and professional interest now is required to make the necessary advances.</jats:p>",

Local government authorities (known as ‘councils’) limited their involvement to supporting festivals and information provision campaigns, often aimed at building Anglo-Celtic tolerance of other groups. Most community relations projects and policies were forms of exotic or assimilatory multiculturalism, rather than radical multiculturalism. Very few had developed policies to confront racism. Even those councils in areas with acknowledged interethnic discord were found to be reticient to intervene in local intercommunal relations. Some Australian councils celebrated and responded to the diversity of their citizenry. However, many failed to recognise heterogeneity and constructed certain minorities as a problematic ‘other’. Good local government practice involves the development of a comprehensive community relations policy. Such policy should be set within the wider context of recasting governance to encourage further involvement of the full range of local citizenry. </jats:p>",

Standard mandibular protocols for dental implant planning were followed using either a conventional dental radiographic unit (PM 2002 CC Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland) or CT scanner (Excel Twin Elscint, Haifa, Israel). Organ absorbed and effective doses were calculated. Effective dose was calculated using two approaches, one based on the ICRP method which excludes the salivary tissue from the remainder organs (designated E(exc)), and the other with its inclusion (E(inc)).</jats:p>\n</jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>RESULTS</jats:title>\n<jats:p>The greatest individual organ doses for any examination were measured in the salivary tissue. E(exc) for panoramic, cephalometric and cross-sectional tomography using DPR was 0.004 mSv, 0.002 mSv and 0.002 mSv, respectively, whereas with CT it was 0.314 mSv.

Politicians and others argue that ‘lay wisdom’ has much to contribute, and that such involvement is essential if public confidence in the service is to be maintained. Many managers and clinicians, however, operating within an essentially technocratic paradigm, remain unconvinced. Their views are often reinforced by a lack of experience of methods for public involvement that can meet the many practical difficulties involved. Using Arnstein’s ‘ladder of citizen participation’, this paper describes the principal nuances of these two paradigms, explores the nature of the conflict between them, and assesses the extent to which they are really incommensurate. It then briefly describes some of the key methodological principles emerging from public involvement work in parts of the NHS in Wales, and assesses their potential to bridge the divide between the paradigms.</jats:p>",

We built a theoretical model consisting of two regions and three sectors (manufacturing, producer services, and agriculture). Given that producer services constitute a sector oriented towards information and knowledge, this is a factor that is taken into account in the explanation of their location. Numerical simulations are made in a general equilibrium framework. In contrast to previous works, we find that when regions integrate, specialization (producer services being in the core regions, and manufacturing in the periphery)—rather than convergence—arises. Besides, improvements in telecommunications may facilitate concentration of services in the core regions. </jats:p>",

However, despite an imperative to provide 23 000 nurse prescribers by March 2001 and to expand this function to half the nursing workforce by 2004, there is as yet no agreement as to the occupational profile of the nurse prescriber, nor the level and content of any pre‐requisite educational programme.

This instrument required the respondents to assess 40 core clinical tasks according to three criteria: how critical each task was both to their current role as family planning nurses and to the role of the family planning nurse prescriber, and how well each was performed. Comparisons of the ratings provided an indicative profile of the role of the family planning nurse prescriber and a prioritized list of training needs to achieve this status.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> Generally, and unsurprisingly, the nurse prescribing role was defined primarily in terms of prescribing functions, although advanced professional issues, communication, teamwork and business/administration were also deemed to be salient. Research was not identified as being important. However, with regard to the top 15 training needs, seven research tasks were recorded, with the remainder including advanced clinical activities, applied pharmacology, administration and technical activities.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> This study offers a role definition of the nurse prescriber in family planning, and an indicative curriculum for cognate educational programmes.</jats:p>",

The model was constructed to describe transportation—residential land-use interaction by means of continuous analytical approaches and mathematical programming methods. Heterogeneity among residential sites and households is also considered, to alleviate aggregation bias. The model is formulated to minimize the sum of households' generalized travel costs and rent costs under user equilibrium by incorporating flow-congestion effects and the bid-rent effects of different income households. Decision variables include the number of households and flow intensity at each residential site, and the number of transferring passengers at each rail transit station. In addition, the generalized travel cost, households' residential distribution, and rent-cost distribution in a metropolitan area are analyzed to explore the benefits of rail transit lines. The results reveal that, upon completion of rail transit networks, savings in travel time from each residential site to the central business district are more marked for longer commuting distances. Moreover, rent costs are, as expected, higher in areas along rail-transit lines. </jats:p>",

The WRA allowed evacuees to publish their own newspapers “freely” without “censorship” but under the authority's “supervision.” This study uses archival documents of the WRA and other concerned governmental agencies and examines development of the “free under supervision” press policy. The study shows that the federal government used camp newspapers to convince the domestic and international public that “democracy” was fully protected within camps. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The forests in Finland have been under intensive planning for decades. Currently, mathematical programming is widely used in planning of wood production. Today's multi‐functional forestry, however, calls for more flexible decision support methods. MCDM tools have been used in responding to fresh planning challenges. For example, the Finnish Forest and Park Service, entrusted with the care of the vast majority of state‐owned natural resources in Finland, endeavours to produce large‐scale natural resource plans satisfying the needs of both economic, social, and ecological sustainability. Participatory approach is applied in the process.</jats:p><jats:p>Several forestry applications of MCDM methods, particularly those making use of the AHP or the HIPRE program, have been presented. Also, the outranking methods ELECTRE and PROMETHEE have been tested. Due to the nature of forestry applications, statistical techniques for analysing uncertainties in pairwise comparisons and for utilizing interval judgement data have been developed to improve the usability of the AHP. Recently, a hybrid method called A'WOT, making use of the AHP and SWOT, was also introduced into strategic forest planning.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper summarizes the experiences gained in applying a MAVT and two outranking methods in connection with a participatory natural resource planning process in Finland. In addition, some results of the method development work related to application needs are briefly presented. The details of the planning cases reviewed here have previously been presented in forestry journals. The purpose of this paper is not only to show how MCDM methods have been applied in forestry, but also to discuss the usability and usefulness of MCDM methods from the viewpoint of supporting forestry decision making—and how they might further be improved. Also, some perspectives for the future development work of MCDM applications in the field of natural resource management are focused on. As a conclusion, the use of more than just one MCDM method in a single planning process is seen usually recommendable. In addition, developing hybrid MCDM methods is regarded as a potential direction for future research. Also, closer co‐operation between method developers and appliers is called for to produce more useful applications. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

In this case, the configuration space is stratified. The stratified control theory using the smooth motion planning algorithm promises a powerful alternative for this manipulation problem, however, it meets also some significant difficulties. The paper presents the main steps of developing computational frame work and some improvements for stratified motion planning. The concept proposes a semi-stratified method which decomposes the manipulation problem into stratified motion planning and pure finger relocation through the special selection of the reference points. Because of the different type of computational tasks (symbolic, numerical), the realization steps are also investigated.</jats:p>",
