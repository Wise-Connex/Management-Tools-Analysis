      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most of the published literature on planning is either prescriptive (i.e., what ought to be the way planning is done), or descriptive (i.e., how it is actually carried out). This paper addresses the problem of moving from a relatively ineffective planning process to one that meets the prescriptive characteristics it theoretically ought to contain. The premise of the paper is that the conversion of a planning system needs as much planning as the process being planned. Hence, the short-hand title of “meta-planning.” The argument is made for more research on meta-planning, some initial hypotheses are developed toward a theory of meta-planning, and an extensive case study is presented to show, the credibility of the hypotheses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with an inquiry into the way in which the organisation of a spatial data set affects the interpretation of the spatial phenomena which it records, in terms of its underlying pattern or density. It is argued that the number and configuration of zones affects the level of information which is imparted to the spatial analyst, and thus the quest becomes one in which the data set is to be reorganised spatially to impart maximum information. The paper sets out to define an appropriate measure of information and an algorithm designed to optimise its value. The information measure developed is in essence a modified Shannon entropy, modified to account for uneven zonal configurations and converging to Shannon entropy when the zoning system is equal-area and the distribution the best approximation to the density. The measure has some well-known aggregation properties which are presented and several interpretations of its form in spatial terms are made. Empirical measurements of this information measure on the distribution of population in seven metropolitan areas indicate that by aggregation of zones to equal areas, increases in information might be possible and a clearer picture of the underlying density perceived. Accordingly a simple algorithm embodying an heuristic to optimise towards the equal-area norm is developed and applied to the Los Angeles region. The results, in fact, indicate that information cannot be improved in this case, and this leads to a reexamination of the nature of the problem and to suggestions for further research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The evils of operating Canada's commercial and recreational fisheries under open-access conditions were known before Confederation. Early recognition of these ills did not lead to an understanding of the basic problems nor to long-term solutions. In the early 1950s the first economic model was developed that articulated the underlying causes of excess capacity and the tendency of overexploitation in open-access fisheries. This was followed by a number of studies that explored the relationship between the biological reproductive capacity of a fishery and the economic consequences of managing publicly owned resources under open-access conditions. This early work provides a general framework from which a number of fisheries management alternatives emerge. Each of six management alternatives, which are implicit in policy for Canada's commercial fisheries, are assessed in terms of political acceptability, administrative feasibility, and effectiveness. It is emphasized that the responsibility of a government fisheries agency is to manage fisheries resources in the best interest of the owners of the resource – the nation's taxpayers. A properly implemented license control system would dissipate, rather than perpetuate, social and economic hardship among fishermen. This misplaced concern for unproven social problems often leads fisheries managers to support programs that sacrifice all the benefits that could be generated from the resource and the resource itself. A management scheme is recommended that encompasses a simple licensing system, a tax or a royalty on catch, and a limited variation of the \"Grandfather System.\" The combination of these three incorporates the main advantages of most management alternatives while avoiding most of their main shortcomings. A carefully implemented program that accounts for economic and biological considerations would improve the efficiency of the industry, improve fishermen's incomes, minimize social disruptions, help to instill an environmental conscience, protect the resource, and induce less, rather than more, government intervention into the free operation of the fishing industry. Probably more important, the program would generate an economic return for the people of Canada. Key words: overcapitalization, open-access fisheries, fisheries economics, fisheries management, fisheries policy, fish licensing, license limitation, fish royalties, tax on fish landings </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Part 1 of this paper discusses the treatment of zero observations in growth-factor methods; part 2 discusses the calibration of gravity models when the data are of different sampling variability. The problem discussed in part 1 is that zero observations are preserved at zero value in the forecast year, no matter how much growth takes place. Since the probability of making a trip is not zero but very small for those matrix cells that are empty by chance, it is shown how to estimate nonzero values for these cells by use of a method of smoothing reported in the statistical literature. It is argued in part 2 that the usual practice of calibrating against ‘grossed-up’ data is incorrect. If the survey method is the same for all trips, but the sampling fraction varies from one cell to another, it is shown, by use of maximum-likelihood methods, that it is the raw sample data against which the model should be calibrated. If the matrix is made up of data from different surveys, it is shown, by use of least-squares methods, that the raw sample data should be modified before estimating the parameters, leading to a minimum χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> fitting criterion. </jats:p>",

Because of the high cost of providing emergency medical service, a large subsidy often is required which the public sector in many rural areas, already under severe financial stress, cannot afford. To assist in solving this problem, Oklahoma legislators passed a law in 1976 which allows the formation of special emergency medical service districts. The usual procedure is for a district to be established along county lines. If the voters in the district approve support for an emergency medical service system, the district collects up to 3 mills annually from property owners to support the system. By October 1, 1977, voters of three counties in Oklahoma had approved creation of special emergency medical service districts. In addition, leaders of several other counties are discussing the issue and probably will take advantage of the enabling legislation.</jats:p>",

Many planners tend to equate erosion control as measured by the universal soil loss equation with improvements in water quality. Others implement channel management practices which degrade rather than improve water quality and thereby decrease the effectiveness of other efforts to control nonpoint sources. Planners rarely recognize the importance of the land-water interface in regulating water quality in agricultural watersheds. More effective planning can result from the development of \"best management systems\" which incorporate theory from all relevant disciplines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents the results of a time-series analysis of short-term changes in the conditions prevailing in regional labour markets. A set of alternative indicators of changes in these conditions are evaluated for each of the standard regions by use of quarterly data for a period that includes the rapid changes in the economy associated with the ‘Barber Boom’. Leading indicators of changes in labour demand are contrasted with lagging indicators and the findings for different regions compared. The results of the analysis show that in general the numbers of vacant jobs and the rates at which the jobs are being filled provide leading indicators of changes in the region's level of unemployment and of changes in the duration of unemployment in the region, and that there is no feedback from unemployment to change the demand for labour in the region. In consequence it would be justified to claim that changes in regional unemployment and its duration are caused by changes in the demand for labour in the region. </jats:p>",
