In Portugal, where the marketing function is less well established, marketing planning is not so developed. Presents the results of a comparative study which examines the level and nature of marketing activity in Portuguese and UK firms and considers the impact upon marketing planning activity. The study is based on a sample of firms drawn from the top 1,000 businesses (by turnover) in the UK and Portugal. Illustrates stark contrasts in the characteristics of marketing planning in each country, although there are signs of increasing marketing and planning activity in Portugal.</jats:p>",

For large firms, the primary reasons for engaging in green tend to be consumer pressure, the desire for better community relations and cost considerations. For smaller companies, the highest priority is given to cost, followed by customer request, fear of governmental intervention and the desire to reduce garbage. For mid‐size companies, the primary concerns are the desire for a pro‐ active stance within the community, competition and foreign countries’ regulations.</jats:p>",

We studied several tool motion characteristics, such as Jocabian matrices, path tracking errors and the extra degree of freedom (e-DOF), and found that the traditional five-axis planning methods cannot take into consideration of the kinematics performance variation and the e-DOF in a hexapod. A kinematics-based tool path planning scheme for the hexapods is therefore proposed. It combines the traditional tool path planning with the kinematic condition optimization. The optimization is a two-step process. First a high accuracy zone of the workspace is identified globally for the placement of the part. Then a set of 5-DOF tool paths is generated and extended to a set of 6-DOF tool paths based on the local planning of e-DOF. Finally the relationship between the e-DOF and the stiffness of the Hexapods, another factor in the use of e-DOF, are discussed.</jats:p>",

This can range from tactical decisions such as planning new right-of-ways or public transit routes to long-term, strategic planning of the entire system.

But in the recent past, development of a road network opened up these areas to the rest of the world, making them vulnerable to foreign influences that are rapidly penetrating into the life and norms of the people.  Change is inevitable in any growing community and it reflects on development of the physical form of built environment. This study aims at understanding the character of existing traditional built-environment, of the historic settlements in the Northern Areas of Pakistan, evaluate and analyze their evolution, identify the forces of change and finally reach to conclusions and propose determinants necessary for the survival of the traditional fabric.

Longitudinal data show that past visits are not significant in hazard models for adoption of contraceptive methods, whereas visits in the current round are significant. Therefore family planning workers’ visits affect women’s contraceptive behavior by decreasing the costs of contraception. Results of contraceptive discontinuation hazard models further support this hypothesis.</jats:p>",

In particular, a decoupling strategy for each of the three degrees of freedom of the vehicle is presented, along with a method for coordinating the degrees of freedom. A nearly optimal trajectory for the vehicle can typically be calculated in less than 1000 floating point operations, which makes it attractive for real-time control in dynamic and uncertain environments.</jats:p>",

First, the motivation for multiple robot control and the current state-of-art in the field of cooperating robots are briefly given. This is followed by a discussion of energy minimization techniques in the context of robotics, and finally, the principles of using genetic algorithms as an optimization tool are included. The initial and final position of the end effector are specified. Two cases, one of a single manipulator, and the other of two cooperating manipulators carrying a common payload illustrate the approach proposed. The genetic algorithm identifies the optimal trajectory based on minimum joint torque requirements. The minimization of a suitably defined performance index involving joint torques implies that the trajectory thus obtained requires the least amount of torque.</jats:p>",

Extended Kohonen networks which contain an additional lattice of output neurons are used in conjunction with PID controllers in position control to minimise command tracking errors. The results indicate that the extended Kohonen network controller is more efficient than the trajectory preshaping scheme reported in early literature. Subsequently, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is used to solve an optimisation problem related to time-optimal control. This problem involves the selection of actuator torque limits and an end-effector path subject to time-optimality and tracking error constraints. Two chromosome coding schemes are explored in the investigation: Gray and integer-based coding schemes. The results suggest that the integer-based chromosome is more suitable at representing the decision variables. As a result of using both neural networks and a genetic algorithm in this application, an idea of a hybridisation between a neural network and a genetic algorithm at the task level for use in a control system is also effectively demonstrated.</jats:p>",

It is being argued that cities have undergone a major transformation process. The morphological aspects of the cities is in the agenda of post modern discourses which debate that morphological patterns of cities are as important as economical, social, political, and cultural factors. It is a lack of understanding for the importance of morphological patterns in establishing the essence and identity of cities, due to which the modernist towns are being questioned.  A growing concern for the new tools, concepts to enhance the methodological issues and to understand the essence of the morphology in urban design is being observed. This paper is concerned with developing a method for analysing the morphological essence of cities in terms of concept of genius loci. The basic premises of the methods consists of the concepts of morphology, topology and typology. With these concepts an analytical framework is established and the town of Mardin is analysed with the help of this model.</jats:p>",

Answers to open‐ended, exploratory questions revealed 18 categories of relationship‐building initiatives. The findings suggest that “customer relationship‐building” means different things to different people and that practices to build such relationships vary considerably. By inventorying the range of relationship‐building objectives, quantifying their priority levels, and identifying specific practices used to build customer relationships, a greater understanding of current practices was achieved. Thus, the findings promise to benefit researchers, practitioners and consumers in terms of knowledge development, prescriptions for success, and enhanced value and satisfaction, respectively.</jats:p>",

Unlike other methods, MEM naturally incorporates <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> knowledge of the problem into the optimized cost function. This feature is especially important in radiotherapy planning, because some knowledge is usually available about the stage of tumor development and about the prescription doses, including some dose constraints to the surrounding normal organs. Inverse planning is inherently consistent with the ability of MEM to estimate parameters inversely. In this investigation, an entropy function determines the homogeneity of dose distribution in the planning target volume; a least‐squares function is added to the maximum entropy function as a constraint to measure the quality of reconstructed doses in organs at risk; and an iterative Newton–Ralphson algorithm searches for the optimization solution. Here we provide two examples that validate this application of MEM and the results were compared with manual plans. Although the examples involve conformal radiotherapy, we think MEM can be adopted to optimize intensity‐modulated radiation therapy.</jats:p>",

Existing research has shown PPGIS production to be highly context dependent, identifying an ever-growing set of key elements of this context, including a variety of locally available resources for GIS access and use as well as organizational capacities and characteristics. Contributing to current efforts to expand the conceptual basis of PPGIS research, this article argues that the conceptualization of organizational context must be expanded beyond internal capacities to include organizational networks with local actors, institutions, and resources; organizational knowledge and stability; and organization mission and priorities, all of which shape its activities and relationships, as well as the utility of available GIS resources. This broadened conception of organizational context enables a stronger explanation of the influencing role of organizations in PPGIS, as well as of local variability in PPGIS. These arguments are developed from comparative case study research with six Milwaukee, WI, community revitalization organizations engaged in PPGIS within a city-wide participatory planning initiative. </jats:p>",

We study a firm producing multiple items in a multiperiod environment where demand for items is known but varies over time with a long-term growth and possible short-term fluctuations. The production equipment is characterized by significant changeover time between the production of different items. While demand growth is gradual, capacity additions are discrete. Therefore, periods immediately following a machine purchase are characterized by excess machine capacity. We develop a mathematical programming model and an effective solution approach to determine the optimal capacity acquisition, production and inventory decisions over time. Through a computational study, we show the effectiveness of the solution approach in terms of solution quality and investigate the impact of product variety, cost of capital, and other important parameters on the capacity and inventory decisions. The computational results bring out some key insights—increasing product variety may not result in excessive inventory and even a substantial increase in set-up times or holding costs may not increase the total cost over the horizon in a significant manner due to the ability to acquire additional capacity. We also provide solutions and insights to the real problem that motivated this work. </jats:p>",

In recent years, a large volume of research has concentrated on improving manufacturing performance. Some research has been directed at senior management emphasising the strategic need for change and how to initiate change; other research has been directed at shop floor level and the provision of tools for continuous improvement; whilst more recent research has focused on business process re‐engineering and supporting methodologies. However, there is a very limited set of tools available for middle managers to encapsulate the aspirations of senior management (e.g. the strategic objectives of a company) and translate these into shop floor actions. This paper proposes a methodology to support management of the introduction of new processes, products and systems and to improve the performance of manufacturing systems. The paper presents a case and methodology for an integrated system for strategic, tactical, operational and project planning. The proposed methodology is based on structured systems analysis and simulation of a manufacturing plant. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through application to two small to medium‐sized enterprises.</jats:p>",

As with any other tool, the quantum of benefits obtained from the use of QFD is proportional to the effectiveness of its use. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of QFD as a means to transfer the “voice of the customer” into design and production, a new comprehensive hierarchical framework for QFD planning process and a zero‐one goal programming model for the selection of design requirements are proposed. The hierarchical framework contributes to the strategic guidance and provides clear direction for QFD teams during the construction of the house of quality. The decision model assists in determining a set of design requirements that most effectively meet customer needs subject to limited resources and other organizational restrictions. An illustrative example is also provided to demonstrate the practical usage of the design selection model.</jats:p>",

Understanding their duration structure is thus crucial to modeling their production, which surely differs greatly from fluent phrases. When the duration structure of the entire repetition string of unplanned repetitions is examined, strong global dependencies are found. Repetition strings are words/phrases repeated once or more, together with silent and filled pauses optionally occurring next to them. The main effects are that durations of first and second string items, whether repeated words or pauses, are positively correlated with the duration of the rest of the string; items, whether words or pauses, are shorter as they occur later in the string; and strings that begin with a pause average longer than strings that do not. The study is based on an analysis of 503 disfluent repetitions taken from the ICSI phonetically transcribed sample of the Switchboard conversation corpus, extensively checked and recoded. The results help explain local durational dependencies of the repeated words [Bell and Girand, LabPhon 7 (2000)] and imply that the articulation of repetitions is influenced from the onset by the nature and degree of difficulty they address.</jats:p>",

In the study of causes of the special climate in cities, it is reported that “The total transformation of natural landscape into houses, streets, squares, big public buildings, sky scrapers, and industrial installations has brought about changes in climate of large cities”. Temperature is one of the most important characteristics of urban areas. It is known that urban temperatures differ from those of sub-urban and rural areas. On hot summer days, one can feel the waves of blistering heat emanating from roads and dark buildings, which keep urban areas hot, even long after the sunset, where as rural areas begin to cool rapidly, depending upon topography, geological location, and anthropogenic factors. So urban areas are usually botter than their rural surrounding. This phenomenon is described as the “Urban Heat Islands”. Vegetation has a large impact on micro climate and is considered an efficient mechanism for cooling down the temperature. The various aspects of urban heat island like causes and temperature pattern in urban heat islands, urban and rural temperatures, reasons of increase in urban temperatures and the effects of landscaping on the surrounding climate were studied. Then, to overcome their effects landscaping elements like trees and other vegetation are discussed. To know the presence and to determine the intensity of urban heat island in the cities of Pakistan, a case study of Lahore is also carried out. This paper therefore presents the causes, magnitude and impacts of urban heat islands and suggests the beneficial effects of strategic landscaping on the climate of a particular area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this study an attempt to explore the meaning of open spaces in housing areas of Northern Cyprus has been made and these spaces have been evaluated in terms of adequacy for use by the residents.  A survey conducted on 420 residents from various areas, having people belonging to different age groups and income levels, helped in finding out the extent to which the exterior environment means to them and how they integrate it with their lives. The findings revealed a high level of desire for better integration between the residences and the open spaces around them. However, in many cases due to the poor quality of design, which lacks a sensitivity towards social and cultural values, a majority of residents showed disappointment concerning these spaces. The questionnaire designed for this specific survey comprised of questions regarding general satisfaction of the users with the open spaces, their location, size and design, their relationship with the house and the street, the quality of the greenery, provision for car parking, etc.  While studying the significance of open spaces, this paper focuses on the most common housing patterns in Northern Cyprus, considering the changing qualities of residential development in the last decade.</jats:p>",

Planning for city development, residential establishment, industrial erection, infrastructural development, provisions of utility services are always guided by some prescribed rules and regulations of the country. In Bangladesh, large number of rules and regulations are executing by different government organisations for the development of urban settlements. The present study focuses on the development and development control of urban settlements, authorities who are entitled for execution of the relevant prescribed rules and regulations and the disputes arise during or after the execution of the said rules and regulations. There are different types of residential formations in the urban premises of Bangladesh. Primarily, it may be divided into two parts - government residences (e.g. residences for government employees) and private residences. For both the types, there are different laws that are executed by different authorities. From the viewpoint of prevalent regulatory arrangements of the country, private residences may broadly be divided intofour types-such as community development, high-rise residential buildings, simple private dwellings and related residential units. For the above mentioned residential developments governmental permission is necessary for the private landowners but different laws prescribed for different urban areas and different authorities of Bangladesh. It is noticed that these laws are overlapped, ambiguous and contradictory that hinder proper execution of these laws. To deal with all these issues and disputes some effective guidelines have to be formulated.</jats:p>"

They wield a disproportionately large influence on the comprehensive planning process and on the pattern of decentralisation in the metropolitan areas. Because of this influence, highway departments have been able to purse the narrow objective of accommodating traffic despite attempts by the Congress to redirect transportation goals towards meeting the land-use needs of declining central cities and avoiding the adverse social, economic and environmental impacts of highways. Some of these adverse effects include isolation of central city’s transit-dependent minorities from suburban employment and the creation of a massive dependence on gasoline.  The inertia of this limited purpose highway program has been sustained by massive federal funding, a bureaucratically embedded and technologically intimidating planning methodology, and a system of federal planning and impact reviews whose major effect has been to expedite the approval and construction of highway projects. These token reviews and deficient impact analysis reviews have deprived the public and elected officials of vital information about foreseeable adverse effects, and have unreasonably restricted their ability to judge highway proposals or to make decisions concerning the decentralisation of cities.</jats:p>",

We argue that absolute measures are better suited to testing theories of spatial separation, and introduce a classification procedure which provides a robust approach to comparative studies, directly linked to the homogeneity – heterogeneity continuum which underpins all studies of segregation. The procedure is illustrated by analyses of the five main ethnic groups in each of the largest cities of Australia, New Zealand, and the USA (Sydney, Auckland, and New York). There are substantial differences among those cities in their ethnic residential patterns, to the extent that these can be clearly established given the other difficulties in cross-national comparative studies (data comparability and the spatial scale of the data units): New York is segmented, Sydney is integrated, and Auckland occupies an intermediate position. </jats:p>",

The authors build on this development by showing how a new institutional analysis of policy implementation transcending different politico-geographic scales might be undertaken. Using contemporary public policy theories, they show how new institutional analyses can be fine-tuned to identify common scalar themes for detailed examination at local through to supranational scales. Drawing on a case study of agri-environmental policy implementation in central Spain between 1992 and 1998, the authors use this nuanced new institutional approach to elucidate the flows of knowledge, territorial representation, and power between multiscalar policy elites. They demonstrate how the interplay between the political strategies of these scalar elites, and the presence of ‘historically sedimented’ institutional forms in the central Spanish region of Castilla la Mancha, have shaped local agri-environmental policy outcomes. </jats:p>",

The patient's head was fixed in a stereotactic localization system which is usable in both MR‐systems and linear accelerator installations. Using phantom measurements global geometric MR image distortions can be ‘corrected’ (reducing displacements to the size of a pixel) by calculations based on modeling the distortion as a fourth‐order two‐dimensional polynomial. Further object‐induced local distortions can be corrected by additionally measured field maps. Using this method multimodality matching could be performed automatically as long as all images are acquired in the same examination and the patient is sufficiently immobilized to allow precise definition of the target volume. Information about the hemodynamics of the AVM was provided by a dynamic MRA with the STAR technique, leading to an improved definition of the size of the nidus, the origin of the feeding arteries, whereas HRBV imaging yielded detailed and improved information about the venous pattern and drainage. In addition, functional MRI was performed in patients with lesions close to the primary motor cortex area, leading to an improved definition of structures at risk for the high‐dose application in radiosurgery. In patients with brain tumors the potential of HRBV to probe tumor angiogenesis and its use in intensity‐modulated treatment planning is still hampered by the open question of how to translate a BOLD signal pattern measured in the tumor to a dose distribution, which should be addressed in future studies.

In light of the significant problems and issues affecting cities in North America and Europe there is a growing need for researchers to acquire a better understanding of the process of urban social change. In this paper the author proposes a model of urban deprivation change and applies it with the use of census indicators to East Montréal, a section of the central city, and the Montréal Urban Community. The changing spatial structure and nature of urban deprivation is examined at the neighbourhood level in this study area over the period 1986 – 96. The author finds that urban deprivation is largely an economic problem, with declining conditions apparent throughout a large part of Montréal's central city and in several inner-suburban municipalities. The model, selection of indicators, and statistical techniques presented in this paper can be used as a guide for further research into urban deprivation change in other urban centres. </jats:p>",

In order to accomplish this goal, careful consideration and expertise must be applied to the three primary ingredients of CME planning: assessing learner needs, programme design and outcome measurement. Traditional methods used to address these three components seldom result in CME initiatives that change performance, even in the presence of sophisticated CME formats and capable learners. In part, performance may not change because the learner is not ‘ready to change’. Planners of CME are aware of this concept but have been unable to measure ‘readiness to change’ or employ it in assessing learner needs, and planning and evaluating CME. One theory that focuses on an individual’s readiness to change is Prochaska’s model, which postulates that change is a gradual process proceeding through specific stages, each of which has key characteristics. This paper examines the applicability of this model to all components of CME planning. To illustrate the importance of this model, this paper provides examples of these three components conducted both with and without implementation of this model.</jats:p>",

These organizations now face the challenge of maintaining these costly systems and many are about to make their first upgrade decisions. The study reported herein aims to address the following research questions from the ERP‐client perspective: (1) What are the fundamental factors driving ERP maintenance and upgrade decisions? (2) How do these factors differ from those for traditional custom, in‐house software? and (3) Do existing software and hardware replacement models suffice for ERP maintenance and upgrade decision modeling? A single case study method and empirical data analysis were conducted and are presented here. We observe that ERP maintenance and upgrade characteristics are indeed unique in three ways: (1) most organizations maintain and upgrade their ERP systems in order to realize increased business benefits from the systems; (2) a new version upgrade reduces the number of ERP‐client‐done enhancement modifications; and (3) a new version upgrade potentially reduces future legal change patch (LCP) maintenance distributed by the ERP vendor. It was also found that on average LCP maintenance is almost as costly as <jats:italic>user enhancements</jats:italic>. Based on these findings, we conclude that the existing in‐house software and hardware replacement models are insufficient for ERP situations. We propose a preliminary ERP decision model that overcomes the observed insufficiencies. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well appreciated that demographic trends threaten the integrity of continental European systems of social security. For France these trends imply a long-term financial crisis as well as a crisis of confidence in national economic and social institutions. The payment of social security entitlements is a recurrent and largely unresolved political issue; proposals for comprehensive reform are heavily contested, involving political interests willing to go to the streets. At the same time, governments' incremental changes in benefit formula and accounting have discounted the expected value of future retirement benefits. In this paper, I begin by sketching the logic of pay-as-you-go social security, identifying the basic economic principles and social institutions that sustain such systems. One goal of the paper is to articulate the economic and philosophical roots of social solidarity and the importance of the state as the custodian of the social contract between generations. In doing so, I sketch out the French ideal: a coherent social security system based upon self-reinforcing mutual obligations and institutions. A second goal of the paper is to show how and why the French social security system became unsustainable. Demographic trends have been exacerbated by the use of the retirement system as a form of labour-market compensation policy, thereby undercutting both its financial and its political legitimacy. The third goal of the paper is to indicate how and why global financial markets may play a significant role in resolving the crisis of social security. Basically, I dispute the argument that national systems of social security will persist into the future; internal inconsistencies and the possible defection of those not served by such institutions combined with external opportunities may overturn the past. By making this argument, I do not mean to suggest that the Anglo-American model is necessarily superior to social security systems based on social solidarity. Rather, my point is entirely argumentative: solemn incantations that defend the past, whatever their best intentions, may simply reinforce the nature and significance of the pending crisis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Global migration is transforming not just urban populations, but the nature and economic roles of ethnic banks—that is, banking institutions owned and operated by minorities. Academic research on ethnic banks has until now focused on the circumstances of African-American-owned banks. This paper explores the rise of a new set of ethnic banks—the Chinese American banks of Los Angeles County. These older and newer ethnic banking communities occupy very different roles in the banking market. African-American-owned banks arose largely because mainstream banks' inadequate services in minority communities left unoccupied market ‘niches’. Despite similar origins, the newer generation of Chinese American banks, by contrast, has prospered for two additional reasons. The first is economic globalization. These ethnobanks' resources have grown tremendously both because of migration and cross-border money flows, and also because they have maintained networks extending across national borders. The second is these banks' ability to tap into their communities' extensive social capital—that is, the networks of information, norms, and disciplinary mechanisms that crisscross the Chinese American community. This social capital permits ethnobanks to mobilize resources and direct development in a way that nonethnic banks cannot imitate. We conclude by considering whether the Chinese ethnobanks are a transient phenomenon, and whether other minority banks can adopt their model. </jats:p>",

The BHPS used a multistage stratified clustered sample design for selecting households and individuals. The primary sampling unit was the postcode sector. 250 out of a population of 8951 postcode sectors were selected. A test for the informative nature of the primary sampling units for labour-market behaviour is developed and applied to the BHPS labour-market data. The results suggest that the sample design is not completely ignorable for male and female labour-market behaviour. </jats:p>",

A sample of 152 responses from private sector businesses in three UK historic cities is analysed. Businesses perceive traffic congestion and inadequate public transport provision as key problems. Businesses typically expect the introduction of RUC and WPLs to lead to some non-economic benefits to the city but negative impacts on the urban economy and their own business performance. It is also found that there is a significant threat of businesses relocating away from the urban economy as a response to traffic demand management policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the hierarchical stochastic production planning (HSPP) problem of flexible automated workshops, each with a number of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), the part transfer between which is delayed by a time period (i.e. delay interaction). The problem not only includes uncertainties in the demand, capacities, material supply, processing times, necessity for rework and scrap but also considers multiple products and multiple time periods. The objective is to devise a production plan which tells each FMS how many parts to produce and when to produce them so as to obtain the lowest cost under the condition of demands being just met. Herein, the HSPP problem is formulated by a stochastic non-linear programming model whose constraints (including demand constraints) are linear but whose objective function is piecewise linear. For the convenience of solving the stochastic non-linear programming model above, it is approximately transformed into a deterministic non-linear programming model and further into a linear programming model. Then, Karmarkar's algorithm and an interaction/prediction algorithm are used to solve the model, the former for the medium- or small-scale problems and the latter for the large-scale problems. With the help of the implementations of the above-mentioned algorithms and through many HSPP examples, Karmarkar's algorithm, the interaction/prediction algorithm and the linear programming method in Matlab 5.0 are compared, the result of which shows that the proposed approaches are very effective and suitable for not only ‘push’ production but also ‘pull’ production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A graphical depiction of the entire emergency response process via a synchronization matrix is an effective management too for optimizing the design, exercise, and real-life implementation of emergency plans. This system-based approach to emergency planning depicts how a community organizes its response tasks across space and time. It gives responders the opportunity to make real-time adjustments to maximizing the often limited resources in protecting area residents. An effective response to any natural or technological hazard must involve the entire community and must not be limited by individual jurisdictions and organizations acting on their own without coordination, integration, and synchronization. </jats:p><jats:p> An emergency response to an accidental release of chemical warfare agents from one of this nation's eight chemical weapons stockpile sites, like any other disaster response, is complex. It requires the rapid coordination, integration, and synchronization of multiple levels of governmental and nongovernmental organizations from numerous jurisdictions, each with varying response capabilities, into a unified community response. The community response actions occur in an area extending from an on-site storage location to points 25 or more miles away. Actions are directed and controlled by responding local governments and agencies situated within the response area, as well as by state and federal operations centers quite removed from the area of impact. Time is critical and the protective action decision-making process is greatly compressed. To ensure an effective response with minimal confusion, given the potential catastrophic nature of such releases, the response community must carefully synchronize response operations. </jats:p>",
