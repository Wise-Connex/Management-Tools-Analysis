Language is a potentially powerful missile, and language planning is the weapon through which that missile is fired. Language planning refers to deliberate efforts to influence the language behaviour of others. The promotion of Hebrew as an all-purpose vernacular in late nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Palestine is a notable example. Other well-known instances include efforts to cleanse modern Turkish of Arabic and Persian loan words, the successive switches from Arabic to Latin to Cyrillic script for writing Turkic languages in Soviet Central Asia, the feminist campaign against sex-bias in language usage, the Arabicization movement in North Africa and the Sudan, and the American bilingual-education movement.</jats:p>",

Key considerations in the planning and execution of Piper B directional drilling include:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>the QC of survey records for the original Piper A wells; the quantification of survey errors in the original Piper A surveys; the assignment of error models for the calculation of positional uncertainty; the generation and maintenance of clearance reports.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To date, six directional wells and two sidetracks have been safely drilled through the Piper B template. Strategic site selection and the highest standards of directional well planning and collision avoidance surveillance have been key ingredients of the ongoing and successful redevelopment of the Piper field.</jats:p>",

Inzwischen haben sich aber die Rahmenbedingungen nachhaltig geändert. Die Förderprogramme können z.T. der veränderten Sachlage nicht mehr entsprechen. Demgemäß sind deren Möglichkeiten zur Einflußnahme auf die Entwicklung sowie die Effizienz der eingesetzten Ressourcen zurückgegangen. Von daher bedarf es der Weiterentwicklung von Ansätzen und Instrumentarium. Es spricht einiges dafür, daß zukünftig die Förderung von Maßnahmenbündel bzw. integrierten Maßnahmenkonzeptionen zur Umsetzung komplexer kommunaler Entwicklungsprogramme gegenüber der traditionellen Form der Förderung einzelner Maßnahmen an Gewicht zunimmt.</jats:p>"

Given the close intellectual proximity of international relations to political geography's concerns with geopolitics, these current debates are of great relevance to any attempt to retheorise global politics from the perspective of political geography. Although the recent revival of interest in political geography has led to a considerable interest in rethinking the historiography of the subdiscipline and to reevaluating its tainted past, the necessary accompanying theoretical rethinking has not progressed in a similar fashion. The theoretical issues discussed in the contemporary international relations literature have much to offer political geographers in pursuing this important task. </jats:p>",

Between 1931 and the election victory of 1945, central economic planning was, in the words of G.D.H. Cole, the ‘professed creed of the Labour Party’. Depression and war demonstrated that the anarchy of free-market capitalism had to ‘give way to ordered planning under national control’. Labour won the election of 1945 with a commitment to ‘plan from the ground up’ through the socialization of industry, the establishment of a national investment board and the use of wide-ranging economic controls. Planning was the defining characteristic of Labour's socialism in this period and it could indeed be argued that the party did not find so effective a political rhetoric until ‘Labour and the scientific revolution’ in 1963.</jats:p>",

The basic approach taken in this method is to restrict the free space referred to in path searching and to avoid executing unnecessary collision detections. The configuration space is equally quantized into cells by placing a regular grid, and two new search strategies which enumerate restricted cells are introduced for realizing this method. One is a local strategy which enumerates free space cells only along the boundary of the free space in the configuration space. Another is a global strategy which finds the outer boundary of the free space. This method has been actually implemented and has been applied to an example in a nuclear power plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, variations in the impedance parameter of the conventional spatial interaction models are examined in a quasi-empirical manner. In a previous paper, a spatial demand model based on the translog indirect utility function was simulated to provide interaction data. If the inputs to the translog demand model are varied systematically, the impedance parameter estimates for both models also vary systematically. In general, the impedance parameter becomes less negative as the set of destinations becomes more dispersed, as relative size among the origins and the destinations becomes more varied, and, in particular, as fewer destinations become substitutable or the degree of substitutability decreases. Meanwhile, model performance also deteriorates. The need for skepticism regarding model transferability and parameter interpretation is confirmed, and the possibility of ever correctly specifying the models is questioned. </jats:p>",

Diese erklären sich zum einen aus den sehr unterschiedlichen Verkehrsmengen auf den Straßen und zum anderen aus den völlig verschiedenen Zusammensetzungen des Fahrzeugbestands. Da die DDR-typischen Pkw mit Zweitakt-Motoren erheblich größere Mengen an unverbrannten Kohlenwasserstoffen freisetzen als Viertakt-Pkw, lagen die flächenbezogenen HC-Emissionen in der ehemaligen DDR trotz bedeutend geringerer Verkehrsmengen etwa auf gleichem Niveau wie in den alten Ländern. Andererseits weisen die Zweitakt-Pkw bezüglich Stickoxiden ein günstigeres Emissionsverhalten auf als Viertakt-Pkw.Wie die augenblickliche Entwicklung erkennen läßt, muß in den nächsten Jahren in den neuen Ländern mit einer raschen Annäherung des Verkehrsverhaltens an das der alten Länder gerechnet werden. Wesentlicher Motor hierfür wird die steigende Verfügbarkeit von Individualverkehrsmitteln sein. Daneben muß auch in Westdeutschland mit einer zusätzlichen Steigerung der Verkehrsleistung durch neue West-Ost-Verkehrsströme gerechnet werden. Zwar werden technische Maßnahmen zur Emissionsminderung bis zur Jahrtausendwende trotz Verkehrswachstum eine Verringerung der HC- und der NOX-Emissionen bewirken, aber es ist eine deutliche Zunahme der klimarelevanten CO2-Emissionen zu befürchten.</jats:p>"

The focus is particularly on property interests which are the dominant players in US coalitions. An attempt is first made to disaggregate the interests making up the UK property sector into its component parts. The growth-coalition concept, as applied in the USA, is then examined and brief comment made on the extent of its relevance for the contemporary United Kingdom. The third section is an examination of the key contextual factors which have triggered the development of UK variants of growth coalitions. Fourth, recent empirical work is drawn on to examine the part which various property interests have played and the strategic weight which is attached to property development in a number of recent UK public–private partnership organisations. Last, the implications for the process and impact of urban change are examined and it is asked whether the growth-coalition model, and the role of property within it, is likely to be an enduring feature of UK urban economic and political life through the 1990s. </jats:p>",

To execute the algorithm, the robot design parameters, the geometry and location of the obstacles, and the initial and goal positions of the desired task are required. As a first step, the manipulator workspace is discretized and points inside forbidden regions formed by obstacles and singularities are excluded. An ellipsoidal searchspace is then selected as a part of the workspace to make the network enumeration and path synthesis more efficient. Based on an allowable deviation angle, path segments axe created to form the connectivity network. A path which is optimal with respect to the manipulator kinematic and dynamic properties is generated as a sequence of intermediate points connecting the initial and goal states using Dijkstra’s minimum cost search technique. A computer program has been developed to implement this methodology for three-axis manipulators, and results of the application of this algorithm to some industrial robots are presented.</jats:p>",

This theory paints a picture of the human agent as being constrained by sociohistorical circumstances and yet being fundamentally autonomous. The success of Giddens attempt to transcend the traditional dualism of individual and society seems to have been taken for granted by now. In this paper it is shown that a careful, ‘deconstructive’ scrutiny of key concepts as they appear in Giddens's major texts reveals insurmountable problems inherent in language. Specifically, the categories ‘duality of structure’, ‘practical consciousness’, and ‘mutual knowledge’ are each in their turn required to perform two contradictory tasks: The simultaneous blending and separation of determinism and autonomy. The gist of Giddens's attempts to circumvent this task is outlined through a seemingly thorough consideration of the effects of language, and the continued popularity of structuration theory is speculated on in light of its ultimate failure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A simple decision theory of spatial interaction is proposed in which interaction decisions are postulated to involve a number of distinct factors, relating to properties both of actors and of opportunities, as well as to the spatial separation between them. In particular, it is postulated that favorable conditions for such factors arise as independent random events over space, and that interactions are taken when an appropriate conjunction of such events occurs. Given this theory, the central result of the paper is to show that the asymptotically most probable interaction frequencies predicted by the theory correspond precisely to the solutions of the general interaction model proposed by Alonso. This result thus provides a possible behavioral foundation for the Alonso model, and in particular it yields an explicit behavioral interpretation of its parameters. </jats:p>",

When a robotic manipulator is used for such operations, it is possible to plan the required trajectory in joint space, provided that the inverse kinematic problem has been solved for the initial and final configurations — and possibly for a lift-off and a set-down configuration — and that the workspace is free of obstacles. Polynomial solutions to this problem can be found in the literature. However, they usually provide continuity up to the second derivative only, leading to a discontinuous jerk. The solutions derived in this paper preserve the continuity of the third derivative of the joint coordinates, thereby ensuring smooth trajectories with smooth variations of the actuator currents. Moreover, whenever possible, unique polynomial expressions valid between the initial and final configurations are used in order to simplify the logic. Polynomial formulations without lift-off and set-down configurations are first presented. Then, these intermediate configurations are introduced, leading to a new set of solutions. A global algorithm is then discussed in order to clearly indicate the relationship between the different solutions. Finally, an example illustrating the application to a pick-and-place operation is solved.</jats:p>",

However, there are many situations in which the decisionmaker chooses the choice set, thereby making the independence assumption implausible. For example, if information about alternatives is costly, an individual may choose to learn in detail about only a small group of them. This paper is concerned with the modeling of discrete choice with endogenous choice sets. It is assumed that costly information forces the decisionmaker to acquire detailed knowledge of only a small group of alternatives that she or he selects.

However, auditing standards do not specify how the auditor is to achieve an appropriate balance between these two conflicting objectives. This paper presents a multiple criteria decision‐making (MCDM) model of an audit planning decision in which an effectiveness vs. efficiency trade‐off is required. The key advantage of the MCDM model developed here is that an optimal solution is obtained without requiring ex ante specification of a loss function by the auditor. Thus, the model addresses a previously recognized problem (e.g., Menzefricke, 1984) that loss functions may vary depending on characteristics of the audit. In this paper, we develop a model of the auditor's sampling plan selection problem incorporating multiple decision criteria, use the model under a variety of simulated audit conditions, and compare our results with previous research.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Résumé. </jats:bold> Le vérificateur doit parvenir à un compromis entre les pertes pouvant être occasionnées à la fois par l'inefficacité (non‐détection d'erreurs commises par l'entreprise cliente) et l'inefficience.

Les auteurs proposent un modèle de dècision à critères multiples qui s'applique à la décision de planification de la vérification exigeant un compromis efficacité‐efficience. Le principal avantage de ce modèle est qu'il permet d'obtenir une solution optimale sans exiger la formulation ex ante par le vérificateur d'une fonction de perte. Le modèle porte done sur une question sur laquelle se sont déjà penchés les chercheurs (Menzefricke, 1984, par exemple): les fonctions de perte peuvent varier selon les caractéristiques de la vérification. Les auteurs élaborent ici un modèle qui s'applique au problème de sélection par le vérificateur d'un plan d'échantillonnage incorporant des critères de décision multiples. Ils utilisent le modèle en simulant diverses situations de vérification et comparent les résultats obtenus avec ceux des travaux précédents.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Deveiopment planning in India, as in other developing\n      countries, has generally been aimed at fostering an\n      industrially-oriented policy as the engine of economic growth. This\n      one-sided economic development, which results in capital formation,\n      creation of urban elites, and underprivileged social classes of a modern\n      society, has led to distortions in the social structure as a whole. On\n      the contrary, as a result of this uneven economic development, which is\n      narrowly measured in terms of economic growth and capital formation, the\n      fruits of development have gone to the people according to their\n      economic power and position in the social structure: those occupying\n      higher positions benefiting much more than those occupying the lower\n      ones. Thus, development planning has tended to increase inequalities and\n      has sharpened divisive tendencies. Victor S. D'Souza, an eminent Indian\n      sociologist, utilizing the Indian census data of 1961, 1971, and 1981,\n      examines the problem of structural inequality with particular reference\n      to the Indian Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes - the two most\n      underprivileged sections of the present Indian society which, according\n      to the census of 1981, comprised 15.75 percent and 7.76 percent of\n      India's population respectively. Theoretically, he takes the concept of\n      development in a broad sense as related to the self-fulfIlment of the\n      individual. The transformation of the unjust social structure, the\n      levelling down of glaring economic and social inequalities, and the\n      concern for the development of the underprivileged are for the author\n      the basic elements of a planned development.

The four policies examined in the paper cover the areas of landownership, Jewish settlement, municipal boundaries, and unauthorised dwelling construction. These policies are shown to pursue the goal of controlling the Arab minority through territorial containment, in an attempt to maintain political stability, that is, prevent the possibility of irredentism. However, the detailed analysis of Arab reactions to the implementation of the four policies shows that the long-term influence of these land-use policies may be counterproductive: Arab reactions have become increasingly militant, thereby challenging Jewish control and political stability. </jats:p>",

Despite the rhetoric, however, few cities have yet taken firm action to control traffic. This inaction does not reflect a lack of suitable techniques and technologies so much as a concern over the degree of public support, either for the consequences of catering for the car (for example, housing demolition) or of restraining it. Twelve recent opinion surveys in the United Kingdom on public awareness of traffic-related problems and support for different solutions are examined. Despite differences in methodology, the overall findings are consistent and clear. These are presented and assessed, and the implications for urban transport policy are discussed. </jats:p>",

This algorithm assumes no previous knowledge of the workspace and is capable of dealing with arbitrarily shaped obstacles with arbitrary motion characteristics. The concept of feasible circle is introduced to determine an obstacle-free subspace around the robot using information which can be obtained from distance sensors. This algorithm employs a unified approach and the modified Lagrange Multiplier method of optimization. A variable penalty, based on the distance of approach is used to keep the robot away from obstacles and the concepts of artificial obstacles and virtual obstacles are introduced to simplify the representation of the known workspace and to control the path of the robot. It is shown that the algorithm is general and can handle concave obstacles, overlapping obstacles, crowded workspaces as well as convex obstacles. The flexibility of the algorithm enables it to be easily integrated with different control strategies. The computational complexity is considerably less than for many existing algorithms, which makes the algorithm attractive for real-time applications. The algorithm is further extended to dynamic obstacles of arbitrary shapes and motion characteristics. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

In this paper the author addresses one particular issue: Rural planning objectives in Romania following the dramatic end to the quarter-century Ceauşescu epoch in December 1989. After referring to the ideological thrust of rural planning under socialism in general and Ceauşescu's leadership in particular the author concentrates on the radical demographic changes arising from the decline of employment in agriculture with only limited priority for the provision of alternative work in the countryside. Rural–urban migration has arguably been increased by discouragement of small-scale private enterprise in favour of large urban-based projects preferred by the central planning system. Following the revolution a swing towards privatisation should focus greater attention on the potentials of the rural areas, and the abandonment of Ceauşescu's draconian scheme of consolidation for rural settlement should encourage greater investment in outlying communities. </jats:p>",

Eight subjects performed a strategic planning “rescue” video game, which required them to make a series of choices regarding which node to “fly to” in order to rescue simulated casualties. After making each choice, subjects needed to fly a challenging tracking dynamics along a path to reach the next “node” in the decision space where the casualties were “rescued.” The dynamics along each path could be at one of four levels of difficulty. The difficulty determined the probability that the corridor would be flown successfully and therefore casualties rescued at the other end. To maximize their score, subjects had to consider the number of casualties at each node, the length of the path to the node (the shorter the better), and the probability they would fly the path successfully (an estimate of their own performance based on past experience). Periodically subjects were asked to give explicit estimates of those probabilities, such data provided in order for us to evaluate the calibration of estimated with true probability of success. Half the flights were flown with restricted preview of only the two nodes of the immediate choice. The other half offered full preview of the whole map. </jats:p><jats:p> The results revealed that (a) subjects' decisions were less optimal when full preview was offered, (b) this deficiency appeared to result because full preview led subjects to rely too much on the simple strategy of choosing routes with most casualties, and neglecting the use of more abstract probability values in guiding their choices, (c) subjects appeared to be well calibrated in their confidence of traversing paths correctly </jats:p>",

The sample of producer services firms in the Auckland region are characterised by a narrow income base, a lack of innovative activity, a propensity to expand via branch offices rather than through local investment, and close links with inward investment.

The presence of an outside good, which does not incur transport or inventory costs, is shown to affect the market area and price of the shopping good according to the relative preference between the goods. The price of the outside good has no effect on the market area and equilibrium price of the shopping good when the utility function is of a simple Bergson type. The generalization to a model where leisure is a source of utility, and where shopping time and working time reduce the amount of leisure, yields richer results. In particular, not only do relative preferences affect the price and market area for the shopping good, but also the wage rate affects demands and prices. Variations in the time required to travel to the shop and the time needed to do the shopping are shown to have opposite effects on the equilibrium market area and prices. Numerical calculations of elasticities of market areas and prices show that variations in all time-related parameters have an important impact and hence should not be ignored in modelling the factors which determine the size of a spatial market. </jats:p>",

Given the profound changes in the world in the past few years, the basis for planners' analysis has not changed: strategy and force structure designed to enhance deterrence at reasonable and acceptable costs. Planners require new and refined guidance to move into uncharted post-Cold War waters. Military planners should call upon resources provided by arms control initiatives. Arms control offers the opportunity to negotiate parity at the lowest practical levels and to develop strategies and force structures with a relatively high assurance of success against potential enemies. The Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Conventional Forces in Europe, and Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaties offer unique opportunities to apply arms control agreements to enhance defense planners' efforts. Future treaties should be shaped by defense needs as well as by arms control theories and broader foreign policy concerns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of (a) ongoing, systematic assessment of student growth (i.e., curriculum-based measurement) and (b) expert system instructional consultation on teacher planning and student achievement in the area of mathematics operations. Thirty-three teachers were assigned randomly to treatment groups: curriculum-based measurement (CBM) with expert system instructional consultation (CBM-ExS), CBM with no expert system instructional consultation (CBM-NExS), and control (i.e., no CBM). Teachers implemented treatments for 20 weeks. Analyses indicated that, compared to the control group, both CBM groups appeared to revise students’ instructional programs more frequently. However, only the CBM-ExS group effected superior student achievement. Analysis of the nature of teachers’ instructional adjustments indicated that the teaching revisions of the CBM-ExS teachers incorporated a dual focus on what types of problems to teach and what strategies to employ for teaching. By contrast, the CBM-NExS teachers focused solely on what types of problems to reteach. Findings are discussed in terms of previous studies of teacher planning and implications for practice. </jats:p>",
