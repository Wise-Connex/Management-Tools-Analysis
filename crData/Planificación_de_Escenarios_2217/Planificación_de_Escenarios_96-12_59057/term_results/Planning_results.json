      "abstract": "<jats:p> Funding constraints and increased criticism of institutions of higher education are forcing many universities to reformulate their missions or develop new strategic plans. For a variety of reasons urban issues appear prominently in the new mission statements of universities. This article explores the extent of this new urban emphasis and its reflection in proposed new university structures, processes, and programs. Because urban planning is the academic discipline most explicitly and specifically concerned with urban areas, one might expect urban planning departments to play a lead role in these redefinitions of mission and new initiatives and take advantage of their knowledge base to advance their standing in the institutions. A survey of universities that have engaged in strategic planning and mission formulation shows, however, that the role of urban planning departments is fairly limited. The article concludes with a discussion of possible explanations for this limited role and an identification of areas of opportunity. </jats:p>",

There is little research on local officials' support for state planning efforts, despite the considerable evidence that their attitudes can influence policy outcomes. A survey of California mayors and city planning directors shows strong support for state planning efforts, though more in the domains of \"system maintenance\" functions (e.g., water, transportation) than for \"life style\" functions (e.g., land use, police). Resistance to regional planning efforts is found, however. City planning directors look more favorably toward having the state government, rather than regional governments, involved in planning efforts. Local officials give support to only minor roles for the regional-level components of state planning. </jats:p>",

Writing as a discovery technique, not merely as a communication tool, is promoted. In a course titled Landscape Planning and Design in Rural Environments, students choose and refine a topic, prepare multiple drafts, receive and give peer review, complete a final manuscript, and submit their work for publication to a self-selected audience. This technique has been evaluated positively by students and has improved students' research and writing. Several student papers have been published. This technique can be applied in a broad range of courses in planning and design. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental economics involve techniques for monetary valuations of environmental resources. But environmental problems raise fundamental questions of social, political and environmental organization. This article mirrors in economics the `cross-over' of Left and Right suggested by Giddens. Positive economics leads to notions of planning, not to laissez-faire and makes evident Habermas's view of the `scientization' of politics. Positive economics contains an implicit political theory of technocracy. Economics cannot conceive of social resources, and views environmental resources as externalities. It attempts to obtain money valuations for non-traded resources. Essentially, this is a planning supplement to markets and it is unclear how both markets and planning supplement can be justified simultaneously. Environmental questions are also ethical. We act as citizens in considering them. They are less suited to markets than to a public forum which requires justification in terms of the collective welfare and involves a process of dialogue between citizens. </jats:p>",

Although essentially informal, this system had a well-defined set of internal rules, rights, and sanctioning mechanisms that evolved over several decades in response to a changing external environment. Attempts by the municipal authorities to \"modernize\" waste collection in Cairo by issuing licenses to large corporate contractors amounted to a confrontation between its legal regulatory authority and the existing informal system. After a process of contestation, mediation, negotiation, and adjustment, a new arrangement emerged in which the informal service providers selectively adopted institutional forms that could be legally recognized by municipal authorities, while retaining the personalized and flexible practices that were central to their informal system. </jats:p>",

What is needed are methodologies that can be used by planners to assess the degree of impact their plans have had on actual urban development and, perhaps more important, on the achievement of planning goals. Such methods would differ from existing evaluation research in that the focus would be on assessing what has in fact occurred in the built environment, rather than on evaluating various plan alternatives before implementation. In this paper, I outline various plan assessment methods that delineate how one particular aspect of plans-identifying where public facilities are to be located—can be evaluated. </jats:p>",

Other informalization trends in formal subdivisions such as noncompliance with building codes (induced by amnesty laws), and formalization trends in gecekondu settlements such as commercialization and densification (accelerated by municipal regularization programs and land pressures) depict the convergence. </jats:p>",

Points out that, since line extension is by far the most common branding strategy for new products, it is important that managers develop their understanding of the effect and that little empirical work has been published on the subject. Defines cannibalization and examines three techniques which managers might use to measure it. Tests gains loss analysis, duplication of purchase tables and deviations from expected share movements on consumer panel data relating to three line extensions in the UK and German detergent markets. Presents results showing cannibalization of the parent brand by all three extensions and suggesting the need for managers to use multiple methods when evaluating the degree of cannibalization. Emphasizes the need to sample over time, since the extent of cannibalization is shown to be dynamic.</jats:p>",

Posits that the new procedure is based on the notion that a project can be partitioned into a number of sections and there is no obligation to use a single policy all the way through all the sections of project. Shows that this research is also an attempt to bridge the gap between the theory and practice by eliminating the question of which priority rule to use for which project. Develops a new model showing that selecting from a number of priority rules is not required and, using the measures of performance introduced, decides on a suitable schedule from the schedules produced under varied assumptions is shown to be much easier. Concludes with suggestions for further research.</jats:p>",

Such a conceptualization derives narrowly from the attributes of the components of an enterprise instead of from consideration of all components in toto. As such, intervention is skewed toward the social component, since the closed technical system is perceived as a ‘given’. Conceptualizing organizations in terms of ‘competing constituent objectives and conflicting value paradigms’ provides an alternative problem-solving approach for the socio-technical consultant. Development of organizational policy as a boundary function between ‘workers’ and ‘owners’ provides such an alternative, and must be fully embraced by both in order to be effective. It is here that the socio-technical consultant has the greatest opportunity to make a meaningful contribution.</jats:p>",

The standard includes a set of deterministic prediction methods, which it suggests may be used for this purpose. However, there seems to be little evidence that they are so used, probably because of the precise data and comprehensive application required to provide useful results. These data requirements are examined, in conjunction with the timing of the generation of information in pre-contract activities, to show that the level of detail necessary is not available. The various calculations involved, and the complexity of the construction process, are described briefly to illustrate the prohibitive amount of work that may be necessary for comprehensive application. The paper concludes that deterministic methods are not effectively usable in this context, and suggests some areas for study that may be helpful. </jats:p>",

The standard involves only five required elements, spans less than five pages, and upon initial review, appears relatively uncomplicated. As well, many of the ISO 14001 requirements may already be present in an organization's existing EMS. Nevertheless, the new standard presents a number of challenges to industry implementation. Whether an organization aims to start from scratch in developing an EMS under ISO 14001 or modify its existing EMS to meet the ISO challenge, implementation requires careful planning and analysis.</jats:p><jats:p>This article provides a summary of the planning required to implement ISO 14001 at the facility level, including the initial planning effort and the identification of significant environmental impacts, objectives, and targets. The aim will be to eliminate some of the “hype” associated with ISO and provide some practical “how to” guidance for implementing the standard. The discussion begins with an overview of the initial planning effort and then turns to key planning requirements.</jats:p>",

First, ways in which pre-startup planning can facilitate survival are delineated. Then, contextual conditions that can limit these impacts are described. Finally, suggestions are offered which show how this view can be used to guide future research and extend the body of knowledge. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In spite of the recent proliferation of theoretically informed writings on all things ‘cyber,’- it remains the case that much of the literature on ‘electronic spaces’ is characterised by a strong current of technological determinism. That is to say, it assumes and reproduces a stable and matter-of-fact distinction between the material/technical and the social such that changes in the former are supposed somehow to ‘impact’ on the latter. In those accounts which eschew this position, authors tend to employ an approach towards technology that might broadly be termed social constructionist. After Latour, I argue that, in that they operate according to the same ‘logic’, both these positions—technological determinism and social constructionism—remain within a ‘modern’ worldview. I propose that if we are to (and I argue that we must) tell stories of a world in which what the moderns refer to as the ‘material’ and the ‘social’ are always already bound together, always already binding together, we require other vocabularies than those which divide and ‘black box’ the world into easy categories, vocabularies that are able to grant all sorts of things their rightful place in the (co)construction of the world. Drawing on a variety of writers, I suggest that one element of these other vocabularies might be what I term a ‘materialist semiotics’. Having elaborated certain strands of what this could mean, I offer some tentative accounts of what our ‘virtual geographies’ might look like from an a modern perspective. </jats:p>",

In this paper, data were analyzed by using the contingent valuation technique, and a functional relationship based on the willingness to pay (WTP) of pollutees was established. Variance analysis and regression models provided support for the diminishing marginal WTP theory. Moreover, the contribution ratio, the area given over to nonirrigated dry land, and income from animal and dairy products are statistically meaningful variables in addition to total income and the area given over to vegetable production. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent call for the reorientation of analysis in medical geography to more critical approaches has been met with both enthusiasm and caution. Critical theories of health and health care services are emerging, which complement the well-developed focus on the spatial aspects of disease and service delivery. Yet in reconceptualising the links between place, space, and health, care must be taken in theorising in context experiences of health and illness. By context we mean the richly textured social formation wherein social relations are threads of a tapestry woven together. One topic which lends itself to such an inquiry is how material and discursive bodies combine to create identities for women with chronic illness around issues of gender and (dis)ability within the context of the wider social political economy. In this paper, we propose a feminist political economic analysis of environment and body as an addition to the critical frameworks emerging in medical geography. We first discuss what a radical body politics entails conceptually. Then we make suggestions with regard to undertaking such inquiry, using in illustration empirical work on women's reshaping of their environment in response to chronic illness. This type of investigation extends previous work on the formation of women's identities, experiences of chronic illness, and the materiality of everyday life. Last, we recast the concepts of environment, body, and identity formation while maintaining a commitment to the fluidity of conceptual and material boundaries. </jats:p>",

This article offers a suggested approach for special schools to study their purpose and the means or process by which they conduct their work in the education of the deaf, the blind, and the sensory multi-disabled. In conducting a strategic plan for a special school it sets a future course for the school that can transform the school from what is to what must be.</jats:p>",

Unfortunately, the motion of a pushed object is generally unpredictable due to unknown support friction forces. With multiple pushing contact points, however, it is possible to find pushing directions that cause the object to remain fixed to the manipulator. These are called stable pushing directions. In this article we consider the problem of planning pushing paths using stable pushes. Pushing imposes a set of nonholonomic velocity constraints on the motion of the object, and we study the issues of local and global controllability during pushing with point contact or stable line contact. We describe a planner for finding stable pushing paths among obstacles, and the planner is demon strated on several manipulation tasks. </jats:p>",

The fundamental algorithm adopted here is composed of solving large-scale linear programming (LP) master problems by the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method and small-scale MILP subproblems by the branch and bound method, and these problems are solved repeatedly until an optimality or suboptimality criterion is satisfied. As one of the revision strategies to improve computation efficiency, a two-phase approach is introduced, by which a next LP master problem can be solved efficiently by utilizing the results of a previous one. An illustrative example on a heat supply system for district heating and cooling is given to show the effectiveness of the above revision strategy. A practical example on a heat supply system with multiple thermal storage tanks for brewing is also presented.</jats:p>",

Little empirical research has been undertaken, however, to evaluate this prediction. Accordingly, we used McFarlan, McKenney, and Pyburn's (1983) strategic‐grid model to study the information systems planning problems encountered by 49 governmental agencies. Twenty‐seven agencies were required to follow a planning approach best suited to organizations that had a high level of dependence on both their existing and proposed systems. We predicted that agencies not having these characteristics would encounter the most problems with the approach. The remaining 22 agencies could choose their own planning approach. We studied this latter group to determine whether the problems encountered by the first group could be attributed to the mandated approach. Overall, the empirical results obtained were equivocal. Some results indicated that more planning problems were encountered by agencies in which the mandated approach was not appropriate to their position in the strategic grid. Other results were not supportive of this proposition. More work needs to be undertaken, therefore, to evaluate the predictive and explanatory power of contingency models of information systems planning. In addition, our research indicates a need to develop more rigorous theories of information systems planning behaviors, to improve the instruments needed to measure these behaviors, to explore the relationship between information systems planning behaviours and organizational effectiveness, to investigate how organizational learning impacts planning behaviors, and to determine the types of information systems planning problems that diffuse through organizations and those that remain localized.</jats:p>",

Taiwanese direct investment in southern China represents a case where transnational capital flows are shaped by cultural and institutional conditions. The effectiveness of Taiwanese direct investment in southern China is achieved through the interpersonal networks established between Taiwanese investors and local Chinese officials. Such networks, in turn, are based on two major conditions. First, the newly gained economic autonomy of local governments in southern China, as well as the Chinese bureaucratic tradition of flexible interpretation and implementation of laws. Such an institutional context provided the space for the local state in China to bypass the scrutiny of the central state and to link up with the world economy directly through overseas Chinese capitals. Second, cultural and linguistic affinity between the Taiwanese investors and local Chinese officials have provided the tools for establishing interpersonal networks between Taiwanese investors and Chinese local officials through the principle of gift exchange. </jats:p>",

In working through a body of literature commonly grouped together under the collective phrase ‘science, technology, and society’, and in seeking to work upon empirical research on electricity networks, the author draws attention to the ontological and representational issues that are confronted when thinking through geographies of technology and geographies of techno-scientific knowledge. In the first part of the paper the ontological status of nonhumans and the politics of representation are discussed as a consequence of a rejection of technical and social determinisms. In the second part, the author turns to review some of the analytical metaphors that are conjured with in order to address the issues raised in the first part. In the third part of the paper the more overtly spatial metaphors of the literature of science, technology, and society are confronted and the move from a measured and ordered managerialist approach to the spatiality of technologies and technoscience is reviewed. In the fourth section, some lessons for the politics of a reconfigured geographical engagement with technology and technoscience are raised. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent years has seen increasing academic concern with constructions of authenticity, much of it focused upon the travel industry and the emergence of the ‘real holidays’ market in particular. Of appeal to independent travellers moving off the beaten track, such holidays have been located within a sociology of tourism that draws strict distinctions between the desires and activities of an independent traveller, drawn from the new cultural class, and working-class package tourists. Here it is suggested that accounts tracing the emergence of this market have tended to conflate two often related, but analytically distinct, discourses of authenticity which, when held apart, undermine the usual tourist typologies and considerably extend our understandings of the search for authenticity. Drawing upon qualitative interviews undertaken both with ‘travellers’ and with ‘tourists’ it is suggested that our understandings of this search be extended, to consider the ways in which a concern for authenticity is negotiated by a range of tourists enjoying a variety of holidays. Offering a critical intervention in debates around authenticity I champion a method capable of mapping the ambiguities of individual experience, rather than forcing that experience through the restrictive categories of various ideal types. </jats:p>",

S.N.B. is nearly mid-way through the process with a tentative schedule and target of 15 February 1997 to have the first draft of the system ready for review, approval and implementation by 1 April 1997.The experience continues to be one of many challenges, not only for the woodlot owner organizations and the woodlot owners themselves, but for the many other stakeholders who have been or will be provided the opportunity to participate. The CSA Protocol provides one of the first frame-works for all the players to \"walk their talk\" in the real management of a real forest with everyone's interests being facilitated. It also provides the players with the opportunity to demonstrate that they do know what they are talking about and to share that understanding with others to achieve the balances required within sustainable limits.The CSA Protocol provides challenges in itself. Staying \"true to the process\" may be the secret to addressing those challenges. In this presentation we shall examine these challenges more specifically. </jats:p>",

All these elements have been found from a case study of the creation and implementation of a music festival in a city in southern France (Montpellier).

In this paper we suggest that our understanding of retail processes will be aided by devoting explicit attention to the role of interorganisational power in shaping the commercial environment of the retail sector. Regrettably, many notions of power are undertheorised and static. In particular there is a tendency to treat power as a commodity that may be ‘bought’ rather than as dynamic and relational. We therefore suggest that a modified version of Clegg's model of circuits of power can add a much-needed dynamic element to a new retail geography. The circuits of power framework is applied to a case study from UK food retailing. The approach clarifies the underlying and inherently dynamic processes of power-based inequality that are driving change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A fully self-organizing neural network approach to low-dimensional control problems is described. We consider the problem of learning to control an object and solving the path planning problem at the same time. Control is based on the path planning model that follows the gradient of the stationary solution of a diffusion process working in the state space. Previous works are extended by introducing a self-organizing multigrid-like discretizing structure to represent the external world. Diffusion is simulated within a recurrent neural network built on this multigrid system. The novelty of the approach is that the diffusion on the multigrid is fast. Moreover, the diffusion process on the multigrid fits well the requirements of the path planning: it accelerates the diffusion in large free space regions while still keeps the resolution in small bottleneck-like labyrinths along the path. Control is achieved in the usual way: associative learning identifies the inverse dynamics of the system in a direct fashion. To this end there are introduced interneurons between neighboring discretizing units that detect the strength of the steady-state diffusion and forward control commands to the control neurons via modifiable connections. This architecture forms the Multigrid Position-and-Direction-to-Action (MPDA) map. The architecture integrates reactive path planning and continuous motion control. It is also shown that the scheme leads to population coding for the actual command vector. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recognising the use of food retailers' own-labels as a particular form of competitive strategy, I seek to show how such a strategy is embedded within the very different retailing environments of the United Kingdom and USA. It is argued that power relations in the production—consumption chain, which have been influenced by regulation, have favoured the retailers in the United Kingdom more than they have in the USA. This appears to have allowed the UK food retailers to execute own-label strategic action which has ‘creatively destroyed’ the preexisting configuration of power, competitive behaviour, and cultural relations in the production—consumption chain. The US retailers, in contrast, have been restricted to quantitatively lower levels of own-label trading and strategy which has been qualitatively more rigid and conservative. It is suggested, then, that power relations produced in different national contexts can either constrain or enable retailers in their ability to formulate and execute own-label strategies which are a part of the complex logic of capital which characterises retailing. Therefore, given a continued period of deregulation in the USA, and an erosion of manufacturer power, retail capital is likely to develop more along the lines of the UK system and generate own-label strategies with similar economic and cultural significance to those in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

These are important questions for understanding how organizations relate to their environment and for understanding U.S. society.

The authors examine the use of twenty hardware-based and organizational new manufacturing technologies, aggregate use of technology, and plans for future use of technology. Multivariate regression analyses indicate that larger, export-oriented, branch plants that manufacture products in long production runs, and plants that are located in counties with a sizeable manufacturing sector adopt more new technologies than do other types of plants. The results also suggest that there is a role for further government policy in encouraging plant modernization. Although participation in a state technology-assistance program is not yet associated with higher aggregate levels of use of new technology, it is found to be associated with the adoption of specific technologies and receptivity to investment in new technology. The results of the study also confirm the value of training and suggest that a strategy of targeting smaller and medium-sized plants with services focused on multiple clustered locations may be effective in stimulating the use of new technology among these manufacturers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this and a previous paper, work by geographers that is based on the idea that we are in a period of transition to an epoch of flexible accumulation, or post-Fordism, is examined. It is argued that this thesis relies on abstracting the technical and organisational aspects of current restructuring from its value relations. An account which includes value relations shows that the phenomena said to characterise flexible accumulation are more contradictory and unstable, more varied, and more open to struggle than is supposed in work in which a new epoch is assumed. In this second part of the study internal regimes of regions, the relations between regions, and regulation of national space economies are discussed. It is argued that the politics flowing from the flexible accumulation accounts oscillate between fatalism and utopianism, and that an approach based on value relations is able to provide a clearer basis for political struggle. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The anxieties and fears of shoppers in the traditional shopping centres of Britain have emerged as an important aspect of the process of retail decline. Central and local government, and commercial interests in the retail sector, have responded to this challenge with the introduction of enhanced security and improved design and management strategies to combat the growing problem. However, policy initiatives have not been firmly based on the perceptions of shoppers. The authors seek to redress this imbalance by analysing consumer surveys undertaken in Cardiff and Swansea to examine the scale and nature of shopper anxieties. Although anxieties had not yet reached crisis levels, considerable causes for concern were identified which related to environmental deterioration, incidents of antisocial behaviour, and fears for the safety of shoppers' cars. Peripherality and isolation were particularly associated with the generation of fears in a variety of situations on the streets, in car parks, and in transport termini. Conversely, the advantages of a compact city centre, and improvements to the shopping environment and car parking facilities all served to reduce shoppers' anxieties and to maximise the attractions of city-centre shopping. The authors conclude that the investigation of strategies designed to maintain a safe shopping environment in British city centres warrants continued attention.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The study of human—nature relationships has long been central to geographic inquiry. Recent attempts to reconcile the growing demands of the international economy with the equally important concerns about environmental protection can be seen as one challenge to the dominant construction of human—nature relationships. Attempts to ‘green trade’ are well illustrated in the debate about the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the environment. This paper presents three arguments. First, the growing influence of the environmental movement in the USA during the past twenty-five years has embedded concern for the environment in political culture. This ‘politics of the environment’ is exemplified in NAFTA's explicit goal of promoting sustainable development. Including sustainable development as a specified goal thus provided environmentalists a legitimate entry into the NAFTA debate over free trade, development, and environmental protection. Second, it is argued that the NAFTA debate highlights several trade—environment dilemmas, dilemmas which must be addressed in order to reconcile economics and the environment. Particular attention will be paid to the debate about NAFTA and environmental sovereignty. Third, the NAFTA debate brought together two distinct communities: free traders and environmentalists. Far from being two exclusive communities, in this paper I assert that economics and the environment must be seen as interdependent forces which will increasingly interact with each other. In the case of NAFTA, these two communities not only interacted with each other, they created a common ground which made supporting NAFTA acceptable to both interest groups. The creation of a common ground took place through negotiation, debate, and compromise, and thus is a fundamental engagement with human—nature constructions. I conclude that we can expect the environmental community to participate in future trade and development issues because environmentalists now see these areas as critical to reconciling economic—environment and human—nature relationships. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent efforts to protect biodiversity in the United States often reproduce the literal and figurative divisions of space that have originally endangered target species. Nature as redefined by these efforts is as much a social construction as it is some biophysical entity under siege by humans, We focus on the categorical and spatial distinctions between landscapes prioritized for protection and landscapes given less priority or ignored altogether. These distinctions, we wish to demonstrate, reflect pragmatic considerations of habitat quality and political expediency, but they also are enmeshed in dualist nature–culture ideologies that serve to legitimate and ultimately to reproduce the different practices that occur on these landscapes. We focus on protection of spotted owl habitat, one of the most important cases of biodiversity conservation in the United States since the passage of the Endangered Species Act. We consider recent spotted owl protection efforts in the Pacific Northwest and southern California. In the Pacific Northwest, spotted owl protection plans on public forests have been cited as justification for casing habitat protection on private lands, in spite of the major historical biodiversity role of these forestlands. In California, spotted owl policy deliberations for the urbanized forests of southern California have lagged far behind those in the Sierra Nevada, even though owl populations have declined faster in southern California than anywhere else in the state. These cases are indicative of a nature epistemologically understood and ontologically constructed as separate from culture, of what Latour would call an act of purification set up against the undeniably hybrid character of nature–cultures in late modernity. It is precisely this recognition of nature–culture intertwining, however, that will prove central to the creation of sustaining habitats for nonhuman life. </jats:p>",

Phylogenetic diversity indicates the biological variety present in a set of species by reference to the phylogenetic relationships amongst the species. A new diversity measure is proposed which for a given group indicates how well a given set of extant taxa represent the group as a whole. The new measure is called the phylogenetic moment, and is related to the p-median definition of locational efficiency in location—allocation analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> Several analytical techniques for the new measure are described: an evaluation procedure, an heuristic optimisation procedure designed to select a representationally efficient set of taxa, and an exact algorithm for the special case where only one taxon is to be selected. The authors describe the application of the procedures in conservation planning for Australian bat fauna, and report the results of performance tests on a variety of other data sets. Because of their efficient performance and modest storage requirements, the procedures are well suited to the analysis of large taxonomic trees. </jats:p>",

Results from a hypothetical case study indicate that useful solutions for the expansion planning of waste management facilities can be generated. The decision alternatives obtained from the GHSJ solutions may be interpreted and analyzed to internalize environmental–economic tradeoffs, which may be of interest to solid waste decision makers faced with difficult and controversial choices.

Model inputs include the set of risk points and the likely spill scenarios and response requirements for each, the sites of existing storage locations and the inventory of components at each, and potential sites for new storage locations. The model prescribes a minimum total cost plan to either build new storage locations, expand existing ones, or both, to purchase new components and pre‐position them, and a contingency plan that determines which response systems should be composed to enable an effective time‐phased response for each likely spill scenario. A family of heuristics based on linear programming (LP) is devised to resolve this strategic problem, providing an area‐wide contingency plan. The heuristics are evaluated on a set of 10 test problems that involve 1869 general integer variables and 3264 constraints. Computational tests indicate that four heuristics are quite effective, prescribing solutions for each of 10 test cases within 1.41% of optimum and within a few minutes runtime. This study focused on modeling the Galveston Bay Area, and the test problems represent application in that area. A sensitivity analysis is demonstrated by assessing the impacts of component availability and the degradation of cleanup capability over time. Use of the model as a decision support aid by responsible parties, contractors, governmental organizations and others is described.</jats:p>",

This article uses a survey of over 700 citizens designed to provide an information foundation for comprehensive park and recreation planning to test for and profile tax‐demand discontinuity. Using combined scores on summated measures of willingness to pay taxes and demand for public investment, citizens are typologically classified into nine groups that are then consolidated under three classifications of tax‐demand discontinuity. Citizen‐assignments include traditionalists, or those with continuity or balance between willingness to pay taxes and demand; philanthropists, those who are willing to pay taxes in excess of demand; and free‐riders, citizens with demands that exceed willingness to pay taxes. Differences in assessments of local government performance are examined in relationship to tax‐demand discontinuity classifications indicating that productivity alone will not resolve issues of tax‐demand discontinuity. The results indicate differences in citizen subpopulations in tax‐demand discontinuity.</jats:p>",

Kingdon's model of agenda development is used to document how air and water pollution was transformed from an issue of local concern and control to an issue of national significance during the 1950s. The analysis focuses on two case studies: the development of pollution as a political issue in the state of New Jersey; and the development of pollution as a significant policy issue in the national political arena. Political leaders both within New Jersey and nationwide linked pollution control to other contemporary concerns about urban decay and suburban growth in order to win the allegiance of undecided voters. Pollution control became part of the debate over the role of the federal government in addressing urban ills. Concern about pollution also became important in the general restructuring of the US political landscape in this period, helping to set the stage for Democratic Party activism on the environment and other issues after 1960. </jats:p>",
