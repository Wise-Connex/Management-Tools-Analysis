      "abstract": "<jats:p> The approach adopted towards environmental management in the rural context is different from that in the urban context in that the first is generally based on voluntary controls accompanied by compensation, whereas the second is based on involuntary controls without compensation. The arguments relating to the payment of compensation are examined with the use of management agreements on Sites of Special Scientific Interest taken as an example. Criteria for determining whether or not compensation is paid may be based on arguments concerning efficiency or fairness. Standard Pareto measures of efficiency cannot determine whether or not compensation should be paid. The basis on which compensation is paid can create incentives, either for occupiers to take preemptive action and extinguish conservation values or for them to make claims for excess compensation. The payment of compensation by the state may provide an incentive for the efficient allocation of resources, but this will not be so if it is based on the financial cost rather than the opportunity cost. Any approach to compensation is based upon a reference point which indicates the level of environmental quality which is expected to be achieved by a land manager. But this point is not immutable and could shift towards an expectation of a higher level of environmental management. There is no single level of compensation which can simultaneously provide appropriate incentives both to the farmer and to the state. A possible resolution would be for the conservation agency to pay only the proportion of the compensation payment which represents the resource cost. </jats:p>",

The paper disputes the validity of an approach which suggests that one discipline (nursing) possesses the broad‐based assembly of skills necessary to promulgate coping strategies in the client and his family or sustainer‐group. The efficacy of such an approach is particularly questionable when we consider that much of our work as nurses is practised in a hospital environment, where the client is abstracted from his familiar surroundings and support networks. Suggestions are made for improving the appropriateness and quality of psychiatric nursing interventions within a multi‐disciplinary care framework, and the argument is put forward that dogmatic adherence to the nursing process, with the emphasis upon finding answers to problems, may dually impede interdisciplinary teamwork and also lead us away from analysis of the skills which are important in establishing an effective interaction with the client and his family.</jats:p>",

Decisions by individual companies concerning the overall level of capacity, the type of facility (e.g., the level of flexibility), and the location of that capacity (e.g., in the United States or abroad) are discussed in great detail in the popular business press. In this paper, we describe a model developed for General Motors to aid in making decisions about capacity for four of their auto lines. The model incorporates elements of scenario planning, integer programming, and risk analysis. All the input and output is done using Lotus 1-2-3. Although the presentation is motivated by the particular application in the auto industry, the model represents a general purpose approach that is applicable to a wide variety of decisions under risk. An example in this paper uses actual data, appropriately transformed to ensure confidentiality. </jats:p>",

This leads to questions concerning the nature of the economic and social matrix within which such firms operate, and these questions in turn motivate the theorist to construct frameworks that yield such results. Spatial proximity has generally been accepted as an intensifier of price competition, but in many local oligopolistic markets it seems to act as an inhibitor of price competition. In this paper I attempt to study the role of uncertainty in explaining the ‘rivalrous consonance of interests’ which tends to keep prices above the competitive level in spatially concentrated markets. By using Weibull density functions to approximate subjective expectations of firms, I seek to cast light upon some of the factors that play a role in explaining this apparent paradox. </jats:p>",

The uncertainty of future wastewater volume is considered, and the regional objectives are evaluated. Hence, the model is composed of several constraints and of three objective functions (goals). The major constraints are the capacity of the treatment plants and the estimated range of wastewater amount in each municipality. The goals are to minimize total cost and environmental impact, while maximizing user satisfaction with the sewerage system. The case study shows that this model can help to decide the location and scale of facilities for sewerage system, giving results that are a good balance of the three goals. Furthermore, the analysis, by varying the settings of the goals or the values of sewerage propagation ratio, shows that the model can simulate changes in the wastewater capacity and its transport routes. Thus our model makes it easier for decisionmakers to plan area-wide sewerage systems. </jats:p>",

The aim of the study was to investigate the attitudes of residents towards this problem and their psychological background. A quasi-experimental field study in form of a telephone survey was carried out. In total, 200 people were interviewed. In evaluating the development plans, perceived urban quality and identification with the town are important psychological variables. Further results concerning the degree of acceptance and social impact of the plans are reported. Finally, the relevance of social scientific examination for local politics is emphasised which could be used to improve the basis of decision-making in the community. </jats:p>",

First, in a simple descriptive analysis it is shown that, despite becoming increasingly different through time, the departure rates as well as the patterns of destination choice of the two groups were broadly similar. Second, a multivariate statistical analysis, carried out using a nested logit model, reveals that (1) the pattern of destination choice of the elderly was relatively sensitive (even more so through time) to environmental factors, whereas that of the nonelderly was relatively sensitive to labor-market variables, and that (2) the variation in provincial departure rates (for both groups) depended significantly on the size and composition of the origin population as well as the drawing power of the rest of the system. In particular, our results suggest that the overall decline observed in the elderly's departure rates is the consequence of changing sensitivity to circumstances in the province of origin rather than to circumstances in the potential destinations. </jats:p>",

The option regarded as most feasible, both technically and economically, involved the construction and operation of a wastewater treatment works with a capacity of 150,000 m3/day on the upper reach of the stream. The effluent would be discharged into the upper reach of Majiagou Stream and would be used as a water source for the stream, while an interceptor sewer was to be constructed on the lower reach of the stream to collect wastewaters in the lower reach basin and transport them to a centralized wastewater treatment plant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>An optimization study of the relationship between the sewerage interceptor and the sewage treatment plant on the upper reach was conducted. In this study, a comprehensive water pollution control plan, including the sewerage system, sewage treatment plant, and the use of treated wastewater as a water source for Majiagou Stream, was considered as a systematic problem in which many factors were taken into account. Cost-benefit analysis was carried out for both the sewage treatment plant and the interceptors by means of empirical regression equations and diagrams in which various curves showed the relationships between the important factors.</jats:p>",

The model distinguishes four phases of an educational program: (1) mission of the program, (2) program goals, (3) competency-based objectives, and (4) learning activities. The fourphases of the model are then divided according to what was intended (planning) or what was assessed from observation (evaluation). The model provides a framework for the planners and evaluators to investigate the success or failure of an individual program in terms of logical contingency and congruency. Contingency in the planning stage refers to the theory that if the mission, goals, competencies and learning activities were planned through a deductive and sequential process, then logical contingency follows. Congruency in the evaluation stage refers to symmetry between what is intended (planning) and what is observed (evaluation). A well planned quality program meets both the contingency and congruency requirements of the curriculum matrix. </jats:p>",

The flights, which are documented in some detail, provided a wealth of data on homogeneous gas phase composition, upon polar stratospheric clouds, and upon tracers for dynamic motion. An important aspect of the ER‐2 data is that periods of high surface winds at Punta Arenas, Chile, which generally prevented a flight, frequently coincided with equatorward extension of the vortex toward the flight track region (53°–72° S, 60°–80° W). The ER‐2 flights are thus biased toward days when the vortex was being pushed away from the tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. Any attempt to use the ER‐2 data as a time series must take into account the variable position of the vortex edge along the flight track. At DC‐8 flight levels, numerical weather prediction models had a tendency to underestimate the wind speeds by up to 50% in situations of strong meridional flow. Since such events had detectable effects on the lower stratospheric vortex, this too could be an important limitation.</jats:p>",

A novel method is presented which determines simultaneously the optimum subdivision of the stock into volumes and the most suitable operation. In arriving at the solution, cost calculations are performed based on optimum cutting conditions calculated with standard tools having indexable inserts. For other features, preassigned operations are used. The sequence of operations is based on commonly accepted rules used in turning and care is taken to ensure that the technological requirements can be guaranteed. </jats:p><jats:p> OP-PLAN caters for all axisymmetrical features and therefore it should be able to deal with a fairly large percentage of turned components found in industry.
