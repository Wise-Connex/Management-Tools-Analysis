      "abstract": "<jats:p> Production capacity has always been one of the most important strategic variables for the major automobile companies. Decisions by individual companies concerning the overall level of capacity, the type of facility (e.g., the level of flexibility), and the location of that capacity (e.g., in the United States or abroad) are discussed in great detail in the popular business press. In this paper, we describe a model developed for General Motors to aid in making decisions about capacity for four of their auto lines. The model incorporates elements of scenario planning, integer programming, and risk analysis. All the input and output is done using Lotus 1-2-3. Although the presentation is motivated by the particular application in the auto industry, the model represents a general purpose approach that is applicable to a wide variety of decisions under risk. An example in this paper uses actual data, appropriately transformed to ensure confidentiality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The article presents an alternative defensive structure for the United States. Operating within the ideas offered by Johan Galtung in his research on transcendence of nuclear deterrence through transarmament, a plausible course of action is outlined. The process of transarmament would provide both superpowers with the means to escape their respective nuclear-dependent military doctrines. While this paper is only a thumbnail sketch of a paradigmatic shift from offensive to defensive national perceptions, its systemic orientation does suggest that transarmament is a possible future. It is a future whereby the US can increase world stability with little risk to its own legitimate national interests. The cost is in surrendering the role of world policeman. As a process of transcending offensive foreign policies, its strength lies in an increase in citizen participation and a total rejection of offensive strategies and weapon systems. The military will be structured to include both a Civil Defense (with a non-violent functional capability) and local militia (citizen soldiers). This deepening of policy-making will reinforce the other changes necessary for a defensively oriented and invulnerable country. The former is vital for the rest of the world and the latter is necessary for the self-interests of the US. </jats:p>",
