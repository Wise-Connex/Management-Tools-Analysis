      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, American cities have initiated light rail transit (LRT) plan ning and implementation because of its affordability, technological feasi bility, and environmental benefits. In spite of these alleged advantages, LRT planning has confronted the same obstacles faced by other major transportation infrastructure projects. In 1988, Hennepin County, Minne sota (within the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area) adopted a Comprehensive LRT System Plan. This case study describes the organiza tional decisionmaking, the politics, the technical analysis, and citizen in volvement associated with producing this plan. Following the case mate rials, a teaching note presents a cri tique of the LRT planning process. </jats:p>",

Some theo rists turned to examine the social construction of reality via communi cation and culture, and to ask what the implications would be for plan ning of noncausal perspectives. This article sets out to describe a contin uum of positions on postmodernism, a term which encompasses some nonpositivist approaches to under standing social life. A description of postmodernist thinking as decon structive, antifoundationalist, non dualistic, and encouraging of plural ism is provided, and some of the analytic themes associated with these characteristics are shown to form the crux of the four articles that follow. </jats:p>",

The focus in this paper is upon the analysis of contextual parametric drift. The technique proposed for such analyses involves embedding an ‘initial model’ into a more complex ‘terminal model’ that incorporates the specification of an hypothesized drift. Hypotheses testing upon, and the estimation of, the terminal model can reveal the occurrence of drift and also can provide a mathematical portrait of it. If parametric drift does occur, any point in the context is associated with an ‘expected’ initial model on which hypothesis testing can be carried out and confidence regions obtained. The investigation of parametric drift by expanded regressions is demonstrated by an illustrative example concerned with the effectiveness of family-planning policies on the decline of fertility in the contemporary less-developed countries. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, ministries of health are now beginning to understand that the selective pricing of healthcare services can be a powerful tool for achieving the efficiency and equity goals that their governments have set, and for increasing ministry financial resources that can be used to improve the quality of care offered. This article provides a blue‐print for these nascent cost‐recovery efforts. After a consideration of the rationale for cost recovery within a theoretical context, a set of pricing principles for the whole public health sector is presented and a prototypical systemic price schedule is derived from the principles. Constraints to effective and equitable cost recovery are then discussed, and topics for further empirical research are suggested.</jats:p>",

This article contributes to the project of recontextualizing home lessness by reviewing ways in which homelessness is represented within sev eral forms of public discourse and by speculating on how homelessness con tributes to the culture of everyday life. The dynamics of attending to homeless ness are double-edged. They insure that the issue is addressed in some ways while at the same time entailing some necessary exclusions. Homelessness also serves to discriminate between regular ized societal life and the consequences of living outside its bounds. In both cases the generative force of established practices contributes to the constitution and maintenance of a category I call the dishonored homeless. Education in plan ning, and public affairs in general, should highlight, rather than submerge, the relations among dispersive policy practices such as economic development planning, social service delivery, and the lives of the dishonored homeless. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this survey was to obtain baseline data in order to facilitate planning, monitoring and evaluation of the Basic Health Services Programme, sponsored by the German Agency for Technical Cooperation, which started in October 1988. The survey was carried out in 12 randomly selected health facilities and in 43 adjacent households, where 435 persons were interviewed. The health service delivery system was characterized by the following score (maximum possible score 100): staff positions filled, 63; presence of staff in health facilities, 59; supervision, 39; management, 17; medical knowledge, 62; skills, 53; drug supply, 80; community participation, 8. The average attendance rate at the health facilities was calculated as 0.8 visits per head per year. The low utilization of health facilities in Kabarole District reflects the quality of government services after a civil war of 15 years, which ended in 1986. The importance of data collection is stressed, as is the methodology employed.</jats:p>",

Theoretically, almost all incidents can be prevented. However, in practice, injury‐prevention is a complex problem. A community‐level intervention programme for prevention of accidents was developed in the municipality of Sollentuna, Stockholm County. The primary strategy has been to involve the community through representatives as well as through local organizations and groups. Project organization has been built up in cooperation with the municipal primary health‐care department, local authorities, voluntary organizations and citizen agencies. A common opinion is that it is the actual process in a community programme which is important, that alters the type of involvement from a ‘top‐down’ to a ‘bottom‐up’ approach. Can a local community take over responsibility for running such a programme which has been initiated by an external authority or organization? We think that, at least for Swedish circumstances, the community development approach is far too optimistic in its expectation that community members should and can stay actively involved in programme decisions. Based on our experience, it does not seem possible to maintain a broad self‐sustained programme solely with input from community members.</jats:p>",

However, it is unclear what people <jats:italic>mean</jats:italic> when they value health states on a visual analogue scale. In a series of empirical studies, subjects expressed little depth of intention in relation to the valuations beyond the act of ranking states. Comparisons of the valuations, with valuations elicited by means of the equivalence of numbers technique, indicated that intervals between states on the visual analogue scale must be weighted more the closer they are to the bottom of the scale. This is the same as saying that visual analogue scale values should not be used directly as utility weights for life years. A transformation of the values is needed, and a power function may be suitable for this purpose.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The existence of uncertainty influences the investment, production and pricing decision of firms. Therefore, capacity expansion models need to take into account uncertainty. This uncertainty, may arise because of errors in the specification, statistical estimation of relationships and in the assumptions of exogenous variables. One such example is demand uncertainty. In this paper, a cautious capacity planning approach is described for solving problems in which robustness to likely errors is needed. The aim is to cast the problem in a deterministic framework and thereby avoid the complexities inherent in nonlinear stochastic formulations. We adopt a robust approach and minimize an augmented objective function that penalises the sensitivity of the objective function to various types of uncertainty. The robust or sensitivity approach is compared with Friedenfelds' equivalent deterministic demand method. Using numerical results from a large nonlinear programming capacity planning model, it is shown that as caution against demand uncertainty increases, the variance of the total objective function (profit) decreases. The cost of such robustness is a deterioration in the deterministic risky performance. This method is also applied to an industry simulation model in order to assess the effect of uncertainty in market demand on optimal capacity expansion and capacity utilisation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Wird der Begriff Altlasten im Rahmen der Bauleitplanung benutzt, so darf er nicht mit den Bodenbelastungen, die üblicherweise unter diesem Begriff summiert werden, gleichgesetzt werden. Altlasten im Rahmen der Bauleitplanung sind nahezu sämtliche Bodenbelastungen, von denen möglicherweise eine Beeinträchtigung der Umwelt zu erwarten ist. Die im Baugesetzbuch enthaltene Verpflichtung, “erheblich mit umweltgefährdenden Stoffen belastete Böden” zu kennzeichnen, läßt eine Reihe von Fragen offen. Einflußfaktoren auf die Erheblichkeitsschwelle, eine Liste umweltgefährdender Stoffe und die Planzeichen der Kennzeichnung in Bebauungsplänen müssen bundeseinheitlich definiert und angewandt werden.Die Erheblichkeitsschwelle, bei deren Überschreitung eine Altlast im Bauleitplan gekennzeichnet werden muß, ist neben der Toxizität noch von mehreren anderen Faktoren abhängig. Generell sollte sie jedoch im Bereich des vorbeugenden Schutzes angesiedelt werden. Die Inhalte der zeichnerischen Kennzeichnung sollten über die bloße Hinweisfunktion hinausgehen und z.B. auch Nutzungseinschränkungen und Ursachen der Bodenbelastung beinhalten.Der vorliegende Beitrag erläutert wesentliche Einflußfaktoren auf die Kennzeichnung und stellt Definitionsansätze zur Diskussion.</jats:p>"

The visual-linguistic associations formed act as a bias in acquiring further knowledge about actions, which in turn aids the system in satisfying its internal needs (e.g., hunger, thirst, sleep, curiosity).

The arguments relating the system's expectations to its underlying model of the planning process are encoded in the form of explicit justification structures. When the system's actual performance diverges from its expectations, it traces back through these justification structures, looking to fault the setting of some controllable parameter of the planner. When such a controllable parameter is isolated, a repair is then effected, in the form of an adjustment to one of these parameters.</jats:p>",

Für den überwiegenden Teil der 15 461 Altstandorte, der 10 722 Altablagerungen, der 657 Rüstungsaltlasten und der 1 037 großflächigen Bodenkontaminationen fehlen noch Gefährdungsabschätzungen, so daß derzeit über das tatsächliche Ausmaß der Schäden und den erforderlichen Sanierungsbedarf abschließend noch keine Angaben gemacht werden können. Zu den besonders betroffenen Regionen gehören in den neuen Ländern die Räume des Uranbergbaus in Sachsen und Thüringen, das Mansfelder Land (Kupferbergbau) und der Raum Leipzig/Halle/Merseburg (Chemische Industrie).Zu befürchten ist, daß Altlasten ein Investitionshemmnis und damit eine Restriktion für die Stadt- und Regionalentwicklung werden. Das Instrument der Freistellungsklausel zur Erleichterung von Investitionen wird deshalb vorgestellt. Es werden darüber hinaus Vorschläge entwickelt, Sanierungsgebiete auszuweisen, um einerseits Nutzungskonflikte zu vermeiden und andererseits die finanziellen Mittel des Aktionsprogramms “Ökologischer Aufbau” in den neuen Ländern mit Maßnahmen der Wirtschaftsförderung abzustimmen und zu konzentrieren. Weiterhin wird die Einrichtung eines Bodenfonds nach dem Vorbild des Grundstücksfonds zur Revitalisierung von Brachflächen in Nordrhein-Westfalen vorgeschlagen.</jats:p>"

This article uses meta‐analysis to aggregate the results of 29 samples on a total of 2496 organizations.

In 1985, legislation in the state of Washington, USA, authorized a central planning agency — the Puget Sound Water Quality Authority — to initiate local watershed planning exercises through counties or other local agencies. The essential elements of community mobilization to the goals and activities of water quality planning were analyzed by comparing key factors in highly successful planning processes with factors in less successful ones. This permitted generalizations about basic organizing principles, educational procedures, and techniques of consensus building in the planning and implementation of water quality rehabilitation and protection for watersheds. The analysis contributed to a general theory of how and why community participation can improve the effectiveness of fish habitat protection. </jats:p>",

These are the effect of real income growth on residential land consumption and of possible improvements in speed as well as cheaper fares in the means of commuting. Density gradient estimations are carried out for London, with use of data from wards and London boroughs. A variety of different functional forms are tested, and the possibility is examined of a density discontinuity generated by the River Thames. Weighted regression techniques are used to correct for biases caused by wide variation in the areas used for observations. Finally, the actual variation of real incomes together with real fuel prices and fares on public transport in London are studied. It is concluded that these factors do not explain the observed flattening of density gradients, so that explanations must rest in other directions such as vintage factors and employment subcentres. </jats:p>",

It is argued that although technical improvements in these models mean that they can now represent decision situations more realistically, their conceptual structure is such that they frame the problems of service development planning in a limited way. Specific limits are discussed and identified as an expression of the spatial separatist theme. In his approach Rushton proposes important innovations concerning the role of location—allocation models in the planning process, but the radical potential of his suggestions about the way the models may be used is likely to be diminished by the limits to analysis and prescription which follow from the way the models are constructed. </jats:p>",

In an investigation of the parameter estimates from a multiple linear regression model and a multiple logit regression model, conclusions are drawn about the sensitivity of such estimates to variations in scale and zoning systems. The modifiable areal unit problem is shown to be essentially unpredictable in its intensity and effects in multivariate statistical analysis and is therefore a much greater problem than in univariate or bivariate analysis. The results of this analysis are rather depressing in that they provide strong evidence of the unreliability of any multivariate analysis undertaken with data from areal units. Given that such analyses can only be expected to increase with the imminent availability of new census data both in the United Kingdom and in the USA, and the current proliferation of GIS (geographical information system) technology which permits even more access to aggregated data, this paper serves as a topical warning. </jats:p>",

The recovered hierarchical spacing reveals that central places were located according to the marketing principle to some extent, as well as being influenced by population density. Their locations were also locally distorted by traffic, administrative, and topographical conditions. These results suggest that Christaller's three principles did generally determine the distribution of central places. Application of the general hierarchical model to the actual frequency distribution of centers further confirms that the hierarchical structure is well approximated by a variable k-system rather than by the Christallerian k-system, which implies that a structural change in the hierarchy had taken place in the course of modernization. </jats:p>",

Today these activities rely heavily on modern communication technology, especially TV and video, and continue to reflect an urban bias in content. The absence of male involvement in family planning was also noted. Family planning education has been strengthened in certain areas with the “five phases” approach and with the organization of “key households.” The Family Planning Association with is 200,000 grassroots associations throughout the country and its 17,000,000 members has greatly increased the manpower pool for the delivery of educational services. It has also been instrumental in developing insurance schemes for one child families, and in some areas the primary function of Association members is surveillance aimed at detecting unplanned pregnancies. There is a need for improved training in the development of educational materials for family planning and in the provision of contraceptive services in rural areas. </jats:p>",

In this paper, growth of state and local population is related to the area's net natural increase and to its net migration, which must be inferred because of lack of data. In turn, net migration is related to the growth of national employment and to the growth of regional civilian and military employment. The model is estimated for two regions, the El Paso, TX, standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) and the State of New Mexico. Several statistical problems arise because of the limited number of available time-series observations. Fully dynamic historical simulations track the population quite closely, in one case never differing from the actual value by more than 1.17% and in the other never differing by more than 1.36%. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>By the early 1980s, reports on the status of scimitar-horned oryx (Oryx dammah) and addax (Addax nasomaculatus) indicated that extinction in the wild was imminent. At the same time, populations in zoos were thriving, and co-operative breeding programmes were developing in various regional zoo associations to manage the populations for genetic diversity and demographic stability. By 1987, major threats to the wild populations from drought, war and hunting were under control or reduced in parts of the species’ historical ranges and it became clear that there was now a potential for re-introduction of captive-bred animals. This paper describes some of the ensuing plans for re-introduction, including discussions with local wildlife managers and politicians, fund-raising, identification of release sites, identification of sources of animals suitable for release, and population simulations to help formulate release strategies.</jats:p>",
