      "abstract": "<jats:p>No manual can provide the fatigue investigator with a complete step-by-step detailed procedure which is valid for the statistical planning of experiments whatever the situation. In fact, only certain very simple fatigue test programs fit precisely into the specific formats required for wellestablished planned experiments, such as the completely randomized design (CRD) and the randomized complete block (RCB) design, [1]. Generally these simple fatigue test programs pertain to either elementary comparative tests (for example, comparing the fatigue life of Material A versus Material B), or to quality assurance tests (namely, the generation of certain fatigue data under well-defined test conditions). On the other hand, most (exploratory) research programs involve one or more (sometimes subtle) constraints peculiar to the specific situation, that is, to the given material processing, specimen preparation, test machine, environment, or whatever. Such constraints often preclude elementary statistical analysis of the resulting data and may even present difficulties to a trained statistician, particularly if he is consulted only after the tests have been conducted. But whatever the nature and the complexity of the given fatigue test situation, there are certain design of experiments fundamentals which must appear in the planning and conduct of any competent experimental program. It is the objective of this chapter of the manual to state these fundamentals (presented in italics in the following paragraph) and to illustrate their application in a few example situations. For further specific references to the design of experiments, see Refs 2, 3, and 4.</jats:p>",

Seven years later E09 published ASTM STP 91A, A Guide for Fatigue Testing and the Statistical Analysis of Fatigue Data. Both publications were modest efforts, presenting what was then considered the current practice and views of Committee E09 members. Subsequently effort was expended intermittently in Committee E09 for over a decade in various attempts to revise and expand these STP's to reflect advances in the state of the art and in statistical analyses. This activity ultimately led to ASTM STP 566, Handbook of Fatigue Testing, and to the present Manual on Statistical Planning and Analysis for Fatigue Experiments.</jats:p>",

Both publications were modest efforts, presenting what was then considered the current practice and views of Committee E-9 members. Subsequently effort was expended intermittently in Committee E-9 for over a decade in various attempts to revise and expand these STP's to reflect advances in the state of the art and in statistical analyses. This activity ultimately led to ASTM STP 566, Handbook of Fatigue Testing, and to the present Manual on Statistical Planning and Analysis for Fatigue Experiments.</jats:p>",

One of the primary considerations for port planners at the present time is in accommodating the public with regard to recreational facilities. Also, the restrictions being placed on ports by environmental legislation are also having a significant effect. The author emphasizes that a master planning process is a never-ending effort, since adjustments and modifications should continually be made in light of changing circumstances and technology.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent research has shown that many industrial projects are not being designed with the environment in mind. The intellectual exercise of thinking ‘what impact does this project have on the environment?’ has not yet been made an integral part of industrial project-planning. More thoughtful and informed planning is needed, for reasons of both sound environmental management and, increasingly, sound project economics. An environmentally-oriented mode of planning, in which inputs and means related to environmental concerns are carefully taken into account during the planning, is discussed. This mode represents a tentative summary statement of an emerging consensus. Its objective is to facilitate informed and socially desirable choice among alternative actions in such a manner that adverse environmental consequences will be avoided or at least minimized.</jats:p><jats:p>Environmentally-oriented planning requires that a new methodology, that of impact assessment, be fully integrated into the very fabric of planning. Impact assessment consists of three analytical functions: description, prediction, and evaluation. These functions can be translated into a series of tasks, which in their entirety constitute the full process of impact assessment. The process can be achieved operationally by incorporating environmental considerations into planning <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> five dimensions: multidisciplinary professional involvement, broad public participation, holistic thinking, systematic analysis, and continuous integration. Adoption and application of the process can be encouraged and/or facilitated by a number of internal organizational adjustments, or by external public-policy adjustments.</jats:p>"

Nevertheless they give direction to and help to legitimate social planning efforts. They are no mere \"castles in the air\" but represent future hopes for the mosses. They help to solicit mass participation and support for social planning efforts. They are symbolic of a brighter tomorrow in these nations. Even if they can never be achieved, Southeast Asian utopias gained sufficient merit as factors promoting social change through their impacts on various planned development efforts.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Policy analysts, policy makers, and other users concur this type of analysis cannot be a sufficient basis for public policy decisions. For health programs, it is an approach that can supplement medical and epidemiologic bases for public investment decisions. It is a useful tool where an understanding of health problems is deficient in some areas. This paper discusses some examples of the use of benefit‐cost analysis in planning disease prevention programs and the explicit consideration to the quality of life benefits associated with reduced disease.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> ASTRACT: Because planning is often viewed as being external to the total management process, planning activities are often isolated from the management system within which they take place and which they are intended to serve. As a result, the use and utility of the planning product as a tool for management decision making and a more rational approach to the allocation of society's resources are sig nificantly diminished. To a large extent, the \"drug crisis\" and society's response to it has suffered from this isolation of planning activity from the management process. This article addresses the practical side of the process as it actually takes place and concentrates on the major factors that affect the ultimate use, or nonuse, of the product. More specifically, it describes the various purposes for research data in the area of drugs and social policy; defines and describes the different types of planning activities that may be used to obtain the data needed; describes the major approaches to planning as currently utilized; highlights some of the problems in current planning activities; and recommends some improvements that can be made in the planning process and in the use of its products. </jats:p>",
