The problem was to discover patterns in our technologically advanced economy which would give top management a new basis for planning profit. Useful insights were gained, particularly on the acceleration in idea production and productivity and on the character of the innovation cycle and its relation to employment, investment, and profitability. A model is built which corrects certain errors in Parkinson's law and Keynes theory. </jats:p>",

It tries to answer three questions asked by managers and management scientists when they hear the phrase “long-range planning”: What long-range planning is and what it is not; why it is needed; and what is needed to do long-range planning. The paper concludes with a brief statement why long-range planning can be considered a major opportunity for, and challenge to, Management Science. </jats:p>",
