The size of the nodes is varied in correspondence to the relative citation impact in this environment. Additionally, one can correct for the effect of within-journal ‘self’-citations. The network can be partitioned and clustered using algorithms from social network analysis. After transposing the matrix in terms of rows and columns, the citing patterns can be mapped analogously. Citing patterns reflect the activity of the community of authors who publish in the journal, while being cited indicates reception. Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design is cited across the interface between the social sciences and the natural sciences, but its authors cite almost exclusively from the domain of the Social Science Citation Index. </jats:p>",

This paper describes experiences in integrating pandemic response with business continuity planning at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. The paper discusses environmental triggers that provide a framework for specific actions, such as activating social distancing and work-at-home measures to be taken during a pandemic, and argues that having staff able to work at home is key to ensuring the organisation can reach the balance of supporting customers, caring for staff and staying solvent. To understand potential cash-flow problems, financial modelling is used to predict the impact of severe and more moderate pandemic influenza outbreaks. Lessons learned, suggestions for effective communications and a control structure are discussed, together with insights and strategies.</jats:p>"

For many architects building regulations are no more than a set of rules to be adhered to, and are usually seen as ephemeral, even incidental, to the creative process of design. However, the main argument of this paper suggests that the building regulations are entwined with, and are constitutive of, architects' practices. Far from being an insignificant part of the design process, as some commentators suggest, I develop the argument that the building regulations influence aspects of creative practice and process in architecture and, as such, ought to be given greater attention by scholars of urban design. </jats:p>",

Each incident record has spatial information (country names for all records and city names for some records), a time stamp (ie year, month, and day), and several other fields (eg tactics, weapon types, target types, fatalities, and injuries). We introduce a unified visualization environment that is able to present various types of patterns and thus to facilitate explorations of the incident data from different perspectives. With the visualization environment one can visualize either spatiomultivariate, spatiotemporal, temporal - multivariate, or spatiotemporal - multivariate patterns. For example, the analyst can examine the characteristics (in terms of target types, tactics, or other multivariate vectors) of aggregated incidents and at the same time perceive how multivariate characteristics change over time and vary spatially. Special attention is devoted to the application-specific data analysis process, from data compilation, geocoding, preprocessing, and transformation, through customization and configuration of visualization components, to the interpretation and presentation of discovered patterns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years, primary health care in Uzbekistan has seen dramatic changes in organization, management and financing. The Soviet multi‐tiered system of primary care is being replaced by a two‐tiered system, consisting in rural areas of rural physician points (SVPs) and outpatient clinics of central rayon hospitals. A state‐guaranteed benefits package of primary care services has been introduced and financing is increasingly based on capitation. In addition, a considerable number of physicians and nurses have been trained in general practice. There are, however, a number of challenges that remain. One of them is the considerable regional differences that exist in health financing. Another challenge is that some rural areas have difficulties attracting primary care workers. Overall, the institutional and financial link between primary and secondary care needs to be strengthened, as at present GPs have an incentive to refer patients to higher levels of care, which is financially inaccessible for large parts of the population.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although there exist numerous urban growth models, most have significant data input requirements, limiting their utility in a developing-world context. Yet, it is precisely in the developing world where there is an urgent need for urban growth models and scenarios since most expected urban growth in the next two decades will occur in such countries. This paper describes a physical urban growth model that requires few, but widely available, spatially explicit data. Utilizing binary urban/nonurban maps generated by satellite imaging, our model can inform urban planners and policy makers about the most probable locations and periods of future urban land-use change. Using a discrete choice framework, the model employs a spatially explicit logistic regression analysis to evaluate probabilities of urban growth for a baseline period. It calibrates parameters, validates results, predicts urban land-use change and examines future growth scenarios. Future growth scenarios can be generated through the inclusion of land prohibited from development, transportation routes, or new planned urban developments. A novel and important element of the model is the incorporation of an explicit policy-making framework that captures and reduces model uncertainty (theory and specification uncertainties), effectively addressing problems of predictive bias; this framework also allows the user or policy maker to associate predictions with a loss function. The model is applied to three cities in southern China that have experienced dramatic urban land growth in the last two decades. From 1988 to 1999, urban land in the region increased by 451.6% or at an annual rate of approximately 16.5%. Results show that the model achieves 73% – 77% accuracy for different cities at 30 m and 60 m resolutions. Aggregating the predictions to the county/administrative district shows that prediction through thresholding underperforms in comparison to the technique of sample enumeration. </jats:p>",

The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city. </jats:p>",

We use a weighted network representation in which vertices correspond to towns and the edges correspond to the actual commuting flows among those towns. We characterize quantitatively both the topological and weighted properties of the resulting network. Interestingly, the statistical properties of the commuting traffic exhibit complex features and nontrivial relations with the underlying topology. We characterize quantitatively the traffic backbone among large cities and we give evidence for a very high heterogeneity of the commuter flows around large cities. We also discuss the interplay between the topological and dynamical properties of the network as well as their relation with sociodemographic variables such as population and monthly income. This analysis may be useful at various stages in environmental planning and provides analytical tools for a wide spectrum of applications ranging from impact evaluation to decision making and planning support. </jats:p>",

Some of these schemes have arisen within community‐based organizations (CBOs), which have strong links with poor communities, and are therefore well situated to offer CBHI. However, the managerial capacities of many such CBOs are limited. This paper describes management initiatives undertaken in a CBHI scheme in India, in the course of an action‐research project. The existing structures and systems at the CBHI had several strengths, but fell short on some counts, which became apparent in the course of planning for two interventions under the research project. Management initiatives were introduced that addressed four features of the CBHI, <jats:italic>viz</jats:italic>. human resources, organizational structure, implementation systems, and data management. Trained personnel were hired and given clear roles and responsibilities. Lines of reporting and accountability were spelt out, and supportive supervision was provided to team members. The data resources of the organization were strengthened for greater utilization of this information. While the changes that were introduced took some time to be accepted by team members, the commitment of the CBHI's leadership to these initiatives was critical to their success.

Organisational effectiveness was attempted to describe in nine dimensions by being inspired from Cameron's study. Factor analysis was used for construction validity of the scale developed by the researcher. For internal consistency and reliability, Cronbach Alpha reliability coefficient and item total correlation were applied. A questionnaire was applied on total 207 persons in health management departments that form up the population in Turkey. In analysis of data were descriptive statistics and <jats:italic>t</jats:italic>‐test used. According to research findings, at university level, lecturers found their departments more effective than their students. The highest effectiveness was perceived at Baskent University (private). In total belonging to each dimension, the perceptions of lecturers realised on a higher level compared to those of students. It was found that the effectiveness, which was the highest dimension, was the organisational health and the ability to acquire source the lowest dimension. Effectiveness level was found to be moderate in general total. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Afghanistan had some of the worst health indicators ever recorded. To begin activities that would quickly improve the health situation, the Ministry of Health (MOH) needed both a national package of health services and reliable data on the costs of providing those services. This study details the process of determining national health priorities, creating a basic package of services, and estimating per capita and unit costs for providing those services, with an emphasis on the costing exercise. Strategies for obtaining a rapid yet reasonably accurate estimate of health service costs nationwide are discussed. In 2002 this costing exercise indicated that the basic package of services could be provided for US$4.55 per person. In 2006, the findings were validated: the four major donors who contracted with non‐governmental organizations (NGOs) to provide basic health services for nearly 80% of the population found per capita costs ranging from $4.30 to $5.12. This study is relevant for other post‐conflict countries that are re‐establishing health services and seeking to develop cost‐effective and equitable health systems.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper investigates the applicability of knowledge domain mapping for analyzing political science data. Utilizing metaphorical-space models grounded on political science theory, and applying sound cartographic visualization techniques, we demonstrate the construction and analysis of knowledge domain maps for exploring voting behaviour in Switzerland. We digitally transformed the results of Swiss popular referenda of the last twenty years to generate a 3-dimensional semantic space representing the current political landscape of Switzerland. The whole country is depicted in this semantic political space at various spatial scales. Locations in this spatialization represent aggregated voting outcomes from cities, regions, and provinces. Special attention was given to the interpretation of the resulting spatial configuration. This includes the assignment of meaning to the axes of the 3D space, depicted in two dimensions. Armed with political science theory locations in the voting behaviour space can be analyzed and the resulting political pattern can be interpreted meaningfully. The spatialized views were disseminated to the public after recent Swiss elections. The initial feedback from domain specialists and decision-makers alike has been very encouraging. Measured by high number of substantive reactions and wide-spread feedback on these spatializations of voting behaviour one could deduce that these abstract views were readily accepted and understood by public administrators, political party leaders, and the politically interested public. Based on these experiences we conclude the paper with a first attempt at identifying design recommendation for spatializing multidimensional political datasets. </jats:p>",

This has been defined by Gibson as the gradual changes in the rate of displacements of contour lines in the visual field of the observer. This paper describes a new approach intended for analysing the motion perspective in order to quantify the morphology of urban open spaces along routes. It is based on spherical projections, which provide the shape of the sky boundary around the observer. The projections are studied through their skeletons, which are continuous sets of curves obtained by a progressive thinning down of the shapes around their main saliencies. The proposed method uses these skeletons to follow the variations in the shape of the sky boundary between the successive views. Measures of these variations have been developed and applied in a range of simplified theoretical examples and a real field example in order to show that they succeeded in capturing significant variations in spherical projections. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I discuss and compare different approaches to collecting, interlinking, organizing, and making sense of scholarly knowledge and expertise in a comprehensive and timely fashion. ‘Comprehensive’ refers to the need for collecting and interlinking multilingual, multidisciplinary records from multiple sources such as publications, patents, grants, and others to truly capture all relevant knowledge. By ‘timely’ I want to emphasize that there has to be a way to integrate the most recent—that is, today's—publications with existing holdings of scholarly knowledge and expertise. I then discuss the advantages and limitations of using search engines to access, and text mining and data mining to help extract, meaning from mankind's wisdom. Next I suggest the usage of semantic association networks as a viable and complementary alternative for interlinking and making sense of scholarly knowledge and expertise. The second part of the paper exemplifies and contrasts three approaches that can be used to delineate and make sense of scholarly knowledge. The first approach uses questionnaire data, the second uses citation data from a major digital library, and the third uses personal bibliography files. These approaches are exemplified by mapping the emerging research area of network science. A particular focus is the identification of major experts, papers, and research areas and geospatial locations in which network science research is conducted. The paper concludes with a summary and outlook. </jats:p>",

This paper reports on the programmatic outcomes of 2 years of integrating the lymphatic filariasis (LF) elimination programme into primary health care (PHC) in the Dominican Republic during a period of national health care reform and decentralization. Data were collected retrospectively from community volunteers, PHC staff and LF programme staff using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods. Benefits of integration for LF elimination included increasing the extent of the geographic coverage of mass drug administration (MDA) and a 21% increase in municipalities achieving the MDA target coverage rate of 80%. Benefits which accrued to PHC included improved information systems and strengthened relationships between the health services and the community. This study also identified challenges to implementing integration and the solutions found. These include the importance of focusing on the professional development of disease‐specific program staff as their roles change, strengthening specific weakness in the general health system and finding alternative solutions where these are not easily solved, actively engaging senior management at an early stage, continually evaluating the impact of integration and not pushing integration for the sake of integration.

The more the business process recovery professional is closely tied to information security activities within the organisation, the more influence they will have on the development of information security countermeasures. This influence will allow these countermeasures to be better suited to the needs of the business process recovery programme. While the business recovery processes and the information security processes may, in most cases, be separate and distinct, it is vital that they be linked in order to provide the greatest level of resiliency. This paper will provide the framework for how to plan and address the effects of cyber-attacks to technology systems. In addition, the paper will also discuss the role of the information security professional in non-cyberrelated events. In all events, it is vital that the role of information security be incorporated in the organisation’s business recovery processes.</jats:p>"

The group contains a wide variety of businesses of varying size, complexity and longevity, and local operations have considerable operational autonomy. The company has a duty of care to staff and needed to provide appropriate guidance and support to business travellers. With this background a business travel policy was developed and published as part of the global policy manual. A survey was also carried out to better understand the traveller profile, travel patterns and understanding of the travel policy, as well as use of emergency travel and medical insurance. The information from the survey was discussed and led to a revision of the policy.</jats:p>"

In this context, different mapping techniques are presented by example of three case studies covering terrestrial, coastal and marine environments. The first case study was selected to demonstrate how to compute an ecological land classification of Germany by means of CART. The resulting ecoregions were mapped by GIS. This CARTography enables to regionalise metal bioaccumulation data in terms of 21 ecological land categories and to prove the specifity of emission control measures as being part of environmental policies. The second investigation was chosen to apply for the first time in Germany the regionalisation approach to the research of climate change effects in terms of past, recent and potential future incidences of Anopheles sp. and malaria in Lower Saxony. To investigate whether malaria might be transmitted due to increasing air temperatures, data sets on past and future air temperatures were used to spatially model malaria risk areas. The third example demonstrates the transfer of the CARTography approach presented in the first case study from terrestrial to marine environments. We analysed the statistical relations between data on benthic communities and physical properties of their marine environments by means of CART and applied these rules to geodata which only describe physical characteristics of the benthic habitats. By this, those parts of the sea ground could be predicted where certain benthic communities might occur.</jats:p>"

These issues can be attributed in part to a prevalence of ad hoc tactical planning, rather than pre‐disaster strategic planning, for reconstruction undertaken by governments and non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) in the chaotic post‐disaster environment. An analysis of the process and outcomes from six case studies of temporary housing programmes after disasters in Turkey and Colombia in 1999, Japan in 1995, Greece in 1986, Mexico in 1985, and Italy in 1976 yields information about the extent to which strategic planning is employed in temporary housing programmes, as well as common issues in temporary housing. Based on an understanding of these common issues, this paper proposes a framework for strategic planning for temporary housing that identifies organisational designs and available resources for temporary housing before the disaster, but allows modifications to fit the specific post‐disaster situation.</jats:p>",

I first illustrate a three-part typology of nonhuman charisma, comprising ecological, aesthetic, and corporeal charisma. Exploring nonhuman agency through the lens of charisma I contribute to ongoing efforts in geography and cognate disciplines to forge a ‘more-than-human’ understanding of agency and ethics. Nonhuman charisma provides a bounded relational ontology for considering nonhuman difference. Furthermore, nonhuman charisma draws attention to the importance of affect in understanding environmental ethics. Affect provides the vital motivating force that impels people to get involved in conservation. Second, I provide an example of nonhuman charisma in action. I draw on earlier work on human charisma to explore how charismatic organisms, operating as ‘flagship species’, are mobilised as boundary objects to achieve organisation order in the assemblages of UK biodiversity conservation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>River basin management demonstrates the increasing importance of active stakeholder involvement within environmental governance, whereby planning and implementation relies on outcomes from collective reasoned discussion. However, claims that stakeholder involvement improves environmental governance are rarely subject to critical examination. This lack of evaluation is problematic for several reasons including: lack of reflection on the purpose of involvement processes or their limitations; a poor conceptualisation of who should be defined as a stakeholder; how different knowledge claims should be treated; and how power relationships affect the process dynamics. This paper engages with the theoretical claims for active involvement and uses a Scottish case study to illustrate to what extent these claims were met during a river basin planning process. The evaluation highlights lessons for policy makers designing river basin management plans, particularly in the context of the pressing timetable for the implementation of the European Water Framework Directive. These lessons include how to maximise these benefits whilst proactively managing conflicts that occur, particularly when trying to sustain a coalition of individuals representing broader organisations and constituencies in a time-consuming and challenging process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we argue that montage is at the heart of contemporary human geography. We demonstrate the centrality of montage in a wide variety of domains, including the analysis of modernity, the critique of political economy, and the practice of spatial science, before drawing out the implications of this centrality in the wake of so-called ‘nonrepresentational’ theory. While nonrepresentational styles of thought ordinarily veer off into considerations of performance, practice, and enactment, the ontological and epistemological play of montage plunges theoretical practice into what Agamben, Baudrillard, and Benjamin call ‘imagelessness’, ‘obscenity’, and the ‘optical unconscious’. Each of these is addressed in turn, and each is illustrated with stills taken from the films of Jim Jarmusch. The overall aim of the paper is to sensitize human geographers to the duplicitous operation of the discipline's cinematic optical unconscious, and in so doing to open up a space for a more considered engagement with geography's much-vaunted visuality.</jats:p>",

Collaborative working is considered by many to be essential if design and construction teams are to consider the whole lifecycle of the construction process. Much of the recent work undertaken on collaborative working has focused on the delivery of technological solutions with a focus on web (extranets), CAD (visualisation), and knowledge management technologies. However, it is now recognised that good collaboration does not result from the implementation of information technology solutions alone, the organisational and people issues, which are not readily solved by pure technical systems, need also to be resolved. This paper aims to address this issue.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Work discussed in this paper brings together the benefits provided by technology, with organisational issues, and people issues, in developing a framework to implement effective collaboration. The research uses a literature search, semi‐structured interviews and a questionnaire to gain the industry's requirements for effective collaboration in the construction sector. From these requirements a develop‐test‐refine approach was taken to develop the methodology for effective collaborative working for construction.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The findings reported in this paper are a summary of the results from the semi‐structured interviews and questionnaire used to gain the industry's requirements. They show that a focus on the “softer” issues (business process and an organisations' people) rather than a technology focus is needed to plan and implement collaborative working more effectively in projects. An initial approach is discussed in this paper concerning a structured approach to be developed further in the research to highlight to the industry the issues associated with the planning and implementation of effective collaborative working in projects.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This paper uses a socio‐technical approach to the planning and implementation of effective collaborative working in construction. It combines technology with the people and business aspects of collaborative working to provide an approach which can enable stakeholders in a project to benefit fully from having a collaborative working approach to their projects.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

To obtain the demand, one needs a pricing model, which in turn relies on consumer preferences that are connected to the product composition, structure, and functionality. Thus, a model, including the varying characteristics of the product, the manufacturing capacity and site, the supply chain and ultimately, the markets, is proposed. I use a very simple case of insect repellent to illustrate how the best repellent, identified as the one that consumers will prefer the most, is not the most profitable one and how one can obtain the insect repellent composition that maximizes profit. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007</jats:p>",

The 11-month programme commenced in December 2006. The aims of the programme are to promote selfreliance among residents and businesses to minimise risk to personal safety and property damage during a flood event. A key aspect of the programme is to target those most at risk, focusing on one-on-one interviews at flood-prone properties. This paper outlines the approach taken in conducting the pilot programme, and reviews the programme outcomes to date. The paper includes a discussion on approaches to extend similar programmes to a wider area. It explores the value of self-help measures in producing resilient communities and some of the costs involved in maintaining effective flood response. It is anticipated that this paper will be of interest to professionals involved in engaging communities in emergency planning and response. The paper emphasises one-on-one meetings as an appropriate and effective tool to promote risk reduction among those in highest risk areas.</jats:p>"

Taking on the challenging task of reforming urban governance within the framework of development where people matter, PRIA initiated a participatory process in each of the urban centres, bringing together civil society groups and local politicians and civil servants as well as officials from state-level institutions. This sought to strike a balance between inclusive town planning and working within the legal framework. This paper explains how the various stakeholders in urban planning, including state government, municipal staff, elected representatives and citizens and civil society groups drawn from all sections of society were brought together to decide on the future of their towns. There is also a discussion of the methodology that was adopted and the challenges that were faced. This is perhaps the first time in India that an NGO has sought to address issues of equitable and integrated urban development at city level, focusing on technical issues of town planning and backed by public participation. Similar initiatives have since been launched in other urban centres. </jats:p>",

Despite this recent disaster there is only marginal evidence of an increase in disaster recovery planning by businesses that experienced the flood. This finding is consistent with the results of other business‐related disaster research. Statistical tests of survey results from 2003 indicate that there is a significantly higher rate of disaster recovery planning in businesses started since the 1997 flood than in businesses started before the flood and still in business. Such an outcome indicates a need for public policy actions emphasizing the importance of disaster planning. Improved disaster planning is an aid to business recovery and the results demonstrate the need for more widespread efforts to improve disaster recovery planning on the part of smaller businesses, even in areas that have recently experienced disasters.</jats:p>",

The project recruited and trained dual (foster care/adoption) approved carers and placed children with them before the children were freed for adoption. The carers who were recruited in the first year of the project (1999) are described, as are the early outcomes of the placements. All the children (n = 52) placed with the carers were subsequently adopted and no placements have disrupted in the three to six years since. The children were placed with their permanent carers earlier than in conventional practice. The carers, for the most part, thought the reward of having their child placed earlier and younger compensated for the anxiety and uncertainty generated by the legal proceedings to free the children for adoption. They were essentially people who wanted to adopt (three-quarters were childless couples) and the project provides positive evidence of the capacity of this population to offer ‘modern’ adoption placements to looked after children. </jats:p>",

Using the notion of ‘heteronormativity’, I argue that our understanding of the spatiality of sexuality needs to focus on ‘ordinary’, ‘benign’ forms of family-based heterosexuality, as well as on more deviant forms. I claim that rural spaces provide important sites for the examination of the coconstruction of conventional heterosexuality and place. I demonstrate aspects of rural heterosexuality in the expectations, values, and practices of sexual relationships. I argue that heterosexual relationships are reinforced and sustained through the distancing of the rural from the urban and through associations between rurality and the romantic positioning of nature as central to both of these tactics. </jats:p>",

I present an analysis of how major cities and interlocking corporate directorates are articulated together into a global network. Findings indicate that the network is concentrated in the main world cities in a way that reinforces the northern transatlantic economic system. However, the structure of the network is more nationally focused, and more complex, than that predicted by global cities theorizations. To account for the structure, I present a multifactoral framework featuring sociohistorical processes as well as spatiotemporal constraints. In conclusion, I explore implications for sociological analysis of a ‘new network bourgeoisie’, invested with several kinds of corporate power and exercising agency both within and beyond the boardrooms of the world's major corporations. </jats:p>",

Coincident with this is the upward trend in coastal population along the hurricaneprone coastline of theUSA from Maine to Texas. Preparedness and planning are therefore essential to minimise the impact of these powerful and destructive storms. This paper provides a framework for the environmental hazard portion of an effective risk and vulnerability assessment process which involves identifying potential hazards and evaluating the relative risks with respect to community/business infrastructure. Through this process, emergency planners can obtain a firm understanding of the relationship between the hazards and risk factors to develop effective mitigation strategies. A review of tropical cyclone basics is presented along with an overview of the hurricane forecast process and hurricane hazards. Several risk and vulnerability assessment process tools are discussed to assist emergency managers/planners in developing hurricane response plans. The paper concludes with a review of hurricane preparedness concepts and provides information on pre-hurricane season activities, along with watch and warning, and post-hurricane actions.</jats:p>"

As a result, path planners that rely only on this knowledge to compute paths are unable to anticipate obstacles sufficiently early and have no choice but to resort to an inefficient local obstacle avoidance behavior. </jats:p><jats:p> To alleviate this problem, we present an opportunistic navigation and view planning strategy that incorporates look-ahead sensing of possible obstacle configurations. This planning strategy is based on a “what-if” analysis of hypothetical future configurations of the environment. Candidate sensing positions are evaluated based on their ability to observe anticipated obstacles. These sensing positions identified by this forward-simulation framework are used by the planner as intermediate waypoints. The validity of the strategy is supported by results from simulations as well as field experiments with a real robotic platform. These results show that significant reduction in path length can be achieved by using this framework. </jats:p>",

Under this structure, there are six regional joint task forces and one central joint operations and planning staff. These regional structures were achieved with relatively light investment by double-hatting existing operational-level military formations. While this presents some challenges in terms of competing requirements, these are outweighed by the advantages of the more coherent and focused domestic structure. The first 18 months of operations have demonstrated that an interagency approach is the key to achieving Canada Command’s mission. Numerous routine and several contingency operations, including support to potentially catastrophic flooding in western Canada, have generated a number of valuable lessons learned. On a daily basis, Canada Command works closely with its domestic partners in Canada, as well as its continental partners to the south, US Northern Command and the binational North American Aerospace Defense Command. While much work remains to be done in the evolution of its domestic role, Canada Command is now the ‘go-to’ organisation in the Canadian Forces for matters of domestic defence and security.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is a contemporary shift in the institutional context of ‘disabled’ children's education in the United Kingdom from segregated special to mainstream schools. This change is tied to wider deinstitutionalised or reinstitutionalised geographies of disabled people, fragile globalised educational ‘inclusion’ agendas, and broader concerns about social cohesiveness. Although coeducating children is expected to transform negative representations of (dis)ability in future society, there are few detailed explorations of how children's everyday sociospatial practices (re)produce or transform dominant representations of (dis)ability. With this in mind, children's contextual and shifting performances of (dis)ability in two case study school playground (recreational) spaces are explored. The findings demonstrate that children with mind—body differences are variously (dis)abled, in comparison with sociospatially shifting norms of ability, which have body, learning, and emotional—social facets. The discussion therefore places an emphasis on the need to incorporate ‘intellectual’ and ‘emotional’ differences more fully into geographical studies of disability and identity. The paper has wider resonance for transformative expectations placed on colocating children with a variety of ‘axes of difference’ (such as gender, ‘race’, ethnicity, and social class) in schools. </jats:p>",

Manitoba Emergency Measures Organization (EMO) was tasked with developing and implementing the provincial BCP programme. The experience of Manitoba EMO was informed by the well-established body of knowledge and best practices for business continuity planning, but also required adaptation of these guidelines to lead to effective implementation in a public sector environment.

The paper examines the Vancouver Agreement—an urban development compact between the governments of Canada, British Columbia, and the City of Vancouver. Signed in March 2000 for a five-year term, and renewed in April 2005, the Vancouver Agreement has been widely acclaimed as an example of successful collaborative working, addressed to the revitalisation of the city's Downtown Eastside. The origins of the agreement are explained in the context of an urban crisis in the Downtown Eastside, where established policies were seen to be failing. High-level political support for a new governance approach led to the adoption of an urban development partnership, and the paper sets out its structure and strategic programmes of action. Benchmarked against conditions for effective intergovernmental working posited in the public administration literature, the paper then analyses five procedural attributes of the partnership: resource sharing, leadership, community involvement, mutual learning, and horizontal accountability. Concluding observations are offered on the long-term prospects for the Vancouver Agreement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In this paper, an electrical power transmission network planning expansion is formulated for mixed‐integer programming, a genetic algorithm and tabu search (TS). Compared with other optimisation methods, GA's are suitable for traversing large search spaces since they can do this relatively rapidly and because the use of mutation diverts the method away from local minima, which will tend to become more common as the search space increases in size. GA's give an excellent trade‐off between solution quality and computing time and flexibility for taking into account specific constraints in real situations. TS has emerged as a new, highly efficient, search paradigm for finding quality solutions to combinatorial problems. It is characterised by gathering knowledge during the search, and subsequently profiting from this knowledge. The attractiveness of the technique comes from its ability to escape local optimality. The cost function of this problem consists of the capital investment cost in discrete form, the cost of transmission losses and the power generation costs. The DC load flow equations for the network are embedded in the constraints of the mathematical model to avoid sub‐optimal solutions that can arise if the enforcement of such constraints is done in an indirect way. The solution of the model gives the best line additions, and also provides information regarding the optimal generation at each generation point. This method of solution is demonstrated on the expansion of a 10 bus‐bar system to 18 bus‐bars. Finally, an empirical analysis of the effects of parameter values on genetic algorithm performance is tested. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Instead, I outline a fractal approach to the study of space, society, and infrastructure. A fractal orientation requires a number of related conceptual reorientations. It has implications for thinking about scale and perspective, and (sociotechnical) relations, and for considering the role of the social theorist in analyzing such relations. I find empirical illustration in the case of the development of electronic patient records in Danish health care. The role of the social theorist is explored through a comparison of the political and normative stance enabled, respectively, by a critical social theory and a fractal social theory. </jats:p>",

The ideas suggested for business continuity planning are based upon knowledge of the risks through communication and audit, management of accumulations and the ability to reroute goods using existing relationships with forwarders and carriers. The ideas discussed are based upon work with a number of different clients. The advantage of planning for this type of risk is that by its nature the supply chain is flexible and can be viewed as a number of floating warehouses which can be diverted to supply markets on demand.</jats:p>"

Preparation for service provision during and after a crisis is called continuity of operations planning (COOP). Historically, the federal government has conducted such planning, and private businesses have embraced business continuity planning. Local governments have more recently begun to adopt such “good business practices.” This article provides a background on government COOP planning, describes the important elements of a continuity plan as described in federal documents and standards, and reports on a survey of public works departments. The results of the survey indicate that although some planning efforts have been undertaken, a majority of public works agencies in this sample are at risk for breakdowns in the provision of essential service in crisis situations. Public works agencies need to intensify planning efforts to ensure operational continuity. </jats:p>",

Right-handed participants ( n = 20, aged 18 to 22 years) made rapid lever reversals of 20° and 60° singly and sequentially with an intermovement interval of 2.5 sec. Following blocked single practice of both movements in each hand (15 trials each), two sets of 30 sequential practice trials were completed. The sequences began with either the long or the short movement and the participant always knew the goal of the first movement. During the intermovement interval, the experimenter gave instructions to complete the sequence with a short movement, a long movement, or no movement in a random order. Compared to the single trials, both movements in the sequence overshot the short-distance and undershot the longdistance goal. Spatial errors increased when a change in the movement goal was required for the second movement in the sequence. The experiment demonstrated that separate planning of sequential aiming movements can reduce spatial assimilation effects, but interference due to practice organization and switching the task's goal must also be overcome in order to produce accurate aiming movements. </jats:p>",

As more young people from nontraditional backgrounds are encouraged to participate in higher education, and as the financial costs of attending are increasingly borne by students and their families, more students are choosing to stay at home for financial reasons. I explore the advantages and disadvantages of students' decisions to live at home in the context of normative debates which stress the value of spatial mobility to the student lifestyle. While the evidence supports the argument that living at home is an economically rational decision for students from nontraditional backgrounds, it is also steeped in young peoples' emotional attachments to locally based networks of family and friends. Further, the connections between living at home and social and educational disadvantage amongst university students are investigated. The analysis shows that disadvantage is not associated with living at home per se, but is related to students' patterns of working, studying, and commuting. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 2000s spatial and urban policy in the UK has become increasingly concerned with the creation of sustainable communities. The urban renaissance's focus on security through design has been replaced by new, more holistic discourses which emphasize `community safety' and the ways in which the planning process can be reformed in order to achieve this. The new emphasis is on the responsibilization of neighbourhood communities with the police becoming more `citizen-focused' in the design and implementation of their strategies. This article examines the shift towards sustainable community building and assesses its implications for the policing and securitization of places. It argues that a paradox lies at the heart of the government's new agendas. On the one hand, they promote community balance, mix and diversity as a vehicle for the creation of more functional and less crime-ridden places. On the other hand, they simultaneously identify diversity as a threat to community safety. Security policy, the article argues, has therefore become focused on the deployment of new types of relational citizenship, based on top-down conceptions of whose presence or absence is required to make a community sustainable. In this context `sustainability' is being used as a discursive cover for a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures. Rather than increasing a sense of security within newly built and regenerated places, the new focus of policy may encourage the formation of new governmentalities of insecurity and fear. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is drawing attention as a statistical method to estimate regression models with spatially varying relationships between explanatory variables and a response variable. Local collinearity in weighted explanatory variables leads to GWR coefficient estimates that are correlated locally and across space, have inflated variances, and are at times counterintuitive and contradictory in sign to the global regression estimates. The presence of local collinearity in the absence of global collinearity necessitates the use of diagnostic tools in the local regression model building process to highlight areas in which the results are not reliable for statistical inference. The method of ridge regression can also be integrated into the GWR framework to constrain and stabilize regression coefficients and lower prediction error. This paper presents numerous diagnostic tools and ridge regression in GWR and demonstrates the utility of these techniques with an example using the Columbus crime dataset. </jats:p>",

The stream of incoming order arrivals is the main source of uncertainty in dynamic order acceptance and the company only has forecasts of the main properties of the future incoming projects. Project proposals arrive sequentially with deterministic interarrival times and a decision on order acceptance and capacity planning needs to be made each time a proposal arrives and its project characteristics are revealed. We apply stochastic dynamic programming to determine a profit threshold for the accept/reject decision as well as to deterministically allocate a single bottleneck resource to the accepted projects, both with an eye on maximizing the expected revenues within the problem horizon. We derive a number of managerial insights based on an analysis of the influence of project and environmental characteristics on optimal project selection and aggregate capacity usage. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This paper attempts to untangle one global–local nexus by examining the ‘sorting’ of people into residential or neighborhood spaces in globalizing Shanghai as a function of individual demographic and socioeconomic attributes and by examining personal global connectivity as a key relational variable. We begin with an overview of how local residential differentiation in general and particularly in Shanghai has evolved through the current phase of accelerated globalization and through the city's booming decade of the 1990s. Then, using survey data from the Pudong New Area of Shanghai in 2001, we present a statistical account and analysis of the increasingly varied and layered residential spaces of Shanghai into which people are ‘sorted’ by both internal local and extralocal factors. The analysis shows that, net of a number of demographic and socioeconomic variables, personal global connections have an effect on people living in different neighborhood areas, especially in more expensive and exclusive housing estates. Finally, we discuss the implications of the findings for how the individual-level impact of global connectivity could reinforce local spatiosocial stratification in rapidly globalizing cities like Shanghai. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a motion planning algorithm which exploits symmetries in distributed systems to reduce motion planning computation complexity. Symmetries allow for algebraic manipulations that are computationally costly, which normally must be carried out for each component in a distributed system, to be related among various symmetric components in a distributed system by a simple algebraic relationship. This leads to a large reduction in the complexity of the overall motion planning problem for a group of distributed mobile robotic agents. In particular, due to the manner in which a symmetric system is defined, the structure of the Chen—Fliess—Sussmann differential equations has a simple relationship among various symmetric components of a distributed system. Essentially, symmetries are defined in a manner which preserves the Lie algebraic structure of each component. In a system with distributed computational capability, the motion planning computations may be distributed throughout formation in such a way that the objectives of the formation are satisfied and collision avoidance is guaranteed. The algorithm maintains a rigid body formation at the beginning and end of the trajectory, as well as possibly specified intermediate points. Due to the generally nonholonomic nature of mobile robots, guaranteeing a rigid body formation during the intermediate motion is impossible. However, it is possible to bound the magnitude of the deviation from the rigid body formation at any point along the trajectory. Simulation and experimental results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the algorithm. </jats:p>",

Drawing on recent theorising in media studies about ‘remediation’, this paper attempts to move beyond a reliance on such unhelpful real–virtual conceptual binaries. The paper uses such conceptual discussions to consider more fully the multiple, subtle, and interdependent spatiotemporalities which together work to constitute ICT-based urban change. While innovative work has traced the emergence of various online spaces and communities, our interest here is on the intersection of online and offline practices. Through a case study of two contrasting neighbourhoods in Newcastle upon Tyne, the paper explores in detail how social relations and grocery shopping are being affected by ICT use. It suggests that the remediation of everyday urban life through ICTs involves subtle shifts in the spatial, temporal, scalar, and material processes which together help to constitute urban change, and which are all too often overlooked in conventional and binary approaches opposing the ‘virtual’ realm of new technologies to ‘real’ urban places. </jats:p>",

Methods: The study assigned the participants, 205 cardiac rehabilitation patients, to one of the intervention groups (action-planning only or combined-planning group) or to a control group. Baseline measurement and follow-up took place 2 months apart. Results: The interventions enhanced physical exercise independently of age. Pretreatment coping planning was higher in older (65-82 years) than in younger (38-54 years) or middle-aged (55-64 years) participants. At Time 2, older participants were the only ones without further increase in coping planning. Advancement in coping planning partially mediated the effect of the intervention. Conclusion: Coping planning facilitates improvement of physical exercise. Implications of age differences in planning are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Following recent insights into performativity and space, I explore the widespread routine of going-to-work as a capitalist ritual. Going-to-work produces a powerful yet ordinary, unspectacular landscape, whose performativity is fourfold: the compatibility of the material form and human use of it; the movements of people and the clothes they wear; the variety of individual practices of going-to-work; and the timing and spacing of this collective ritual. Generally, going-to-work is performative, because it transforms people into employees, defining productivity in terms of paid work. Hence, the prime quality of this landscape is to enhance economically productive bodies. In the second part of this paper, I examine this productive—nonproductive distinction in a unique setting on the edge of an Israeli neighborhood of ultraorthodox Jews, whose definition of men's work—unpaid religious studies—contrasts with that of the majority of the modern population. The distinctive ultraorthodox appearance, originally designed to mark a particular Jewish identity, signifies their nonproductivity as a spatial performance of Otherness. This provides an opportunity to probe going-to-work in this specific place as an arena where the ultraorthodox identity as Other intersects with their capitalist identity as Other. Short street interviews with modern and ultra-orthodox Jews show that they recognize work as the main theme of this landscape. They are also aware that work is socially defined and can be criticized on both capitalist and ultraorthodox—religious grounds, and they illustrate how the controversy over the definition of work lies within the struggle over Jewish identity. I conclude by illuminating the performative role of space in displaying identity and social ideas. </jats:p>",

Hierarchical production models offer a means of better managing these large and complex models. Hierarchical production planning models decompose large models into a set of smaller linked models. For example, in this paper, a Lagrangian relaxation formulation and a modified Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition – column generation routine are used to solve a hierarchical forest planning model that maximizes the net present value of harvest incomes while recognizing specific geographical units that are subject to harvest flow and green-up constraints. This allows the planning model to consider forest-wide constraints such as harvest flow, as well as address separate subproblems for each contiguous management zone for which detailed spatial plans are computed. The approach taken in this paper is different from past approaches in forest hierarchical planning because we start with a single model and derive a hierarchical model that addresses integer subproblems using Dantzig–Wolfe decomposition. The decomposition approach is demonstrated by analyzing a set of randomly generated planning problems constructed from a large forest and land inventory data set. </jats:p>",

Although located within this particular debate, the fundamental issue of the relationship between household income and property value is of relevance to systems of property taxation the world over. Although the empirical literature to date makes reference to the links between property values and income levels in the context of debates about the fairness of council tax, the relationship between the two has not been empirically tested. The authors provide evidence of this relationship and show that, although there is a strong positive relationship between property values and income amongst higher income households, there is evidence of a ‘U-shaped’ relationship among lower income households. In addition, there is very strong evidence, that the elasticity of property prices with respect to income is not constant, but follows a bell-shaped distribution which is skewed to the right. </jats:p>",

Most policy authors focus on explaining incremental change, and yet in practice a pattern of change described as punctuated equilibrium has been observed, with periods of stability interspersed with periods of rapid, abrupt change. It is argued here that the influence of materials and technologies—the substance of policy—must be incorporated into models of the policy process in order to help further our understanding of radical change. Concepts from science and technology studies concerning the inseparability of social and technical spheres are used to explore how people and materials interact to create opportunities for radical change. These ideas are particularly relevant to policy sectors comprising durable, capital-intensive infrastructure, such as housing. Drawing on examples from the UK housing sector, ideas about policy networks and large technical systems are synthesised to develop a more holistic, interdisciplinary account of policy change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> From the perspective of institutional analysis, this paper evaluates the place-remaking process of Niucheshui in Singapore. It is found that the redevelopment of Niucheshui since the 1960s has been substantively shaped by the property rights regime over land and buildings. As property rights are defined by the state in the forms of statutory land-use planning, compulsory land acquisition, rent control, land leasing, and conservation of historical buildings, the free market for land redevelopment is reined in heavily by the state. The built form of Niucheshui before 1960 was by and large the product of many private individuals' and communities' initiatives. Those players have faded from the scene since the 1960s, and the redevelopment of Niucheshui is the result of interactions between the state and market forces, though public participation is practised in the land-use planning process. In view of the urban land market behaving and performing within a framework defined by institutions, and property rights being one of the most important institutions, we argue that, not warranted by rhetoric public participation, pluralism and diversity in the built environment are protected by a diverse structure of land property rights which should be incorporated into the place-remaking process. </jats:p>",

Our goal is to specify inputs in the form of gaits, that is, a sequence of controlled shape changes of a multi-bodied mechanical system that when executed would produce a desired change in the unactuated position or orientation variables of the entire mechanical system. In other words, we want to indirectly control the unactuated degrees of freedom of the mechanical system utilizing a controlled “internal” shape change. More precisely, in this paper we develop a gait evaluation tool which easily measures the change of position, computed in a body-attached coordinate frame, due to any closed curve in the shape space. This evaluation tool is simple enough that we can use it to generate gaits or to design curves that move the mechanical system along a desired direction. Finally, we verify that this gait analysis technique applies to two seemingly different classes of mechanical systems, purely mechanical and principally kinematic systems, and unify the gait generation problem for both classes. </jats:p>",

Because of the anatomic complexity and often limited visualization, fracture reduction can be difficult. Virtual planning software can allow the surgeon to understand the fracture morphology and to rehearse reduction maneuvers. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a novel virtual fracture reduction module on time and accuracy of reduction. Four acetabular fracture patterns were created in synthetic pelves, which were implanted with fiducial markers and were registered with CT scan. Ten surgeons used virtual fracture reduction software or conventional 2D planning methods and immediately reduced the fractures blindly in a viscous gel medium. 3D imaging was again performed and the accuracy of reduction was assessed. The average malreduction was significantly improved following planning with the virtual software compared to the standard technique. The time taken for reduction was also significantly less for two of the four fracture patterns. Virtual software may be useful for visualizing and planning treatment of fractures of the acetabulum, potentially leading to more accurate and efficient reductions, and may also be an effective educational tool. © 2007 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Service restoration is a non‐linear, combinatorial, non‐differential and multi‐objective optimization problem that often has a great number of candidate solutions to be evaluated by the operators. To tackle the problem of service restoration with multiple objectives, the weighted sum strategy is employed to convert these objectives into a single objective function by giving equal weighting values. The transformer/feeders capacity in the post‐fault distribution network creates a major problem for the electrical power distribution engineers and distribution system substation operators to satisfy the operational constraints at the consumer localities while restoring power supply. The feasibility of the developed algorithm for service restoration demonstrated on several distribution networks with fast and effective convergence of the results of this technique helps to find the efficient operational planning of the EPDS.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The present study addresses the relevance of geographic proximity for companies in our age of advanced information and communication technology (ICT). Many visions of, and speculations on, an increased footlooseness of companies and a concomitant dispersal of urban economic activity have been published in recent years. To identify whether urban agglomeration economies (in particular, knowledge spillovers) are still a key force in preventing such dispersal, we investigate the degree of footlooseness of young, innovative companies. The exploratory analysis, based on interviews with twenty-one companies, employs an artificial intelligence method, called ‘rough-set analysis’, to increase our understanding of the crucial factors that influence needs for physical proximity. On the basis of these results, we argue that agglomeration economies still remain important for various categories of young, innovative, firms, even those providing ICT services, but that we need to make a distinction between agglomeration economies that work exclusively in the largest city (that is, Amsterdam) and agglomeration economies that cover a larger metropolitan area. The only fundamental change in proximity needs among these young, innovative companies originates from a small class of ‘network companies’, which are footloose even beyond the larger metropolitan area. The study also addresses urban policies to use opportunities better to attract companies with high proximity needs. </jats:p>",

However, little is known about the specific nature of the nucleus accumbens' contribution to generating movement. We investigated motor encoding by nucleus accumbens neurons in rats performing a delayed response task that allowed us to dissociate the effects of sensory and motor events on firing. In a subset of neurons, firing in the delay period preceding movement was highly selective; this selectivity was tightly correlated with the direction of the subsequent movement, but not with the sensory properties of the instructive cue. Direction selectivity in this population of neurons developed over the course of the delay period, with the strongest selectivity apparent just prior to movement onset. Selectivity was also apparent in nucleus accumbens neurons during movement, such that firing showed a tight correlation with movement direction, but not the instructive cue presented nor the spatial destination of the movement. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subpopulation of nucleus accumbens neurons contributes to the selection and execution of specific motivated behaviours.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The predominant view in the literature is that cities affect labor productivity because spatial proximity facilitates the transfer of ideas which make workers more productive. We also anticipate that information technology, or IT (both equipment and labor), by facilitating human communication and speeding up the flow of ideas and data, also contributes to enhancing the productivity of workers within cities. Thus, workers will be more productive in cities with a large endowment of these two factors of production. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it describes the spatial characteristics of IT workers in the United States. Second, it tests the hypothesis that in cities with a higher endowment of IT workers wages (a proxy for productivity) would be higher after controlling for the characteristics of individual workers and city-specific characteristics that also affect wages. Using data from the 2000 US Census of Population (5% PUMS), we find evidence of a wage premium, especially for college-educated workers, associated with living in a city that has a large concentration of IT workers. On the basis of our findings, we propose to move the discussion on the future of cities from the effect of IT equipment on face-to-face communication to the impact on cities of losing IT workers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Whilst concurring with the new streams of literature in geography that highlight the importance of face-to-face and ‘buzz’ in the globalizing learning economy, we argue that this literature is misleading on three interrelated counts. Firstly, it conflates face-to-face and buzz; secondly, it fails to distinguish between the importance of face-to-face and buzz for industries drawing on different knowledge bases; and, thirdly, these conceptual inadequacies lead to an exaggeration of the importance of cities as sites for creativity and innovation, and hence regional competitiveness. By applying an industrial knowledge base approach, we seek to reconstruct an alternative framework that allows for a systematic differentiation between the importance of face-to-face and buzz for different industries. This provides a framework for developing a more nuanced understanding of the spatial implications of face-to-face communication and buzz for learning and innovation. </jats:p>",

Firm location is modeled in a discrete-choice framework, with eight employment centers and outlying areas used as possible choices. Agglomerative and dispersive forces are explicitly treated, as are taxes and other characteristics that vary over space. The findings suggest that property taxes have large deterrent effects on firm locations for the four industrial groups analyzed here: oil and gas; manufacturing; finance, insurance and real estate (FIRE); and services. When agglomeration economies are present, they are weaker than the tax effects and are positive for only the FIRE and services industrial groups. </jats:p>",

While many babyboomers are more financially secure than previous generations have been on account of compulsory superannuation contributions made over the past 15 years, there are still some who are financially vulnerable and expect to rely on government pensions and welfare assistance. Changes to family structures and job security also mean that those who are less financially secure will need social support. Using an ecological framework model</jats:bold>\n          <jats:bold>, we explored the retirement expectations and experiences of some Australian babyboomers through focus groups and individual interviews to identify key issues and their plans to address these issues. Four main themes are reported in this paper: retirement attitudes and expectations, finances, health, and food. The results suggested that for many persons retirement equated freedom. Little future planning was undertaken for retirement other than contributing to superannuation schemes, and expectations were reported in general terms, such as wanting to remain independent and healthy and to have time to socialize and travel.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

This canton is a rural prealpine area, which has been historically shaped by traditional industries and which lies in the vicinity of St Gallen in the Greater Zürich Area. Scientists and regional stakeholders collaboratively planned, assessed, and discussed how to realize cooperative business strategies in order to sustain a continued presence in their selected industry. 101 stakeholders participated in a project, which made use of the area development negotiations method. This systematic and analytical method involved (a) the construction of different regional business strategies and clustering variants through formative scenario analysis, (b) a multicriteria evaluation of these variants, and (c) a multi-stakeholder consensus process on different forms of horizontal and vertical cooperation. As a result, a regional learning process with the ultimate goal of moving towards a sustainable development form was initiated between industries, public authorities, and research institutions. </jats:p>",

In particular, we analyze and generate gaits for mixed mechanical systems which are systems whose motion is simultaneously governed by both a set of non-holonomic velocity constraints and a notion of a generalized momentum being instantaneously conserved along allowable directions of motion. Through proper recourse to geometric mechanics, we are able to show that the resulting motion from a gait has two portions: a geometric and a dynamic contribution. The main challenge in motion planning for a mixed system is understanding how to separate the geometric and dynamic contributions of motion due to a general gait, thus simplifying gait analysis. In this paper, we take the first step towards addressing this challenge in a generalized framework. Finally, we verify the generality of our approach by applying our techniques to novel mechanical systems which we introduce in this paper as well as by verifying that seemingly different prior motion planning results could actually be explained using the gait analysis presented in this paper. </jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of altered mental nerve sensation after implant placement in the posterior segment of the mandible when a panoramic radiograph is the only preoperative imaging technique used.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Material and methods: </jats:bold> The study included 1527 partially and totally edentulous patients who had consecutively received 2584 implants in the posterior segment of the mandible. Preoperative bone height was evaluated from the top of the alveolar crest to the superior border of the mandibular canal on a standard panoramic radiograph. A graduated implant scale from the implant manufacturer was used and 2 mm were subtracted as a safety margin to determine the length of the implant to be inserted.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results: </jats:bold> No permanent sensory disturbances of the inferior alveolar nerve were observed. There were two cases of postoperative paresthesia, representing 2/2584 (0.08%) of implants inserted in the posterior segment of the mandible or 2/1527 (0.13%) of patients. These sensory disturbances were minor, lasted for 3 and 6 weeks and resolved spontaneously.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions: </jats:bold> Panoramic examination can be considered a safe preoperative evaluation procedure for routine posterior mandibular implant placement. Panoramic radiography is a quick, simple, low‐cost and low‐dose presurgical diagnostic tool. When a safety margin of at least 2 mm above the mandibular canal is respected, panoramic radiography appears to be sufficient to evaluate available bone height prior to insertion of posterior mandibular implants; cross‐sectional imaging techniques may not be necessary.</jats:p>",

Time-resolved MR angiography was performed on a 1.5-tesla MR unit (Achieva, Philips Medical Systems) using contrast-enhanced 3D fast field echo sequencing with stochastic central k-space ordering. Postprocessing with interactive data language (Research Systems, Inc.) produced hybrid data sets containing dynamic angiographic information and the MR markers necessary for stereotactic transformation.

The stereotactic coordinates of vascular structures predefined from time-resolved MR angiography matched with DS angiography data in all cases. In 10 patients dosimetry planning could be performed based on time-resolved MR angiography data. In two patients, time-resolved MR angiography data alone were considered insufficient. The target volumes showed a notable shift of centers between modalities.</jats:p></jats:sec>\n<jats:sec>\n<jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n<jats:p> Integration of time-resolved MR angiography data into the Leksell GammaPlan system for patients with brain AVMs is feasible.

The Intuitive Operations Planning Process (IOPP) is an iterative planning procedure, developed for this project, in which a single course of action is continually evaluated and refined. An experimental evaluation of the IOPP was conducted in which two planning teams performed two simulated planning tasks, once with the CFOPP and once with the IOPP. Results show that the IOPP outperformed the CFOPP in terms of efficiency, quality of planning products, usability, operational effectiveness, and workload, but was rated inferior in terms of trust and reliability, and the potential to lead to errors. It appears that the IOPP may be able to provide benefits to operational planning in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness and its use should therefore be further examined. </jats:p>",

The findings revealed that autoflight systems did not significantly impact replanning, while the scenarios did significantly affect the primary performance measures of distance flown and time of flight. Additionally, pilots selected the most direct route when possible and did not distinguish between emergency and non-nominal flight conditions. Pilots also favored use of the automatically generated flight plans. We conclude that: 1) automatic flight path generation benefits in-flight replanning primarily by reducing workload in emergencies; and 2) such a system will require real time access to environmental information, including traffic, weather and terrain, be considered simultaneously. </jats:p>",
