      "abstract": "<jats:p> A general linear demographic model is derived which subsumes a wide variety of previously proposed population models. The general model includes in particular the linear model of interregional population growth and distribution developed by Rogers and others. One feature of this model is criticized, the allocation of outmigrants from any region in constant proportions among possible destination regions. Insofar as persons migrate to economic opportunities, outmigrants will distribute themselves among regions in proportion to these opportunities. Insofar as the economy of a region services its population, opportunities will vary directly with population. This suggests the introduction of a new model which allows for the variable allocation of outmigrants from each region according to the distribution of population among possible destination regions. Such a model is proposed, and it turns out to be nonlinear. The linear and nonlinear models are compared by applying them to the analysis of migration between three regions of the United States during 1955–1960. In the course of developing the new model, a set of interregional migration statistics is defined which eliminates the imperfect duality between interregional in- and out-migration rates. </jats:p>",

In particular, attention has been directed at the relationships between a regional population's fertility and mortality schedules and its growth and age distribution. Recently, however, studies by the author and others have extended the mathematical theory of population growth in order to examine the relationships between a multiregional population's fertility, mortality, and mobility schedules and its growth and regional age distributions. This paper summarizes and reviews the major contributions of these studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents accounts and models which can be used for spatial demographic analysis. It is shown that in any time period there are sixteen different kinds of demographic flows for a two region system. These flows can be represented in an accounting table. Some of the minor flows, involving double or triple demographic events such as a birth followed by a migration, cannot be measured directly from data, and an iterative scheme is offered for the calculation of these flows. In this way a complete set of accounts can be built up from existing data. Two principles of model building using this set of accounts are then discussed. The first uses a simple definition of demographic rates, while the second uses a definition of rates which employs a concept of ‘at-risk’ populations. Procedures are given for calculating these populations. The account building principles are illustrated with a worked example for a three region system: the West Riding of Yorkshire, the rest of England and Wales, and the rest of the world. The results presented in this paper are for aggregate populations. In a subsequent paper equivalent results will be presented for age/sex disaggregated populations. </jats:p>",
