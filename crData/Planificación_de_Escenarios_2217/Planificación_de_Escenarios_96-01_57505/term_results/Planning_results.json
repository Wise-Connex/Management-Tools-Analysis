The workshop was sponsored by the Philippine Federation for Natural Family Planning (NFP), the Family Planning Service of the Department of Health, and the Family Planning Operations Research and Training (FPORT) Program of the Population Council, Manila. Program managers and health officials were trained in operations research (OR) to enhance their understanding and appreciation of OR and its role in integrating NFP technology in the public health sector. Results of several diagnostic and intervention studies were presented by resource persons from university-based research institutions and the Population Council. Participants also reviewed the fundamentals of research methodology. The NFP technology was presented by the PFNFP staff. A process for identifying a particular NFP service delivery model for integrating within the public health sector was facilitated by the staff of PFNFP. The workshop included a discussion on planning the dissemination strategy and utilization of OR study findings. The final activity was identifying issues that OR can address in mainstreaming NFP in the public health system.</jats:p>"

Die nationalistische Bewegung in Orissa zwischen 1868 und 1870 brachte die Verwendung des Orija als moderne Sprache ernsthaft in Gang. Ihre frühere Position konnte die Sprache jedoch nicht wiedererlangen. Als 1936 der Staat Orissa gegründet wurde, scheiterte der Versuch, das Orija zu dessen Amts-sprache zu machen und seinen Wortschatz durch Terminologieplanung zu modernisieren. Ursachen hierfür waren das mangelnde Sprachbewußtsein der Orija, die pro-englische Einstellung der Beamtenschaft und ein zaghafter Korpusplanungsversuch, der sowohl im Widerspruch zu den Grundsätzen der Terminologieplanung selbst als auch zu denen des Ständigen Ausschusses für wissenschaftlich-technische Terminologie (SCSTT) stand.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tTerminplanado en la orisa: problemoj kaj prognozoj\n\t\tSub la brita regado, la kreskanta hegemonio de la angla en la tuta Bharato sovis la orisan al la duarangeco.

Cette date pivotale est marquée par la promulgation de l'article 23 de la Charte canadienne des droits et libertés. Les services éducatifs fournis aux francophones minoritaires ont évolué d'une relative autonomie préconfédérendaire (avant 1867) à de nombreuses pressions assimilationnistes (jusque dans les années 1960). Ce n'est que lorsque l'idéologie \"dualiste\" s'est incarnée dans la philosophie étatique fédérale que les francophones minoritaires ont acquis des droits scolaires substantiels. Et c'est surtout avec l'article 23 que des changements majeurs sont intervenus. Ce texte décrit chacune des étapes et analyse les courants idéologiques qui sous-tendent les changements éducatifs. Il conclut que les garanties constitutionnelles en faveur des minorités permettent à celles-ci de développer leur propre voix autonome. Mais il met également en garde puisque ces dispositions sont elles-mêmes soumises aux jeux de pouvoir qui fondent les idéologies.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingvoplanado, ideologio kaj konstitucia juro:\n\t\tfranclingva minoritata edukado en Kanado\n\t\tTiu ci studo eksponas la jurajn kaj ideologiajn ŝanĝojn kiuj okazis rilate al la franclingva minoritata eduksistemo antaü kaj post 1982, dato kiu markas turnan momenton kun la efektivigo de sekcio 23 de la Kanada Ĉarto de Rajtoj kaj Liberecoj. Franclingvaj edukservoj evoluis el kunteksto de relativa aŭtonomeco je asimiligaj premoj antaŭ la Konfederaciiĝo (1867) gis la \"dualisma\" ideologio gajnis potencan pozicion ce la federacia nivelo en la sesdekaj jaroj. Prilingvaj protektoj provizataj ene de la nova ideologia kadro, precipe per sekcio 23 de la Kanada Carto de Rajtoj kaj Liberecoj en 1981, estas estigintaj diversajn sangojn kiujn tiu ci studo dokumentas. Gi konkludas ke la provizado al minoritatoj de fortaj konstituciaj garantioj permesas al ili disvolvi sian propran vocon en demokratioj en kiuj la voco de la cefaj grupoj regas, sed gi avertas ke minoritatoj devas ne idealigi tiajn garantiojn: ili dependas de ideologiaj potenc-ludoj kiuj ne nepre sekvigas ilian malavaran aplikadon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tDie Politik des Sprachenkonflikts: Konsequenzen fur Sprachplanung und Politologie\n\t\tWie Sprachenkonflikte verlaufen hängt davon ab, ob sie eine überregionale Verkehrssprache, eine einheimische Nationalsprache oder eine Minderheitssprache betreffen. Bei solchen Konflikten geht es um Probleme der Bildung von Nationalstaaten und der soziokulturellen Integration sowie darum, politische Rivalitaten und politische Instabilität zu verhindern. Gängige Ansichten über die Lösungsmöglichkeiten bei Sprachenkonflikten werden hinterfragt. So ist etwa die Annahme, Sprachenvielfalt sei ein Entwicklungshemmnis, nicht immer gerechtfertigt, und die Anwendung bestimmter Kriterien auf die Lösung von Sprachenkonflikten zeugt oft eher von einer politischen Zielsetzung und ideologischen Vorgaben als von Objektivität. Die Dynamik der Sprache als Konfliktursache wird anhand von vier Funktionen beschrieben: Sprache als Symbol, als Mittel, als Wert und als Machtfaktor. Sprachenkonflikte können beispielsweise dadurch verscharft werden, daß der Symbolwert einer bestimmten Sprache oder eines bestimmten Alphabets betont wird. Konflikte können entstehen, wenn die Funktion der Sprache als Mittel zum sozialen oder wirtschaftlichen Aufstieg blockiert ist. Sie können entstehen, wenn nur ein bestimmter Aspekt der Sprache entwickelt wird. Und schlieBlich kann es bei Versuchen, wirtschaftliche oder politische Macht zu erlangen oder zu festigen, zu Konflikten kommen. Sprachenkonflikte werden oft durch vermeintliche Unterschiede in der sozialen Ordnung und gesellschaftlichen Wertvorstellungen genahrt, und auch durch Unterschiede in der sprachlichen Ausdrucksfahigkeit. Letzteres läßt sich nur andern, wenn die gesellschaftlichen und politischen Eliten ein Gefühl gemeinsamer Werte und Ideale entwickeln. Sprachplanungstheorie und Politologie sind noch nicht weit genug entwickelt, als daB wir Wesen und Reichweite von Sprachenkonflikten verstehen könnten, und wir sind auch noch nicht in der Lage, solche Konflikte verläßlich vorherzusagen. Hieraus ergibt sich die Notwendigkeit, einer praxisnahen Sprachenpolitik ein Erklärungsmodell fiir Sprachen-konflikte zur Verfügung zu stellen. Die Spieltheorie hat in dieser Hinsicht einiges zu bieten, ist aber nicht ohne weiteres anwendbar.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa politiko de lingvaj konfliktoj: Implicoj por lingva planado kaj politika teorio\n\t\tLingvaj konfliktoj montras diversajn formojn, depende de tio, ĉu ili koncernas lingvon de pli vasta komunikado, nacian indigenan lingvon, majoritatan lingvon, aŭ minoritatan lingvon. Sub risko en tiaj konfliktoj estas demandoj de nacio-konstruado, socikultura integrigo, kaj evitado de politika rivaleco kaj malstabileco. Akceptitaj antaŭsupozoj pri la solvado de lingvaj konfliktoj estas suspektindaj. Ekzemple, asertoj, ke lingva diverseco konsistigas obstaklon al evoluigo, ne nepre pravas, kaj la aplikado de specifaj kriterioj al solvado de lingvaj konfliktoj eventuale nur indikas politikan tagordon aŭ ideologian konvinkon kaj ne nepre objektivecon. Oni povas difini la dinamikon de lingvoj kiel kaŭzo de konflikto surbaze de kvar karakterizoj: la simbola, la ila, la rimeda, kaj la potenca. Tiel, konfliktojn povas fortigi emfazo je la simbola signifo de difinita lingvo aŭ skribsistemo; ili povas ekesti kiam la instrumenta uzo de iu lingvo kiel socia kaj ekonomia antaŭenigilo estas blokita; ili povas rezulti el decido evoluigi difinitajn aspektojn de lingvo kaj ne aliajn; kaj ili povas okazi rezulte de klopodo kapti aŭ firmigi ekonomian aŭ politikan potencon. Lingvajn konfliktojn ofte hejtas perceptitaj diferencoj en socia organizado kaj valoroj, aü diferencoj en parola repertuaro. Či-lastan oni povas sangi nur tiam kiam sociaj kaj politikaj elitoj kreas senton de komuna grundo kaj komunaj valoroj. Lingva planado kaj politika teorio ankoraü ne evoluis sufiče por ke ni komprenu la esencon kaj amplekson de lingvaj konfliktoj, kaj ni ne kapablas bone anticipi ilin. Sekve nepras kaj taügas evoluigo de klariga modelo de lingvaj konfliktoj, por krei funkcipovajn lingvajn poltikojn. Tiurilate, la ludo-teorio havas multan potencialon, sed estos malfacile apliki gin.</jats:p>",

The workshop was co-sponsored by the Family Planning Service of the Department of Health and the Family Planning Operations Research and Training Program of the Population Council, Manila. Representatives from the health and population offices of ten local government units (LGUs) worked with a select group of researchers to evolve a list of relevant topics for operations research (OR) and develop a concept paper on a chosen OR topic. The LGUs represented in the workshop were selected from a group of local governments participating in the LGU Performance Program of the Department of Health. A series of lectures and paper presentations on three major modules comprised the training workshop. Workshop sessions provided program managers and researchers the opportunity to put all these new learnings into practice by working together on their concept papers. The training workshop was capped by the individual LGU presentations of concept papers to a review panel which provided its critique and comments.</jats:p>"

In the 1980s, principally through funding initiatives on the part of the National Park Service and through the efforts of NPS preservation planners such as John Knoerl, many states began their first attempts at comprehensive preservation planning. One of the more highly acclaimed of these early planning documents was the Resource Protection Planning Process for Texas.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> John Nolen's three decades of planning consultation to many southern cities, beginning with his role as advisor to the Charlotte, North Carolina, Park and Tree Commission in 1905, illustrate how planning was a continuing influence throughout the heyday of the New South movement. Yet Nolen's planning in southern cities also offers a window into the broader American urban planning process at a time when public institutions had not yet established a dominant role in regulating urban development. Nolen's work speaks directly to the current-day dilemma of planning as a visionary art or as a rational policy process. His planning model for cities reflected the unique melding of these conflicting crosscurrents in planning theory and was a model that appealed to the urban aspirations of the New South. By examining Nolen's southern planning practice in two cities where he had a long association—Charlotte and Roanoke, Virginia—it is possible to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the guided decentralization model that he offered to the region during its formative urban development era. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SAMENVATTING\n\t\tTaaiplanning als bezinning over taal en maatschappij:\n\t\tde taalkundige ideologie van een geleerde traditie\n\t\tTaalplanning is een traditie die vooral in de jaren 1960 en 1970 bijzonder productief was en in zich een groot optimisme ontwikkelde. De traditie viel wat stil in de jaren 1980, maar kent nu weer een heropbloei, o.m. omwille van de ontwikkelingen in Zuid-Afrika. In deze bijdrage wil ik een evaluatie van de voorbije traditie aansnijden, in het perspectief van de optimalisatie van het theoretisch, conceptueel en methodologisch kader van taalplanning-studies. Ik schets eerst kort de historische ontwikkeling van taalplanning, en ga vervolgens in op enkele ideologische aspecten die in veel traditioneel werk terug te vinden zijn. Ik bespreek achtereenvolgens de courante boutade dat taalplanning geen theoretische achtergrond zou hebben; de intuïtieve beperkingen die taaiplanners zich in hun studies leken op te leggen; de organische visies op taal en maatschappij ; het oligolingualisme en de assumpties van efficiëntie en integratie. Vervolgens vat ik de kritieken van Glyn Williams en Andrew Apter samen. Zij bepleiten een sterkere politieke invalshoek, die taal naast een reeks andere maatschappelijke kenmerken plaatst. Ik sluit af met een pleidooi voor een combinatie van een historiografische en een etnografische benadering in het bestuderen van language planning.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLingvoplanado kiel debato pri lingvo kaj socio:\n\t\tla lingvistika ideologio de sciencista tradicio\n\t\tLingvoplanado estas tradicio kiu estis tre fekunda cefe en la 1960-aj kaj 1970-aj jaroj kaj kovis en si grandan optimismon. Gi iom fadis en la 1980-aj jaroj, sed nun denove floras, i.a. pro la evoluoj en Suda Afriko. Mi ci tie ekanalizas la tradicion de la pasinteco cele al plibonigo de la teoria, koncepta kaj metodologia kadro de studoj pri lingvoplanado. Mi koncize skizas la historian evoluon de lingvoplanado, kaj poste tusas aron da ideologiaj aspektoj kiujn oni renkontas en multaj el la tradiciaj laboraĵoj. Mi diskutas la aserton ke lingvoplanado ne havus teorian fonon, la intuiciajn limigojn kiujn lingvoplanantoj sajnis starigi al siaj propraj studoj, la organajn konceptojn de lingvo kaj socio, plurlingvismon, kaj la premisojn de efikeco kaj integrado. Mi resumas la kritikojn de Glyn Williams kaj Andrew Apter, kiuj pledas por pli politika aliro en kiu lingvo estas unu el aro da sociaj faktoroj. Fine mi pledas por tio ke en la studado de lingvoplanado oni uzu kombinon el historiografia kaj etnografia aliroj.</jats:p>",

This workshop was co-sponsored by the Family Planning Service of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Family Planning Operations Research and Training Program of the Population Council, Manila. Fourteen local government units (LGUs) were represented in the workshop: Benguet, Cagayan, Ilocos Sur, Tarlac, Quezon City, Capiz, Negros Oriental, Bacolod, Misamis Oriental, Davao del Sur, Davao City, Maguindanao, North Cotabato, and South Cotabato. They are all participants in the LGU Performance Program of the DOH, which was undertaken as a response to the devolution of health services to local government units as mandated by the Local Government Code. Resource persons from academe, research institutions, and the DOH elaborated on OR in five sessions: Introduction to Operations Research, Considerations in Conducting an OR Study, Conducting the \"Cluster Survey\": 1997 LLP Benchmark #6, Special Topics in OR, and Preparation of an OR Concept Paper.</jats:p>"

A variety of topics are covered: male fertility preferences, opinions about male methods of contraception, family planning (FP) decision-making, and recent efforts to involve Bangladeshi men in FP programs. Men’s desired family size in Bangladesh is small; only one-third of respondents in the most recent DHS survey wanted more than two children. The same survey revealed that knowledge of at least one modern method of FP is practically universal and that attitudes toward contraception are overwhelmingly favorable. Only superficial information on the frequency and quality of communication about FP between spouses and the effects of such communication on contraceptive usage exists. Not much effort has been made to involve men in FP programs in Bangladesh. The few references that could be found suggest that men can be successfully incorporated into outreach programs and that contraceptive prevalence can be raised through such efforts.</jats:p>"

Though the architects and planners promoting these ideas are usually careful to emphasize the many ingredients necessary to obtain desired results—straightening of streets to open the local network, \"calming\" of traffic, better integration of land uses and densities, and so on—a growing literature and number of plans feature virtually any combination of these elements as axiomatic improvements. The potential problem is that the traffic impacts of the new plans are generally indeterminate, and it is unclear whether designers understand the reasons well enough to avoid unintended results.

Using survey data gathered in one Bedouin town, the provision of public services by the government and their effective use by the Bedouin community are measured and analyzed. The effects of urbanization on the Bedouin economy and social structures— both positive and negative—are addressed. It is concluded that Bedouin development programs such as that in the Negev Desert would benefit from greater awareness of and sensitivity to the cultural, religious, and social features of these groups. It is suggested that more comprehensive, user-oriented planning which encourages and includes public participation is essential in furthering social and economic development in such communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Increasing attention has been paid to quality of care (QOC) in family planning (FP) during the last few years, and there have been several initiatives to strengthen QOC in FP in the developing world. This paper reviews the quality of the FP program in India’s public and private sectors, and examines six elements: choice of methods, information given to clients, technical competence, interpersonal relations, continuity of care and follow-up, and appropriate constellation of services. Overall, the paper finds that not much attention has been paid to QOC and hence the level is quite low. Evidence and observations indicate that QOC may be slightly better in the nongovernmental sector. In many areas adequate information is not available to assess QOC, especially in the private sector. Overall, substantial efforts are needed to improve QOC in FP in India. The paper discusses why QOC is poor and offers suggestions for improving each dimension. As the Government of India is actively considering revising its FP program strategy and adopting a reproductive health approach, it may be an opportune time to improve QOC in the family welfare program.</jats:p>"

There is concern about the financial and social sustainability of the program. Other issues include achievement of replacement-level fertility within a stipulated period and improvement of MCH-FP service quality. It is widely believed that most of the concerns will be taken care of with effective community participation. Before activating community initiatives, it is worth carrying out action research. A literature review was completed from July to October 1996 to identify a range of models used for increasing community participation and experiences in terms of implementation, management, financing, monitoring and evaluation, and sustainability in both rural and urban areas. Attempts were also made to identify a set of indicators to assess the level of community participation in these programs. This report documents the results of the review.</jats:p>"

It schematically illustrates a constant-amplitude stress cycling about a possible mean load that leads to the fracture of a single part or specimen. The article discusses the evaluation of the range of transition and of the finite-endurance range for fatigue curves. It concludes with a discussion on extrapolation from the range of finite endurance into the range of transition.</jats:p>",

Its elements include analysis of a full range of alternatives, the use of benefit-cost analysis to compare alternatives, public involvement in the development and evaluation of alternatives, analysis of uncertainties in forecasts of future conditions, and continuous monitoring of transportation system performance. The theory and methods of integrated transportation planning for implementation by a metropolitan planning organization developed for the Puget Sound Regional Council are discussed. The discussion includes how integrated transportation planning fits into the strategic planning process, the similarities and differences between integrated transportation planning and the current transportation planning process, and the analytic issues raised by implementing integrated transportation planning. </jats:p>",

Infant and under-5 mortality rates have fallen, yet maternal mortality remains high. The Government of Botswana has developed an extensive network of health care facilities that provide services through an integrated approach. Family planning (FP) services are available at all three levels of the MOH system (hospitals, clinics, health posts). Services for managing sexually transmitted diseases (STDS) have recently undergone a substantial change with the introduction of the Syndromic Approach to STD management. There is concern about a rapid increase in the number of persons infected with HIV. Although the Government of Botswana continues to make efforts to meet the need for FP, STD, and AIDS services, there remains a large unmet need. The Botswana Population Assistance Project is USAID’s approach to strengthening MCH/FP and STD/AIDS services to improve quality and availability of FP/STD services and expand AIDS prevention measures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1994, the Population Council, Manila, conducted an operations research (OR) project entitled “DMPA Monitoring and Follow-up Studies.” The activity was undertaken to provide accurate and timely support to the DMPA Reintroduction Program of the Department of Health. Commonly known as Depo-Provera, DMPA stands for Depo-Medroxy Progesterone Acetate, an extremely effective injectable contraceptive given every three months. This report focuses on the survey component of these studies which aims to comprehensively examine the influence on DMPA use of factors classified into the following eight major areas: socioeconomic and demographic characteristics; reproductive history; contraceptive history; adoption of DMPA; quality of care related to DMPA; the respondent's experience with DMPA; husband-wife communication regarding family size and family planning practice; and attitudes towards DMPA held by relatives and peers. Findings are taken from bivariate and multivariate analyses of 812 women randomly selected from DMPA acceptors in nine of the ten local government units covered by the first phase of the program. These acceptors were surveyed first in February and then again in June-July 1995 to document DMPA experience and perceptions since the first DMPA injection.</jats:p>"

This shift has been fuelled by the demise of apartheid-based town planning and an acceptance that urban reconstruction and development is a priority. An important gap, however, has been the absence of an alternative concept of urban spatial organisation.  The intention of this book is to provide guidance to professionals involved in layout planning, by putting forward an approach which is significantly different from that which has prevailed in South Africa in recent decades. The authors stress the need for uniqueness in settlement formation and argue amongst other things, for pedestrian-oriented road geometries, integrated neighbourhoods, extroverted public facilities and an emphasis on the collective functions of services, instead of more conventional car-oriented road geometries, neighbourhood cells, introverted public facilities and an emphasis on residential service functions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>SUMMARY\n\t\tLocating the Scientific Literature on Interlinguistics and Esperanto Studies\n\t\tInterlinguistics and Esperanto studies are still largely neglected in mainstream linguistics. One reason for this is the difficulty experienced by non-specialists in locating the scientific literature in these fields, some 60% of which is written in planned languages (and 90% of the latter in Esperanto). The paper reviews the most important means of keeping abreast the existing and continually evolving literature on interlinguistics and Esperanto studies, through various bibliographic tools (on general linguistics and interlinguistics), through bibliographic services in newsletters, book catalogues, and specialized libraries, and through the Internet. Finally databases of active scientists are mentioned.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tVojoj al interlingvistika kaj esperantologia fakliteraturo\n\t\tInterlingvistikaj kaj esperantologiaj temoj ankoraŭ malofte vekas la intereson de la establiginta lingvoscienco. Unu el la kaŭzoj estas la malfacila aliro al la faka literaturo por nefakulo, malfacila i.a. pro tio, car cirkau 60% estas verkitaj en planlingvoj (de tio ĉirkaŭ 90% en Esperanto). La studo montras la plej gravajn eblecojn orientigi pri la ekzistanta kaj daüre nove aperanta fakliteraturo interlingvistika kaj esperantologia en diverstipaj bibliografioj (ĝenerallingvistikaj kaj interlingvistikaj), krome en bibliografie orientitaj bultenoj, planlingvaj libro-katalogoj (Esperanto, Interlingua), en fakbibliotekoj kaj en \"Internet\".

Das im Oktober 1990 verabschiedete Gesetz über die Amts-sprache der Slowakischen Republik hat jedoch die sprachenrechtliche Stellung der 600.000 Volksungarn und der übrigen Minderheiten empfindlich beschnitten. In der Form einer Rezension zweier kiirzlich in der Slowakei erschienener ungarischer Bücher zeigt der Beitrag soziale, politische und sprachliche Aspekte der Konflikte um den Sprachgebrauch der Behörden, zweisprachige Ortsschilder und nichtslowakischsprachige Personennamen in der Slowakei zwischen 1990 und 1995.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa konflikto pri nomoj en Slovakio\n\t\tPost la velura revolucio en 1989 oni esperis, ke la etnaj konfliktoj en Slovakio malfortiĝos. Tamen la leĝo pri la oficiala lingvo de la Slovaka Respubliko, akceptita en oktobro 1990, grave reduktis la lingvajn rajtojn de la 600 000 indigenaj hungaroj kaj la aliaj minoritatoj. Recenzante du hungarajn librojn lastatempe aperintajn en Slovakio, la artikolo montras sociajn, politikajn kaj lingvajn aspektojn de la konfliktoj pri la oficiala lingvouzo, pri dulingvaj tabuloj de loknomoj, kaj pri neslovaklingvaj personaj nomoj en Slovakio inter 1990 kaj 1995.</jats:p>",

Casi documentati di famiglie che usavano l'esperanto risalgono al 1919. Dagli anni '70 la loro visibilità nel movimento esperantista è aumentata; un ente di coordinamento, Rondo Familia, è stato formato nel 1995. In quasi tutte le circa 350 famiglie attualmente documentate, l'esperanto è parlato ai bambini dal padre. Coppie con una origine etnicolinguistica mista sono solo circa un terzo di tutte le coppie. Le informazioni a disposizione suggeriscono che il \"bilinguismo artificiale\" praticato dai due terzi rimanenti delle coppie puö avere altrettanto successo del \"bilinguismo naturale\". Il parallelo linguistico più vicino sembra essere quello delle prime fasi di rinascita dell'ebraico.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\t\"Patrina lingvo \" parolata precipe de patroj\n\t\tLa artikolo prezentas superrigardon pri Esperanto kiel familia kaj denaska lingvo. Kazoj de Esperanto-familioj estas dokumentitaj ekde la jaro 1919. Ekde la 70-aj jaroj ili akiras pli da atento en la Esperanto-movado; kunordiga instanco, Rondo Familia, fondigis en 1995. En preskaŭ ĉiu familio el la proksimume 350 aktuale registritaj, temas pri la patro kiu parolas Esperanton al la infanoj. Miksetnaj paroj konsistigas nur trionon de la konataj kazoj. La haveblaj informoj indikas ke la \"artefarita dulingveco\" pratikata de la ceteraj du trionoj estas same sukcespova kiel la \"natura dulingveco\". La plej trafa lingvistika komparo sajnas esti la fruaj stadioj de la revivigo de la hebrea lingvo.</jats:p>",

Can scanning software be used independently by someone who relies on synthesized speech output? How much RAM (Random Access Memory) and how large a hard drive are needed to run assistive technologies? How big a monitor is needed for screen enlargement software? Is the screen enlargement program compatible with the voice output program? Do we need a Braille printer? a refreshable Braille display? a personal transmitter/receiver system?

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tSprachenpolitik und Imperialismus Großbritanniens in Indien\n\t\tIm 18. und 19. Jahrhundert ist die britische Sprachenpolitik in Indien von einer Kontroverse zwischen Orientalisten und Anglisten gekennzeichnet. Beide Seiten verfolgen dasselbe Ziel: eine Festigung der britischen Herrschaft über Indien. Die Meinungen scheiden sich an der Frage, ob die örtlichen Sprachen mit den Verkehrssprachen aus vorbritischer Zeit oder Englisch das beste Mittel zu diesem Zweck sind. Die Gegensätze wurzeln inunterschiedlichen im Westen verbreiteten Auffassungen vom Orient. Ein gutes Indiz für den Grad der Umsetzung der jeweiligen Auffassung ist die Sprache der unteren Gerichtsbarkeit und der örtlichen Verwaltung in Indien. Hier kommt es zu einem Wechsel von einer Politik des Persischen, Hindustani und Sanskrit um 1780 über eine Zwischenphase mit örtlichen Sprachen zum Englischen ab etwa 1830. Die Kontroverse zwischen Orientalisten und Anglisten stellt den sprachlichen Niederschlag einer Veränderung der englischen Auffassung von Indien zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts dar. Die Untersuchung dieser Kontroverse zeigt einen engen Zusammenhang zwischen Sprachenpolitik und politischer Macht.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa britaj lingvopolitiko kaj imperiismo en Hindio\n\t\tLa britan lingvopolitikon en la 18-a kaj 19-a jarcentoj en Hindio karakterizis disputo inter orientistoj kaj anglistoj. Ambaŭ partioj celis al plifortigo de la brita rego super Hindio, sed ili malsamopiniis pri la demando ĉu la pli bona ilo por atingi tiun celon estis la lokaj lingvoj kun la interlingvoj uzitaj dum la antaübrita islama rego, aŭ la angla. La disputo originis en malsamaj perceptoj pri la oriento inter okcidentanoj. Taŭga indikilo pri la grado de realigo de certaj eroj de la du vidpunktoj estas la lingvoj uzataj en la malaltnivelaj jugejoj kaj en la loka administrado en Hindio. Observeblas transiro de politiko uzanta la persan, la hindustanan kaj la sanskritan en la 1780-aj jaroj, tra intera periodo kun lokaj lingvoj al uzado de la angla ekde la 1830-aj jaroj. La disputo inter orientistoj kaj anglistoj povas esti konsiderata lingva esprimo de la percepto pri Hindio fare de angloj en la frua 19-a jarcento. Gia studo montras senperan rilaton inter lingvopolitiko kaj politika potenco.</jats:p>",

Za razliku od ranijih istrazivanja, u kojima se podatke interpretiralo na nacin pogodan za analizu drustvenih pokreta, ovaj pregled stavlja naglasak na sociologiju jezicnih manjina. Istrazivanje provedeno na uzorku 156 aktivnih esperantista 1985 godine, ukazuje da esperanto funkcionira prvenstveno kao sredstvo usmenog i neformalnog opcenja, a tek na drugom mjestu kao sredstvo neformalne ili poluformalne pismene komunikacije u dopisivanju i unutar siroke mreze esperantskog tiska.

Enketo pri 156 aktivaj esperantistoj el 1985 supozigas, ke Esperanto rolas unuavice kiel neformala buŝa komunikilo kaj duavice kiel neformala aŭ duonformala skriba komunikilo por korespondado kaj kadre de vasta reto de periodaĵoj.

The documentation usually serves a number of different purposes. The task of a documentation system is to fulfil these purposes in a methodically correct manner and as economically as possible. This requires that the properties of the documentation system be planned systematically with a view to the goals pursued. To support systematic planning, a “documentation protocol” is proposed analogous to the “study protocol” used for controlled clinical trials. The individual sections of the proposed documentation protocol are described and the design options which exist in the corresponding planning phases are pointed out. Experience gained by the application of the documentation protocol is discussed.</jats:p>",

Simultaneous planning and execution is the process of taking an implicit task description, planning a sequence of explicit execution commands e.g. for robots and monitoring their execution. As the execution planning process is running completely on-line, that means during the actual execution of the assembly task, the planning process is highly reactive based on sensor information about the robot&amp;rsquo;s present environment. In order to meet the problem that medical data is usually complex and needs time-costly preprocessing an appropriate architecture for evaluating sensor data has been developed. In this paper, a detailed presentation of the phases of execution planning and sensor data evaluation is given. As an example, the execution of a LeFort I osteotomy is presented.</jats:p>"

In this paper the notion of ‘displacement’ is used to reflect on these constitutive geographies, and in particular as a way of understanding contemporary consumption neither as a homogenising nor a locally bounded social activity. Two aspects of the geographies of displacement within consuming worlds are highlighted: the representations of origins, travels, and destinations—or geographical knowledges—that surround and in part comprise commodities; and the juxtapositional character of the arenas in which consumption takes and makes place. These geographies are illustrated and critically analysed through examples of commodities that deploy representations of the ‘global’, the ‘ethnic’, and the ‘hospitable’. </jats:p>",

The problem is solved in three steps: (1) transform the arbitrary shaped obstacles in the 2-D workspace into simple convex polygons; (2) generate a local minima-free potential field on the workspace; (3) generate a streamline from the starting position towards the goal position in the artificial potential field. The computational complexity of the pertinent algorithms justify the applicability of the approach in real-time. Simulation results are included.</jats:p>",

A two-day seminar on \"Male Involvement in Family Planning: A Challenge for the National Programme\" was held in Dhaka June 25–26, 1996. The objectives were to review research findings on methods currently used, determine male involvement policy and strategy, and formulate an action plan including IEC, counseling, and programmatic interventions. Speakers emphasized the need for more male involvement in FP and the prevailing misconceptions about male contraception that should be addressed with IEC programs. Participants felt that to increase male participation in FP there should be action to marginalize sociocultural constraints, ensure that service facilities cater to male needs, arrange service-provider training, undertake innovative research, and extend coverage of male issues in IEC activities. Summary recommendations are noted in this report.</jats:p>"

In order \nto develop a universal procedure for the formation of tools within the framework of a flexible system \nof internal planning, the paper identifies variants of the characteristics of the development of this \nsystem, which can be considered the most simplified, i.e., the characteristics of the development of \nthe system of internal planning of enterprises are presented. For the development of the internal \nplanning system, the article proposes a procedure for forming the tools of a flexible internal planning \nsystem, which contains a set of successive stages. In addition, the paper presents a comprehensive \nassessment that can be obtained only when analyzing indicators in dynamics  before the start of \nactivities related to the formation of flexible system tools within the framework of internal planning \nand after a certain period of time of the flexible system tools functioning. The proposed model of a \nflexible system within the framework of intra company planning is built on this basis and creates key \nelements related to this management tool, and fully reveals the existing relationships, giving a \nsimplified view of the mechanism of interaction of these elements.</jats:p>"

Rozróžnienie powyžsze jest dyskutowane z perspektywy jçzyka esperanto, który rozwinal sie z projektu jçzyka do dojrzaiego srodka komunikacjii miedzynarodowej wspólnoty jezykowej žyjacej w swiatowej diasporze. Artykul nawiazuje do trychotomicznego modelu, którym Rudi Keller posluguje sie przy opisie procesów dotyczacych zmian jçzyka. Dotychczasowa dychotomia \"jçzyk naturalny\" i \"jçzyk sztuczny\" jest pelna braków, dlatego Keller proponuje dodatkowa, kategorie, która okresla mianem \"zjawisk trzeciego rodzaju\". To trzecie rozróžnienie dotyczy zjawisk historyczno-rozwojowych, do których Keller zalicza jezyki etniczne. Okazuje sie jednak, že to trzecie rozróžnienie Kellera obejmuje jeszcze wiecej; mianowicie — z jezyków powstalych w wyniku planowania — conajmniej esperanto. Od poczatku 20-go wieku dajace sie zauwažyč przejscie esperanta z kategorii \"artefaktów\" do kategorii \"zjawisk trzeciego rodzaju\" naležy bez watpienia do jednego z najciekawszych procesów w historii jçzyka.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tLa dihotomio \"artefarita \" kontraü \"natura \" kaj la historia fenomeno de la funkcianta planlingvo\n\t\tLa artikolo pridiskutas la (en hodiaüaj lingvistikaj rondoj ankoraü gis nun uzatan) klasikan dihotomion \"naturaj\" kontraü \"artefaritaj\" lingvoj. Či tiu diferencigo estas ĉi tie traktata el la perspektivo de Esperanto - lingvo evoluiginta el nura lingvoprojekto al matura komunikilo de mondvaste dissemita lingvo-komunumo. La artikolo apogas sin sur la trihotoman modeion, kiun Rudi Keller aplikas ce priskribo de procezoj de lingvošanĝiĝo. La kutime uzata dihotomio \"natura\" kontraü \"artefarita\" estas deficita; tial Keller suplementas gin per unu plua kategorio, kiun li nomas \"fenomenoj de la tria speco\". Keller gin rilatigas al dinamikaj, historie-evoluaj fenomenoj, al kiuj li alkalkulas la etnajn lingvojn. Evidentigas tarnen, ke ĉi tiu tria kategorio de Keller ampleksas ankoraü pli multon, nome inter la planlingvoj almenaü Esperanton. La transiro de Esperanto el la kategorio \"artefaritajoj\" al tiu de \"fenomenoj de la tria speco\", observebla ekde la komenco de la 20-a jarcento, estas certe unu el la plej interesaj procezoj en la lingvohistorio.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\t\"Soy catalán, pero no tengo manias \": Cambios en las actitudes públicas catalanas\n\t\tEl catalán, idioma minoritario en España, goza de gran prestigio entre la población catalana. Durante muchos años, los ciudadanos de Cataluna se identificaron claramente como \"catalanes\" en encuestas sobre su identidad etnolingüística. En 1993, en medio de una polémica sobre el uso del catalán en las escuelas y un conflicto politico a nivel federal, la situación cambió radicalmente. Los encuestados preferian identificarse como \"catalán y [otra cosa].\" La idea de ser solamente catalán se hizo mucho menos popular en pocos anos. En la época actual, presentarse como catalán, o catalana, sin calificativos, podría interpretarse como algo hostil o fanático. Este texto trata de explicar como ciertos cambios geopolíticos en Europa, además de la \"guerra fría\" de la prensa madrileña contra la política lingüística del gobierno catalán, causaron tal evolución en la opinión publica catalana. A pesar de cierta \"de-Catalanización\" de la identidad catalana, la lengua catalana podría seguir avanzando como lengua vehicular. Mientras haya presión personal, económica y administrativa en favor del catalán, la gente aprenderá esta lengua. De esta manera, mientras que muchos se identificarán como catalanes \"pero sin manias,\" el catalán seguirá progresando.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\t\"Mi estas kataluno, sed ne fanatikulo\":\n\t\tSangiganta tajdo en la kataluna publika opinio\n\t\tLa kataluna lingvo, kvankam minoritata en Hispanio, havas altan prestigon en Katalunio. Dum multaj jaroj logantoj de Katalunio emis rekte identigi sin kun la etikedo \"kataluna\" se ili respondis al lingvaj enketoj. En 1993 tiu situacio estis ŝangita. En tiu periodo furoris malaproba kampanjo kontraŭ la politiko de la kataluna registaro. Hispanlingvaj presitaj kaj elektronikaj komunikiloj daŭre atakis la katalunan lingvan kaj edukadan politikon. Reage al tio kaj al aliaj okazajoj, parolantoj kaj de la hispana kaj de la kataluna preferis identigi sin kiel \"katalunoj kaj [io alia]\" aŭ \"katalunoj sed ne fanatikuloj\". La etikedo \"nur kataluna\" (tre satita kelkajn jarojn antaŭe) por multaj farigis identigo malsatata aŭ eĉ ekstremisma. Tiu ci artikolo klopodas klarigi, kiel konfliktoj en Eŭropo, la tutlanda kaj la kataluna balotpolitiko, nova politiko de edukado, kaj la \"malvarma milito\" pesitaj kontraü la kataluna registaro kune kreis tiun sangon de la publika opinio. Malgraŭ la malemo etikedi sin \"kataluno\" (sen pliaj klarigoj), la kataluna eble ja plu progresos kiel lingvo de Katalunio. Politika, ekonomia kaj socia premo plu subtenas la progreson de Katalunio. Do povus esti, ke la homoj sentos sin \"malpli katalunaj\", sed lingve agos \"pli katalune\".</jats:p>",

While these concerns are consistent with theories emphasizing life-cycle and precautionary motives, the idea that saving involves self-control was also mentioned repeatedly.</jats:p>"

This article examines the attitudes of residents in a Midwestern city considering the possible introduction of a riverboat casino in their community. In addition to surveying the general population, a subsample of 104 African American households was contacted to ensure that this population's views would be represented. Similar data from the African American and white samples were compared using t-tests and chi-square statistics. Results indicate that the minority population were somewhat more ambivalent toward and less opposed to the proposed casino and were generally less likely to gamble themselves. Furthermore, they indicated a preference for new tax revenues to be allocated to social programs. </jats:p>",

A number of the leading American universities have developed comprehensive planning processes that offer suggestive guidance for managing in this new environment. These processes have emphasized: clarifying and articulating norms essential to the legimacy of planning; grouping and consolidating functions; promoting reciprocal communication; encouraging the development of a planning capacity within each strategic unit; and increasing direct communication and the sharing of information among members of the academic community. Essentially these universities have conceived of comprehensive planning as a problem of organizational design, systematically seeking means of promoting integration in a highly differentiated organization. The specific mechanisms by which this integration has been accomplished are reviewed.</jats:p>",

Widely accepted observations about the fluidity and multiple dimensions of identity do not adequately link situated practices with the repeated (re)constitution and destabilization of identity elements. Moreover, it is not only through the use of purchased goods to produce individual and collective difference that consumption and identity are connected. Circumstances in contemporary commodity societies demand that critical human geographical studies of consumption and identity unconventionally couple ethnography and political economy, that the practices of ‘safe’ geography and ‘safe’ representation be forsaken. </jats:p>",

Malgré la place importante qu'elles occupent, par leur comme par leur population, et malgré nombreux handicaps dont elles souffrent, montagnes marocaines n'ont que bénéficié des aides de l'Etat. Alors qu'un aménagement rural montagnard adéquat doit absolument dépasser l'approche qui est plutôt centralisatrice et l'action étatique est restée très techniciste sectorielle. Il est donc temps d'opter pour politique de la montagne concertée, contractuelle, s'intégrant harmonieusement dans politique nationale d'aménagement du territoire.</jats:p>"

We emphasise the density of retail shops in England; the reflexive relationships among ‘consumers’, shopkeepers, and consumption sites; and the inability of current theorisations based on the semiotics of advertising to address questions about consumers' understandings and identities in an age prior to widespread product advertising, department stores, and mass retail outlets. We contend that, then as now, peoples' interpretation of objects and identities involved practical, embodied knowledges rather than the sorts of explicit, intellectualised understandings central to most contemporary accounts of consumption. Such practical knowledges have been underresearched, and we point to some concepts in recent work which can assist in their theorising. </jats:p>",

It is not unlikely that some targets will be set for the reduction of CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions. If a stringent reduction target should be imposed on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emitted from a national energy system, this can possibly have as severe an impact upon electric power sectors as the oil price crises experienced in the seventies. It is, however, quite uncertain whether or not political muscles will be used specifically for tackling the CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> problem in the near future.</jats:p><jats:p>In such a context, this paper presents a new method for optimal power system planning under uncertain CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions control policies. The derived optimal expansion plan gives us the minimum expected value of the sum of the total system cost and the total amount of carbon taxes levied on net CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> emissions from fossil fuel‐fired power plants. The stochastic dynamic optimization problem discussed here is formulated as a linear programming problem decomposable into several small subproblems. The proposed method can take into account a specific future scenario of the magnitude of control policy uncertainties, which can be presumably resolved in the first half of the next century due to the increase in scientific wisdom.</jats:p><jats:p>In order to evaluate the usefulness of the method proposed here, the authors also present a simple case study with the Japanese national power system up to the year 2050.</jats:p>",

This makes it possible to consider biodiversity as a decision objective among multiple objectives in tactical forest planning. Biodiversity is operationalized by decomposing it into measurable environmental components that describe its dimensions. The relative importance of the components is assessed via pairwise comparisons. The relationship between the value of the component and the overall biodiversity is estimated and described for each component as a subpriority function. The relationship can be nonlinear. A biodiversity index is calculated for each alternative forest plan based on the components and their weighting, the subpriority functions, and the predicted qualities of the forest area when implementing the plans. The approach is illustrated by a case study. Using this approach, the relationship between biodiversity and the other objective variables, as well as the effects of the components of biodiversity, can be analyzed numerically. </jats:p>",

A suitable objective function, combining the requirements of time optimality and path smoothness, is proposed, which is subject to the continuity of joint trajectories, limits on their rates of change and collision-free constraints. Fast and effective collision detection for the arms is achieved using the Kuhn- Tucker conditions along with the convexity of the distance function and relying on geometrical relationships between cylinders. Nonlinear optimization is used to solve this path planning problem. The feasibility of this method is illustrated both by simulation and by experimental results.</jats:p>",

First, the goal‐decision network (GDN) is constructed to model this planning problem, and the negotiation algorithm is applied to utilize both subtransmission system planning GDN, which attempts to capture its knowledge, and negotiation operators, which search for the most feasible and promising decisions in this planning GDN. Finally, the negotiation expert system is demonstrated for the subtransmission system planning using a real system.</jats:p>",

In this paper two major approaches to locational decisionmaking are overviewed: optimizing decision rules (utility-function-based methods) and satisficing decision rules (goal-programming methods). Their advantages and disadvantages are discussed. From these two concepts a quasi-satisficing decision rule is developed and operationalized through a reference point method. A framework for an interactive decision support system (DSS) for tackling MCLPs is proposed. The system integrates a network model with the quasi-satisficing approach. It is argued that the DSS data and analytical components can be effectively integrated by means of the interactive decision support concept that involves a feedback exchange of information between a decisionmaker and a computer-based support system. This concept allows for the exploration of the locational decision problem and the alternative solutions both in decision space and in criterion outcome space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The planning of syntheses in organic chemistry has continuously been given more solid foundations during the last decades. Widely applicable rules have been formulated. Nearly parallel with the systematization of this field the potential for the automation of synthesis planning by the use of computers has been promulgated. However, after more than two decades of continuing efforts by a number of groups, computer‐assisted synthesis planning, which relies on large libraries of synthons and transforms, has failed to establish itself firmly. This is in marked contrast to the acceptance of reaction databases. Their use has become routine with a surprisingly short time. Apparently the classical approaches to computer‐assisted synthesis planning do not satisfy the needs of the preparative chemist. However, this lack of success does not yet mean the complete demise of the whole field. The conceptual shortcomings and problems of the first generation of programs are both of technical and psychological nature and need to be critically analyzed. Meanwhile, work has begun on systems of the second generation, which try to support the chemist in the synthesis laboratory with new methods in novel ways. Care is taken to mimic and support the typical planning style of the human chemist, who often on the spur of the moment switches direction in planning as well as his (sub) goals and methods. New tools that correspond better to the thinking patterns and working habits of chemists empower the user to plan syntheses of organic molecules in an interactive and innovative fashion. We feel that this field is far from dead and continue our research activities. In this article we introduce a system with a number of novel concepts and demonstrate its capabilities with some practical examples.</jats:p>",

This paper is an examination of the experience of this ‘transition’ in Slovakia. It is argued that, whereas a process of regional convergence took place under state socialism, we are presently witnessing the regional economic fragmentation of the Slovak economy. New forms of regional uneven development result from the combined effects of the collapse of the national economy, the globalisation and marketisation of economic life, and the interaction between local economic and industrial structures and strategies. By focusing upon the comparative dimensions of change in different regions we can begin to unpick some of the causal mechanisms underlying this trajectory of fragmentation. Of particular importance are the uneven development of new firm formation, foreign direct investment, and the expansion of trade with capitalist markets. The author examines the ability of regions in Slovakia to engage in these dual processes of marketisation and globalisation and finds that integration into the capitalist world economy is highly uneven. </jats:p>",

Successful transition planning for postsecondary education extends beyond meeting the academic requirements for admission. Planning efforts must also include direct skills instruction in self-advocacy, independent living, decision making, and working with students to identify career goals. Three primary areas of consideration stand out when creating a plan which promotes independence and responsibility within students as they prepare for postsecondary education: exploring postsecondary education environments, identifying skills needed by students for a successful transition, and identifying the family's role in promoting the skills of self-advocacy and independence.</jats:p>",

The main development principle adopted consists in combining measures to channel visitors (signs, zoning) with other measures to provide them with professional guides, the latter being used when the channelling techniques may present a risk to the natural environment. The success of park management plans is contingent upon setting up agreements, at both the local and national levels, between the public and private actors involved in tourism development. </jats:p>"

The new evacuation planning methodology is subsequently applied to a fixed facility incident scenario to demonstrate its applicability to present practice.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of “shared streets” involves an area in which the street is shared by pedestrians and vehicles. The entire shared street area is paved, and no vertical elevation difference exists between the walking areas and the parking area and the “travel lane.” The concept of travel lane is developed in this paper, and it refers to that part of the shared street that is specifically intended for motorists to travel. The travel lane is often distinguished by blocks with different colors. Because of the narrow lane width, it is possible for only one vehicle to pass through a straight section; two vehicles can meet only in the diagonal section. The angle of the diagonal section and the length and width of the straight section are primary parameters that strongly affect the travel speed along a shared street. Some general planning considerations are discussed, such as creating a discontinuous alignment by inserting a diagonal section between two consecutive tangent sections. Unidirectional or alternating diagonals are discussed, and three general forms of diagonal sections are presented. Safety considerations are also discussed, along with the need to provide sufficient parking space for visitors and residents. It is shown that the geometry determines the path of vehicles that results in a possible safe speed for a given design. Specific design criteria are presented for the recommended length of a tangent section and the recommended minimum width ranges, depending on the length of street. The parameters determining the geometric characteristics of the diagonal section, the angle of turn, the offset between the centerlines of the two adjacent tangent sections, and the width of the road along the tangent and within the diagonal section are also presented and evaluated. It is concluded that shared streets provide an excellent, attractive accessibility solution for residential neighborhoods with low volume of residential traffic resulting from a low density of residential dwellings. If planned properly, a balanced design is achieved, and the reduced speed results in improved safety and enhanced environmental qualities. </jats:p>",

This paper comments on some of the findings from the one project in this series that focuses on the dynamics of partnerships formed to carry out the planning, design, and implementation of multimodal and intermodal projects. An intensive industry scan has been completed, resulting in an interactive data base of approximately 60 multimodal projects throughout the country. From these 60 candidate projects, 12 were selected for more intensive study through a case study approach. The results of the case studies revealed a number of common, underlying themes. Included among those themes is the finding that local governments and private sector partners must be included in earlier stages of multimodal transportation planning than is currently being practiced. One of the key hypotheses tested with the data available on these partnerships was the impact of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) as a catalyst to stimulate multimodal projects and to improve the multimodal planning process. In this regard, one finding of this study is that before the 1990s, it appears that a major emphasis of partnership formation was simply to secure funding from a variety of sources for such projects. Since ISTEA was passed, however, objectives more frequently cited by partners relate to meeting societal values and traveler needs. </jats:p>",

As a means of demonstrating the validity of the suggested decision support approach, a prototype decision support system was developed to assist with the preliminary planning of MSW management systems. This planning tool combines knowledge-based system components with spreadsheet, optimization and stimulation models to assist with: waste forecasting; technology evaluation; recycling and composting programme design; facility sizing; location and investment timing; waste allocation; and MSW management system analysis using stimulation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the postwar period as a whole homeownership in Britain has been generally considered to be a desirable form of tenure. For many observers the present, since 1989, downturn in the market—characterised by high levels of arrears, stagnant or falling prices, negative equity, and so on—is a temporary blip from which sooner or later the enthusiasm for owning will recover. In the first part of this paper we analyse the British Social Attitudes Surveys for 1989 and 1991 in order to identify which groups in the population have most reduced their support for owning. The main conclusions are that the largest reduction has been amongst those groups who were already most marginal to the tenure and can be related to experiences in and expectations of the future of the economy as well as to specific, rather than general, characteristics of the tenure. In the second part of the paper we suggest that the basis of these attitudinal changes is to be found in the changing nature of work in Britain with there being a contradiction between the long-term commitment of ownership as it is currently organised and the insecurities of the labour market. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An alternate approach for truck transportation planning at the state level is presented using a case study application in the State of Iowa. The method was based on some freight modeling concepts and available freight data sets. However, the model takes advantage of two concepts: unconstrained highway capacities and the decomposition of commodities, resulting in manageable data and modeling requirements. Identification of significant economic sectors, selection of appropriate productivity measures, estimation of truck freight volumes for each sector individually, and estimation of routing of truck traffic on major highway routes are major elements of the planning method. The case study used two industrial sectors—food and kindred products, and machinery products—which accounted for the largest portion of state employment in nonservice sectors and the largest truck traffic generated in the state. A simplistic transportation network was used to demonstrate the modeling procedure. The analysis uses county-level employment and population to estimate zonal freight tonnage. The truck share of generated freight was estimated as the total freight generated less the freight tonnage shipped by rail. A gravity model was used to distribute the truck tonnage among origin-destination pairs, using travel time as the impedance on highway links. Estimated truck flows were converted to vehicle trips on least time highway routes using typical vehicle equivalent weights. </jats:p>",

In a past study, several algorithms based on exploratory procedures have been proposed; however, they do not generate practical paths that take into account aircraft inertia. This paper proposes a new algorithm to generate a flight path taking account of the aircraft's inertia; this algorithm does not generate the flight path directly, but determines the aircraft's steering acceleration at every point along the way and then generates the flight path based on the steering acceleration. This algorithm extracts feature parameters representing a relation between the aircraft and the terrain, determines steering acceleration by fuzzy reasoning using the feature parameters, and updates state variables of the aircraft. Furthermore, this paper also proposes a learning algorithm to design the membership values in the fuzzy reasoning from reference flights since it is difficult to optimize them by trial and error. The flight‐path planning by the proposed algorithm is compared with that based on the exploratory procedure. The learning algorithm of the membership values is validated through computer simulations.</jats:p>",

This task involves, first, fitting a process-based HIV model to AIDS incidence series for both Ireland and the United Kingdom to estimate national variations in the force of infection between the major risk populations. Second, these results are used to calibrate extended models which employ time-dependent parameters to imitate the effects of changed behaviours and other preventative actions. Third, the impacts of such interventions on the size and duration of the epidemic are illustrated by altering the values of the epidemiological or behavioural parameters at some time during the simulation interval. These results are then presented as control charts which record both the magnitude of the preventative action (such as a reduction in the number of sexual or needle-sharing partners) and the timing of its implementation. Last, in the discussion the implications of these findings for the development of health policy for HIV/AIDS in Ireland are considered. In particular, a comparison of the control charts suggests that, if it has not already taken place, the need for stringent interventions amongst intravenous drug users would appear to be imminent, whereas the position for gay men is less critical. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographic information systems (GISs) are becoming more widely used in transportation planning agencies, especially among metropolitan transportation organizations. The extension of GIS into transportation (GIS-T) is driven largely by the requirements of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA), the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and legislation by states that mandate the development of transportation programs to reduce traffic impacts. Traditionally, transportation modeling of traffic impacts, calculation of vehicle emissions, and consideration of wider transportation planning effects, including transit, have employed different modeling techniques, often in different agencies or in separate sections within an agency. The results from these modeling and planning exercises have more often than not been displayed on different map bases, using different graphic programs to represent the data. The requirements of federal and state programs are encouraging modelers and planners to consider more consistent methods of data integration and display, hence the growing interest in GIS-T. The role of GIS-T in regional transportation planning is evaluated, including data integration issues, the configuration of transportation networks for use with GIS, and the linkage of transportation models to GIS. </jats:p>",

The study indicated a fair degree of similarity in the attitudes, beliefs, knowledge levels and practices of men and women regarding fertility and family planning. Where they differed (e.g. on expected or ideal number of children, the desire for more children at parity 7 or above), men tended to be more pronatalist than women.

This approach is appropriate for project-specific planning, but it presents only a snapshot of existing conditions because environmental data are changing constantly. The integration of environmental considerations into long-range plans requires a much broader focus. It must allow dynamic systems to change without affecting the plan's validity. A case study is presented of the Oklahoma statewide intermodal transportation plan, which uses recent geographic theory to integrate planning and human activity at varying scales. This theoretical framework is based on ecological and societal units of interaction called bioregions or place-systems. The environmental baseline and analysis for Oklahoma begin with the identification of place-systems in the state: areas of biophysical and cultural similarity and context. The delimitation of such regional place-systems is sufficiently generalized and flexible to accommodate many data types and sources, yet rigid enough to be useful for planning. Both quantitative data and descriptive information are included in an analytical framework suitable to relational data bases and geographic information systems applications. These are used to create a series of map and data overlays to project potential environmental impacts and constraints, as well as opportunities for developing future transportation projects. The methods used to delineate regional place-systems in Oklahoma and their subsequent use in environmental analyses and planning are described. </jats:p>",

Environmental designers are interested in applying research-based models to study the effects of specific transportation design treatments on the built and natural landscape. The development of a perception-based visual quality predictive equation is investigated for application in both naturalistic and designed landscapes for transportation planning and design projects. The prediction model contained total area of noospheric features and total area of motorized vehicles; presence of humans, wildlife, utility structures, and foreground flowers; total area of distant nonvegetation landscape features such as mountains and buttes; perimeter of intermediate nonvegetation; total area of foreground vegetation; and openness, mystery, and environmental quality indexes (p &lt; 0.0001 for the overall regression, p ≤ 0.05 for each regressor using Type II sums of squares, and multiple. R-square of 0.67). Other variables such as motorized boats, nonflowering foreground herbaceous plants, a greenness index, fire, total area of exposed foreground substrate, smoke, water, smoothness, and the Shafer index were not significant regressors. By using a graph plotting the 95 percent confidence limits for the equation, an investigator can predict the statistical differences between a pair of images at a 90 percent confidence level. </jats:p>",

The tool will include a system-level component to develop a prioritized list of projects by mode for a county and a project-level component to perform more detailed evaluations of roadway project alternatives and multimodal enhancements. The MMTPT will operate in a computerized hybrid system that uses expert system and conventional algorithmic programming techniques.

This situation has led the Mexican Transport Institute (MTI) to develop strategies for optimizing the allocation of resources among the various necessities of the system. The use of the economic value of the freight flows for identifying and planning improvement projects to be undertaken for a specified time period on basic surface transportation networks (roads and railways) is proposed. This parameter can also be used for assessing the relative importance of the components of such networks. The methodology suggested for assessing the economic value of the freight flows is presented. The basis of the use of the criterion proposed including its greater convenience than other commonly used criteria (of the benefit/cost type) is described. Based on the suggested criterion, several considerations are raised for the Mexican road and railroad networks. The belief of some policy makers that freight is of paramount importance for planning improvements to the transportation systems is applied and facilitated by the applications described. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> How a California metropolitan planning organization (MPO) overcame data limitations and developed innovative solutions to regional agricultural freight transportation problems is described. Data from government agencies and trade groups on annual fruit and vegetable production, fish landings, and wine production were combined with survey data on truck volumes and loading practices to develop novel approaches for estimating truck and rail trips. Similar methods were used to project future freight volumes by using key population, income, and agricultural productivity indexes to project agricultural production volumes and employment forecasts in the processed food industries and thereby forecast freight volumes in their industries. To identify problems and deficiencies in the system, new performance indicators such as number of internal truck trips per outbound line-haul trip, wait time per pickup, comparisons of hourly inbound and outbound line-haul truck trip distributions, and truck trips as a percent of total traffic volume on roadways with poor level of service were used. It was concluded that poor logistics planning, lack of coordinated information and communications about load availability, poor load consolidation practices, and inadequate truck parking and driver waiting facilities were among the biggest problems facing the region. A proposed freight logistics center, which may be developed as a public-private partnership, is now under consideration. The methods and programs developed in this study may have applications in other small to medium-sized MPOs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Across the country a network of multiuse trails is evolving from abandoned rail corridors. This phenomenon creates a new set of demands on public highway and transportation agencies. These demands are most evident at public highway crossings of rail-trail projects. These demands raise new policy, planning, and engineering issues. The most difficult and controversial of the engineering issues is whether to retain or remove grade-separating rail structures. The issue often pits trail advocates against public highway and transportation engineers in a debate over whether safety is enhanced or degraded by the removal of the structure. Decisions on structures rely on a variety of factors, including the physical condition of the structure; the alignment, clearance, and sightlines at the crossing; the quality of trail plans; and the magnitude and division of responsibility for current and future costs. To effectively resolve trail and highway crossing issues, it is important to recognize that, in matters related to the crossings, the highway or transportation agency's customer base includes trail users as well as motor vehicle drivers and passengers. Decisions on crossing issues should evolve from a balanced appraisal of the sometimes differing safety and operating needs of trail as well as highway users. The process of reaching balanced, multimodal design decisions begins with better public planning before rail line abandonment. The state highway or transportation agency can enhance its decision making through better communication, coordination, and encouragement of trail planning with sister state agencies, local government(s), regional planning agencies, and trail development organizations. </jats:p>",

The aim of this study is to illustrate data, presented at the GISMa meeting held in April 1994, concerning the characteristics of each programme and some early indicators of effectiveness. To assess these parameters (concerning compliance level, recall rate, benign/malignant biopsy ratio, detection rate, stage distribution, nodal involvement and number of cancers with a diameter under 1 cm, rate of cancer, etc.), ‘acceptable’ and ‘desirable’ standards obtained from Italian and North-European cancer screening experiences have been adopted. Most programmes have shown an acceptable standard for most of the indicators, and many of them have attained desirable levels. In most screening programmes the occurrence of interval cancers has not yet been measured, but all centres have (or are working to set up) a systematic active procedure to collect the data. The results indicate that common guidelines can be adopted, even when working in very heterogeneous contexts, and that it is possible to achieve a very high effectiveness and efficacy level. As regards quality control and cost/benefit issues, the goal of extending centralised, population-based screening programmes to other Italian regions becomes a priority. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> FHWA and FTA have proposed a combined process for integrating transportation and environmental planning. A major feature of the process is conducting corridor and subarea studies to reach a decision on design concept and scope in planning before a project enters a preliminary engineering phase. These corridor and subarea studies facilitate decisions by metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and refinement of their long-range plans, analyses of alternatives, and analyses of demand reduction and operations required of congestion management systems. As developed to date, the combined process is seen primarily as applying to major investment studies. As part of its congestion management system, Florida (the Department of Transportation, MPOs, and others) addressed corridor and subarea studies, major investment studies, and the proposed combined process. Furthermore, the Florida congestion management system task team found that the combined process may have many beneficial aspects, addressed state and MPO institutional roles in reaching decisions on design concept and scope, and is evaluating the extension of the combined process to arterial investments and interchange justification analyses. By extending the process to these other projects and reaching a decision on design concept and scope in planning, the needs and alternatives analyses required by the National Environmental Policy Act could be obtained earlier, possibly improving and shortening the decision-making process. Overviews of the combined process and Florida actions that may lead to extending the process beyond major investment studies are presented. Florida actions include supporting pilot arterial investment studies to be coordinated by MPOs with funding provided by the state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The 1994 update of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) includes a planning procedure to estimate the capacity condition of a signalized intersection (Xcm). The planning method results can also be extended to a planning application of the more data-intensive HCM operational procedure to estimate intersection critical flow-to-capacity ratio (Xc) and level of service with only planning-level data. Both the planning procedure and the planning application of the operational procedure involve default adjustment factors and synthesized traffic signal timing (called the “default signal timing”). Data from 166 Missouri intersections were used to determine how well the planning approaches predict operational analysis results. In general, the default signal timings had shorter cycle lengths than the timing plans used at pretimed signals. The shorter cycle lengths led to slightly higher flow-to-capacity ratios, since a higher proportion of each cycle was devoted to lost time. The default signal timings also had more equal flow-to-capacity ratios within critical lane groups. The shorter cycle lengths and more equal flow-to-capacity ratios led to a predicted level of service that was the same or better than that calculated for actual conditions. For the subject intersections, locally calibrated default adjustment factors yielded better predictions of flow-to-capacity ratios and level of service than the HCM defaults. The planning value for Xcm was often less than the actual Xc for operational analysis of actual conditions. This was to be expected since Xcm is based on the maximum allowable cycle length. The HCM planning procedure is expected to receive wide use in a variety of planning and design applications. Calibration of appropriate local default values should improve the accuracy of the planning procedure results. </jats:p>",

Today's transportation officials face a complex task. Success in transportation planning is measured not just in terms of connectivity and operational efficiency, but in the ability to respond to a host of complicated concerns; the ability to achieve a variety of operational, managerial, and financial objectives; and in proficiency in involving the public in the entire transportation planning process. The Colorado Department of Transportation, in cooperation with the Graduate School of Business Administration at the University of Colorado at Denver, conducted a three-phase investigation on the development of customer focus in the statewide transportation planning process. From this systematic methodology, the research team established a series of recommendations for developing a customer focus in the statewide transportation planning process. These recommendations were developed in several areas including broadening the mission and process; strengthening public involvement in project orientation; improving organization flexibility; and implementing marketing orientation, market research process, and techniques and approaches for dealing with high priority public involvement issues. </jats:p>",

A cohort of 1537 seronegative women attending a family planning clinic in Nairobi, Kenya was enrolled and followed for up to 12 months per woman. HIV testing was done quarterly. A nested case-control analysis was done with seroconverting women (cases) and 3 matched controls per case, who had detailed interviews and received physical examinations and STD tests. The prevalence of HIV at enrolment was 6.1%; seropositive women were excluded from further analysis. The 12-month life-table cumulative incidence of HIV was 2.1 per 100 women (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-3.2). In the nested case-control analysis (17 cases and 51 controls), the crude odds ratio of HIV infection comparing oral contraceptive (OC) users with other women was 3.5 (95% CI 0.8- 21.5), which persisted after control for single confounders at a time. The putative association between OC use and HIV infection is critical to public health policy, yet no study has been conducted specifically to measure it, yielding weak and conflicting evidence. We intend to conduct a larger study with a similar design as the current pilot study, which confirmed the feasibility or a more definitive project. </jats:p>",

The development of a new approach to planning and architecture in mountain areas Jean-François Lyon-Caen Resume : C'est à partir de l'examen des débats soulevés par les choix techniques nécessaires à la conception de la station de Courchevel 1850 - dans les domaines de l'urbanisme et de l'architecture - qu'apparaît la recherche d'une pensée moderne pour l'aménagement des espaces touristiques d'altitude. Cette pensée est décrite dans cet article, en mettant en parallèle d'une part les réflexions produites pour le premier projet d'aménagement élaboré par la mission du Secrétariat d'Etat aux Sports en 1942 et d'autre part les actions engagées sur le terrain pour la mise en œuvre effective de la station à partir de 1946, sous la conduite de Laurent Chappis urbaniste, Denys Pradelle architecte, et de l'équipe technique des Ponts et Chaussées placée sous la responsabilité de Maurice Michaud ingénieur des Ponts et Chaussées. Par la comparaison entre les premières idées émises lors d'études préalables et les choix retenus pour les réalisations de ce qui deviendra la première station internationale de sports d'hiver française d'une part, et en analysant certains aspects techniques liés à la mise en œuvre de la station d'autre part, on montrera comment cette expérience révèle l'invention d'une pensée particulière sur l'espace montagnard, mais aussi les conditions effectives de son expérimentation. </jats:p>"
