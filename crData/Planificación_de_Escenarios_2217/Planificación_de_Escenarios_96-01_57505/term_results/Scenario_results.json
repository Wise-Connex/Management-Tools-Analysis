We discuss a few new techniques of the investigation of dark matter in the Universe. We discuss the peculiar periodic dependence of the initial spectrum of the baryonic matter distribution on wavelength at the moment of recombination (Sakharov oscillations). Sakharov oscillations should manifest themselves by the specific anomalies in the angular correlation function of the microwave background anisotropy on scales 10′ – 2°, practically in any cosmological model. We discuss special methods for filtering of this effect in the observational data.</jats:p>"

This technique has been used to study the effect of moisture on the interfacial strength and transverse cracking behavior of unaged composite specimens (≈ 1.1% of matrix weight is moisture) compared to composite specimens saturated by soaking in seawater (≈ 2.2% of matrix weight is moisture). Specimens experienced both initiation controlled failure and propagation controlled failure. The type of failure did not appear to depend upon the moisture content; rather it depended upon the microstructure of the composite. Analysis has also been performed, aiding in the interpretation of the experimental results. The mathematical models show that the interfacial residual stresses in the radial direction due to thermal cooldown are compressive in a homogeneous microstructure; while in an inhomogeneous microstructure, the stresses are tensile at the boundary of the inhomogeneity. In both cases the presence of moisture relaxes the stresses.</jats:p>",

The model has been used to predict the effects of a number of scenarios for improvement of water quality. In this paper an analysis of the input uncertainty and the effect upon the resulting uncertainty in the output is presented. Both the influence of parameter uncertainty and the uncertainty in the other input variables as: boundary conditions, loading from point and non-point sources, and initial conditions, has been studied. From reported ranges in literature an estimate of the parameter uncertainty has been made. The uncertainty within the other input variables has been assessed from available data. Through Monte Carlo simulation, using Latin Hypercube sampling the resulting uncertainty in the model predictions has been determined. From the uncertainty analysis it appeared that it was not possible to discriminate between the predicted impacts of some of the scenarios. Both the uncertainty in the parameters and in the loading of the system contributed to the overall model uncertainty, although their relative contribution differed going from south to north in the system.</jats:p>",

From 21-cm HI line data and BVRI CCD-images of this galaxy we find (cf. Verdes-Montenegro et al. 1995) : 1) a nuclear ring strong in Hα, 2) an inner ring seen clearly in a B - I colour map, and 3) an outer ring, with blue colours and strong HI-emission. After deprojection the disk has a mean ellipticity of 0.04 ± 0.01, while the position angle of the deprojected galaxy changes suddenly at 65″ radius, where the minor axis becomes major axis. Thus a very mild oval distortion could exist, with the outer ring perpendicular to the oval. Merrifield and Kuijken (1994) find from the stellar kinematics that about 20 – 30 % of the stars are in retrograde orbits.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We present numerical calculations that simulate the evolution of a low mass (1M<jats:sub>⊙</jats:sub>) star transfering mass to a compact object (Muslimov &amp; Sarna 1993; Ergma &amp; Sarna 1996). Mass transfer starts when the secondary turns off the main sequence (having a small helium core). We have calculated 14 evolutionary sequences with the assumption of non-conservative or conservative evolution. We can conclude that near the bifurcation point the evolution is very sensitive to: (i) the assumption of conservative or non-conservative evolution, (ii) the structure of the mass losing star. Small changes in the initial period when the secondary fills its Roche lobe will lead to large changes in the final period and final mass of the remnant. Presently there are 40 known low-mass binary pulsars (LMBP). The evolutionary scenario for the wider systems (10 &lt; <jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>orb</jats:sub>(d) &lt; 1000) is connected with that of wide low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB) in which the donor star will fill its Roche lobe after helium core formation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Jovian S‐bursts are intense impulsive decameter radio spikes drifting in frequency in tens of milliseconds over several hundreds of kHz up to a few MHz. Their generation scenario has been much debated for 30 years. The automated analysis of an extensive set of digital radio observations at very high temporal and spectral resolutions is presented here. It strongly suggests that S‐bursts are the cyclotron‐maser emission of electron populations with ∼5 keV energy, accelerated near Io and then in quasi‐adiabatic motion along magnetic field lines connecting the Io torus to Jupiter's auroral regions. This scenario is consistent with Voyager observations of Alfvèn waves near Io's wake and with recent infrared observations of the Io flux tube footprint. The total energy, velocity and pitch angle of the radiating electrons, and the extent of the bursts radiosources are deduced from the radio measurements, which appear as a promising remote sensing tool for the Jovian magnetosphere, and possibly that of other “radio” planets.</jats:p>",

The qualitative difference of the past from the present has intrigued many a methodologically-concerned social scientist such as Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Karl Polanyi. As a matter of fact, the reservation that the categories by way of which we approach the analysis of the modern world are by no means equally applicable to the study of pre-modern historical formations is as old as the modern social sciences. If the past is a foreign country the boundaries of which are well defined and the territory of which has been mapped for good, the future remains as the <jats:italic>terra incognita</jats:italic> waiting for its Columbus, the courageous discoverer. Moreover, because the relevant geography of the future is not a given but only in the making, the task of the social scientist becomes squarely difficult as s/he does not face before her/him a well defined terrain. It is for this reason that, on the whole, social scientists have shied away from exploring the future in a systematic way until recently.</jats:p>"

The transportation system hierarchy prevailing in a large metropolitan area in a developing country is examined using a scenario-building model. The model is bidimensional with two parameters: distance traveled and the value of time of persons using the transportation system. It is applied to metropolitan Madras (population 6 million) in India. Two scenarios are developed: first, using the perceived costs of various modes available in Madras, and second, using costs reflecting the changes that could arise as a result of policy changes. Results suggest that policy needs to be oriented toward promoting the use of non-motorized modes, motorized two-wheelers, and public transit instead of emulating that of developed countries. This model and its results will be useful to decision makers in examining scenarios of their choice. </jats:p>",
