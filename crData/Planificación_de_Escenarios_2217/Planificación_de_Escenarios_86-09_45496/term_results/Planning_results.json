      "abstract": "<jats:p> Postmodernism seems able to embrace any discourse on style, architecture, literature, with equal facility. Yet its erratic and chameleon-like form renders it susceptible to quick dismissal. In this essay, I attempt a tolerant assessment of the meaning of postmodernism as it applies to planning. The notions of postmodernism as style, as method, and as epoch are examined. The history of planning from 1945 to 1985 is deconstructed, and reveals the pastiche of ‘postmodern planning’. A metalanguage for discourse on a reconstructed planning theory suggests three evaluative dimensions: function–context; commodification–noncommodification; and penetration–participation. </jats:p>",

In addition options for the building ofa retail planning DSS are explored. Emphasis is laid on the recognizability of information needs related to the planning process and the possibility to develop a consistent theory on the dynamic operating of the retailing system. Considerations regarding these issues are transferred into substantive as well as organizational require ments to a retail planning DSS. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, the conditions necessary for solving these problems in Yugoslavia are not very favourable when considering either the financial or the technological aspect. Taking into account the importance of the sea water quality along the coast for the economic development of these resorts as well as the difficulties arising when solving this problem, our objective was to find an optimal solution. This paper presents some alternatives for solving this problem, as well as the method used for the selection of the optimal solution. A ranking procedure is used to develop the alternative solutions and to describe their application. The solution used most frequently for the disposal of waste water i.e. the “Treatment plant-submarine discharge ”, has here been analyzed. The paper also presents the ranking of the alternative solutions and the selection of the optimal one according to the current practices in Dalmatia.</jats:p>",

From the technology portfolio strategies for the introduction of new technologies can be derived.

Unlike traditional categorical grant programs predicated on an externality or some other efficiency-based rationale, revenue sharing addressed issues of vertical and horizontal fiscal imbalances as well as political concerns about the growing influence of the federal bureaucracy in the fiscal affairs of states and localities. Scheduled to terminate at the end of fiscal year 1986, revenue sharing nevertheless remains a viable concept in reckoning the makeup of a well-ordered intergovernmental grant system. It is with an eye toward future deliberations about such a program that this paper is written. The findings from six years of research at the Brookings Institution are drawn upon, and a review is given of the lessons learned about the role of such a program and how the design of any future revenue sharing program might be enhanced, with specific emphasis on greater equity and more effective integration of federal and state roles in addressing the causes and consequences of local-area fiscal disparities. </jats:p>",

The point of emphasis is that analysis of policy effects requires a sufficiently long observation period to be able to discern the continuities and discontinuities from previous policy or lack of a policy.

Privatization and institutional fragmentation, facilitated in Los Angeles by passage of a transit sales tax in 1980, are the strategies of choice for outlying business centers, just as region-wide agencies and radial rail rapid transit systems have been downtown initiatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is addressed to the problem of developing realistic-looking patterns of land use and activity from predictions generated by conventional urban models. The method developed is based on a geometric model of irregularity involving hierarchical cascading and recursion, whose rationale lies in the emergent field of fractal geometry. First the idea of fractals—shapes with fractional dimension—is introduced and then it is shown how two-dimensional patterns whose dimensions are consistent with a large city such as London can be simulated at different levels of detail or recursion. It is then argued that the hierarchical structure of cities should be exploited as a basis for such simulation, and it is argued that discrete choice models of individual spatial behaviour have excellent properties which enable their embedding into such simulations. </jats:p><jats:p> The standard multinomial logit model is presented and then applied to house-type data in Greater London. A variety of models are estimated, house-type choice being related to age and distance from the centre of the city, and the spatial biases in these predictions are then mapped using prediction success statistics. These models are then used at the base level of a fractal simulation of house type and location in London. Random and deterministic model simulations are developed, and an unusual and possibly innovative feature of these simulations involves the way the inputs and outputs, data and predictions, are simultaneously displayed on the graphics device used. Conclusions for further research, particularly in spatial hierarchical modelling, are then sketched. </jats:p>",

The research into these two issues uses a simulation study that describes the relevant production and information characteristics. Four production characteristic variables are investigated: (1) average learning rate, (2) run-time variance, (3) learning rate mix, and (4) run-time distribution. A fifth variable, level of data aggregation, is an information characteristic and is also investigated. </jats:p><jats:p> The results of this study indicate that there are significant increases possible in the accuracy of medium-term capacity projections from the incorporation of learning curve analysis in firms with high rates of learning or with low noise levels in their data. However, when a company has either low to moderate rates of learning or moderate noise, a standard analysis, which uses the sample mean of the last planning horizon's data, provides projections approximately as accurate as a learning curve estimate. </jats:p>",

A computerized simulation was built to examine several questions. Results indicate that forecasting error, especially the mean error, does impact MRP system inventory costs and shortages; the greater the forecast error the greater the shortages. An exception to this general relationship was that a slight forecast BIAS may improve MRP system performance, which was the case for systems studied herein. Lot-sizing rules and product structure (bill of material structure) were also found to impact total MRP system inventory costs and shortages. The more complicated the MRP structure, the greater the differentiation among lot-sizing rules and the greater the cost impact of forecast errors. A good lot-sizing rule appears to be the period order quantity rule. However, as the forecast error level gets higher, it becomes difficult to select the better lot-sizing rule.

In an examination of new data for voluntary organizations in the Los Angeles metropolitan region, an extensively differentiated sector of significant size is found that is often highly reliant on public funding, but which is becoming increasingly entrepreneurial and has begun to shift more of the service cost burden onto clients as a consequence of reductions in funding support. These characteristics have important implications for the region and possibly for other urban areas in the USA, one of which is that this new reliance on voluntary services could lead to the existence of a shadow state: a new institutional form that fulfills many of the functions of government but also makes many public policy decisions in the absence of governmental preemption. </jats:p>",

The es sence of our approach lies in a heuristic but natural decom position of TPP into two subproblems: (1) planning a path to avoid collision with static obstacles and (2) planning the velocity along the path to avoid collision with moving obsta cles. We call thefirst subproblem the path planning problem (PPP) and the second the velocity planning problem (VPP). Thus, our decomposition is summarized by the equation TPP =&gt; PPP + VPP. The symbol =&gt; indicates that the de composition holds under certain assumptions, e.g., when obstacles are moving independently of ( i.e., not tracking ) the robot. Furthermore, we pose the VPP in path-time space, where time is explicitly represented as an extra dimension, and reduce it to a graph search in this space. In fact, VPP is transformed to a two-dimensional PPP in path-time space with some additional constraints. Algorithms are then pre sented to solve the VPP with different optimality criteria: minimum length in path-time space, and minimum time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The severity of the recession in Britain in the late 1970s and 1980s has stimulated considerable interest in the analysis of the spatial and sectoral incidence of redundancy. In this paper two separate approaches to this topic are identified. In the labour-market – manpower analysis approach detailed empirical case studies were used to assess the local labour-market impact of specific major redundancies. More recently, aggregate official data have been used to investigate the sectoral and spatial incidence of recession in Great Britain. This paper extends this second approach by analysing, for the first time, some aspects of the incidence of redundancy in Northern Ireland. It is argued that trends in the level and incidence of redundancy are strongly affected by sectoral influences, and the analysis is concentrated in particular on the examination of redundancies in the regional shipbuilding industry between 1972 and 1983. It is concluded that redundancies in this sector differ from those elsewhere in the regional economy in terms of both nature and timing: shipbuilding redundancies affected predominantly older and male workers and peaked two or three years later than redundancies in other sectors. This pattern can be related to changes in the external market conditions facing the industry in the late 1970s, and to the specific corporate response of Harland and Wolff plc to these in the 1980s. </jats:p>",

At the University of Central Florida cautious optimism has led to a feasibility study of these considerations in anticipation of a Ph.D. offering in Human Factors. Feasibility, Planning, and Implementation stages required for Ph.D. authorization in Human Factors will be presented. In particular, emphasis will center on the primary issues of need for such a program balanced against available resources. The Central Florida area is fortunate to have a growing base of government and industrial concerns interested in Human Factors research. In addition, these same concerns have resources in terms of people, equipment, and laboratory space that they are willing to share in a cooperative effort in exchange for trained professionals.

This change will permit man to dedicate more of his time in space to tasks that require his unique intellectual, manipulative, and perceptual abilities. However, if history is any indication, man cannot be completely removed from servicing duties because unanticipated servicing operations occasionally will require his direct intervention and control through either extra-vehicular activities (EVA) or teleoperations. As a result, certain minimum user-system interface capabilites must be maintained, no matter how sophisticated future technology becomes. This paper discusses research related to some of the basic human factors problems that will probably always have an impact on space-based teleoperated servicing operations. The implicit warning is that future advanced systems must implement solutions to these problems if humans are to provide effective backup support. Furthermore, the authors believe that there are several critical gaps in our present knowledge of teleoperator human factors that must be closed before such backup operations can be effective. There is a danger that system developers may become so enamored of advanced teleoperator technology that they may fail to provide an adequate user/system interface for backup operations. Human factors issues discussed include: vision systems, control devices and communication time delays. Each issues section concludes with a list of suggested research topics that address gaps in our present knowledge about teleoperator human factors. </jats:p>",

There is now a basic competence in many aspects of modelling which could not have been envisaged in the early days.

The original Portbury problem and its associated data sets provide an excellent opportunity to examine the new set of models in a real public-planning context.

But in the 1970s and 1980s this model of the organization of production seems to be losing importance in industrial countries. Standardized mass production was increasingly competed for by newly industrializing countries, and flexible production technology lowered the importance of scale economies. These changing conditions forced firms to reorganize their production and decision structures. Both an increasing centralization of enterprises (based on the new automation and information technologies— ‘neo-Fordism’) and a decentralization of production (towards small-scale firms) seem possible. It is to be expected that these changes are related to changes in the spatial division of labor and in the organizational characteristics of plants. </jats:p><jats:p> An empirical analysis of Austria revealed marked changes in the organizational status of plants and in the spatial pattern of control in the period from 1973 to 1981. Externally controlled employment decreased in those areas which had the highest shares in 1973, namely, the old industrial areas and the peripheral rural areas. Major employment increases of externally controlled plants on the other hand occured in areas with a low degree of external control in 1973, namely, the agglomerations and tourist areas. Concerning the spatial pattern of control, there was a clear tendency to decentralization due mainly to a decline in the importance of Vienna as a headquarters location. </jats:p>",

The division of regional industrial policy powers between the European Community, the national government, and regional and local organisations has been the subject of little debate in Britain. The 1984 reforms are likely to weaken the role of the national government relative to the other participants. The relative position of the national government has been slowly weakening since the early 1970s. In addition, changes in regional policy fashions in favour of assisting service industries, innovation, and small firms are likely eventually to favour further decentralisation of regional industrial policy powers. </jats:p>",

In this paper the emergence of this vertically disintegrated industry is traced and its impact on the location of the motion picture industry is analyzed. Vertical disintegration has led to a reagglomeration of motion picture employment and establishments in Los Angeles, despite the dispersal of film shooting throughout the world. The processes that are shaping the present-day organization of motion pictures can be observed across a range of industries. An examination of these processes in motion pictures suggests that their association with reagglomeration in urban centers could have an important impact on patterns of urbanization. </jats:p>",
