      "abstract": "<jats:p> More traditional approaches to accident reporting and analysis have received much critisism in recent years. The dispute apparently lies in their inability to facilitate intervention development due to a primary non-ergonomic orientation as well as limited suitability as an information management system. Laughery, Petree, Schmidt, Schwartz, Walsh and Imig (1983) in an effort to address these issues adopted the human factors based scenario and analytic technique developed by Drury and Brill (1983) and devised a accident coding and analysis system. In an study of 1,694 operator cases taken over a three year period at a petrochemical facility in the Houston, TX area, five separate accident patterns accounting for 80% of all the reported cases were found. The scenarios are as follows: </jats:p><jats:p> 1) muscular/skeletal strain in system operation. 2) chemical release due to system breakdown. 3) obstruction in the workspace. 4) unsolicited interface movement during system operation. 5) poor footing in the workspace. </jats:p><jats:p> A closer analysis of each scenario revealed apparent design flaws and managerial policy problems, that if corrected would reduce incident numbers significantly. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Currently, government statistics inficate that sanitation workers suffer a high number of job related injuries/illnesses each year. Considering the inability to control hazard exposure in this job in terms of type, severity and duration, this is not too surprising. What is alarming is that the rates have remained stable, indicating that nothing has been done to curtai their numbers. One reason for the difficulty seems to stem from a lack of ergonomie information being yielded by many accident reporting/analysis systems. They ignore the time ordering and factors that led to an incident and focus only on demographic variables, thereby making it a static event. The present effort involved a scenario analysis (Drury &amp; Brill, 1983) of approximately 300 solid waste collector First Reports of Illness of Injury complied over a five year period in Galveston, TX. The accident cases were coded for computer entry and subsequent analysis using the Texas Research &amp; Analysis of Sanitation Hazards (TRASH) system, a devise similar to one developed by Laughery et al (1983) to discern common patterns of accidents. The analysis provided five unique accident scenarios, which account for approximately 80% of the cases. The scenarios were as follows: </jats:p><jats:p> 1) Poor ergonomie arrangement of the truck crib area led to body strain during loading, mounting and dismounting. 2) Containers failed, exposing collectors to the hazards of their contents. 3) Excessive container weight or awkward load shape led to body strain and unintended contact. 4) Poor footing led to slips, trips, and falls. 5) Lack of personal protective devices led to unwarranted hazard exposure. </jats:p><jats:p> Each scenario lent itself well to accident intervention strategy development in terms of equipment redesign and adaptation as well as managerial and public policy formation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The effective use of resources to evaluate defense systems is a matter of continuing interest to the operational test and evaluation (OT&amp;E) community. A three-phased methodology was developed to identify potential problem areas, and to focus evaluation efforts on those areas. Phase 1 identifies areas upon which to focus attention through OT&amp;E scenario analysis. Phase 2 determines the data required to evaluate problem areas. Phase 3 determines the procedures to be employed to collect the data. This approach provides OT&amp;E personnel with a systematic method of optimizing the allocation of test resources. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports the results of a scenario analysis of ingestion accidents involving children under five years of age. The variables of primary interest were the location of the child and the supervising adult, what each of them was doing before the accident, the nature and location of the substance, and how it was accessed and opened. Several frequent scenarios were identified. They indicate that most ingestion accidents happen in the course of normal events in the home rather than under unusual circumstances. Another interesting finding was that products with safety caps were involved in 57% of these cases. Results demonstrate the need for a modification of cap design and a public education program for parents regarding situations that lead to ingestion accidents. </jats:p>",
