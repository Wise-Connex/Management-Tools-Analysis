      "abstract": "<jats:p>We propose a dynamic structure of coupled dynamic molecular strings for supercooled small polar molecule liquids and accordingly we obtain the Hamiltonian of the rotational degrees of freedom of the system. From the Hamiltonian, the strongly correlated supercooled polar liquid state is renormalized to a normal superdipole liquid state. This scenario describes the following main features of the primary or α-relaxation dynamics in supercooled polar liquids: (1) the average relaxation time evolves from a high temperature Arrhenius to a low temperature non-Arrhenius or super-Arrhenius behavior; (2) the relaxation function crosses over from the high temperature exponential to low temperature nonexponential form; and (3) the temperature dependence of the relaxation strength shows non-Curie features. According to the present model, the crossover phenomena of the first two characteristics arise from the transition between the superdipole gas and the superdipole liquid. The model predictions are quantitatively compared with the experimental results of glycerol, a typical glass former.</jats:p>",

The system shows a bifurcation scenario similar to the classical period-doubling one, but which is influenced by so-called border collision phenomena and denoted as border collision period-doubling bifurcation scenario. This scenario is formed by a sequence of pairs of bifurcations, whereby each pair consists of a border collision bifurcation and a pitchfork bifurcation. The mechanism leading to this scenario and its characteristic properties, like symmetry-breaking and symmetry-recovering as well as emergence of coexisting attractors, are investigated. </jats:p>",

In this paper we present ground motion simulations for earthquake scenarios for the city of Basel and its vicinity. The numerical modeling combines the finite extent pseudodynamic and kinematic source models with complex local structure in a two‐step hybrid three‐dimensional (3‐D) finite difference (FD) method. The synthetic seismograms are accurate in the frequency band 0–2.2 Hz. The 3‐D FD is a linear explicit displacement formulation using an irregular rectangular grid including topography. The finite extent rupture model is adjacent to the free surface because the fault has been recognized through trenching on the Reinach fault. We test two source models reminiscent of past earthquakes (the 1999 Athens and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake) to represent <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub> ≈ 5.9 and <jats:italic>M</jats:italic><jats:sub><jats:italic>w</jats:italic></jats:sub> ≈ 6.5 events that occur approximately to the south of Basel. To compare the effect of the same wave field arriving at the site from other directions, we considered the same sources placed east and west of the city. The local structural model is determined from the area's recently established <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>S</jats:italic> wave velocity structure and includes topography. The selected earthquake scenarios show strong ground motion amplification with respect to a bedrock site, which is in contrast to previous 2‐D simulations for the same area. In particular, we found that the edge effects from the 3‐D structural model depend strongly on the position of the earthquake source within the modeling domain.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we consider the role that this phenomenon, known as behavioral confirmation, plays in shaping the social perceptions of perceivers, targets, and outside observers. As well, we address the value of laboratory research on behavioral confirmation for understanding the dynamics and outcomes of social interactions in naturally occurring settings. Building on these considerations, we then examine the role of behavioral confirmation phenomena in shaping intergroup relations, with particular reference to delineating conditions in which such phenomena serve to preserve these relations. Based on this analysis, we suggest that dyadic confirmation phenomena are likely to occur in naturally occurring settings and may contribute to the maintenance and perpetuation of social stereotypes and societal structures.</jats:p>",
