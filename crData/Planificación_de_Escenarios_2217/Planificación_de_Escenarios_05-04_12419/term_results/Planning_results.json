This is unproblematic for the research community but, as the numbers of users increase through initiatives resulting in data integration on an unprecedented scale, such as E-science and GRID, issues of information meaning and conceptualisation become more important. We explore these issues through the mapping of land cover and the variety of conceptions of land-cover features that may be held by actors in the creation, distribution, and use of the information. Current metadata do not report the wider meaning of the information categories in terms of the decisions that were made and by whom in specifying class conceptualisations. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a new approach to analyzing views using a fuzzy logic methodology, with the aim of assessing the amenity of views. It illustrates the process of constructing a system from data collection and fuzzy rules design, to inference and defuzzification procedures. With the verification of the prediction outcomes, it is shown that the evaluation model can successfully mimic a human's subjective preferences for scenic views. The methodologies and the underlying principles of the evaluation model are explained. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper gives a technique to extrapolate the anticipated accuracy of a prediction of land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) to any point in the future. The method calibrates a LUCC model with information from the past in order to simulate a map of the present, so that it can compute an objective measure of validation with empirical data. Then it uses that observed measurement of predictive accuracy to anticipate how accurately the model will predict a future landscape. The technique assumes that the accuracy of the model will decay to randomness as the model predicts farther into the future and estimates how fast the decay in accuracy will occur based on prior model performance. Results are presented graphically in terms of percentage of pixels classified correctly so that nonexperts can interpret the accuracy visually. The percentage correct is budgeted by three components: agreement due to chance, agreement due to the predicted quantity of each land category, and agreement due to the predicted location of each land category. The percentage error is budgeted by two components: disagreement due to the predicted location of each land category and disagreement due to the predicted quantity of each land category. Therefore, model users can see the sources of the accuracy and error of the model. The entire analysis is computable for multiple resolutions, so users can see how the results are sensitive to changes in scale. We illustrate the method with an application of the land-use change model Geomod to Central Massachusetts, where the predictive accuracy of the model decays to 90% over fourteen years and to near complete randomness over 200 years. </jats:p>",

We briefly review recent developments in methods for the automatic extraction of road centre line networks and propose a related algorithm aimed at encoding the geometry of road networks with line segments. Our algorithm is inspired by ‘axial lines’, which have been defined as lines of uninterrupted movement within urban streetscapes or buildings. We show that axial lines appear as ridges in isovist fields. These are formed from the maximum diametric lengths of the individual isovists, sometimes called viewsheds, which make up these fields. We present an image-processing technique for the identification of lines from ridges, discuss current strengths and weaknesses of the method, and show how it can be implemented easily and effectively. </jats:p>",

Such improvements typically consist of increased economic efficiency in the form of lower aggregate production costs and greater welfare in the form of higher levels of aggregate output. The improvements are made possible by the effective integration of otherwise individual economies. This paper employs the principle of comparative advantage as the foundation for illustrating potential improvements in the allocation of land uses under a regional approach to land-use planning. It uses a generalized assignment problem within a geographical information system (GIS) to describe the efficiency benefits of integrating land-use plans among several districts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents an urban land-use simulation model using cellular automata (CA). In the model urban growth is regarded as the result of a global process underpinned by local actions and land-use change as the joint action of three different effects: attribute, heterogeneity, and gravity. The attribute and heterogeneity effects are regarded as different aspects of a local driving force for change constituted by changing accessibility and other attributes resulting from the interaction of land use and transport at the neighborhood level. The gravity effect is a universal resistance to change as a result of inertia and agglomeration of compatible land uses in the vicinity. To ensure that local actions would lead to global behavior, a multipass, in addition to a single-pass, land-use-allocation algorithm is designed to mimic land-use changes. With metropolitan Melbourne in Australia as a case study, the performance of the model in replicating land-use changes is compared with that of an alternative model developed by using only a distance function. The results of the comparison show that the proposed CA model outperforms the alternative model with only a distance function, confirming the importance of incorporating local attributes in modeling land-use changes. </jats:p>",

The results were both encouraging and frustrating. Encouraging, in that planners are keen to involve children and young people in planning and there are a number of innovative and promising policies and projects. Frustrating, in that these initiatives are not representative of planning as a whole, where regulatory planning is still the prime concern and more socially oriented issues, such as those associated with children and young people, languish fairly low on the list of priorities for the vast majority of New Zealand local government planners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Empirical research in the built environment field is hampered by a lack of reliable measurement tools. The authors argue that there is a need for measures of built form that are objective, descriptive, comprehensive, reliable, practical, and address all environmental scales. They outline the development of an instrument to measure physical characteristics of housing for use in a study funded by the Wellcome Trust, on the effects of regeneration on mental health. The Built Environment Site Survey Checklist (BESSC) contains a wide range of items designed to be rated by built environment specialists for individual predetermined ‘housing areas’. The interrater reliability of the BESSC was tested using the κ and weighted κ statistics for categorical variables and item rankings and intraclass correlation coefficients for continuous measures. The majority of the items were found to be reliable and, although the instrument requires further refinement, it offers substantial potential for investigation of the relative merits of alternative urban forms and the generation of research-based design guidance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public transit service is a promising travel mode because of its potential to address urban sustainability. However, current ridership of public transit is very low in most urban regions—particularly those in the United States. Low transit ridership can be attributed to many factors, among which poor service quality is key. Transit service quality may potentially be improved by decreasing the number of service stops, but this would be likely to reduce access coverage. Improving transit service quality while maintaining adequate access coverage is a challenge facing public transit agencies. In this paper we propose a multiple-route, maximal covering/shortest-path model to address the trade-off between public transit service quality and access coverage in an established bus-based transit system. The model is applied to routes in Columbus, Ohio. Results show that it is possible to improve transit service quality by eliminating redundant or underutilized service stops. </jats:p>",

With the aid of remotely sensed data, the spatial extent of urban areas in the Houston (USA) metropolitan region from 1974 to 2002 was analyzed by spatial metrics. Regularities in the spatial urban growth pattern were identified with temporal periods as short as thirty years by means of spatial metric values, including mean nearest-neighbor distance, mean patch area, total number of urban patches, and mean patch fractal dimension. Through changes in these values, a distinct oscillation between phases of diffusion and coalescence in urban growth was revealed. The results suggest that the hypothesized process of diffusion and coalescence may occur over shorter time periods than previously thought, and that the patterns are readily observable in real-world systems. </jats:p>",

To counter this tendency, without abandoning DeLanda's perspective, a new passage between the virtual plane of consistency and concrete machines is invented.

The five trip purposes:journey to work, goods movement, tourism, economic generators and community travel. Understanding travel purposes in the market sheds will allow transportation planners to integrate these purposes into transportation systems, irrespective of mode, to meet the market needs. Our transportation infrastructure is a costly investment. We need to make smarter transportation investment decisions. We can no longer remain intolerant to our customer’s purpose(s) for transportation. We need to understand the market and its relationship to economic and social goals to better plan our transportation system. </jats:p>",

The new recovery plan we seek after has to not only suit the changed environment brought about by the disruption, but also be close to the initial plan so as not to cause too much customer unsatisfaction or inconvenience for current‐stage and downstream operations. For the general‐cost case, we propose a dynamic programming method for the problem. For the convex‐cost case, a general problem which involves both cost and demand disruptions can be solved by considering the cost disruption first and then the demand disruption. We find that a pure demand disruption is easy to handle; and for a pure cost disruption, we propose a greedy method which is provably efficient. Our computational studies also reveal insights that will be helpful to managing disruptions in production planning. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2005.</jats:p>",

We argue that, to date, understandings of innovation are predominantly technological and product driven and defined in universal terms such that the nature of innovation is stripped of its contextual influence and is overly masculinist. Through combined analysis of interview material from two complementary studies on the gendering of entrepreneurship based in the United States, this paper challenges current conceptualisations of innovation within geography. We show how the context, both social and geographical, of an innovation is elementary to its identification as innovative. Moreover, we reveal some of the many instances of innovation that occur in economic sectors and by agents that are typically ignored or undervalued by current research and by policy. Our analysis challenges researchers and policymakers to expand their concepts of regional and urban development beyond those processes associated with technologically defined and growth-oriented originality, such that notions of local development may enhance the social well-being of places and be more gender inclusive. </jats:p>",

First, the CAD-based vision sensor planning system developed in our lab is briefly introduced; it uses both the CAD model and the camera model to plan camera viewpoints. The planning system employs a decomposition-based approach to generate camera viewpoints that satisfy given task constraints. Second, to improve the efficiency of the eye-in-hand robot inspection system, robot path planning is studied, which is the focus of this paper. This problem is rendered as a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). A new hierarchical approach is developed to solve the TSP into its suboptimality. Instead of solving a large size TSP, this approach utilizes the clustering nature of the viewpoints and converts the TSP into a clustered Traveling Salesman Problem (CTSP). A new algorithm, which favors the intergroup paths, is proposed to solve the CTSP quickly. Performance of the new algorithm is analyzed. It is shown that instead of a fixed performance ratio as reported in some existing work, a constant bound can be achieved which is related to the diameter of the clusters. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the robot motion planning system. The proposed path planning approach can obtain sub-optimal solutions quickly for many large scale TSPs, which are common problems in many robotic applications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although directed to the British system of town and country planning this paper has relevance for many OECD countries, including some with systems of land use regulation which evolved entirely independently of the British. The paper starts by characterising the basic features of the British land use planning system, viewed from the resource allocation point of view of an economist. A conclusion is that the system explicitly excludes any use of price signals from its decisions. The paper then summarises the problems to which the exclusion of price information has given rise. Because the UK planning system has deliberately constrained the supply of space, and space is an attribute of housing which is income elastic in demand, rising incomes not only drive rising real house prices but also mean that land prices have risen considerably faster than house prices. Several housing attributes other than garden space are to a degree substitutes for land but the underlying cause of the inelastic supply of housing in the UK is the constraint on land supply. The final section proposes a mechanism which would make use of the information embodied in the price premiums of neighbouring parcels of land zoned for different uses. Such premiums signal the relative scarcity of land for different uses at each location and should become a 'material consideration' in planning decision-making. If they were above some threshold, this should provide a presumption of development unless maintaining the land in its current use could be shown to be in the public interest. If combined with impact fees, such a change would not only make housing supply more elastic and the system more transparent, but would help to distance land availability decisions from the political process. </jats:p>",

Factors that hinder progress are identified at central and local government levels. Drawing on principles from a gender mainstreaming toolkit, developed as part of the research, key stages and components of the planning process are identified through which gender might be more successfully mainstreamed into substantive spatial policy. </jats:p>",

By introducing game theory together with the basic concepts and accompanying reasoning, the author intends to explore and present a manageable and rationalised way of preparing and undertaking a difficult SI assignment. So, in the development of his ideas, partly through telling a Chinese legend and partly through presenting a case study of a real life SI assignment, he will make the following points. First, the interpreter must have a good knowledge of his/her own strengths and of the nature and difficulty of assignment and must undertake research to enhance that knowledge. Secondly, on the basis of this knowledge, he/she must set an optimal and realistic objective for the assignment. Thirdly, through research, he/she must design strategies to achieve the selected objectives and, at the same time, through research, he/she must assess the costs and risks and then design specific strategies to contain/reduce the costs and manage/minimize the risks in order to optimise the results of the assignment. Last but not least, he/she must evaluate the game plan designed for the job to facilitate future game planning. In the spirit of game theory, SI becomes a very brainy, intellectual activity and is no longer a process of mechanic reproduction, pedantic compilation of glossary and an unmanageable chancy behaviour.</jats:p>",

I argue that geographers have tended to overlook the ways in which practices of self-government and subjectification are performed in relation to programmes of government, and suggest that they should examine the technical devices which are embedded in networks of government. Drawing upon these observations I suggest how geographers might proceed, tracing the geographies of a specific artefact: the British government's 1958 Motorway Code. I examine how the code was designed to serve as a technology of government that could shape the conduct of fairly mobile and distant subjects, enabling them to govern their conduct and the movements of their vehicles. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent clinical trials show promising results in using MRI and MRI‐based thermometry to guide focused ultrasound surgery to treat uterine fibroids. During treatment, large variation in the focal temperature distribution has been observed. It is possible that some of this variation is due to abdominal tissue inhomogeneity, which might be causing focal beam distortion, and might largely decrease the focusing ability in deep‐seated tissues. The purpose of this study was to numerically demonstrate this effect and also show the feasibility of restoring the focal beam patterns by employing the phase correction procedure for phased arrays. Abdominal MR data from four uterine fibroid patients were obtained to reconstruct the three‐dimensional meshes of interfaces used in simulations, and one patient was selected to perform the analysis of key parameters in focused ultrasound surgery. Results show that, without phase correction, the focused beam can be severely distorted while using a frequency above <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp5525-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp5525:mp5525-math-0001\" /> or delivering ring‐shape focal patterns. Different focal positions at the same depth may require a different power to induce the same ultrasonic intensity level (up to 179% among the different focal patterns). After adding a phase correction procedure, the distorted focal beams can be restored, and the peak intensity can be largely recovered (up to 85% among the different focal patterns). This study may offer important implications and information for treatment planning toward optimizing focused ultrasound surgery in uterine fibroid or other abdominal tumor treatments.</jats:p>",

In this paper we examine the progentrification rhetoric and tactics confronted by the second largest Puerto Rican community in the United States, Chicago's Humboldt Park. Three points are documented in this current case. First, real-estate capital and the media now target and script Puerto Rican youth bodies to communicate a new gentrification-sanitizing theme: a disgust for ‘ghetto’ morals and social order. Second, this coding of bodies involves a key process, taking readers to imaginary spaces in discourse. Third, possibilities to thwart gentrification exist but organizing strategies are ineffective in that they fail to confront the politics of youth bodying. The results shed light on one of the ascendant strategies of capital to restructure Spanish-speaking neighborhoods and a subset of them, Puerto Rican communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Towards the end of the 20th century Guatemala embarked on an ambitious rural electrification plan: central planners in the Ministry of Energy and Mines hope to connect 90% of homes to the national electricity grid by 2004. Energy for the increased demand comes from floating power plants anchored in Guatemala's Pacific port, a new coal-fired power plant, and numerous small-scale hydroelectric plants. So far, rural electrification, in terms of connected households, has proceeded to plan. However, the success of the rural electrification program belies energy realities and the development needs of rural Guatemala. Data from in-depth interviews and household surveys in Ixcán, Guatemala, show that rural residents prefer other forms of development—like the introduction of potable water, or improved schooling. Electricity, farmers state, only provides rural families with a few hours of light at night because they cannot afford to pay for appliances or for increased consumption of electricity. Fieldwork in rural areas also reveals that the introduction of electricity will not change patterns of firewood consumption; firewood is the basic survival fuel for most rural Guatemalans. Development funds may be better spent on locally run and organized forestry initiatives to ensure reliable sources of firewood for the future. </jats:p>",

Five themes emerged: (a) concerns about knowing how to begin to plan, (b) difficulty identifying what the children needed to learn, (c) the prominence of decisions made on the fly, (d) comparisons of thinking about teaching and planning with actual written plans, and (e) limited transfer of in-class experiences to teaching in the project. Suggestions for teacher educators include acknowledging the complex nonlinear relationship between planning skills, teaching experience, and professional knowledge; structuring guided experiences with a variety of lesson planning formats (e.g., written, mental, verbal); and maximizing opportunities for preservice teachers to reflect on connections between their experiences as students and as teachers. </jats:p><jats:p> September 22, 2004 </jats:p><jats:p> December 10, 2004. </jats:p>",

These ideas have informed regional development policy from the growth poles/centres of the 1950/1960s to the contemporary focus on clusters. Although such policies imply the theoretical prospect of regional diversification by exploiting supply-chain and information-based/knowledge-based relationships, in practice they tend to promote regional specialisation. The experiences of many old industrial areas emphasise the risks of specialisation as advantages mutate into liabilities (territorial lock-in). These experiences are ignored in much of the clusters discourse which often lacks historical perspective. This paper provides such perspective by reflecting upon the relationships between the dynamics of industry evolution, agglomeration, and regional development policy with reference to the chemical industry on Teesside in North East England. </jats:p>",

With few exceptions, the extant literature tends to compare SOEs as a whole with other economic sectors. Little has been written about the heterogeneous nature of SOEs. The author examines the internal variation of SOEs at different administrative levels in terms of productivity and profitability in China, which remains one of the largest socialist economies undergoing profound structural changes. The performance of SOEs is found to have varied significantly among the administrative hierarchy of the socialist political system. The changing politics of scale from promoting regional self-reliance in the Maoist era toward both expanding SOE autonomy and fiscal decentralization in the post-Maoist era, has resulted in an increase in the disparity between the SOEs affiliated with the national government and those affiliated with local governments. The investigation of SOEs in the Chinese context raises important theoretical questions concerning the growth dynamics of SOEs and suggests the need for a more careful and path-dependent treatment of socialist economies under reform. The growth of SOEs in transitional socialist economies provides an interesting testing ground in which to evaluate the theoretical discourse concerning the politics of scale and the rescaling of politics. </jats:p>",

A systematic tracing of agendas, arguments, and policy change indicates that learning processes and partial EPI have occurred. Changing actor configurations and increasing resource dependencies have facilitated learning and EPI, driven in turn by the European deregulation processes, global policy agendas, and the development of the Nordic electricity market. However, learning and EPI has been slow, indirect, and partial—constrained by how policymaking is organised in central government. Further measures are needed to advance EPI in national sector policy, including the development of policy-level strategic assessments and stronger sector accountabilities. </jats:p>",

Participants were 118 mothers and their second‐grade children. Mothers rated children on their emotional intensity and children rated themselves on their use of emotion regulation strategies. Children and mother–child dyads were videotaped during planning tasks and independent observers rated their behavior. Child emotional intensity was directly related to children being less engaged in the task and to an emphasis in maternal instruction on regulatory behaviors. Some types of emotion regulation strategies modified these relations. Findings suggest that child emotionality may play an important role in the early school years in children's opportunities to learn during social‐cognitive activity.</jats:p>",

The principal question that this paper addresses is: how are the long periods of continuity, punctuated by occasional major shifts in developmental trajectory and the region's place in the global economy, to be understood? The author seeks to answer this question by exploring the extent to which continuity and change in the region's developmental trajectory can be understood in terms of evolutionary and institutional concepts and the varying engagement of the state with issues of socioeconomic development and change. The value of theoretical plurality in seeking to understand uneven development in capitalism is demonstrated and the limits to public policies that seek to address regional problems indicated. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over time we can observe a dramatic global shift in shipbuilding activities, from Great Britain to Continental Europe to Japan to South Korea; most recently China is gaining ground. Every transition is accompanied by institutional and political reactions, leading to protectionism and trade conflicts. The most recent of these battles is being fought out between the European Commission, in particular Germany as a major player in this market, and South Korea, which is accused of illegally supporting its shipyards. As state support has traditionally played an important role, both in establishing and in protecting shipbuilding as a strategic industry within a national economy, the concept of political lock-in appears to provide a promising method for explaining both the rise, through its enabling element, and delayed fall, through its constraining element, of these specific regional economies. Against the background of this theoretical concept, an empirical study comparing two competing shipbuilding regions—Mecklenburg-Vorpommern in eastern Germany and Gyeongnam in South Korea—was conducted; the results are twofold. First, restructuring the shipbuilding industry in these two regions seems less affected by local and regional factors than it is by national and international organisations. National and international organisations are, under globalisation conditions, increasingly responsible for regulating the conditions of competition, but are failing to do so. Second, because of the multiscale involvement of political and economic actors and, hence, the increasing complexity of the restructuring process, the concept of political lock-in needs to be integrated into a much broader explanatory framework—which the authors develop. </jats:p>",

On the basis of fifty interviews in six case-study authorities, the author identifies five reasons for a reluctance to externalise. He further considers the degree of theoretical support for this reluctance, concluding that gaps in our knowledge—critical to ‘make or buy’ decisions—make it impossible to determine whether a reluctance to externalise is well founded or not. </jats:p>",

To be complete, regional plans that identify critical areas for conservation must capture representative components of freshwater biodiversity as well as rare and endangered species. We present a spatially hierarchical approach to classify freshwater systems to create a coarse filter to capture representative freshwater biodiversity in regional conservation plans. The classification framework has four levels that we described using abiotic factors within a zoogeographic context and mapped in a geographic information system. Methods to classify and map units are flexible and can be automated where high‐quality spatial data exist, or can be manually developed where such data are not available. Products include a spatially comprehensive inventory of mapped and classified units that can be used remotely to characterize regional patterns of aquatic ecosystems. We provide examples of classification procedures in data‐rich and data‐poor regions from the Columbia River Basin in the Pacific Northwest of North America and the upper Paraguay River in central South America. The approach, which has been applied in North, Central, and South America, provides a relatively rapid and pragmatic way to account for representative freshwater biodiversity at scales appropriate to regional assessments.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The coherence of scale analysis and its contribution to our understanding of this relationship are examined here, with a focus particularly upon the influential writings of Swyngedouw. It is argued that these writings are haunted by a spatial fetishism that has deconstructive consequences, confounding the distinction between society and space upon which their composition depends. But this conclusion points (through a sort of ‘spectral logic’) towards a wider deconstruction, which suggests that the distinction between these terms or realms is itself the product of a kind of ‘scaling’. Despite its centrality to the development of geographical thought, and its congruence with other dualisms such as culture/nature, the juxtaposition of society and space remains the unexamined ground of much contemporary writing. Recent efforts by feminists and others to rework the notion of ‘space’ and indeed of ‘society’ would benefit from addressing these together in their articulation through the in-between-ness of scale. </jats:p>",

Four focus group discussions were conducted with married men and with family planning providers from both the government and private sector. In addition, seven key informants were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide. The results indicate that men have limited knowledge about family planning, that family planning services do not adequately meet the needs of men, and that spousal communication about family planning issues is generally poor. However, almost all men approved of modern family planning and expressed great interest in participating. The positive change of the beliefs and attitudes of men towards family planning in the past years has not been recognized by family planning programme managers, since available services are not in line with current public attitudes. A more couple-oriented approach to family planning is needed. Measures could include, for example, recruiting males as family planning providers, offering more family planning counselling for couples, and promoting female-oriented methods with men and vice versa.</jats:p>",

Over the past decade and longer, the first-generation Asian NICs, Singapore included, have been confronted with imperatives necessitating deep restructuring. We observe that the pattern of industrial decline associated with failed restructuring caused by lock-in does not fit these countries, industrial regions, and early industries. Yet research has hardly begun to look at adjustment or to address deeper evolution from tenets in the framework of evolutionary economics, although such an approach is made more rather than less relevant by continued resilience. We analyse the pathway(s) of one early industry, the apparel industry in Singapore, through the 1980s and 90s. The withering away in the Singapore context of an industry such as apparel manufacture is not inevitable. From a juxtaposition of the line of thinking in evolutionary economics in which hindrance and decline due to path dependency and lock-ins are emphasised, with an alternative line in which the possibility of adjusting through renewal and the limited operation of lock-ins is emphasised, we discuss why the latter rather than the former has been the case. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is often suggested that innovation is one of the most desirable environmental policy aims, in that it promises to solve the conflict between environmental regulation and economic growth. Contrary to what is frequently advocated—that in order to foster innovation through regulation, most of the attention should be put on the regulation-setting process, I argue that a cooperative stance in the implementation of regulations also has a crucial impact, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This argument is assessed looking at innovation effects that both direct regulations (command-and-control) and indirect regulations (negotiated voluntary agreements, called cleaner production agreements) have in this sector. A face-to-face survey questionnaire, with a non-probabilistic matching sampling strategy, was conducted in 322 firms representing four industrial sectors in Chile. The propensity-scores analysis demonstrates that SMEs involved in voluntary agreements innovate significantly more, as expressed through environmental management systems and techniques. In terms of technological innovations, voluntary agreements promoted incremental (rather than radical) multimedia innovations. Nevertheless, they had a significant effect on triggering at least one radical process change in the SMEs engaged in the programme. I conclude by emphasising that a cooperative style in the design and implementation of regulations has a key role to play in environmental capacity building in SMEs, and that this approach can create the appropriate conditions for innovation. However, this potential cannot be fully realised if there are not strong market and regulatory stimuli towards the development of more radical environmental innovations. </jats:p>",

This framework problematises the public—private and community—asylum boundaries that have hitherto been taken for granted. The framework is applied to case studies in Canada and New Zealand.

He argued that this reversal in political fortunes had in part emerged out of an internal tension within the environmental movement itself—a tension between overinflation and banalisation. In this paper I analyse the nature of the purported processes of overinflation and banalisation within contemporary ecological politics, and explore ways in which it is possible to image a reinvention of environmental politics, forged between the socioecological marvellous and the mundane. Focusing on struggles over the treatment of nature and the urban environment in the socialist city of Katowice in Poland, I reveal a brand of environmental politics emerging out of communist Eastern Europe which appears to have important implications for a reinvented environmentalism. Considering the particular utilisation of the everyday environment which was forced on environmental groups in Katowice by political circumstances, I claim that the quotidian could provide a new ground upon which to perceive and connect social and ecological politics at a variety of different spatial scales and in a powerful array of different socionatural contexts. </jats:p>",

An evolutionary approach is taken which starts from different institutional bases and reveals a complex mix of temporalities and spatialities in the development path of enterprises and the region. The major empirical findings contrast two dominant types of strategic response to decline: firms either stayed in the industry, but left the region; or stayed in the region, but left the industry.

This calls for greater strategic and operational cooperation between buyer and supplier firms, often involving some degree of collaborative planning. Advances in information technology are making it possible for firms to share planning information more quickly and easily. This study surveyed purchasing executives whose firms are involved in collaborative planning with suppliers to examine several factors that support effective planning and the impact that effective collaborative planning has on performance in the buying firm. The results show that effective collaborative planning is dependent on the level of trust and the quality of information shared between firms.</jats:p>",

Programs are typically fragmented, with little communication among the groups who share a common interest in reducing crime. Most programs operate in isolation rather than being linked to a broader community-wide prevention strategy. Communities that have been able to make meaningful reductions in crime rates have done so by taking a comprehensive approach to crime prevention in which they implement an integrated series of programs that coordinate the efforts of a broad range of partners and participants. To be comprehensive and effective, crime prevention programs must analyse the crime problems in their community context, involve a broad group of people and organizations, consider a diverse range of prevention strategies, carefully implement the programs most suited to a particular community, and assess the results. This article illustrates how this process can be applied to the prevention of motor vehicle theft. </jats:p>",

We have developed a novel signal-processing based technique to noninvasively estimate these parameters in situ based on analysis of raw backscattered RF data from two localized HIFU exposures, one at sub-ablative intensities to determine K, and another at therapeutic intensities to obtain Q. Both exposures are performed prior to therapy. To estimate K, a short HIFU exposure is applied resulting in a temperature rise of less than 15° C. The Gaussian radius of the temperature induced apparent strain profile during cool down is estimated and fit to an approximate analytical heat diffusion expression to obtain K. Independent estimates of K derived using the transient hotwire technique validated the ultrasonic measurements. To estimate Q, an audio range hydrophone was acoustically coupled to the sample to detect the onset of boiling. The time required to bring the sample to boiling was used to estimate Q by iteration of a numerical BHTE model. These results are validated against in situ measured values using thermocouples and linear acoustic calculations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inverse planned intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) fields can be highly modulated due to the large number of degrees of freedom involved in the inverse planning process. Additional modulation typically results in a more optimal plan, although the clinical rewards may be small or offset by additional delivery complexity and/or increased dose from transmission and leakage. Increasing modulation decreases delivery efficiency, and may lead to plans that are more sensitive to geometrical uncertainties. The purpose of this work is to assess the use of maximum intensity limits in inverse IMRT planning as a simple way to increase delivery efficiency without significantly affecting plan quality. Nine clinical cases (three each for brain, prostate, and head/neck) were used to evaluate advantages and disadvantages of limiting maximum intensity to increase delivery efficiency. IMRT plans were generated using in‐house protocol‐based constraints and objectives for the brain and head/neck, and RTOG 9406 dose volume objectives in the prostate. Each case was optimized at a series of maximum intensity ratios (the product of the maximum intensity and the number of beams divided by the prescribed dose to the target volume), and evaluated in terms of clinical metrics, dose‐volume histograms, monitor units (MU) required per fraction (SMLC and DMLC delivery), and intensity map variation (a measure of the beam modulation). In each site tested, it was possible to reduce total monitor units by constraining the maximum allowed intensity without compromising the clinical acceptability of the plan. Monitor unit reductions up to 38% were observed for SMLC delivery, while reductions up to 29% were achieved for DMLC delivery. In general, complicated geometries saw a smaller reduction in monitor units for both delivery types, although DMLC delivery required significantly more monitor units in all cases. Constraining the maximum intensity in an inverse IMRT plan is a simple way to improve delivery efficiency without compromising plan objectives.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The use of the Internet as a health education tool and as a resource in health education planning is widely accepted as the norm in industrialized countries. Unfortunately, access to computers and the Internet is quite limited in developing countries. Not all licensed service providers operate, many users are actually foreign nationals, telephone connections are unreliable, and electricity supplies are intermittent. In this context, computer, e-mail, Internet, and CD-Rom use by health and health education program officers in five states in southwestern Nigeria were assessed to document their present access and use. Eight of the 30 organizations visited were government health ministry departments, while the remainder were non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Six NGOs and four State Ministry of Health (MOH) departments had no computers, but nearly two-thirds of both types of agency had e-mail, less than one-third had Web browsing facilities, and six had CD-Roms, all of whom were NGOs. Only 25 of the 48 individual respondents had computer use skills. Narrative responses from individual employees showed a qualitative difference between computer and Internet access and use and type of agency. NGO staff in organizations with computers indicated having relatively free access to a computer and the Internet and used these for both program planning and administrative purposes. In government offices it appeared that computers were more likely to be located in administrative or statistics offices and used for management tasks like salaries and correspondence, limiting the access of individual health staff. These two different organizational cultures must be considered when plans are made for increasing computer availability and skills for health education planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Current arguments in Australia concerning horizontal fiscal equalisation may help inform the debate in the United Kingdom concerning possible changes to the Barnett formula and the establishment of financial relations with any regional governments in England. Although Australia is a long-established federation, with mature institutions for managing the financial aspects of intergovernmental relations, the most populous states are now pushing for a per-capita-based system to replace the existing formula—based on needs and costs—overseen by the independent Commonwealth Grants Commission. This has important implications for the United Kingdom, where the Barnett formula—a per capita system for deciding annual changes in the funding for the devolved administrations—has been increasingly challenged. In particular, the Barnett system has been vulnerable to nontransparent ‘formula-bypass’ agreements. We argue that the status quo in the United Kingdom appears secure as long as England remains a single entity and the UK Treasury sees the financial implications of larger per capita expenditure in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as relatively small. However, we speculate that regionalisation of government in England would be likely to increase the pressure: to abandon the Barnett system; to look more systematically at need and cost, rather than population, as criteria for allocating funds between governments; and to move towards an Australian-type system. However, the recent experience of Australia also shows that larger states prefer a per-capita-based system allied to more political, less transparent, arrangements to deal with ‘special circumstances’. It may be that a Barnett-type formula would suit the new ‘dominant states’ in a fully federalised United Kingdom which would, ironically, create an alliance of interests between Scotland and London. </jats:p>",

Race and gender were not significant determinants of plan quality; however, disability type, projected diploma type, and district residence were associated with variations in transition planning activities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ecological modernisation is a normative theory that explains why society's institutions and practices change in response to environmental consequences of industrial economies. It is also a term used to describe broader processes of change in environmental governance. In this paper, we use the second concept to explore the development of Brazil's governance of genetically modified (GM) or transgenic crops. We discuss three major shifts in GM-crop governance and regulatory institutions during the past decade. We focus on how nongovernmental organisations, local governments, and farmers challenged the federal government's biotechnology regulatory institution. The analysis of Brazil's GM debate offers important insights into the process of ecological modernisation in the global South. The case represents a key example of how ecological modernisation may proceed in countries facing neoliberalism and export-oriented economic policies paralleled by increasing democratisation. In Brazil, these seemingly contradictory forces have led to innovative, market-based paths of institutional change in environmental governance. Our study also offers an instructive example of how ecological modernisation processes in the global South intersect with broader dynamics of globalisation to shape potentially diverse environmental policy outcomes. </jats:p>",
