      "abstract": "<jats:p> The growth forecasts of the World Bank have become increasingly influential for the planning efforts of developing countries. However, after reviewing these forecasts this author concludes that the projections of the Bank for the economic growth rates both of the industrial and of the developing countries are systematically biased, and its estimates of the locomotive effect for developing countries are ambiguous. A similar pattern is reflected in the forecasts of the major United Nations agencies, in particular the Secretariat and UNCTAD. These forecasts are not readily explained by the data presented or by the forecasting methods used by the agencies. Rather, the explanation appears to lie in the need to rationalize forecasts within the context of a particular institutional imperative. An alternative model of forecasting is suggested which shows how peer group and pressures within the interagency system have resulted in a misplaced consensus about long-term trends, changed the methods used, undermined the potential benefits of the forecasting exercise, and ultimately harmed the situation of many people in the developing countries. </jats:p>",

This article investigates the measurement of family planning program effort based on data reflecting conditions circa 1982 in 100 developing countries. Using confirmatory factor analytic techniques, it tests some hypotheses implicit in the work of Mauldin and Lapham. Since the data do not fully support these hypotheses, an alternative conceptualization is proposed that consists of eight rather than four components. The discussion focuses on the expanded set of components and includes an assessment of the empirical indicators associated with them.</jats:p>",

The PTMT includes a set of logic diagrams and specially developed software for manipulating the information represented by the logic diagrams. Two logic diagrams are included in the PTMT in its current form. One diagram, called a process tree, graphically represents the physical processes that occur when an engineered system functions successfully. Another, called a programme tree, includes gates representing elements of a successful research, development, and fabrication programme. These trees are used in conjunction to store programmatic and scientific information useful for a manager of a large, technical research and development programme. The objective of this article is to explain the methodology involved in development of the process tree and its associated programme tree and to describe a computer software tool based on the HYPERTALK language that make the logic diagrams vastly more useful to the manager. The methodology is illustrated by a relatively simple and understandable example.</jats:p>",

Two main objectives were achieved: the formulation of a National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCP) for consideration by the government and the creation of a Coastal Sensitivity Atlas detailing the sensitive resources of Mauritius and the strategies to protect them.

The NOSCP document also recommends supporting legislation and ratification of relevant regional and international conventions, and proposes techniques for oil spill response and the disposal of oily wastes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Coastal Sensitivity Atlas is a separate document containing 19 maps on a scale of 1:30,000, which cover the coastline of Mauritius and neighboring islets.

The results presented are based on real‐world complex financial models in a large commercial bank.

Calculation of power of the test and evaluation of designs augmented sequentially over time are exercises that have not been done by most researchers because of the labor and tedium involved.

The statutory coherence hypothesis states that effective implementation is a function of the extent to which a statute coherently structures the implementation process. The equitable distribution of statutory benefits is defined as a condition of effective implementation. During the period of study (Fiscal Years 1976-1981), national family planning policy was embedded in four separate statutes. Implementation was operationalized in terms of interstate variation in per capita family planning expenditures under each of the four grant programs. Statutory coherence scores were developed for each of the four enactments. The findings of this study support the statutory coherence hypothesis. Both the theoretical significance and the policy implications of these results are discussed. </jats:p>",

The management and conservation of the basin itself in turn depends on knowing the requirements of those sectors and their probable impact on each other and on the status of the basin's resources, its ecology and environment. The development of African river basin resources is subject to various constraints, some for physical and climatic reasons, others tied to socio‐cultural characteristics and the priorities of national economies. These are reflected in financial, manpower and institutional limitations, problems of finding technologies suited to specific local conditions and concern for human health. The scale and complexity of river basin development make it difficult to predict precise outcomes of planned proposals, but a progressive approach which links long‐term activities with achievable, shorter term production projects offers prospects for ultimate success.</jats:p>",

In this model, the original consumption forecast may be disrupted at some random future time by an event called a “surprise.” As in the Swedish situation, we have modeled the surprise as an unexpected stagnation in future demand growth and benefit levels. We show that this form of uncertainty makes desirable delaying the initiation of the project beyond the time optimal under the original forecast. We then extend the model to include the lead time for the project as a variable, and demonstrate that the lead time should be reduced from that optimal under a deterministic future. Finally, we incorporate the option of abandoning the project when the surprise occurs, and show that higher salvage values for the project lead to earlier optimal commitment times. </jats:p>",

The precise nature of such regularities and what can be learned from them about the internal structure of an economic system are the purpose of this series of two papers. In this first paper the evolution of an economic system is analysed, namely in Germany during the period of its economic integration, that is to say during the 19th century. Different statistical measures are compared: the price ratio, the price correlations, the price dispersion, in order to characterise the increasing interdependence of economic activity centres. It is shown that this interdependence increases for every commodity according to a specific trend. Last, in order to link these results with the economic and political history of Germany some data are presented pertaining to the development of its domestic trade during the 19th century. </jats:p>",

It has been used extensively to determine the appropriate number of machines to place within the repair center, the stacker capacity for in-process inventory, the location of elevators for sending parts to the conveyor, and the optimal design and routing scheme for the overhead conveyor system. The new layout, as predicted by the simulation model, has proven to be quite effective. The new design has decreased material handling by 50 to 80 percent, decreased flow times, allowed better management control of part transfers, saved $4.3 million from the elimination of excess machine capacity, and saved $1.8 million from higher direct labor efficiency. </jats:p>",

Correction for the dwelling characteristic permits the analysis to be interpreted in terms of land values rather than property values per unit area. The selected equation explains more than 93% of the variation in the dependent variable (house price per unit of lot area). All the independent variables (five property or transaction characteristics, four neighborhood effects, and ten locational nodes) are statistically significant, with one major exception: distance from the CBD, which has a very low /-value and an unexpected sign. This result should be considered in the context of many superficial references, based largely on visual symbols such as new office buildings, to a revival of downtown Los Angeles. The authors interpret the finding that eight subcenters have a statistically significant influence on metropolitan residential land values in Los Angeles as yet another indication of the demise of the monocentric model and the need to discuss VS metropolitan areas in policentric terms. </jats:p>",
