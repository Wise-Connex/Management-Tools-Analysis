      "abstract": "<jats:p> Communicative planners are often criticized for lacking a credible strategy for dealing with biased power relations. The purpose of the article is to make it evident that critical communicative planning has a strategy for handling this problem. The logic of critical communicative planning (John Forester’s ‘critical pragmatism’) is reformulated in terms of transaction cost politics. The critical planner counteracts systematically distorted communication by augmenting the transaction costs of those trying to influence the planned solution by leaning on their power base instead of the force of the better argument.Also, the critical planner aims to diminish the political transaction costs of deprived groups standing to lose from the results of power-based argumentation. The idea is to make it relatively more difficult to pursue special interests by means of repressive or manipulative strategies. Hence, the rationality of critical communicative planning rests on power management by deliberate alteration of political transaction costs. Analysis of ‘network power’ shows that the same chain of reasoning does not fit well for strongly consensus-seeking collaborative planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is important to consider ways to help planning students develop a concern for social justice before they enter professional life. In previous decades, particularly the 1960s and 1970s, the task of instilling a sense of social commitment among planning students was not so difficult. Students were very likely to come into the classroom with a heightened awareness of social justice concerns, in great part because of the civil rights movement and because of an “urban crisis” that may have actually called them into the profession. In the current situation, in which such background and sense of urgency cannot be assumed, it is important to consider ways in which to create classroom learning experiences that foster a sense of social consciousness. Only a limited number of tools exist that can help with this process, however, and each has advantages and disadvantages. Planning history is one of these tools, but it has value only if used carefully and with purposeful preparation on the part of the instructor.</jats:p>",

However, this article argues that the participatory paradigm provides at best inadequate justification to the planning process. Particularly if consensus building is the aim of the participatory process, it suffers from a number of impossibility results well documented in the political economics literature. ‘Lazy deliberators’ will arrive at the acceptance of a priori median preference, and participatory processes necessarily exclude some groups, even under equitable capability and power distribution.

The previous research was accompanied by the formulation of an innovative war plan which envisaged, for the first time in Russian military history, the crossing of the Balkan mountain range and an assault on Constantinople One of Kiselev's first actions on becoming head of the Second Army's Main Staff in 1819 was to draw up a war plan against the Ottoman Empire. He was assisted in this enterprise by the large body of experience acquired by the Russian army during its five previous Turkish wars fought between 1711 and 1812.</p>",

Might historians help students see planning as a ubiquitous and ongoing process that has shaped the present and will inform the future? Every planning report includes a history; it may be brief in scope, it may be implied or inferred, it may be potted. Planners can do better. Their histories ought to reveal the fact that multiple, competing paradigms are always in play; that those who preceded us grappled with issues similar to those that challenge us today; that they crafted policy, drew up plans, and struggled for justice to the best of their ability; that we build upon their success and failure; that all plans are compromised in implementation; and, perhaps most importantly, that humility and persistence have been and remain essential when you aspire to make change. </jats:p>",

The “creative capital” perspective argues that such growth is extremely dependent on the presence of four main conditions: technology, talent, tolerance, and good quality of place. This article examines evidence for the importance of tolerance in promoting metropolitan economic development. Through his analysis, Richard Florida studied the association of economic growth with the presence of gays and lesbians, bohemians, immigrants, and racial minorities. Literature confirms that diversity is an important component of economic development, although this does not appear to be fully explained by Florida’s creative-cities model. </jats:p>",

With tree-lined streets and Greek Revival, Italianate, and Second French Empire architecture, Bayside hardly fit the stereotype of a slum. This study not only examines Bayside’s changing socioeconomic configuration but also (within the context of the progressive housers’ rhetoric about deslumming) explores the Depression-era and post-World War II government-energized crusade against blight. Like Robert Fogelsong and Alison Isenberg find for larger cities, the study sees this Bayside-dooming campaign as having much more to do with saving the downtown from the threat of suburbia and white flight than with providing safe and sanitary housing and decent neighborhoods to the urban poor.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Social and economic changes resulting from the introduction of market allocation processes in the post-Mao era have been enormously consequential in accelerating China’s urbanization. Central to such changes have been the fundamental reconceptualization of the role of the city vis-a-vis national development strategies and the consequent revitalization of the practice of urban spatial planning after years of disrepute and dissolution. This article examines the current state—the “third spring”—of urban planning practice relative to ongoing changes in urban China, particularly the rapid expansion of urban spatial economies and the local impacts of administrative and fiscal decentralization. Instead of seeing the new position of urban planning as indicative of a sharp discontinuity with past practices, we argue that the rise of professional planning should instead be understood in terms of its conceptual continuity with the past. Analysis of current developments in planning practice indicates growing tensions over questions of control, both between central and local states and with regard to the diversification of actors shaping the political economy of urbanization at local levels. </jats:p>",

Working with several youth-serving organizations, a community planning project was conducted in which local youth collected qualitative data about their neighborhood through a variety of techniques (photography, drawings, narratives). The project took place against the backdrop of an emerging neighborhood indicators geographical information system (GIS) aimed at tracking the impact of the revitalization effort. Although techniques for collecting and using qualitative data have matured during several decades of use in the field of participatory planning and development, their effective incorporation into GIS remains elusive. Although few technical barriers remain, the absence of stakeholder participation and the lack of community capacity to implement a community-based GIS are important obstacles to a fully realized qualitative GIS. Drawing on the youth-development literature, I demonstrate in this case study the potential of qualitative GIS for engaging young people in participatory planning, while also highlighting the continuing challenge to its implementation. </jats:p>",

Governments are requiring planners to engage citizens, organizations, and institutions in regional strategic planning, regional organizational amalgamation, and regional administrative-boundary reconfiguration to achieve such integration. Despite this popularity, these approaches still are not well thought out. In particular, there has been little critical hypothesis development on institutions and regional integration by which planning practice toward achieving rural sustainability can be guided. This article seeks to show how certain elements of the scholarship in a range of disciplines within and outside planning can shed light on the different dimensions of this concept. This review enables important lessons to be drawn for planners, citizens, and governments concerned with institutions, integration, and the environment. </jats:p>",

The park is just one element of a far-reaching urban renewal scheme which seeks to restore a slum of Islamic Cairo where many cultural assets and monuments exist. The ambitious project, which has galvanized the nation, has drawn on the resources of international, national and local agencies in addition to grassroots organizations. Upon completion, the integrated development project is envisaged to rehabilitate many dwellings, monuments and urban spaces, in addition to creating employment, drawing droves of tourists and improving the quality of life in its vicinity. Thus, the impact of the project will most certainly fulfill some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set forth by the UN at the tum of the century.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world's growing cities are a critical fact of the 21st Century, and represent one of the greatest challenges to the future. By the year 2050 cities with populations over three million will be more than double; from 70 today to over 150. When knowledge is perhaps the most important factor in the future of city's economy, there is a growing interest in the concept of the \"knowledge city\". An acceptable definition of knowledge city might be it is not just a regular city. It is a growing space of exchange and optimism in which each and everyone can devote himself to personal and collective projects and aspirations in a climate of dynamism, hannony, and creativity. A world examination of the status of Knowledge Cities will reveal a tangible development in collective efforts of declaring and developing such cities around the globe. On the contrary, Arab cities are building technological isolated projects thinking that they are promoting the same concept. An examination of projects like Egypt' Smart Village and Dubai's Internet City and Knowledge Village will be helpful in evaluating the knowledge status of contemporary Arab Cities.The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge city concept in depth. It will discuss the principles of a knowledge city, and portrays its distinguishing characteristics and processes. I'll argue in this paper that the concept of 'Knowledge Cities' is rooted in the urban, cultural structure of traditional Arab cities. Therefore an attempt to foster this concept in today's Arab cities would not be possible by building isolated technologicalstatement scattered around the city. Alternatively, the rise of the network society, global networks, linked cities and existence of smart communities should construct the basis for shaping Arab Knowledge Cities.In addition, the paper will introduce the concept of Urban Creativity Engines , and examples of various types will be presented. I II argue that this is a more comprehensive concept for constructing and evaluating knowledge cities. Although this concept and its terminology is new, the paper will prove that there are many historical examples, regionally and internationally, of knowledge cities and Innovation/Creativity Engines. A focus on the traditional built environment of the Middle Eastern cities will be included to examine the main hypothesis of the paper.</jats:p>"

The ambitious project, which has galvanized the nation, has drawn on the resources of international, national and local agencies in addition to grassroots organizations. Upon completion, the integrated development project is envisaged to rehabilitate many dwellings, monuments and urban spaces, in addition to creating employment, drawing droves of tourists and improving the quality of life in its vicinity. Thus, the impact of the project will most certainly fulfill some of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) set forth by the UN at the tum of the century.</jats:p>"

The use of compensation can be one method in trying to reach a more sustainable development. The work with EIA for roads ensures that avoidance of damage to nature is given serious attention. Still, impacts that could require compensation measures will remain. This paper examines 15 planned Swedish state road projects in order to investigate the intended use of environmental compensation. The analysis serves to point out problems and opportunities for improvement to facilitate the use of compensation. The results show that while environmental compensation is proposed in several projects, measures are seldom explicitly documented or interpreted as compensation measures. The planning process also needs to be better coordinated. The most explicitly described environmental compensation in the Swedish projects is connected to water issues, while compensation for impacts in small biotopes is rare. The proposed measures are almost never in sufficient proportion to the damage that is caused. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The world's growing cities are a critical fact of the 21st Century, and represent one of the greatest challenges to the future. By the year 2050 cities with populations over three million will be more than double; from 70 today to over 150. When knowledge is perhaps the most important factor in the future of city's economy, there is a growing interest in the concept of the \"knowledge city\". An acceptable definition of knowledge city might be it is not just a regular city. It is a growing space of exchange and optimism in which each and everyone can devote himself to personal and collective projects and aspirations in a climate of dynamism, hannony, and creativity. A world examination of the status of Knowledge Cities will reveal a tangible development in collective efforts of declaring and developing such cities around the globe. On the contrary, Arab cities are building technological isolated projects thinking that they are promoting the same concept. An examination of projects like Egypt' Smart Village and Dubai's Internet City and Knowledge Village will be helpful in evaluating the knowledge status of contemporary Arab Cities.The purpose of this paper is to explore the knowledge city concept in depth. It will discuss the principles of a knowledge city, and portrays its distinguishing characteristics and processes. I'll argue in this paper that the concept of 'Knowledge Cities' is rooted in the urban, cultural structure of traditional Arab cities. Therefore an attempt to foster this concept in today's Arab cities would not be possible by building isolated technologicalstatement scattered around the city. Alternatively, the rise of the network society, global networks, linked cities and existence of smart communities should construct the basis for shaping Arab Knowledge Cities.In addition, the paper will introduce the concept of Urban Creativity Engines , and examples of various types will be presented. I II argue that this is a more comprehensive concept for constructing and evaluating knowledge cities. Although this concept and its terminology is new, the paper will prove that there are many historical examples, regionally and internationally, of knowledge cities and Innovation/Creativity Engines. A focus on the traditional built environment of the Middle Eastern cities will be included to examine the main hypothesis of the paper.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plan preparation process has evolved from the usage of traditional approaches of brainstorming to an advanced application of sophisticated analytical techniques coupled with powerful decision support software systems. The rationale of applying analytical techniques is to ensure that the analysis is thorough and logical and minimize the uncertainties in the decisions made. The National Physical Plan (NPP) of Malaysia is prepared on the basis of the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Al 129). It contains a written statement that pertains to formulation of strategic policies in determining the general directions and trends of the physical development of the country. The NPP is needed to strengthen the existing national planning system so that it is 1nore systematic, effective, and efficient. The NPP also coordinates the country's various planning agencies and authorities at the national, state and local levels and acts as the basis for preparation of lower tier physical development plans, e.g., structure and local plans. The present paper presents a case study on the NPP using a combined application of GIS and a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique. While GIS has provided its capability in data storage, retrieval and analysis of data, MCDM technique has reflected its capability as the tool for aggregating the geographical data and decision maker's preferences. It is expected that the study will stimulate further applications in various planning activities in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

New towns are distinct from older suburban and other master-planned communities in four regards: larger size, mixed use of land, existence of a master developer and phased planning. The study investigates whether the three new towns, which are considered highly successful in the field of urban planning, have broken the older patterns of racial diversity and residential segregation. Based on 2000 Census data, it is found that these new towns are much less segregated overall than their surrounding metropolitan areas and suburbs, although each community indicates different patterns of racial diversity and integration. By contrasting each community's planning visions and practices with the levels of racial diversity and segregation, the paper explores the contributions of urban planning to residential integration. </jats:p>",

Habitability in housing involves several components, including environmental factors, man-made designs, socio-cultural operations and psychological impacts. Elements of habitability can be observed in various concepts of residential developments including classical concepts such as the Garden City Movement and the Neighbourhood Unit. In Malaysia, the Malay Kampung and the Chinese New Village exemplify some ideal living practices relating to habitability. Both the classical and traditional concepts influenced subsequent residential developments in Malaysia such as the Jengka Project, Kampung Tersusun, Town 8, Cyberjaya and Putrajaya.

More recent concepts such as the New Urbanism and the China Healthy Residence have placed greater emphasis in dealing with such issues. In Malaysia, legislations and policies have not adequately addressed the problems on habitability. We lack a thorough planning system, which prepares and monitors the quality of our residential development. Failures in planning policies have also created other planning issues that affect habitability, as portrayed in the case of the Rifle Range Low-cost Flats in Penang.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Plan preparation process has evolved from the usage of traditional approaches of brainstorming to an advanced application of sophisticated analytical techniques coupled with powerful decision support software systems. The rationale of applying analytical techniques is to ensure that the analysis is thorough and logical and minimize the uncertainties in the decisions made. The National Physical Plan (NPP) of Malaysia is prepared on the basis of the Town and Country Planning Act 1976 (Al 129). It contains a written statement that pertains to formulation of strategic policies in determining the general directions and trends of the physical development of the country. The NPP is needed to strengthen the existing national planning system so that it is 1nore systematic, effective, and efficient. The NPP also coordinates the country's various planning agencies and authorities at the national, state and local levels and acts as the basis for preparation of lower tier physical development plans, e.g., structure and local plans. The present paper presents a case study on the NPP using a combined application of GIS and a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique. While GIS has provided its capability in data storage, retrieval and analysis of data, MCDM technique has reflected its capability as the tool for aggregating the geographical data and decision maker's preferences. It is expected that the study will stimulate further applications in various planning activities in Malaysia.</jats:p>"

Its main topics are contributions of planning and regional policy to general social and economic tasks like “growth and innovation”, “guaranteeing public services” and “safeguarding natural resources” as well as “shaping cultural landscapes”. The paper wants to explain why the new guidelines indicate an innovative step for spatial planning at the federal level in Germany. The main messages are: The guidelines identify their goals and proposals for action not from a traditional territorial perspective using categories like agglomerations and rural areas. Instead the new strategies refer to prevailing economic, social and environmental challenges like regional competitiveness, demographic change and conflicts on land-use priorities. This signifies a paradigm shift from traditional equity-oriented interventions in favour of rural areas to a stronger emphasis on urban agglomerations and their metropolitan development potentials. The apparent or supposed shift led to continuing political and ideological discussions which are treated in this article.</jats:p>"

Thus, the optimization multicriteria analysis leads us to infer upon the reasonableness of the decision taken in regard to implementing budgetary planning in moment of business uncertainties.

These factors include but not limited to: organizational values, advantages of teleworking, performance evaluation, strategically measures and information technology requirements. A logistic regression model was developed to test the significance of these factors against the decision to implement teleworking. Finally, conclusions were also drawn.</jats:p>"

I examine the opposition between quantitative and qualitative methods as an extension of different epistemologies and not as indicative of their innate incompatibility, and reposition GIS within these methods seen as a continuum. I show that the always-assumed alignment of GIS with quantitative research has never been complete and the many openings in GIS enable qualitative research. I also discuss how critical geographers can engage with and transform GIS as well as enhance their explanations and social theory in general by representing spatially complex social processes and relationships. </jats:p>",

An important part of the study was therefore to include a discussion of possible scenarios, e.g. mud loss and influx detection critiera and evaluate procedures for mitigating severe losses. The advanced well control model was then used to evaluate the consequences of large influx volumes. Since the well was relatively shallow with a potential for large influx volumes, gas migration issues and consequences related to that was evaluated thoroughly. It was important to stress the need for rapid well control response in case of such events.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The model was also used to evaluate maximum casing shoe pressure for various kick volumes, and the typical dynamics to be seen when applying a given well control method for safely bringing up the kick.

The study analyzes the efficiency of existing water supply network system using NETWORK allocation function. The study shows that 61% of distribution path are close to the existing coverage through water pipe line. It also delineates suitable sites for setting up new overhead tanks considering the existing water supply coverage, water demands in different landuses and their relative weighted valuation using Model Builder tool of ARC View. It has been identified that 1028132 m2 (13% of the Pourashava area) in different locations is suitable for constructing new tanks.

In this study we used these issues to frame several hypotheses about the deficits underlying ideomotor apraxia (IMA). In particular, we examined whether ideomotor apraxics exhibited (1) deficits in movement control in intrinsic (body relative) coordinates with better control in extrinsic (workspace relative) coordinates, (2) deficits in movement planning that are compensated for by an overreliance on online correction, or (3) both deficits. Patients with IMA and two comparison groups performed movement tasks that relied preferentially on either intrinsic or extrinsic coordinate control when online correction was either possible or impossible. Participants performed posture imitation and grasp imitation movements to body- and object-relative end positions in the presence or absence of visual feedback. Consistent with the intrinsic coordinate control hypothesis, patients with IMA showed a significantly greater disparity than the other two groups between movements made to body-relative and object-relative targets as well as between imitation of meaningless postures and grasping. Consistent with the correction overreliance hypothesis, the IMA group was more disrupted than the other groups by the removal of vision. Thus, IMA patients exhibit behavioral patterns consistent with both deficient intrinsic coordinate control and overreliance upon visual feedback. Finally, lesion analysis suggests that damage to the left inferior parietal lobe (Brodmann's areas 39 and 40) may play a key role in both behavioral deficits.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses the “Concepts and Action Strategies for Spatial Development in Germany” adopted on 30th June 2006 by the Standing Conference of Ministers Responsible for Spatial Planning. It considers the context, the function and the central message of the document as well as in detail the three guiding visions (Leitbilder). The author analyses both the innovative content of the document and its conceptual consistency; he also explores the question of to what extent the new guiding visions signalise a paradigm shift in spatial planning policy to the detriment of the aim of balanced regional development in favour of growth, competitiveness and the market, and thus also an acceptance of greater regional disparities. The conclusion is that there is in fact no paradigm shift taking place in spatial planning policy, but equally that the new guiding visions are by no means a plea for everything simply to continue as before. Three new accents can be distinguished: firstly, a special emphasis on the aim of growth and innovation, secondly, a re-interpretation of the aim of securing the supply of basic and essential infrastructure, in particular against the background of demographic change, and thirdly, a more detailed specification of aims with regard to the safeguarding of natural resources and the shaping of cultural landscapes.</jats:p>"

In this paper I examine the recent far-reaching air-pollution policies in India's capital, as well as the role of environmental nongovernmental organizations and judicial activism, in view of their implications for different groups of the urban population. I analyze these policies in the wider context of Delhi's ongoing strive for ‘city beautification’ and for changing (environmental) governmentalities, and reveal a marked middle-class bias in the environmental and judicial activisms practised, which also contributes to the refining of the boundary between public and private environments. Furthermore, it is argued that air quality with its complex sociospatial patterns plays a significant part in the coproduction of urban ‘socioenvironments' that needs to be addressed in political-ecological studies. </jats:p>",

Rapid hits into the target region led to a monetary bonus; accidental hits into the penalty region incurred a penalty. The outcomes assigned to target and penalty regions and the spatial arrangement of those regions were varied. Subjects preferred configurations with higher expected gain whether selection involved a rapid pointing movement or a choice by key press. Movements executed to select one of two goal configurations exhibited the same movement dynamics as pointing movements directed at a single configuration, and were executed with the same high efficiency. Our results suggest that humans choose near-optimal strategies when planning their movement, and can base their selection of strategy on a rapid judgment about the expected gain associated with possible movement goals. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A key virtue of urbanization is the possibility of using the market value of land to pay for its development costs. Many urban-redevelopment strategies, such as urban renewal, land readjustment, and land sharing, are based on this principle. Mumbai's tenement, or chawl, redevelopment programme is also a variation on the theme. The key promise of the programme is the resettlement of tenement residents in new, cross-subsidized housing on the original sites. The city's property readjustment strategy is ambitious, but deals with difficult contexts—contested claims by tenants and owners, potential for disagreements and conflicts, underdeveloped housing-finance institutions, reliance on real-estate values, and the risk of failure, overburdened infrastructure, and so on—and is hard to implement. Nonetheless, an advantage of the approach, and a partial explanation for the difficulties in implementation, is the ability to redistribute wealth to tenants. My normative position in this paper is that the pace of implementation should not be increased at the cost of the welfare of tenants. Although the strategy is far from being a panacea, I focus on public-policy recommendations to support redevelopment led by tenants' cooperatives, including technical assistance, conflict resolution, access to information, and housing-development finance. I illustrate and elaborate these arguments through a single redevelopment case. </jats:p>",

The purpose of the study was to know the perceptions the project managers, on aspects and activities of the process of implementing an ERP system and that are strongly correlated with the Critical Success Factors (FCE’s) for this kind of projects.  The FCE’s were identified in a deep revision of the literature.  The questionnaire included, among others, questions on the top management support to the project, the process of selection of the system, team work implementation and the participation and training of the users.  Additionally were identified the problems that organizations confronted during the implementation process.  The study concludes that organizations must take care the elements that indicate the FCE’s, because them hit positively the project, additionally describe aspects, which must take into account the enterprises who are in the process to adopt an ERP system to facilitate its implementation.</jats:p>"

The idea that regions are performed through forms of knowledge and political practice is advanced and explored through an engagement with development as a discourse. Within the European Union regional-development discourse is inextricably tied into the cultural political rhetoric of the ‘Europe of the Regions' concept. Local actors can utilise the discourse of development as a political resource. To illustrate this process the concept of cultural literacy is developed and explored through a case study of cultural and political activism related to the European Union Objective 1 programme in Cornwall in the South West of England. Cultural literacy refers to knowledge that aids in the assimilation of further knowledge (about a specific culture) through the creation and comprehension of tailored communications; such knowledge is inherently political and can act as a central constituent of a social identity. The discourse of European regional development itself can also be coopted into new cultural literacies towards specific political goals. In this way regional development discourses can become part of the performance of regions. </jats:p>",

Any previously existing follow-up guidelines for cancer survivors have been largely restricted to surveillance for recurrence of the primary disease. An important message of the Institute of Medicine report is that survivorship care plans must surpass this and address the chronic effects of cancer (pain, fatigue, premature menopause, depression/anxiety), monitoring for and preventing late effects like osteoporosis, heart disease, and second malignancies, and promoting healthy lifestyles. It should explicitly identify the providers responsible for each aspect of ongoing care and provide information on resources available for psychosocial and other practical issues that may arise as a result of the prior cancer diagnosis. Although having some sort of a plan is clearly necessary to achieve high quality care, there are practical barriers to formal off-treatment consultations and the creation of written documents that may become part of the medical record. This article reviews the elements of the proposed survivorship care plan and discusses areas of research and development needed to make them part of standard oncology practice. </jats:p>",

Redevelopment of former open‐cast mines and shrinking processes in cities are typical examples. Decision making in such a planning context considers complex tasks and involves preferential selection among different, usually competing alternatives. They result from demands of different spatial functions and the necessity to conserve the natural environment and landscape. The modeling of a planning process requires an adequate definition of the problem, identification of the main decision criteria and possible courses of action. Following environmental and institutional economic theory we use the idea of involving stakeholders. Determining and understanding the demands of stakeholders may lead to a successful management of environmental, social, human, and economic tasks. We propose a multicriteria approach to formulate a planning problem as a multiobjective optimization problem.</jats:p>",

However, compared with the breadth of research on various aspects of UK grocery retailing, there is a relative paucity of work across the same range of topics and scales in European contexts (broad national-level comparisons excepted). The paper therefore extends work on UK retail change, assessing the extent of corresponding or diverging development trajectories elsewhere in Europe. Key indicators are used to map spatial variations in competition, saturation, and internationalization at a subnational scale. Inferences are made regarding likely patterns of future development through the identification of growth opportunities that may be exploited by organic expansion or merger-and-acquisition activity. Some speculative merger-and-acquisition scenarios are also considered, which suggest the validity of regulatory concerns over local competition and spatial monopoly. </jats:p>",

As there is a paucity of previous studies examining discharge planning in critical care nursing knowledge about the phenomena is consequently limited.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Background. </jats:bold> The study reported here is part of a larger study exploring critical care nurses’ perceptions and understanding of the discharge planning process in the health care system in the state of Victoria, Australia. While a number of different discharge planning models are reported in the literature there is no agreement on the most effective or the most efficient model.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Design. </jats:bold> An exploratory descriptive research design was used for this study.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods. </jats:bold> A total of 502 Victorian critical care nurses were approached to take part in the study. A total of 218 participants completed the survey, which represented a nett response rate of 43·4%. The data from the questionnaire were entered into the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) Base 10.0. This allowed calculation of descriptive statistics and statistical analysis using chi‐square test for goodness‐of‐fit.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results. </jats:bold> While just over half the participants reported that the discharge planning process in their unit was co‐ordinated by a combination of personnel that included a nurse, just under half the participants believed that this was an appropriate model. Another key finding was of those participants who worked in critical care units using primary nursing, just over half responded that the bedside nurse/primary nurse co‐ordinated the discharge planning process while just under half responded that a combination of health care team members, including a nurse, co‐ordinated the process. Overall there was little support for the designated discharge planning nurse to co‐ordinate the process.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions. </jats:bold> The findings presented here suggest critical care nurses need to examine who has the ultimate responsibility of co‐ordinating the critical care patient's discharge plan irrespective of the nursing model employed within the critical care ward. There is the need to ensure that when discharge planning becomes everybody's responsibility it ultimately does not become no‐one's responsibility.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Relevance to clinical practice. </jats:bold> If discharge planning practices are to be changed with the introduction of new discharge planning models in the critical care environment then it is important not only to know current practice but also the perceptions of critical care nurses in terms of who they believe should co‐ordinate the discharge planning process.</jats:p>",

Win–loss outcomes followed offers favoring only one child and arguments over older siblings' plans.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inverse planning in external beam radiotherapy often requires a scalar objective function that incorporates importance factors to mimic the planner's preferences between conflicting objectives. Defining those importance factors is not straightforward, and frequently leads to an iterative process in which the importance factors become variables of the optimization problem. In order to avoid this drawback of inverse planning, optimization using algorithms more suited to multiobjective optimization, such as evolutionary algorithms, has been suggested. However, much inverse planning software, including one based on simulated annealing developed at our institution, does not include multiobjective‐oriented algorithms. This work investigates the performance of a modified simulated annealing algorithm used to drive aperture‐based intensity‐modulated radiotherapy inverse planning software in a multiobjective optimization framework. For a few test cases involving gastric cancer patients, the use of this new algorithm leads to an increase in optimization speed of a little more than a factor of 2 over a conventional simulated annealing algorithm, while giving a close approximation of the solutions produced by a standard simulated annealing. A simple graphical user interface designed to facilitate the decision‐making process that follows an optimization is also presented.</jats:p>",

These models produce coefficients which can then be applied to socioeconomic data at the local scale. As an example we outline a model of the determinants of volunteering. This indicates significant variation between places in the relationship between individual and area characteristics which influence the probability of volunteering. Then we proceed to show how this can be used to generate predictions of the variations between places in a number of aspects of the social environment. The estimates we produce are validated against survey data from other surveys, and a satisfactory degree of correlation is obtained, giving us confidence in the estimates we have produced. </jats:p>",

The frequency of visits to green amenities was analyzed in relation to detailed spatial data based on sociodemographic variables. The findings indicated that, although people tend to make more use of green space if it is available in the vicinity, a brown (more urban) residential environment does not result in compensation behaviour. An explanation for this may be self-selection in the residential-choice process. It is conceivable, however, that some of the people who do not live in a green neighbourhood but would prefer to do so will move to a more suburban or rural environment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Our purpose in this paper is to conceptualize and demonstrate an integrated analytical method for using both qualitative and quantitative data through geographic information systems (GIS) and ethnography. We acknowledge that the use of both types of data has been possible in GIS for some time, particularly for representation purposes. However, a recursive integration of different forms of data at the analysis level has been less explored and minimally theorized. Drawing on recent work in critical GIS and feminist perspectives, we suggest that visualization offers a strong technique for this effort but we approach it from the analytical base of grounded theory. Thus, we present an example of how grounded theory and visualization might be used together to construct an integrated analysis strategy that is both iterative and reflexive, both contextual and conceptual. We use Knigge's work on community gardens in Buffalo, New York, to provide a substantive example of the proposed methods. </jats:p>",

Increasingly, users have access to hundreds or thousands of machines at once and wish to utilize those resources concurrently. To provide a reasonable user experience, such systems must provide an effective, scalable scheduling system. Unfortunately, the great majority of job schedulers are centralized and many do not scale well to thousands or even hundreds of nodes. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper we study how distributed scheduling systems can be designed most effectively; we focus on the problem of selecting an optimal arrangement of schedulers, or a deployment, for hierarchically organized systems. We show that the optimal deployment is a complete spanning d-ary tree; this result conforms with results from the scheduling literature. More importantly, we present an approach for determining the optimal degree d for the tree. To test our approach, we use DIET, a middleware system that uses hierarchical schedulers. We develop detailed performance models for DIET and validate these models in a real-world environment. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach selects deployments that are near-optimal in practice. </jats:p>",

We partition the free space into star-shaped regions such that a single point, called the guard, can see every point in the star-shaped region. The resulting set of guards capture the intra-region connectivity—the connectivity between points belonging to the same star-shaped region. We capture the inter-region connectivity by computing connectors that link guards of adjacent regions. The guards and connectors are combined to obtain the star-shaped roadmap. We present an efficient algorithm to compute the roadmap in a deterministic manner without explicit computation of the free space. We show that the star-shaped roadmap captures the connectivity of the free space, thereby enabling us to perform complete motion planning. Our approach is relatively simple to implement. We apply our approach to perform motion planning of robots with translational and rotational degrees of freedom (dof). We highlight its performance in challenging scenarios with narrow passages or when there is no collision-free path for robots with low degrees of freedom. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographical information systems (GIS) are increasingly used in England and Wales as a tool to monitor crime and aid community-safety planning. This is despite the widely known limitations of police-recorded data on crime victimisation, and concerns about the quality and specificity of available data on fear of crime. Meanwhile, improving streetlighting is a popular strategy both for improving community safety and for reducing fear of crime. In this paper we report on research carried out in Northumberland, northeast England, which aimed to identify locations most in need of new streetlighting. First, GIS crime hotspot maps and lighting coverage maps were analysed to identify potential areas to target. Qualitative rapid appraisal techniques were then used in these areas to explore local residents' perceptions and understandings of the relationships between streetlighting, victimisation, and fear of crime. The qualitative data were used to interpret the hotspot maps further, and to inform the location and type of streetlighting interventions. The research demonstrates that people's experiences of crime and fear, and their understandings of the relationships these have to streetlighting, are complex and reflective. At most, streetlighting was held to have a marginal and even then contradictory influence on the problems of crime and fear that people face. The implications are considered. We conclude that qualifying the outputs of GIS mapping was essential in this case, and has wide potential in critical policy research to promote more inclusive knowledge and more effective decisionmaking. </jats:p>",

This paper, using a sample case study within an organization, shows how different versions of ELECTRE methods can be used in choosing efficient strategies that account for both human behavioral resistance and technical elements. The effect of resistance from each subsystem of the organization is studied to ensure the reliability of the chosen strategy. The comparison of results from a select number of compensatory and noncompensatory models (ELECTRE I, III, IV, IS; TOPSIS; SAW; MaxMin) suggests that when employee resistance is a decision factor in the multicriteria strategic planning problem, the models can yield low-resistance strategies; however, ELECTRE seems to show more reasonable sensitivity.</jats:p>",

National guidelines restricted the development of large‐scale retail locations on peripheral sites. Considering this restrictive planning ideology since the 1970s, the recent proposal to deregulate and decentralise retail planning came as a surprise and caused great controversy. Dutch retailers in particular raised their voices. They feared a disruption of the hierarchical retail system, following the removal of national restrictions on peripheral developments. The policy goal to preserve city centres seemed to disappear but returned when the national government and provincial authorities decided to reregulate retail planning. This paper analyses shifting retail planning ideologies in the Netherlands and reflects on the strength and persistence of city centre preservation within these shifts.</jats:p>",

At the time, however, only a single drilling slot was available on the platform; thus, dictating that only one well bore could be drilled to tap both reservoirs. Further complicating the problem was the fact that the drilling rig which discovered the horizons would be moving to a new platform a short 5 weeks after it was understood by reservoir engineers, geologists and geophysicists that multiple horizontal well candidates existed.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper chronicles the rapid processes that took place to evaluate, plan and execute the first multilateral well in the Gulf of Thailand.

From this we discuss lessons learned that may be universally applicable when rapidly expanding the use of technology in a remote region of the world (regardless of how small that expansion is).</jats:p>",

This procedure drastically reduces patient office time, surgical treatment time, and the degree of post‐treatment recovery. Patients with an edentulous arch or a partially edentulous area had a denture with radiopaque markers constructed for computed tomography (CT) scans of the appropriate jaw. The CT images, having acquisition slices of 0.4 mm, are transposed in a three‐dimensional image‐based program for planning and strategic placement of dental implants. After virtual implant placement on the computer, the surgical treatment plan is sent to a manufacturing facility for construction of the surgical template. The manufactured surgical components and surgical template arrive on the clinical site. From the surgical template, the dental laboratory retro‐engineers the master cast, articulates it with the opposing dentition based on a duplicate of the scanning denture, and creates the prosthesis. Using the surgical template, minimally invasive surgery is performed without a flap, and the prosthesis is delivered, achieving immediate functional loading to the implants. Minor occlusal adjustments are made. The total surgical treatment time required is typically between 30 and 60 minutes. Postoperative symptoms such as pain, swelling, and inflammation are dramatically reduced.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</jats:title><jats:p>Identification of the bone in relationship to the tooth position via three‐dimensional CT prior to surgery allows the clinician to precisely place implants.

Public officials have been warned that H5N1 may mutate into a strain that is not only highly pathogenic but also readily transmissible between humans.

Because of this, community leaders, public health officials, and responders at planning and management levels face one of their most challenging problems: planning and preparing for pandemic influenza. Recently, an initiative at the Center for Domestic Preparedness was undertaken to assemble a training program for community leaders and senior responders that will address the current threat of a pandemic, outline an appropriate response to the problem, and exercise small planning teams using a tabletop model.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>▪ Abstract  Species extinctions and the deterioration of other biodiversity features worldwide have led to the adoption of systematic conservation planning in many regions of the world. As a consequence, various software tools for conservation planning have been developed over the past twenty years. These tools implement algorithms designed to identify conservation area networks for the representation and persistence of biodiversity features. Budgetary, ethical, and other sociopolitical constraints dictate that the prioritized sites represent biodiversity with minimum impact on human interests. Planning tools are typically also used to satisfy these criteria. This chapter reviews both the concepts and technical choices that underlie the development of these tools. Conservation planning problems can be formulated as optimization problems, and we evaluate the suitability of different algorithms for their solution. Finally, we also review some key issues associated with the use of these tools, such as computational efficiency, the effectiveness of taxa and abiotic parameters at choosing surrogates for biodiversity, the process of setting explicit targets of representation for biodiversity surrogates, and dealing with multiple criteria. The review concludes by identifying areas for future research, including the scheduling of conservation action over extensive time periods and incorporating data about site vulnerability.</jats:p>",
