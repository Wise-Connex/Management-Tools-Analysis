Due to this structure, the major computational work required by the homogeneous self-dual interior-point method can be split into three steps, each of which is highly decomposable. Numerical results on some randomly generated problems and a multistage production-planning problem are reported. </jats:p>",

Structural trends identified and applied to porosity Modeling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The uncertainties considered were the structure, the fluid contacts, the continuity of the facies &amp; RRTs, petrophysical properties and variograms ranges.

Many cases were built and pre-ranked using the geological knowledge translated in a set of parameters to cover the uncertainty range.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Ranking of models was done by progressively analyzing the cases/ scenarios considered. Initially, inconsistent scenarios/ cases were discarded. In other words, those that did not comply with the data distribution expected and/or the spatial distribution and consistency with the conceptual geological models are discarded. The weight of each criterion in the decision that leads to abandon a particular case or scenario varies according to the variable modeled.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The final phase involved ranking the different models using body connectivity and volumetrics. The ranking was divided in sets where one variable was considered and others added progressively until all the variables were taken into account, including structure and fluid contacts uncertainty.

We conducted a blinded, randomised, controlled trial to assess the benefit of online teaching on students' ability to administer drugs in a simulated critical incident scenario, during which they were scored on their ability to administer drugs in solution presented as a ratio (adrenaline) or percentage (lidocaine). Forty‐eight final year medical students were invited to participate; 44 (92%) attended but only nine of the 20 students (45%) directed to the extra teaching viewed it. Nevertheless, the teaching module significantly improved the students' ability to calculate the correct volume of lidocaine (p = 0.005) and adrenaline (p = 0.0002), and benefited each student's overall performance (p <jats:italic>=</jats:italic> 0.0007). Drug administration error is a very major problem and few interventions are known to be effective. We show that focusing on better teaching at medical school may benefit patient safety.</jats:p>",
