Each student is assigned to a role as Senior Scientist, Researcher, or Technician based on their letter of application, resume, and personal interview. Students are assigned to research groups and participate in a project feasibility study and in writing the resulting proposal. The assembly of apparatus, data taking, and data analysis proceed as in the usual project laboratory. At the end of the semester each student writes a section of the final report and presents a 10-min technical talk. The instructor and the assisting graduate student assume the roles of President/Chief Consultant and Vice President/Associate Consultant/Stockroom Man, respectively.</jats:p>",
