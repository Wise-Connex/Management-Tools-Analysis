The problem is a complex one and as such there is still some gap in our knowledge and also between the experimental results and ryots' field practico. From 1914 to 1950, there have been 38 exporiments in repre- sontativo sugarcane tracts of this State on manuring sugarcane. Of these, 16 were at Anakapalie, 8 at Samalkot, 8 at Palur and 6 at Gudiyattam. In spite of the large number of experiments laid out, the quantitative knowledge in respect of manuring the crop is not advanced very much. The results of experiments recorded year after year aro so vary- ing that conclusions based on three-year data have been of only qualitative value. Further, the results of these experiments were not tested in ryots' fields and therefore are not very helpful in extension service. It is therefore desirable to critically roview the manurial experiments, to detect the causes for the fluctuating results recorded and to explore the possibilities of better technique for future experiments.</jats:p>"

Rice, which is the staple food crop of the area, occupies 81% of the total extent and makes up 68% of the total normal output of the Madras State; and the district continues to depend on imported food grains. Within the district the southern zone grows 69 50% of the total area under paddy, while the Palghat taluk alone contributes 26.60% of the total production in the district. Vast stretches of fertile paddy lands exist in Palghat taluk in contiguous blocks. The soil is red loam in most parts, the rainfall is fairly well-distributed and the area is benefited by both the monsoons during normal years. The terrain is fairly plain in comparison with the rest of the district, and there is a well-knit system of roads touching all villages and the ryots are comparatively progressive and responsive to all major improvements. Owing to these natural advantages, all pioneering work on improvements recommended by the department, have been tried here.</jats:p>"
