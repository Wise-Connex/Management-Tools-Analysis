The programs planned according to the PPM are found to have more efficient services and greater community acceptance during their first year of implementation than the programs that were developed with the conventional planning process. Due to the absence of random assignments, it is not demonstrated that these results are due to planning processes alone. However, evidence is presented that suggests the PPM projects outperformed the non-PPM projects because implementation success correlates with five key dimensions of planning behavior. Implementation success increases with: (1) participation of citizens, experts, and community interest groups; (2) involvement of a policy board representing partisan interests; (3) greater and more equal distribution of planning team effort; (4) process consultation in early planning phases; and (5) fewer deviations from the PPM procedural model in allphases of planning. The implications of this research for theory and practice will be discussed in a companion Part II of this article. </jats:p>",

The system comprises a network of activities with supporting cost, time and resource data. Together, the network and activity data form the project plan, which subsequently becomes the tool for controlling the project execution. By linking the plan to an economics package, the planned execution is optimized. Other applications of the system became apparent during the course of development and, as a result of using the system, project costs have been reduced and confidence in attainment of schedules has increased. A system of this kind is considered essential for successful execution of future major projects.</jats:p>",

BP and Statoil (Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap) each hold a 50 % interest in the licence. As part of the planning for drilling on the block a feasibility study was undertaken in July 1977 to evaluate the requirements for a deep test well. This well was required to investigate the potential hydrocarbon bearing Jurassic sandstones below 5200 m. The study drew on the experience gained on other deep high pressured wells drilled by BP in the UK sector and evaluated other regional data.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper discusses the planning required for a deep high pressure well. The casing design required to contain the expected pressures resulted in the need for a drilling unit having a high deck load capacity and pressure control equipment with a 15000 psi working pressure rating.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first well in Norwegian Block 30/4 was drilled between November 1978 and May 1979 and achieved its objective, at the same time becoming the deepest well in the North Sea at 5454 m.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>During drilling of the high pressure wells in the British and Norwegian sectors of the Northern North Sea problems have occurred which required solutions that deviated slightly from the planned programme.

The physical planning system in England has undergone another process of change in the last decade: a growing flexibility manifested in the change from ‘development plans’, which are binding plans, to ‘structure plans’ that present only general principles of planning to be taken into consideration by planning authorities when granting building permits. Thus the following question presents itself: Are the two processes of change in the area of physical planning related to each other? Is the rising amount of bargaining with planning authorities due to the growing flexibility in the physical planning system; or is the rising bargaining in the area of physical planning, as J. Jowell suggests, due mainly to a more general phenomenon of increasing corporatism in English politics; or to both of them? To put it in more general terms: Is the increase in bargaining within the functioning of the physical planning system related to factors internal to the physical planning system or external to it?</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the early 1970s, it has been realized that rapid economic development in developing countries leads to an acute inequality in income distribution. To prevent massive dissatisfaction among their citizens, developing countries were urged to achieve economic growth (particularly industrial growth) with distribution of income as their development goal. A good way of promoting growth and dispersal of industrial activities is the establishment of industrial estates in the locations where such activities are desired. This paper formulates the problem of optimal development of industrial estates, with the incorporation of specified minimum levels of development in poverty (priority) sites as distributive targets, as encountered by a Malaysian state government. The linear programming problem so formulated is then shown to be equivalent to a transportation problem, enabling it to be solved and parametically analyzed efficiently. Computational results, obtained using real-life data, show that the subsidy incurred in fulfilling the distributive targets is small compared to the total revenue generated. This justifies the imposition of the distributive targets on the development process. Further, the optimal policy was found to involve decisions to be taken in the initial years of the planning horizon that are fairly insensitive to variation in demand and cost parameters, thereby demonstrating the relative “goodness” of the optimal policy for industrial estate development in the state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent increases in energy prices have drawn attention to the importance of developing an integrated approach to energy sector planning, in contrast to the prevailing practice of uncoordinated planning in different energy sub‐sectors. Integrated national energy planning (INEP) requires a clear definition of national objectives, in relation to which links between the energy sector, and activities in each individual sub‐sector, may be analysed. Policy tools for achieving national goals include physical controls, technical methods, education and propaganda, and pricing. Use of these tools must be coordinated. The INEP procedure, which leads to an energy master plan, consists of several steps: determining the socio‐economic background, supply and demand analysis, energy balance, and policy formulation. Initially INEP may be carried out at a relatively simple level, and later as data and analytical capabilities improve more sophisticated computerized modelling techniques could be implemented. The institutional structure should be rationalized by setting up a central energy authority (CEA) or ministry of energy (MOE), with its principal focus on energy planning and policy formulation.</jats:p><jats:p>Les récentes hausses des prix de l'énergie ont révélé</jats:p><jats:p>l'importance de l'élaboration d'une approche intégrée de la planification du secteur de l'énergie contrastant avec les pratiques courantes de planification non coordonnée qui existent dans les différents sous‐secteurs de l'énergie.

Les contrôles directs, les méthodes techniques, l'enseignement, la publicité et la fixation des prix sont au nombre des moyens d'action dont dispose une telle politique pour parvenir aux objectifs nationaux. La procedure de la PNIE qui conduit â l'élaboration d'un plan‐cadre en matière d'énergie comprend plusieurs étapes: détermination du contexte socio‐économique, analyse de l'offre et de la demande, bilan énergétique et formulation politique. Dans une première étape, la PNIE peut être effectuée à un niveau relativement élémentaire et par la suite, au fur et à mesure que les donnés et les méthodes d'analyse s'améliorent, des techniques informatiques plus avancées en matiére d'établissement de modèlas pourraient étre utilisées.

This paper investigates a number of possible conditions under which flows regulated by the spatial interaction model might be observed to be intransitive. A singly constrained gravity model is calibrated for a number of flow tables, and distorted by sampling error, by aggregation over strata, and by an independently distributed error term. Only the last distortion gives the correct bias in the relative abundance of intransitivities in numerical flows and flow probabilities. This conclusion is supported by further simulations using random spatial interaction models. The results of the calibrations of the spatial interaction model using US interstate migration flows, 1935–1970, are given and compared with others previously published. </jats:p>",

Major findings were that the workers, although favorable in general to induced abortion as expected are often unfavorable under certain circumstances, differ somewhat from the public they serve, and do not espouse views in consonance with existing laws. Furthermore, cumulative ethical judgment scales are shown to exist which could have important program implications. Recommendations for educational activity are made. </jats:p>",

The functional–spatial model is a two-level system. At the microlevel, random links are incorporated between the elements of the system, and at the macrolevel, deterministic links are incorporated between the subsystems. To construct the macrolevel an entropy maximisation approach is used. Most attention is paid to the structural analysis of the macrolevel which is constructed as a system with a stochastic hierarchy structure. Characterisations of stochastic hierarchy are introduced and the methodology of their use in the creation of the functional–spatial model is explained. Possible applications of the model in the analysis of urban spatial structure are explored. </jats:p>",

The property boom 1971–1973 and its collapse are discussed in the context of Zeeman's cusp catastrophe theory. Results of econometric experiments show that the interpretation of these events in terms of catastrophic switches is not entirely satisfactory, but that changes in money supply and credit availability may be more likely causes of the boom. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the use of these techniques as management tools, political strategies and ritualistic symbols using concepts discussed in the organizational theory, planning and control, and policy science literatures. Two basic conclusions emerge from the evaluation. First, PPB, MBO and ZBB may inappropriately encourage the use of an analytical, computational decision strategy, and a cost/benefit method of performance assessment at a level within the organization and in environmental settings which call for an inspirational decision strategy and social test performance assessment. As a result, environmental variety may not be matched by an organizational response which is equally variable.</jats:p><jats:p>Secondly, PPB, MBO and ZBB may have been used more as political strategies and ritualistic symbols for controlling and directing controversy by both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. Federal government and less as management tools for improving decision making within the U.S. Federal bureaucracy. These management tools give the appearance of rationality in the formulation of public policy which is consistent with man's need for confidence building and conflict avoidance in running the affairs of state.</jats:p>",

A wetland is more than an organic mat ‐ it is an element in a larger hydrogeologic system. Three distinct but related effects of wetlands are: modifying the character of runoff from a basin, influencing the discharge/recharge relationship with the underlying aquifer, and effecting the potential for ground water development in a wetland dominated basin. An important goal of wetland research is to define the diverse roles that wetlands play in the regional hydrology and to define the geologic, hydrologic, and topographic factors that will allow meaningful distinctions among wetlands. Geologic and hydrologic factors include character and thickness of surficial materials; bedrock type; hydrologic position; permeability of organic layer; transmissivity, quality, and hydrologic connection of wetland related aquifers; ground water outflow; and depth of standing water. Topographic factors are position in the drainage basin, relative size, and absolute size of wetlands. A wetland classification to aid hydrologists and land use planners is proposed using selected factors involving hydrologic position, topographic position, and geologic type.</jats:p>",
