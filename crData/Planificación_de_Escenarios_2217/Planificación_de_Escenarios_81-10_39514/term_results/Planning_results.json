In the last decade or so public authorities of many kinds have engaged in strategic policy making or planning. The practice has become regarded as a proper part of management responsibility. Planning units have been established in many organisations, systematic procedures for strategic monitoring and review have been widely produced. The practice of strategic planning has become sufficiently widespread and sufficiently significant in the public sector to enable and merit some examination.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The concept of strategy, and the distinction between it and tactics, is military in its origin and developed through the 19th century. The most widely accepted military definition is that strategy is the means of bringing forces into contact with the enemy while tactics is the means of defeating him in battle.</jats:p>",

In most cases they have taken place late in the planning process, quite close to the realization of a plan. Forms of action have been used which quickly get publicity and engage new members through e.g. strikes, demonstrations and occupations. These methods are often unacceptable to the politicians in the planning process and confrontations are unavoidable. The purpose of this article is to discuss methods of how to identify and encourage citizen participation in physical planning. The pilot area for the research project is southwestern Skåne, mainly the Kävlinge river basin with the Vomb lake, a controversial area as regards land and water use.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> </jats:p>",

That is, it tried to pool its resources and channel them for development with the aim of improving the standard of living of the population.The first experience in development planning was the five-year plan 1963-1968. The total expenditure for this plan was LD. 290 million (about $ 812 million). The bulk of the expenditure (about 59%) went to developing the infrastructure. A second five year plan was prepared in 1969, but it was never implemented because a revolution took place at that time. That plan was re-evaluated and a three-year plan 1973-75 was carried out instead. The allocations for this plan amounted to LD. 1965 million (about $ 6563 million). A large portion of the development expenditure (about 42%) went to agriculture and industry. For the main objectives of the plan were to stimulate domestic production and achieve more equitable distribution of income among the population.</jats:p>"

The increased activities of the state within that area are examined, and it is pointed out that it is primarily the local state which carries out these activities. This in turn results in a basically local orientation of the movements. In an attempt to evaluate the political perspective of the movements we analyse the development of the factors – including collective consumption – which have caused their appearance, and at which they are aimed. We also deal with the development of the framework within and against which the movements struggle. This includes the local state and the relationship between the local and central states. </jats:p>",

A prerequisite for answering such questions is a theoretical understanding of the relationship of planning to social totality, i.e. to basic political, social, economic and ideological conditions. Capital-logic and ‘structure-logic’ theories of social structure and development offer frameworks for analysis. Both, however, lead to functionalist explanations, and imply mechanical determinism.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>SUMMARY</jats:bold> It is argued that even the most elaborate social surveys in the development field are one‐sided, in that they answer their sponsors' questions, and not those of the people surveyed. Rapid Rural Appraisal has no methodological sophistication in which to cloak this one‐sidedness. This is no disadvantage, however, for not only does RRA focus attention on an important problem, it also provides the means to solve it. Several ‘quick and dirty’ surveys are possible for the price of, and in the time taken by, one ‘long and clean’ survey. The opportunity is thus opened up for a more ‘interactive’ style of applied social research, incorporating a diversity of political feedback at the earliest possible stage in the development planning process.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESUMEN</jats:bold> <jats:bold>Valoración del método de evaluación: en camino hacia un diálogo más intenso sobre la planificación rural</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>Se aducen argumentos que tienden a mostrar la unilateralidad de las investigaciones sociales en el campo de desarrollo, por muy cuidadosas que sean. Los métodos que se emplean para la Rápida Evaluación Rural carecen de complicaciones que justifiquen esta unilateralidad. Sin embargo, esto no constituye una desventaja porque la Rápida Evaluación Rural no se limita a concentrar la atención sobre un problema importante, sino que aporta los medios para resolverlo. En el mismo espacio de tiempo que se tarda en realizar una investigación ‘detenida y clara’ se pueden llevar a cabo, por el mismo coste, varías ‘apresuradas y embarulladas’. Así es como se presenta la oportunidad de introducir un estilo de actividades más ‘interdependientes’ de investigación social aplicada, en el que se incluya una diversidad de reacciones políticas a la acción llevada a cabo a partir del mismo instante en que comience el proceso de planificación del desarrollo.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESUME</jats:bold> <jats:bold>Une évaluation des évaluations: vers l'amélioration du dialogue dans la planification</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>On estime que les enquêtes sur le développement, si élaborées soientelles, témoignent d'un parti‐pris. Elles répondent aux questions de leurs organisateurs, non à celles des personnes concernées. L'évaluation rurale rapide possède une méthodologie trop simple pour dissimuler ce partipris. Ce n'est d'ailleurs pas un inconvénient: lorsqu'elle attire l'attention sur un problème important, elle fournit également les moyens de le surmonter. Plusieurs enquêtes rapides et rudimentaires sont possibles pour le prix d'une enquête longue et complexe. Ainsi peut naître un mode plus ‘interactif’ de recherche sociale appliquée, tenant compte des réactions dès les premières étapes du processus de planification du développement.</jats:p>",

A review of the basis for forcasts show that they will contain considerable uncertainty throughout the time period of greatest importance in planning. Much of the discrepancy between early forecasts and actual production is so far found to be caused by development time overruns. Special procedures are developed to adjust the results of lengthy rigorous procedures to late incoming information on development and operation. Further improvement in development forecasting is sought through the use of empirical data and assessment of the quality of development plans.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Although there is room for improving the accuracy of forecasts, it is essential to recognize their elements of uncertainty. A procedure is therefore proposed to compile the effects on production of quantified uncertainties in start of production, production build-up, peak rate and production decline performance.</jats:p>",

Both water quantity and water quality parameters of various sources of flows are considered. Wastewater from all use sectors, along with freshwater, can be considered as candidate sources or origins of water. The model considers the capacity expansion of treatment facilities and allows for economies of scale in treatment and transportation through the use of nonlinear objective functions. Either the large‐scale generalized reduced gradient or the successive linear programing methods can be used to obtain solutions to the models. Both single‐period and multiperiod models are applied to a region including San Antonio, Texas. The single‐period model was applied to planning scenarios for the years 1980, 2000, and 2030. The multiperiod model was applied using a planning horizon consisting of three periods, 1980–2000, 2000–2030, and 2030–2060. Comparisons were made of the single‐period model applications and the multiperiod applications. The solution of a sequence of single‐period problems does not correctly represent the dynamic nature of the systems.</jats:p>",

Subsequent to the Eastern Ghat orogeny (1400-1600 m.y.), faulting in Mesozoic was the major tectonic event recorded in the Indian Peninsula.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Eastern Ghat terrain was subjected to uninterrupted planation in the intervening period. The attainment of a clear macro-relief instead of a featureless plain (peneplain) is visualised as a consequence. This macro-relief, possibly modified to some extent due to Mesozoic faulting, after attaining stability and with the onset of monsoonal climate in upper Cretaceous promoted the process of residual chemical weathering. Chemical leaching was accentuated and optimised during Upper Tertiary-Quaternary period when there was copious rainfall with less of evapo-transpiration, resulting in thick bauxitic duricrusts. This view is at variance with the concept of an once extensive residuum formed at lower levels and what are now seen at high altitudes are their erosional relics, owing their elevation and discontinuous nature to post-residuum uplift followed by denudation. As the gibbsitic duricrusts formed insitu have not been disturbed later, an in-depth study of their geomorphic characteristics, especially the slope morphology, assumes added relevance as it aids geological prognosis of the behaviour of the pay zone in terms of grade and thickness fluctuations. Once the geomorphic evolution of the duricrusts has been logically reconstructed, a conceptual approach instead of a regular grid for exploration planning is considered more pragmatic not only for acquiring a geologic grip but also in minimising exploration costs.</jats:p>",

By means of a hermeneutic framework, the spatial integration of the United States economy is interpreted in terms of the structure and application of laws adjudicated by the Supreme Court. Emphasis is placed, in particular, upon the substantive aspects of law which have provided the conditions for national economic growth. It is argued that spatial integration can be derived as an outcome from earlier debates between competing classes of the revolutionary era and from an agreement between these classes that the basic unit of American society would be the individual. However, it is also shown that control of the state by the ruling class also enabled the implementation of a policy of spatial integration as part of an overall agenda of national economic development. Evidence in support of this interpretation is drawn from Supreme Court decisions relating, for example, to the Commerce Clause and relative legal autonomy of the local state. </jats:p>",

Findings on local motivations for use of land-use controls suggest that such policies are adopted to protect private and public consumption levels of residents and thus insure reproduction of social relations. However, constraints on development policy, deriving from historical conditions of urbanization and configuration of the local economic base; development policies of neighboring jurisdictions; and past development policies in a locality, are important factors shaping land-development policy of the local state. </jats:p>",

Data required about the rural sector are usually considerable and relatively costly to obtain; this area receives particular attention. The search for useful principles proceeds from the economics of information via Karl Popper's principle of error reduction and the use of information cybernetics in public decision‐making to the design of more cost‐effective models of development processes and the significance of alternative hierarchical administrative structures for the utility obtained from primary data. These components are combined into a unified logical framework. An integrated approach to management information is identified as a desirable adjunct for its application in practice.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESUMEN</jats:bold> <jats:bold>Un marco teórico para los procedimientos de evaluación con economí de datos y algunas aplicaciones a la planificación del desarrollo rural</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>El propósito de esta disertación es el de construir un marco general que ayude a aumentar la utilidad y reducir los costos relativos a la reunión de datos de información, con vistas a la toma de decisiones de carácter público, en lo tocante al desarrollo de los países con pocos ingresos.

A continuación, se buscan principios de útil aplicación, comenzando por el de economía de la información, el de reducción de errores de Karl Popper y el empleo de la informática en la toma de decisiones en el sector público, seguidos por el planteamiento de modelos de procesos de desarrollo más eficaces en cuanto a costos y por la importancia que pudieran tener unas estructuras administrativas jerárquicas de carácter diferente para la utilidad que se obtuviese de los datos primarios.

It also computes a marginal profitability index for each project. Comparison of these indices suggests ways in which effort might profitably be re‐allocated among projects.</jats:p>",

Because of the potential for detrimental downstream effects, storm water management policies often require downstream effects to be evaluated. Such evaluation requires the design engineer to collect additional topographic and land use data and make costly hydrologic analyses. Thus, a method, which is easy to apply and which would indicate whether or not a detailed hydrologic analysis of downstream impacts is necessary, should decrease the average cost of storm water management designs. A planning method that does not require either a large data base or a computer is presented. The time co‐ordinates of runoff hydrographs are estimated using the time‐of‐concentration and the SCS runoff curve number; the discharge coordinates are estimated using a simple peak discharge equation. While the planning method does not require a detailed design of the detention basin, it does provide a reasonably accurate procedure for evaluating whether or not the installation of a detention basin will cause adverse downstream flooding.</jats:p>",
