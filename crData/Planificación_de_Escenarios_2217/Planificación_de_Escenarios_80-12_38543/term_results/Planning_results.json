This study focuses on the aggregate production and inventory planning problem of a contractor whose existing inventory policy for leaves was not based on any systematic analysis. The suggested inventory model resulted in significant cost savings. His plan for increasing production is compared with other alternatives, and it is shown that marginal profit can be increased by adopting a different production plan. </jats:p>",

Short-range capacity planning is concerned with identification of computer and communication resources which will reach saturation levels in the near future. The initial step in the short-range planning process is to evaluate the performance of the user's current system configuration and one or more configuration enhancements with respect to their effectiveness in supporting a projected workload. Central to long-range planning is the evaluation of a broader range of architectural alternatives, including various distributed processing design. In both short range and long range planning, system modeling is a basic tool for evaluating alternatives. An analytic network of queues model has been developed to reflect both centralized and hierarchically distributed network architectures. The application of the tool as part of the short-range case study is described.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract. </jats:bold> This paper examines the process of planning a program and assigning priorities in the Canada Counciľs support of scholarship and research. This requires a differentiation of claims on the Counciľs resources. The primary basis of this categorization was the nature of the activity for which support was requested. Although other bases of differentiation entered into the administration of the program ‐ the characteristics of the claimants, the kinds of expenditure for which subsidies were sought, the academic disciplines and the content of the proposed research ‐ they were found to be unsuitable for program planning and the allocation of resources. Once claims were categorized, the simplest way to define priorities was to identify which kinds of claims would be considered and which were excluded, with an undertaking to meet all of the former that passed a test of quality. From 1965 to 1969 the Council relied heavily on this approach, both because it offered the clearest statement of priorities and because it was thought to provide the greatest stimulus to research and graduate studies. But from 1969 on, with its appropriation virtually frozen, the Council resorted increasingly to a more sophisticated approach which ascribed controlled allotments to a growing range of program elements and manipulated the response to claims in each category to keep within the bounds of the allotments. The move to establish a new council for the humanities and social sciences, which would be subject to the budgetary and financial controls of the government, accelerated this transition by jeopardizing the financial flexibility on which the Canada Council had relied in treating the adjustment of priorities as an integral and continuous part of its program administration.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire. </jats:bold> .ľauteur de cet article examine le processus de planification ďun programme et ďétablissement de priorités en ce qui concerne le soutien que le Conseil des Arts accorde àľérudition et à la recherche. Ceci demande, tout ďabord, de trier les demandes ďaide au Conseil. Cette première catégorisation a été basée sur la nature de ľactivité pour laquelle une subvention était de‐mandée. Il y avait ďautres éléments de differéntiation à entrer en ligne de compte, à savoir: les caractéristiques des requérants, le genre de dépenses pour lesquelles des subsides étaient sollicités, les disciplines académiques et la teneur de la recherche proposée, mais ces éléments n'étaient pas considérés comme suffisants pour permettre la planification et ľallocation des ressources. Une fois les demandes catégorisées, la façon la plus simple de définir les priorités était ďidentifier les demandes qui seraient considérées et celles quiseraient exclues tout en s'engageant à satisfaire toutes les demandes de la première catégorie ayant réussi un test de qualité. Entre 1965 et 1969, le Conseil a principalement utilisé cette approche, à la fois parce qu'elle offrait la formulation de priorités la plus claire et fournissait, pensait‐on, un remarquable stimulant à la recherche et aux études graduées. Mais à partir de 1969, en raison de coupures budgétaires, le Conseil adopta de plus en plus une approche plus sophistiquee qui consistait à attribuer des sommes déterminées à une gamme croissante ďéléments de programme et à manipuler ľanalyse des demandes dans chaque catégorie de facon à rester dans les limites des sommes déterminées. La création ďun nouveau Conseil pour les humanités et les sciences sociales, sujet aux contrôles budgétaires et financiers du Gouverne‐ment, a accéléié cette transition en compromettant la souplesse financiére qui permettait au Conseil des Arts de traiter ľajustement des priorités comme une partie intégrate et continue de ľadministration de son programme.</jats:p>",

Recent research has focused on development of multi-level lot sizing heuristics for such systems. In this paper, we develop an optimal procedure for the multi-period, multi-product, multi-level lot sizing problem by modeling the system as a constrained generalized network with fixed charge arcs and side constraints. The network permits us to relax some of the more restrictive assumptions of previous models such as those designed for product structures with single sources or successors. </jats:p><jats:p> The solution to the resulting minimum cost flow problem yields optimal lot sizing decisions for all purchases as well as manufactured goods and components in all periods over a finite planning horizon. A simple illustration, beginning with a master production schedule and bills of material, illustrates the suitablility of this approach for modeling complex requirements planning systems. </jats:p><jats:p> Optimal solutions obtained by this method may also be useful in comparing results obtained from future heuristic approaches which may be more computationally efficient. </jats:p>",

Social factors (for example, overcrowding, owner-occupation) have often been found to be weakly related to mortality. This research reports no significant correlations between mortality and current smoke concentrations (which have mostly fallen below the WHO goal), weak correlations with sulphur dioxide levels, and fairly strong correlations with a number of social factors. The WHO goal therefore appears appropriate for smoke, and the results (including estimates of excess deaths) indicate that sulphur dioxide levels need to be reduced further.

The relationship of these factors to the planning process is discussed. Al though this project deals with hypertension, the factors identified as facili tating or hindering change are applicable to any public health program. </jats:p>",

The CASP information processing methodology is based upon Monte Carlo simulation to obtain an initial probability distribution for target location and to update this distribution to account for drift due to currents and winds. A multiple scenario approach is employed to generate the initial probability distribution. Bayesian updating is used to reflect negative information obtained from unsuccessful search. The principal output of the CASP system is a sequence of probability “maps” which display the current target location probability distributions throughout the time period of interest. CASP also provides guidance for allocating search effort based upon optimal search theory.</jats:p>",

After a general discussion of the basic properties of each approach, the detailed processes that are involved in each case are illustrated by reference to a worked example. The last section of the paper presents the findings obtained by each of these approaches as a result of empirical studies of Greater London, Merseyside, and the Netherlands. The study as a whole identifies a number of ambiguities in the existing literature which point to the need for a more rigorous examination of current methodology. They also suggest that more attention needs to be given to the role that is played by aggregation procedures as against data transformation procedures in the evaluation process. Although each user must decide which of the three methods best suits his particular purposes, the results obtained by means of the intramax procedure seem generally more readily interpretable than those obtained by either of the other two methods. </jats:p>",

This exercise has provided an encouraging example of a professional body accepting responsibility for, and monitoring, its own standards of health care, assisted with data and advice from the health authority. The Neurosurgical Society used the Commission's extensive data from the hospital morbidity data collection system. This system is briefly described. The results of this work were presented to an international symposium on head injuries. Several major problems existing in this field of neurosurgery were identified, and their various clinical and organizational aspects are being further researched, for the Society to formulate recommendations for solutions. This experience demonstrates the value of such cooperation and provides an example which could be followed by other disciplines of surgery. The need to supply the highest quality of care, the high cost of medical services, and increasing consumer interest in the outcome of treatment, indicate an increasing need for review of the results of surgical treatment. It is preferable that such a review is conducted by the profession, in cooperation with a governmental health authority, rather than by the latter body alone.</jats:p>",

Others have put forward personality traits such as ‘flair’ and ‘diplomatic style’ as the major determinants of policy unit effectiveness. Neither of these would seem to provide an adequate explanation for the Canadian experience. This paper concentrates on the profile which a policy unit might assume in any given organization. A two‐dimensional model is presented based on the degree of initiative and the degree of visibility of policy units. Against the background of the model, the experience of these units in the Canadian federal bureaucracy suggests that while most start as highly visible and proactive, they later tend toward being invisible and reactive.</jats:p><jats:p>With a view to the future, a distinction is made between the policy development function and the policy unit. If policy development and analysis is to survive, greater use must be made of a task force approach. If permanent policy units are to survive and be effective, they should adopt a modest role and profile.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire. </jats:bold> Daprks certains observateurs, le succhs des services de recherche et de planification depend de la rkceptivitk du systkme politique A la rationalitk.

Its spatial distribution became rather more even, but there were substantial spatial and temporal variations in the rate and direction of foreign-controlled employment change. Such changes were brought about by the interaction of several components of which only one—new foreign openings—has been monitored at the national level. Case studies of the foreign sector in two large metropolitan areas, however, show that similar aggregate changes may be produced by quite different combinations of components. The in situ expansion of foreign branch plants explained most of the increase in the size of the foreign sector in Merseyside.
