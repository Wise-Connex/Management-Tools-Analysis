An expectancy-value attitudinal model was developed to assess the relationship between intention to participate and (a) attitudes towards the process of public involvement, (b) subjective norms, and (c) attitudes towards possible outcomes of involvement. It was hypothesised that other attitudinal variables associated with intention to participate would be mediated through these variables. The model was tested against alternative explanatory variables including centrality, self efficacy, political efficacy, and moral norms. Regression analyses indicated that behavioural intention was best predicted by centrality, attitudes towards the process, and subjective norms. Thus the model was not wholly supported. The results are discussed in terms of the development of the theory of centrality and the roles of process and outcome in the evaluation of regional versus neighbourhood public-involvement programs. </jats:p>",

Rather than assuming that death occurs at life expectancy, probabilistic estate planning treats death as a random variable. Compounded to randomly chosen ages of death, estate assets are taxed and distributed to heirs. The purpose of probabilistic estate planning is to find the estate plan and asset/liability combination that maximizes the expected net present value of assets passing to heirs and to convey some idea of the risk associated with that estate plan.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Kick tolerance is a drilling parameter that has prompted both confusion and misunderstanding in the drilling industry, yet its importance to drilling engineers may be increasing exponentially. The increasing number of worldwide drilling catastrophes may spur government agencies to tighten controls on casing-setting-depth criteria, requiring pipe to be set once minimal kick tolerance values are reached. A thorough understanding of kick tolerance is necessary in both drilling operations and casing program design. Confusion involving kick tolerance may be attributed to the concept of zero gain, which is commonly referred to in many accepted definitions of kick tolerance. This paper presents an innovative approach to determining true kick tolerance that not only incorporates the conditions of an influx within the wellbore but also considers the possible reductions in kick tolerance caused by the circulation of that influx from the wellbore. New techniques are available for hand-held calculators, which are now more accurate in determining influx pressure and volume anywhere within the wellbore. A typical well example with illustrations describes kick tolerance and empha sizes the influence of other drilling parameters. Integration of kick-tolerance considerations into the well planning process also is dem onstrated.</jats:p>",

In this paper it is argued that technological paths are deliberately chosen and that the state, through its commitment to cold-war armament, has been a major source of demand for and underwriter of the new flexible technologies and new product lines so central to the new industrial districts phenomenon in the USA. The emergence of specific agglomerations, such as Los Angeles, Orange County, Silicon Valley, and the Boston area's Route 128, and the parallel failure of the industrial heartland cities to host military-related high-tech development, are the products of concerted locational choice and developmental efforts by military personnel, politicians, boosters, and military-industrial corporate managers, Military-led innovation has furthermore contributed to the rise of accelerated and institutionalized innovation and to the emergence of new macroeconomic pathologies, such as state debt, accelerated deindustrialization, and a worsening income distribution. </jats:p>",

As a result land has been used with increasing intensity with infill, 'town cramming' and smaller houses on less land—'rabbit hutches on postage stamps'; a destruction of the urban environment of the many to preserve a rural environment for a few. Why is the supply of land restricted? Firstly, it is suggested, because the British misapprehend the degree of urbanisation in their own country. Secondly, because rural and farming interests ensure that the planning system operates in their favour. And thirdly, and most importantly, because the planning process is tilted in favour of the existing residents of an area who seek to preserve their environment by resisting intruders. A number of suggestions are made to resolve the situation by increasing the supply of land or reducing the demand for land. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Province of Alberta's Integrated Resource Planning Program is used to provide direction for the management of public land and resources. Over the past 15 years since the Program's inception, change has occurred in personnel, processes, and deliverable products. The recent introduction of GIS technology into the Resource Planning Branch has the potential for helping professional planners undertake their activities in significantly different ways. A host of new capabilities and different methodologies may evolve from this marriage.In order to successfully implement GIS into our organization, a GIS implementation strategy has been prepared and is currently being undertaken. Our plan identifies primary goals, objectives, and specific means by which this technology transfer will occur. Of crucial importance has been the support and commitment of the Branch's management and planners. The use of a structured implementation strategy has the greatest potential for ensuring a successful incorporation of GIS into the integrated resource planning process. This paper presents details on the strategy, methods, and issues that must be addressed for a successful implementation. A review of preliminary results with respect to resource planning applications is also provided. </jats:p>",

Although sharing a common workspace, the robots are assumed to perform periodical tasks independently. The goal is to schedule the motion trajectories of the robots so as to avoid collisions among them. Rather than assigning the robots with different priorities and planning safe motion for only one robot at a time, as is done in most previous studies, an efficient method is developed that can simultaneously generate collision-free motions for the robots with or without priority assignment. Being regarded as a type of job-shop scheduling, the problem is reduced to that of finding a minimaximal path in a disjunctive graph and solved by an extension of the Balas algorithm. The superiority of this approach is demonstrated with various robot operation requirements, including “non-priority”, “with-priority”, and “multicycle” operation modes. Some techniques for speeding up the scheduling process are also presented. The planning results can be described by Gantt charts and executed by a simple “stop-and-go” control scheme. Simulation results on different robot operation modes are also presented to show the feasibility of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

The results were used to develop forest valuation methodology and in negotiations between the two parties. We also used the system to help managers develop management strategies for the 14 corporation districts, modeling forest management, harvesting, and log allocation to processing plants for the next 40 to 70 years. Before the incorporation process was concluded, the government decided to sell the state plantations to the private sector. Subsequently, the system was used to help set reserve prices and provide indicative valuations. Prospective buyers have also used the system to help them value the forests and develop bidding strategies. </jats:p>",

At the centre of the discussion are the concepts of temporality and spatiality which are broken up into their different, but related, dimensions.

It is argued here that, to date, geographers studying tourism have done so without fully grasping the fact that tourism is an important avenue of capitalist accumulation. I contend that if this weakness is rectified the geographic analysis of tourism could provide important contributions to contemporary debates in geography. In an attempt to integrate critical theory and political economy into the study of tourism, two themes are developed: the capitalistic nature of most travel and tourism production and consumption; and the contribution of tourism to the analysis of territorial competition and economic restructuring. The core of the argument presented is that the study of tourism assists us to recognise how the social meaning and materiality of space and place is created, and how these representations of place are explicitly incorporated into the accumulation process. To understand how tourism is involved in this, we need a thcorisation that recognises, and unveils, tourism as a capitalistically organised activity driven by the inherent and defining social dynamics of that system, with its attendant production, social, and ideological relations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Relationships between interest groups and the European Community have generally been regarded as more pluralist than neocorporatist in character. In part, this is because of a prevailing view of Euro interest associations as weak ‘federations of federations’, often unable to agree and act upon meaningful common positions. Evidence from the pharmaceutical industry suggests that such a blanket generalisation cannot be sustained, not least because of the commonality of regulatory experiences across member states, and prior experience of the industry in transnational political action. These have been reproduced at the EC level to the point of a Euro private interest government. There are, however, other forms of interest representation besides the ‘super federation’, and a cursory examination of one area—biotechnology—reveals the multiplicity of these. Of interest is that here it is the Euro organisations themselves rather than an aggregation of national concerns which have been of prime importance in engaging the European level, a feature of the development of biotechnology at a time of the enhanced competence of the EC in the shape of the Single European Act. This may suggest the pattern for the future in newly emerging arenas of industrial activity. Only one of the many Euro aggregations in biotechnology—a direct firm membership forum—has proved to be an effective interest outlet. What appears to be a challenge to the possibility of the existence of a neocorporatist structure through a Euro federation in fact shows the importance of Euro federations in the creation of appropriate transnational representational structures, which may develop reciprocal relationships with the Commission which are characteristic of neocorporatist patterns. The explanatory power of neocorporatist ideas in revealing the dynamics of completing the internal market should therefore not be dismissed. </jats:p>",

To illustrate this problem, we have collected published data for 214 population censuses of carnivores. We tested for a relationship between the number of individuals censused and the size of study site for our entire data set. We conducted the same test for each family, for which we obtained sufficient and qualifying census data With areas ranging from less than 10 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> to over 40,000 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>, we obtained a significant regression (p &lt; .001; r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>= 76%) for the sample as a whole. We examined the distribution of densities with increasing area and found that the relationship was not constant but decreased We noticed that numbers per census‐area size increased with a slope (m &lt; 1). We also noticed that the sizes of study areas were unevenly distributed Only 7% of the studies in our sample censused regions larger than 10,000 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>.

Over time, cast iron and steel pipe sections became weak from corrosion and are subject to failure which in turn can lead to explosions and possible injury and loss of life. Gas utilities maintain system integrity through repair‐replacement programs where pipe sections are prioritized for replacement in any given year through cost‐benefit analysis; however, the total annual amount to be budgeted for replacement is left to engineering judgment. This approach has left some utilities vulnerable to criticism that their current replacement rate on cast iron pipe is not great enough and that public safety is being compromised. This paper addresses the problem situation by formulating a linear programming replacement decision model which augments cost‐benefit analysis with explicit constraints on acceptable risk to human life from fire/explosion. The model is illustrated for a hypothetical utility.</jats:p>",

The power of the planner derives both from the \"good\" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces).

Previous work by economists on the subject of environmental pollution has largely ignored the global dimension of the problem such as characterizes the greenhouse and ozone issues, thus resulting in the absence of an appropriate property rights basis for implementing economically efficient atmospheric utilization policies. The present analysis is an attempt to fill this void and, in so doing, to construct an economic basis for global atmospheric policies. Its analytical foundation will utilize such economic concepts as public goods and bads, externalities, common property resources, and Pareto-efficiency. The study will interact with the disciplines of international law and political science because of the relevance of political institutions and property rights to the analysis. The nature of the economic demand and supply for a clean global atmosphere is examined in section 1 and in section 2 the problems inherent in international collective consumption such as occurs in the utilization of the global atmosphere are considered. In section 3 the economist's Pareto-efficiency rule is applied as a basis for international agreements in pursuit of efficient atmospheric use and in section 4 global atmospheric policy options are considered within the parameters of contemporary international social choice institutions. The creation of a sovereign international body to implement an international law of the atmosphere that is founded upon the legal premise of global property rights to the atmosphere is recommended. </jats:p>",

Two special cases—straight‐line crab walking and turning about a fixed axis—are studied first. The general case that the walking machine is following an arbitrary curve is then studied.

In this paper it is argued that this is a fallacy as responses are conditioned by the filter of political party control. With a focus on nonmetropolitan counties and metropolitan boroughs and districts, it is shown that relationships between policy variation and socioeconomic conditions vary in Conservative-dominated and Labour-dominated councils. In particular, Conservative councils respond more notably to fiscal resources, whereas Labour authorities are more responsive to service need. Examination of changes in provision show that these patterns have persisted through the 1980s. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The joint development of urban mass transit facilities and private real estate projects has become a popular practice throughout the United States. As of October 1990, 114 transit joint-development projects had been constructed in more than two dozen US cities, although the vast majority of projects have been concentrated in just five cities: New York City, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Boston. Of completed joint-development projects 58% have occurred at or near heavy-rail transit stations; another 18% of projects have been developed around commuter rail facilities. Transit joint-development activity can be classified into two basic forms: (1) revenue-sharing arrangements, and (2) cost-sharing arrangements. Of the joint-development projects completed to date, 40% have involved cost-sharing, and 25% have involved revenue-sharing. The remaining projects have involved both types. Joint-development projects have yet to generate very much income to local transit operators, either through capital contributions or through yearly lease payments. Except in New York City, capital contributions from joint development have generally amounted to less than 1% of yearly capital expenditures. This study reveals that there are four conditions necessary for successful joint-development projects. First, the local real estate market must be active and healthy. Second, the agency with the lead responsibility for pursuing joint development must have an entrepreneurial bent. Third, coordination is essential when joint-development projects involve more than one public agency. Fourth, sponsoring agencies need to understand that there are benefits to joint development that go beyond generating revenues. To date, in fact, the direct revenue benefits of joint development have been quite small. The best joint-development projects are those that encourage greater transit usage, create more interesting station environments, and reinforce other planning and development goals. </jats:p>",

His comment concerns the uses of various terminologies in the literature on supply-driven and demand-driven input—output models and the claims to have defined terms such as ‘stability’, ‘joint stability’, and ‘consistency’. Further, generalizations are made on the basis of a specific set of aggregated data for the US economy to show that biproportional changes suggested in my theorem are unlikely to be observed in the real world. I will show that Miller adds no illumination to the issues of ‘stability’ or ‘consistency’, and that, in fact, his comment accomplishes nothing of import.

The dominant UK metaphors are found to be control, coordination, and centralization, whereas those for the USA emerge as conflict, competition, and change. Enterprise Zones and Urban Development Corporations in the two countries are then examined for differences in practice, and it is concluded that differences in the societal and political meanings attributed to the two programs underscore the difficulties of cross-national transfer of development approaches. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the impact of corporate restructuring in the British building societies movement is examined as an example of the changing organisation of the financial services industry, a significant component of the service sector. It is argued that regulatory changes, which have broken down the segmented and compartmentalised nature of the financial sector, have provided the opportunity for large building societies to diversify into new markets, and this in turn has encouraged a round of innovation in the financial services industry. It is also suggested that as the building society movement has become more deeply integrated into the financial sector as a whole, this has promoted a drift in employment towards the south and east of the country and a shift back to larger urban areas in the provinces. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The clinical and radiologic records of 500 sequential patients who underwent screening sinus CT as a prelude to possible functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were reviewed in order to answer three clinical‐radiologic questions: (1) Can distinct radiologic patterns of inflammatory disease be identified on screening sinus CT (SSCT)? (2) If so, what are these radiologic patterns? (3) How do the findings seen on SSCT influence the endoscopic surgical plan? Five basic radiologic patterns of sinonasal inflammatory disease were identified among the 500‐member patient population. These were based on known patterns of mucociliary drainage correlated with obstructive patterns observed on the CT scans. These radiologic batterns included: (1) Infundibular (129 of 500 or 26%), (2) ostiomeatal unit (126 of 500 or 25%), (3) sphenoethmoidal recess (32 of 500 or 6%), (4) sinonasal polyposis (49 of 500 or 10%), and (5) sporadia (unclassifiable) (121 of 500 or 24%) patterns. Normal SSCT was seen in 133 of the 500 patients (27%). Although the ostiomeatal unit is the central feature in sinonasal inflammatory disease, obstruction of the infundibulum alone or of the sphenoethmoidal recess can cause unique inflammatory patterns of disease that require tailored FESS. The identification of sinonasal polyposis raises a different set of FESS considerations. The sporadic pattern of inflammatory disease, when identified, creates unique FESS challenges, depending on the specific sinus or sinuses involved. Assignment of these patterns to the individual case also assists in patient management by grouping patients into nonsurgical (normal CT), routine (infundibular, ostiomeatal unit, and most sporadic patterns) and complex (sinonasal polyposis and sphenoethmoidal recess) surgical groups.</jats:p>",

Results show that characteristics of entrepreneurs and their firms did not explain problems in starting up. The results suggest that it will not be easy to target public or private technical assistance to particular groups, because their problems are not as unique as might be implied in the literature on entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Attempts to plan an overall strategy for library and information research face a whole series of problems, beginning with the most fundamental question of all – what is library and information research? Of equal importance for discussing the topic is the failure of developed countries to implement a properly planned national information policy. Without such a policy, is it even possible to find a generally acceptable rationale for a national research programme for library and information studies? Developments in research planning in the UK over the past decade are used as a basis for examining questions of this kind. The British Library Research and Development Department provides an example of how a well-established funding body can give some coherence at the level of national planning of research even though library and information policies are fragmented. The future of such policies is problematic; there will certainly be forward planning for particular topics, but it is highly uncertain as to whether such partial policies will be coordinated or sprout up separately, perhaps even in competition with one another. Currently, the balance between the forces favouring coordination and those favouring continued fragmentation seems somewhat weighted towards the latter. </jats:p>",

In the report a model for calculations of future need for dental manpower was introduced as an effective planning tool. An analysis of whether the WHO model is appropriate to calculate the future need for manpower planning was carried out. It appears that the model has serious methodological shortcomings. The model expects the user to know the future oral care needs concerning preventive, special group, surgical, orthodontic, and periodontal care. In calculating future needs for restorative and prosthetic care, the model restricts itself to looking back in time and roughly calculating what has happened in the past, assuming this will happen again.</jats:p>",
