      "abstract": "<jats:p>What would a library credit course look like if the syllabus and course content were based on the type of daily questions that undergraduate students regularly present to librarians at the reference desk? The scenario‐based approach to credit course instruction integrates such real‐life situations into its syllabus. Examples of such scenarios include determining if a library owns materials on a reading list or bibliography; using a subject‐specific database to find articles from peer‐reviewed journals; finding reviews of books on a reading list; “packaging” a list of citations and then sending it via e‐mail to a home account; and creating a personalized “library gateway” through a Web authoring exercise. This article includes the advantages and disadvantages of this approach, and student evaluations from such a course.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, much effort has been spent in integration of the hydrocarbon E&amp;P business processes. The new challenge lies in the use of the generated data for decision-making. In particular, in hydrocarbon assets, where large uncertainties occur, it is important to include the formal quantification of these uncertainties in the integrated workflow and allow for a decision framework based on a full characterization of these uncertainties.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>For quantification of uncertainties two classes of approach are currently in use –the probabilistic approach based on the description of a stochastic model for capturing all uncertainty and the scenario approach based on a definition of a number of conceptually different models expressing the uncertainty. Some hybrid versions of the approaches exist as well. The pros and cons of these approaches are discussed. Following this, an extended statistical framework is presented in which the previous approaches to subsurface uncertainty modelling have been combined. The framework is not limited to subsurface uncertainties, but can also be applied to the other uncertainties and decisions in the asset model. In the integrated framework several scenarios may be identified for the static earth model, the dynamic earth model, the drilling model, the surface facilities model and the economic model. A scenario tree can represent the combination of all these scenarios.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Within each scenario a stochastic model can be applied to capture the within-scenario uncertainty. Calculation rules for the integration of the stochastic and scenario uncertainties are presented. Finally, decision rules are given that allow for decision-making based on the full uncertainty span in the integrated asset framework.</jats:p>",

It is still not clear if the major driving force in protein folding is hydrogen bonding or hydrophobic interactions or both. We analyzed data on the conformational characteristics of 41 globular proteins in native and partially folded conformational states. Our analysis shows that a good correlation exists between relative decrease in hydrodynamic volume and increase in secondary structure content. No compact equilibrium intermediates lacking secondary structure, or highly ordered non‐compact species, were found. This correlation provides experimental support for the hypothesis that hydrophobic collapse occurs simultaneously with formation of secondary structure in the early stages of the protein folding.</jats:p>",

A positive impact of changing times on their health was evident from the views expressed by respondents and strongest feeling was that there is an increase in life expectancy due to immunization, life saving drugs and better medical facilities.

This approach showed that the majority of these polymorphisms did not occur independently in the different strains of the\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            complex but, rather, resulted from ancient, irreversible genetic events in common progenitor strains. Based on the presence or absence of an\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            specific deletion (TbD1),\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosi</jats:italic>\n            s strains can be divided into ancestral and “modern” strains, the latter comprising representatives of major epidemics like the Beijing, Haarlem, and African\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            clusters. Furthermore, successive loss of DNA, reflected by region of difference 9 and other subsequent deletions, was identified for an evolutionary lineage represented by\n            <jats:italic>M. africanum</jats:italic>\n            ,\n            <jats:italic>M. microti</jats:italic>\n            , and\n            <jats:italic>M. bovis</jats:italic>\n            that diverged from the progenitor of the present\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            strains before TbD1 occurred. These findings contradict the often-presented hypothesis that\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis,</jats:italic>\n            the etiological agent of human tuberculosis evolved from\n            <jats:italic>M. bovis</jats:italic>\n            , the agent of bovine disease.\n            <jats:italic>M. canettii</jats:italic>\n            and ancestral\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            strains lack none of these deleted regions, and, therefore, seem to be direct descendants of tubercle bacilli that existed before the\n            <jats:italic>M. africanum→M. bovis</jats:italic>\n            lineage separated from the\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            lineage. This observation suggests that the common ancestor of the tubercle bacilli resembled\n            <jats:italic>M. tuberculosis</jats:italic>\n            or\n            <jats:italic>M. canettii</jats:italic>\n            and could well have been a human pathogen already.\n          </jats:p>",
