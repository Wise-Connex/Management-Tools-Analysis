      "abstract": "<jats:p> The post-positivist domination of planning theory in recent years has rightly highlighted the social and political context of theories. Its impact through various guises including collaborative, postmodern and neo-pragmatic approaches has been significant. However, one area that has been immune to these broad changes and interpretations is typologies of planning. Typologies provide heuristics for academics and practitioners that help map the landscape of ideas that influence a particular field. As such they are crucial to any understanding of a diverse theoretical area such as planning. This article seeks to develop a post-positivist typology for planning theory. My typology is based upon the broad themes of post-positivism including the belief that all theory is to greater or lesser degrees normative, a non-linear conception of time and progress and the introduction of spatial and temporal variance in any understanding of the formulation, interpretation and application of theory. The result is an approach that does away with two traditional planning theory dualisms - the procedural-substantive distinction and the theory-practice gap. It also provides a locally diverse and unique interpretation of planning theory at the national and sub-national scale that rejects the idea that local interpretation of theories and their application can be assumed to be consistent with ideas operating at a higher (often supra-national) scale. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author argues that a key to understanding interactions between urban planning and lesbian and gay communities is to recognize that urban planning developed as a heterosexist project. Based on works in lesbian and gay history, he notes how the development of modern planning arose at the same time as modern conceptions of sexual orientation. Early planners were cognizant of lesbians and gays. Analyzing key texts of urban planning, the author shows how the heterosexist project works through unquestioned acceptance of Katz’s key assumptions of heterosexuality. He builds the argument by examining three dualisms within planning discourse: order/disorder, family/household, and public/private. While much of the analysis is historical, the author finds that planning continues to reinforce repression of lesbians and gays through laws, ordinances, and regulations. Analysis of emerging lesbian and gay enclaves must start with this background of repression. He concludes by suggesting several starting points for inclusive planning. </jats:p>",

Fertility levels and population growth rates are still high, and family planning programs suited to the region are still being developed. Nevertheless, by the end of the twentieth century, fertility transition was under way in Southern Africa and a few countries elsewhere. Successful regional family planning in the twenty‐first century will depend upon stronger political leadership, the development of family planning programs that meet the needs of all segments of society and not only currently married women, assistance to the market, and a recognition of the central importance of hormonal methods, especially injectables. Problems include stagnation in economic growth and in child mortality decline, as well as the persistence of the AIDS epidemic.</jats:p>",

Collaborative policy processes are increasingly in use as ways of achieving results in an era distinguished by rapid change, social and political fragmentation, rapid high volume information flow, global interdependence, and conflicting values. Network power can be thought of as a flow of power in which participants all share. It comes into being most effectively when three conditions govern the relationship of agents in a collaborative network: diversity, interdependence, and authentic dialogue (DIAD). Like a complex adaptive system, the DIAD network as a whole is more capable of learning and adaptation in the face of fragmentation and rapid change than a set of disconnected agents. Planners have many roles in such networks, and planning education needs to incorporate new subject matter to better prepare planners for these roles. </jats:p>",

The extent to which they were attributable to family planning programs, established in most countries of the region by 1970, is hotly debated. The 1970s were the heyday of family planning programs, which were created in a climate of urgency because of concerns over the “population explosion.” Issues faced by programs at that time are discussed. Over time, programs generally have moved to a simpler “service” approach. As increasing numbers of countries reach replacement‐level fertility, and as policies are formed against the background of the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, the role of family planning programs is increasingly debated and questioned. This article examines the responses of Asian countries and the population challenges that remain.</jats:p>",

This article uses qualitative data analysis to review the experience of nine family planning association projects in the Latin American and Caribbean region that have made a successful organizational transition from services focused on family planning to a gender‐based and sexual health approach. A conceptual framework is proposed, including factors external to the organization. Factors that can promote a pilot intervention's becoming fully institutionalized include: the need for commitment from high‐level staff and members of the board of directors, the creation of partnerships with other agencies, and an emphasis on monitoring and evaluation. Lessons from this experience and their potential relevance to other settings are reviewed and discussed.</jats:p>",

Longitudinal data from the Maternal and Child Health‐Family Planning Extension Project of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, are analyzed to show that a better strategy might be to target visits to women according to their educational level and area of residence. For uneducated women living far from clinics, access to contraceptives is likely to be a problem, and home visits for resupply might have a larger impact on the contraceptive prevalence rate than would field‐workers'visits to motivate nonusers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>National family planning programs have been an important instrument in accelerating global fertility decline and in restricting ultimate world population to a level probably below ten billion. They began to come into being after 1950 and will probably go out of existence in most of the world's regions by 2050. The archetypal programs were instituted in Asia and North Africa. The end of the twentieth century is an appropriate half‐way mark at which to evaluate the twentieth‐century programs and to assess what changes in them will be needed for the twenty‐first century. Some changes are necessary because dramatic events have occurred: (1) long‐term replacement‐level fertility has been attained in most of East Asia and some of Southeast Asia, and accordingly, some programs there are being phased out; (2) mainland South Asian fertility has been slower to decline; (3) international donor funding is diminishing and may not be significant during much of the twenty‐first century; (4) the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo called for a radical change in programs away from demographic aims and toward reproductive health and the improvement of the situation of women; and (5) the future family planning frontier will be sub‐Saharan Africa, for which radically new types of programs may have to be developed. These issues were discussed in January 2000 at a conference held in Dhaka, Bangladesh. A selection of contributions to the conference is published here. This article provides an overview of the issues based partly on this selection and partly on the discussions that took place at the conference.</jats:p>",

I argue that planners should place less emphasis on rational analysis and adopt a distinctly pragmatic approach when evaluating plans. Analysis may offer objectivity and precision, but it sacrifices context and continuity. A pragmatic outlook embraces context and seeks continuity among diverse viewpoints. It avoids the separation between analysis and action, providing a useful rationale for what some practitioners might call common sense judgment. </jats:p>",

One component that had been neglected was the study of precolonial towns in Southern Africa. Urban morphology, with its emphasis on how and why settlements took the shapes they did, provided a useful tool in the analysis of precolonial towns. Initial attempts by the staff to integrate selected parts of the syllabi of urban morphology and planning history are documented, illustrating how the links were reinforced through student project work. </jats:p>",

It involves the development of partnerships and protocols between mental health agencies and housing providers. This new role is not concerned with zoning and mitigating not-in-my-backyard responses. Supported housing is the newest and most popular model of housing and support for people with serious mental illness. It involves affordable integrated housing paired with flexible individualized mental health support services. Focusing on the Canadian experience, the authors review where past research on housing for people with serious mental illness has taken us. Supported housing and the new roles that planners can play in implementing this model are discussed. </jats:p>",

Surveys conducted in one pedestrian-oriented neighborhood and one automobile-oriented neighborhood in Portland, Oregon, support the hypotheses that (1) sense of community will be greater in the traditional neighborhood and (2) pedestrian environment factors will significantly influence sense of community, controlling for various demographic influences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article I discuss the significance of the temporal-spatial figure of transition in relation to spatial planning and environmental planning. This discussion is based on the theory that change and renewal can be found in intermediate spaces. I consider the positive value accorded to the spatial figure of transition in the discourses of ecology, environmental education and town planning. The integrative function of transition as a liminal space of possibility was highlighted early on in feminist planning debates. This function corresponds to the sustainable development model and is evidently inherent in the figure of transition. I therefore suggest that these debates should be used constructively in current research on sustainability, especially in the planning sciences. </jats:p>",

With this question in mind, the study examines the relationship between transit availability and auto ownership with travel survey data from Los Angeles. Although the relationship is statistically significant, it is rather weak, indicating that significant improvements will be needed in transit services to bring forth a slight decrease in auto ownership among the general population. Empirical evidence also shows that auto ownership is relatively low among the poorest households. Due to the difficulties in attracting the general population from automobile use to transit use, it has been suggested that instead of trying to achieve its many objectives, transit may benefit by rigorously pursuing provision of services to those incapable of owning and operating an automobile. </jats:p>",

A stable new equilibrium is far from inevitable; indeed, it is unlikely. Many countries are experiencing below‐replacement‐level fertility, and this trend is spreading. Couples are now able to choose their family size, free of the traditional pressures to bear children that was characteristic of most traditional societies. In fact, most societal pressures for the last generation have been distinctly antinatalist, in response to the enormous attention paid by the media to the “population bomb” agenda. This antinatalist attitude is changing, however, and what seems more likely than either a stationary or declining world population is a new growth cycle reflecting a resurgence of fertility as a response to growing material affluence and potential technological mastery of environmental challenges. Societal pressures and policies will play a role in this transition as they did in earlier ones.</jats:p>",

Demand for contraception can be expected to continue to rise rapidly for the next few decades as populations continue to grow and fertility declines to approach replacement level. As a result of these trends, the number of contraceptive users in the developing world is expected to rise from 549 to 816 million during the next 25 years, according to the most recent UN projection. An examination of the projection methodology found it to be reasonable. Projecting the future distribution of specific contraceptive methods is more difficult. Method choice is affected by trends in several factors, including access to different methods, user characteristics, and technology. The procedure employed by the Futures Croup to project method mix was found to be less than optimally designed, and a new methodology is, therefore, proposed.</jats:p>",

The model is based on the premise that collective action is the cause and consequence of the local externality itself, the perceived needs of the residents, and the underlying power structure or the capacity to organize. The model is then tested in a case study that explores the conditions that led to locally initiated school-based care in 114 public elementary schools in Scarborough, Ontario, Canada. Policy implications and recommendations for action are presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Excessive losses in natural disasters in Turkey are, to a large extent, a consequence of omissions and deficiencies in the structuring of ‘disasters’ and ‘development’ laws, as well as negligent land‐use practices and avoidance of control in building processes. Two extreme forms of legal and organizational structures in disasters policy could be formulated as the ‘fatalist’ and ‘self‐reliance‘ models. Their contrasts can be investigated in terms of (a) the use of information concerning natural phenomena in formal planning procedures; (b) pre‐ or post‐disaster emphasis in preparations; (c) the political or technical basis of decisions; (d) the extraordinary or routine nature of responses; (e) the general or specialized nature of financial sources used; (f) and their compatibility with the order of priorities in risk management. An evaluation of the conventional policy in Turkey clarifies a position closer to the ‘fatalist’ model and indicates the lines of action for improvements. However, after the 1999 earthquakes, the conventional approach in disaster policy has been restructured. With the newly introduced ‘Obligatory Building Insurance’, ‘Building Control’, and ‘Professional Proficiency’ systems, greater emphasis is now given to mitigation efforts, and the introduction of contingency planning practices is more likely to happen.</jats:p>",

This article draws on a range of research in the social sciences and presents two frameworks for understanding the critical attributes of successful expansion of small‐scale innovations. Seven key lessons are developed using examples from family planning where scaling up was an explicit objective, including the early Taichung Study of Taiwan, the Chinese Experiment in Quality of Care, the Bangladesh MCH‐FP Extension Project, the Navrongo Project in Ghana, and the Reprolatina Project in Brazil. Unless small, innovative projects concern themselves from the outset with determining how their innovations can be put to use on a larger scale, they risk remaining irrelevant for policy and program development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Population conferences have evolved through three overlapping stages, each stage reflecting a different perspective on the relationship between national policy formulation and the international system. Initially, at Rome in 1954 and in Belgrade in 1965, participants were invited on the basis of their expertise and were not expected to represent their governments. By the time of the Bucharest Conference in 1974, the United Nations, in an attempt to give conferences a greater role in shaping population policy and to inspire member governments to show greater concern for their own population problems, decided that conferences would be intergovernmental gatherings and that national delegations would be selected by governments. The effect of this change was that governments gave less weight to scientific expertise and, conversely, greater weight to political and bureaucratic considerations. At the present time, although conferences remain intergovernmental gatherings, the door has been opened for nongovernmental organizations–civil society–to play a more active role in the conference process and in deliberations. As conferences have become more inclusive, their focus has veered from what has conventionally been regarded as population concerns. The changing composition of participants at UN conferences has had the effect of altering the policy agenda in the international population field and, as some have argued since Cairo, has redefined the meaning of population. Conferences in the twenty‐first century likely will be compelled to confront diverse demographic problems in addition to social issues demanding the attention of the political system at every level.</jats:p>",

Collaborative Design Planning Networks (CDPN) permit designers from different firms to build a project model in which the plans of each participant are integrated with those of the others. Actors submit partial plans describing what they intend to do. These partial plans are represented in networks composed of tasks and infotems. By representing not only tasks but also their inputs and outputs, it becomes possible to link the partial projects of the collaborating actors and construct a global project plan. The involvement of every actor in the construction of the plan ensures both that the plan more accurately reflects the project and provides a greater degree of commitment to the plan by the individual actors.</jats:p>",

A multi‐criteria decision‐making procedure consists of generating alternatives, establishing criteria, assessment of criteria weights and application of the compromise ranking method (VIKOR). The alternatives are the scenarios of sustainable hazard effects mitigation, generated in the form of comprehensive land‐use plans. The alternative plans should consider the redevelopment of urban areas and infrastructures, multi‐purpose land use, including restrictions on building in hazardous areas. The evaluation of alternatives is implicated with imprecision (or uncertainty) of established criteria, and the fuzzy multi‐criteria model is developed to deal with “qualitative” (unquantifiable or linguistic) or incomplete information. The planning goal is to compromise competitive land uses through choice of the best (compromise) combination of uses. An application of this model is illustrated with the post‐earthquake regional planning problem in central Taiwan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ecotourism is an important niche market in the world tourism industry. It is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to mass tourism. The emergence of ecotourism was facilitated by the environmental damage associated with mass tourism. Ecotourism is defined in many ways and there is no consensus as to its exact meaning. However, a number of salient elements, such as environmental conservation, maintenance of biodiversity, a satisfying experience for the visitors, study and appreciation of nature and sustainable community development, are included in many definitions. Tourism creates negative environmental externalities in the form of environmental damage. Such adverse effects can have serious implications for the tourism industry because they damage the very natural resource that forms the raw material for ecotourism. Ecotourism ventures should thus be properly planned and implemented and carefully monitored. Proper planning of ecotourism is hampered by the paucity of relevant qualitative and quantitative information. The use of analytical tools such as the Contingent Valuation Method, carrying capacity, decision analysis techniques with which multi-objective and uncertain consequences can be analysed, and other management strategies, such as the Safe Minimum Standard, can be useful in enabling better planning of ecotourism. Ecotourism can thus enhance the opportunities for better management of natural resources while providing a satisfying experience for the visitor. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to develop the concept of a housing market area, thereby provide insights into our understanding of the sub-regional structures of the housing system and hence propose a framework for strategic planning research in the housing market. To tackle this task, it is first necessary to consider the criteria for a local housing market area. The paper begins by reviewing previous definitions by both academics and planners, and their underlying assumptions. Based on the principle of spatial arbitrage, a local housing market area is defined by reference to criteria linked to migration self-containment. Parallels are drawn with the principles that have been applied to define a system of spatial labour markets using travel-to-work areas. This spatial arbitrage definition is tested empirically by developing a system of housing market areas for west central Scotland using data derived from the Land Registry. Finally, the paper draws together the empirical findings to discuss the nature of spatial housing markets and the implications for strategic planning. It argues that the establishment of a geography of functional housing market areas represents the first step in the development of systematic planning research. </jats:p>",

However, a considerable number of important planning issues call for significantly longer-term forecasts of demographic developments. Such issues include the decisions which need to be taken by housing providers in the context of urban redevelopment regarding the reduction of supplementation of the housing stock; other examples are investment decisions affecting social and technical infrastructure, and labour-market matters. Consequently, the Spatial Monitoring Section within Brandenburg's State Environmental Agency has undertaken population-development forecasts with a 2040 horizon for 25 towns and cities in Brandenburg with populations in excess of 20,000. These forecasts highlight in particular the specific problems facing cities in eastern Germany; what they reveal especially clearly is that the drastic shifts in age structure expected to become evident over the coming years will continue after 2015, and in some cases will become even more pronounced.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A municipality of 2.4 million inhabitants that makes up the inner half of the Greater Toronto Area, the City of Toronto was consolidated from seven municipalities in 1998. Planning practice, discourse, and “vision” in the new City of Toronto are shaped by the city’s bid for the 2008 Olympics, related proposals for waterfront redevelopment, and preparations for a new official plan. In the context of comparative debates on trends in local governance, we see current planning strategies in Toronto as one of several strategic sites in which Toronto is consolidated into a “competitive city.” Historically, the formation of the competitive city in Toronto must be seen as a result of the impasse of postwar metropolitan planning in the early 1970s, the sociospatial limitations of downtown urban reform politics in the 1970s and 1980s, and the neoliberal restructuring and rescaling of the local state in the 1990s. Theoretically, we draw on the global city research paradigm, regime and regulation theory, and neo‐Gramscian urban political theory to suggest that planning the competitive city signals shifts in the sociopolitical alliances, ideological forms, and dominant strategies that regulate global‐city formation. These constellations and strategies threaten to reconstitute bourgeois hegemony in Toronto with a series of claims to urbanity.</jats:p>",

There is to date, however, little empirical evidence regarding the timescales affecting business start-ups, nor are sectoral or geographical breakdowns or data on survival rates available. The first part of this article consists of an analysis of start-up activity in western Germany between 1983 and 1997, revealing a relatively high constancy between structures and processes. One further important finding is the discovery overall of a reciprocal relationship between the start-up rates observed for specific cohorts and their survival rates over a five-year term, attributable largely to the service sector. The second part of the study draws on regression analysis in an attempt to assess the geographical differences for start-up rates and survival rates. The models for start-ups provide relatively good certainty levels (60–84 %); the results for survival rates are not quite as sound. Overall the study reveals that both start-up rates and survival rates are influenced significantly by the respective business sector and by the regional milieu (size of businesses, qualifications, unemployment rate, etc.). In the final section, these findings are used to develop ideas for regional structure policy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This research program was aimed at developing an objective methodology for water quality management on a river basin scale. To that end, a mathematical model has been formulated to determine the best configuration of wastewater treatment plants consistent with either fixed‐emission standards or prescribed river quality objectives. It will, of course, be appreciated that the latter case is considerably more difficult since this involves not only site selection but also waste load allocation. In the case of waste load allocation it was first necessary to use a process‐based river water quality simulation model to predict the impact of different combinations of effluent discharge standards on the river. For reasons of computational efficiency an artificial neural network was employed to replicate the process‐based model, which was then used in conjunction with a genetic algorithm to determine both the best sites and individual effluent discharge standards, subject to meeting the required river water quality. The overall model has been applied to the upper Thames basin in southern England, initially for site selection alone and then for site selection with waste load allocation. The results show that the genetic algorithm performs well for both options, thereby providing an efficient means of planning wastewater treatment on a regional basis.</jats:p>",

The authors look critically at the arguments frequently advanced in favour of FGPs, namely the “added leisure value” and “locational benefits”, as well as the gains anticipated for the city's economic strength, for city and regional development, for the city's image and for its competitive position vis-à-vis other cities. Proceeding from an appraisal of the current leisure value of the two cities, they go on to examine and to assess the impact of such a new FGP on the existing range of decentralised retail and leisure amenities. Where the initial assessment of a city's leisure value is high, an FGP is unlikely to be capable of generating additional demand. Thus, the very significant displacement of demand which can be expected to take place following the opening of a new FGP will be accompanied by losses in terms of both leisure value and urbanity. The authors also indicate what factors need to be considered in selecting the right location for an FGP, assuming that such a development is deemed desirable from an urban development perspective.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When people commute to work longer or farther than the actual spatial arrangement of homes and workplaces suggest they could be commuting, people are engaging in excess commuting. In the aggregate, excess commuting is the nonoptimal or surplus work travel occurring in cities because people do not minimize their journeys to work. In this paper an alternative view of excess commuting based on a theoretical maximum commute is presented. The calculation of a theoretical maximum commute allows for an analysis of the range between the theoretical minimum and maximum commutes, which marks an improvement over current approaches to the measure of excess commuting. Conceptually, this range is taken to be the commuting capacity of a city. To what extent commuting capacity is consumed in terms of current levels of commuting forms a primary question of the analysis. A model is formulated and applied to 1990 Census data for a sample of US cities. Numerical and visual results suggest variation in the amount of excess commuting and consumed commuting potential for the sample of cities. The results also suggest a relationship between the jobs – housing balance of a city (as captured by its theoretical minimum commute) and its observed commute. Additionally, the maximization calculation is shown to provide insight into the degree of decentralized urban form. A conclusion is provided which relates the findings of this research to larger issues of urban sustainability. </jats:p>",

There are several possible solutions to this kind of problem. They range from solutions where each community treats its wastewater separately, to solutions where all the wastewater produced in the region is sent to a single treatment plant. It is likely that the most effective solution both in terms of public expenditure, equipment reliability, and environmental impact will be found somewhere between these two extremes. This paper presents an optimization approach to wastewater systems planning at regional level. The approach applies only to sanitary sewer networks. A simulated annealing algorithm is used to solve the optimization model upon which the approach is based. For the application of this approach a user-friendly computing tool was developed. Within this tool, both the acquisition of data and the output of results are made through a flexible GIS interface.</jats:p>",

Throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and into the 1990s, the financial services sector in Bristol, like that of many regional financial centres in the United Kingdom, grew significantly. Of particular note has been the local expansion, through relocation and new firm formation, of the life assurance industry. I argue that underwriting, concerned as it is with the management and production of risk, plays a central role in defining and distinguishing life assurance as a distinctive form of economic activity. By placing underwriting in Bristol within the wider configurations of the life underwriting community-of-practice I seek to determine the role of local actants in constituting insurantial practices. I argue that the city of Bristol is a significant space within the geography of life underwriting and, in turn, the manufacture of life assurance risk. However, in attempting to assess exactly how significant, some of the limitations of thinking about financial space in terms of regional and network topologies become apparent. In taking seriously the anthropology of financial communities-of-practice, institutions, and ‘network(ing)s’ I conclude that we may therefore need to think about financial centres and financial space in new ways. </jats:p>",

The full publication of several important residential and sacred sites, including La Muculufa, Monte Grande, Capo Graziano and I Faraglioni, Ustica enable close study of material assemblages within their architectural contexts. The relationship between social behavior and domestic architecture in Bronze Age Sicily is analyzed, focusing on the structuring of social interaction at multiple levels of social distance. Recent work has also demonstrated increasing contacts between Sicilian and east Mediterranean communities during the second millennium BC. Innovations, including widespread use of formally defined exterior household spaces, careful planning of shared public places, and imposing defensive structures, emerged in response to frame new kinds of interactions with outsiders and between community members. These new architectural forms developed unevenly, reflecting a variety of processes specific to local conditions. At Thapsos, new architectural forms appeared in the context of intensive contact with the Aegean world; at other sites such as I Faraglioni, Punta Milazzese and Mursia (Pantelleria) innovative architectural forms formalized traditional uses of domestic space in response to dynamic local conditions.</jats:p>"

A total of 63 analysts participated in a two (firm size: small and large) by two (firm health: unhealthy and healthy) randomized between-subjects design. The ERP announcement represented a within-subjects manipulation. The analysts' overall reaction to ERP implementation plans was positive, as mean post-announcement earnings forecasts were significantly higher than mean pre-announcement forecasts. Additionally, as expected, mean earnings forecast revisions in the small/healthy and large/unhealthy firm conditions were significantly greater than mean forecast revisions in the small/unhealthy firm condition.</jats:p><jats:p>Experimental results from the current study support archival findings reported by Hayes et al.

The Esthetic Grid Analysis is a system for analyzing the basic problems that detract from the concept of an attractive smile. A photograph is taken of the anterior teeth with the lips retracted. The upper and lower frame of the photograph is aligned parallel with the interpupillary line, assuming that the interpupillary line is parallel with the horizon. Where this is not the case, the vertical margins of the photograph are aligned parallel with the facial midline. Through orienting the photograph to the facial guidelines and incorporating the idealized positions of the incisal plane, highest Upline, midline axis, and proportionate contact areas, a grid is formed. The grid built from these components provides a method of demonstrating deviations from an esthetic arrangement of anterior teeth.</jats:p><jats:p>CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE</jats:p><jats:p>Integrating facial guidelines with the dental composition using a grid highlights deviations from the ideal.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper I use the notion of performance, especially as it has been theorized within the science studies literature, to begin to make sense of the history and continuing practices of economic geography. I argue that not only humans perform, but also objects. In this paper, I focus on the performance of books, and in particular, textbooks, or as Bruno Latour calls them, ‘immutable mobiles’. I argue that textbooks bring four attributes to their performance: they travel easily over distance, thereby bringing their message to a geographically diffuse audience; they allow for ‘an optical and semiotic homogeneity’, that is, they take quite different pieces of the world, and bring them together, manipulating them and controlling them, on the same page; they represent an obligatory passage point in the sense that once they are accepted as the standard summary of a field they are necessarily acknowledged by successors; and finally, their effectiveness is in part a consequence of their rhetoric—defined as the ability to draw together and integrate within the text a wide range of sources and authors. These arguments about the performance of textbooks are illustrated by two case studies. The first is George G Chisholm's Handbook of Commercial Geography, published in 1889, which helps launch economic geography as an academic discipline within Anglo-America. The second is Peter Haggett's Locational Analysis in Human Geography, published in 1965, which in many ways codifies the quantitative and theoretical revolution that first emerged in the United States in the late 1950s.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a novel randomized motion planner for robots that must achieve a specified goal under kinematic and/or dynamic motion constraints while avoiding collision with moving obstacles with known trajectories. The planner encodes the motion constraints on the robot with a control system and samples the robot's state × time space by picking control inputs at random and integrating its equations of motion. The result is a probabilistic roadmap of sampled state × time points, called milestones, connected by short admissible trajectories. The planner does not precompute the roadmap; instead, for each planning query, it generates a new roadmap to connect an initial and a goal state× time point. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the planner's convergence rate. It shows that, if the state× time space satisfies a geometric property called expansiveness, then a slightly idealized version of our implemented planner is guaranteed to find a trajectory when one exists, with probability quickly converging to 1, as the number of milestones increases. Our planner was tested extensively not only in simulated environments, but also on a real robot. In the latter case, a vision module estimates obstacle motions just before planning starts. The planner is then allocated a small, fixed amount of time to compute a trajectory. If a change in the expected motion of the obstacles is detected while the robot executes the planned trajectory, the planner recomputes a trajectory on the fly. Experiments on the real robot led to several extensions of the planner in order to deal with time delays and uncertainties that are inherent to an integrated robotic system interacting with the physical world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A number of possible advantages of industry agglomeration—or spatial clustering—have been identified in the research literature, notably those related to shared costs for infrastructure, the build-up of a skilled labour force, transaction efficiency, and knowledge spillovers leading to firm learning and innovation. We identify two shortcomings of existing research on the clustering phenomenon. First, the abundance of theoretical concepts and explanations stands in sharp contrast with the general lack of work aimed at validating these mechanisms empirically and the contradictory evidence found in recent empirical work in the field. Second, there is still a lack of a unified theoretical framework for analyzing spatial clustering. In an attempt to remedy the latter shortcoming, this paper investigates the nature of the cluster from a knowledge-creation or learning perspective. We argue for the need to establish a specific theory of the cluster where learning occupies centre stage. The basic requirements for such a theory of the cluster are discussed. Two main components of such a theory are identified: it must explain the existence of the cluster on the one hand and its internal organization on the other. </jats:p>",

Currently, no psychometrically founded training needs analysis instrument exists that can reliably assess the nature and extent of the specific educational provision required for this role. This paper is concerned with the development of an instrument capable of defining the development needs for family planning nurse prescribing.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Methods.</jats:bold> A national survey was conducted with 388 family planning nurses, using a modified training needs analysis instrument. Respondents were required to assess the importance of 40 tasks, firstly for the role of the family planning nurse (FPN), and again for the role of the family planning nurse prescriber (FPNP). The data from each set of ratings were separately factor analysed using orthogonal Varimax rotations and Cronbach’s α was computed for each factor.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> Six factors emerged from the family planning nurse ratings (‘professional development’, ‘managing patient consultations’, ‘critical appraisal’, ‘clinical information giving and professional accountability’, ‘collaborative working and current National Health Service (NHS) issues’ and ‘dispensing of drugs’) and nine factors emerged from the FPNP ratings (‘research and practice development’, ‘prescribing and professional accountability’, ‘management/leadership’, ‘clinical decision making and risk assessment’, ‘advanced health assessment’, ‘critical appraisal’, ‘referral processes’, ‘core nursing skills’ and ‘dispensing of drugs’. This suggests that the role of the FPNP is more extended and, moreover, that the two roles are configured very differently but in a way that makes logical and coherent sense within existing research and government policy. This indicates that the instrument is valid. Moreover, all but two of the factors had a Cronbach’s α score of &gt;0·7 and so can be considered reliable.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold> The results indicate that the modified instrument is valid and reliable and therefore can be used with confidence to assess the training needs of FPNPs. In addition, the factors have outlined a cogent definition of the role of the FPNP, which can be used both to inform educational programmes and to assess their efficacy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The post 1960 locational sequence of peri‐urban residential development in the Halifax city region is interpreted in terms of three sets of factors: magnets or attractors, constraints or inhibitors, and planning policies designed to direct or control development. Most peripheral housing has been suburban (i.e., on small, centrally‐serviced lots) rather than exurban (on large lots, serviced on‐site). Suburban development patterns have been strongly shaped by the 1963 Halifax Housing Survey and the 1975 Regional Development Plan, both of which promoted planned satellite communities on government land assemblies, in areas of cheap land and low development costs.</jats:p><jats:p>After 1980 effective regional planning was phased out, which encouraged excessive large‐lot development in country districts beyond the service boundary. Magnets for country residential development operate at a variety of scales, and include highway access, elementary schools, localized site conditions, and appropriate zoning. The major regional constraint is road‐distance from the urban core, but socio‐cultural and cadastral constraints are locally important.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper concludes with a survey of policy options to promote efficient patterns of suburban development and to curb exurban sprawl. Many of these options were recommended in earlier plans, but have lacked fiscal and political support in the last two decades. They must now be re‐assessed in a new regional plan.</jats:p><jats:p>La séquence géographique post‐1960 du développement résidentiel péri‐urbain dans la région de Halifax est interprétée par l'entremise de trois ensembles des facteurs: les aimants ou les attracteurs, les contraintes ou les inhibiteurs, et les politiques de planification conçues pour diriger ou contrôler le développement. La plupart des logements périphériques ont été sub‐urbains (c'est‐à‐dire sur des petits lots dotés de services centraux) plutôt qu'exurbains (sur des grands lots, dotés sur place). Des configurations suburbaines de développement ont été fortement conditionnées par le Halifax Housing Survey (1963) et par le plan de développement régional (1975), tous deux ayant promu des communautés satellites prévues sur les terres de gouvernement, dans les zones de terrain bon marché avec des coûts de développement relativement bas.</jats:p><jats:p>Après 1980, la planification régionale a étééliminée, ce qui a encouragé le développement excessif de lots de grandes dimensions dans des zones au‐delà de la limite des services. Les aimants pour le développement résidentiel exurbain fonctionnent à diverses échelles. Ils incluent notamment l'accès routier, les écoles primaires, l'état des sites locaux, et la répartition appropriée en zones. La contrainte régionale principale est la distance routière par rapport au noyau urbain, mais les contraintes socio‐culturelles et cadastrales sont localement importantes.</jats:p><jats:p>En conclusion, l'article fournit un résumé des options politiques favorisant les configurations efficaces du développement suburbain et limitant le développement des grands lots exurbains. Plusieurs de ces options ont déjà fait l'objet de recommandations dans le cadre de plans passés, mais ont manqué de support fiscal et politique au cours des deux dernières décennies. Elles doivent maintenant être réévaluées dans un nouveau plan régional.</jats:p>",

Mucosal hemoclips were placed at the time of endoscopy to indicate the superior and inferior extent of the tumour. The clips provided a radiologically‐recognisable marker of the tumour extent and were visible on simulation films or planning CT scans. The radiation portal included the tumour as demarcated by the clips with an adequate margin. There were no complications related to the placement of the clips. All patients completed the radiotherapy course as planned.</jats:p>",

Acculturation accounted for a small but statisticallysignificant amount of the variation explained for all three reproductive behaviors. Being less acculturated was associated with older age at initiation of sexual intercourse, fewer lifetime sexual partners, and fewer pregnancies. Substance experimentation was associated with earlier sexual debut and more sexual partners but with fewer pregnancies. Gender role orientation was significant onlyfor age at first intercourse. More traditional young women were older at sexual debut. These results suggest that gender role orientation is important for delaying first intercourse, but once sexually active, acculturation and substance experimentation become more important influences on sexual risk taking among Latina adolescents. </jats:p>",

A GIS‐based modelling approach has been developed, which links site conditions as expressed in an integrated soil and land cover dataset with the site requirements for different woodland types. There are three important aspects to the model – the parameter weightings, the added value of the integrated dataset, and the woodland categories which are described and predicted. The initial quantitative and qualitative validation has been encouraging although more is required and planned. The results indicate that for broad strategic planning purposes, predictions of woodland potential are not improved significantly when climatic factors are incorporated. The concept that soil acts as an integrator of other environmental variables is discussed alongside the practical application of the model by a range of users.</jats:p>",

The impact of feasible changes in the levying of “carbon tax” can be investigated with the proposed model, as well as the effects of investments in infrastructure and of the coverage of operational costs. Based on some transport externalities, various cost indices are identified and suitably minimized using optimization techniques, so that a quantitative definition of public policies can be derived. As an example, the model is used to evaluate application of alternative policies in Germany. This case study shows that the model system of goods transportation has a slight sensitivity to the public interventions considered. The application of the carbon tax shows significant effects on the increase of fiscal revenues rather than on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and on the share of road transportation. Reductions in carbon dioxide emissions and in transportation by road are best achieved by higher investment in the infrastructures of alternative modes of transport, together with a reduction in fuel taxation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To investigate the neural mechanisms of planning, we used a novel adaptation of the Tower of Hanoi (TOH) task and event-related functional MRI. Participants were trained in applying a specific strategy to an isomorph of the five-disk TOH task. After training, participants solved novel problems during event-related functional MRI. A computational cognitive model of the task was used to generate a reference time series representing the expected blood oxygen level-dependent response in brain areas involved in the manipulation and planning of goals. This time series was used as one term within a general linear modeling framework to identify brain areas in which the time course of activity varied as a function of goal-processing events. Two distinct time courses of activation were identified, one in which activation varied parametrically with goal-processing operations, and the other in which activation became pronounced only during goal-processing intensive trials. Regions showing the parametric relationship comprised a frontoparietal system and include right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA 9)], bilateral parietal (BA 40/7), and bilateral premotor (BA 6) areas. Regions preferentially engaged only during goal-intensive processing include left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44). The implications of these results for the current model, as well as for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of planning and functional specialization of the prefrontal cortex, are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports part of the results of a 3 year project carried out at Cranfield University in collaboration with companies in the automotive and aerospace industry, aiming to develop new methodologies for computer aided assembly process planning (CAAPP). CAAPP is not a mature technology, despite the managerial and technical advantages offered by its implementation. This paper describes the limiting factors in industrial acceptance of CAAPP and discusses methodologies by which these factors can be eliminated. This is done primarily by the integration of CAAPP functionality with a product data management (PDM) tool, providing a data control framework and a high-level data structure to form the basis of planning. The paper also details a system based on the described approach. The underlying object-oriented model developed to facilitate automated assembly process planning is described in detail. Data control methodologies are presented to aid retrieval, storage and creation. Methods for the definition of liaisons, mating features, are discussed. The methodologies used for constraint identification, process sequence generation and sequence representation within the system are described. Multiple sequences are represented by means of a tree structure, similar to the AND/OR graph representation. The sequence is navigable and can be used for downstream sequence evaluation and simulation or to generate scheduling data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An inverse treatment planning (ITP) module on a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) (Helax AB, Uppsala, Sweden) is being used for an in‐house clinical trial for treatment of nasopharyngeal cancer with contralateral parotid sparing. Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) fields are delivered by step and shoot multileaf collimator (MLC) with a DMLC enabled Varian 2300 CD (Varian Associates, Palo Alto, CA). A series of testing procedures have been devised to quantify the modeling and delivery accuracy of routine clinical inverse planned IMRT using Helax TMS and the Varian step and shoot MLC delivery option. Testing was done on specific aspects of the TPS modeling germane to DMLC. Measured relative dose factors (head scatter plus phantom scatter) for small MLC fields, normalized to a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20097-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20097:equation:acm20097-math-0001\" /> non‐MLC field, were found to differ by <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20097-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20097:equation:acm20097-math-0002\" /> from the TPS values for the smallest of the fields tested. Relative distributions for small off axis fields were found to be in good agreement. A process for the routine clinical verification of IMRT fields has been implemented. Each IMRT field in an inverse plan is imported into a flat water tank plan and a “beam's eye view” (BEV) dose distribution is generated. This is compared to the corresponding measured BEV dose distribution. The IMRT verification process has also been performed using an anthropomorphic phantom. Large clinical fields (i.e., greater than 14.5 cm in the leaf direction) caused difficulties due to a vendor specific machine restriction, and several techniques for dealing with these were examined. These techniques were (i) the use of static stepping of closed junctions, (ii) the use of two separate IMRT fields for a given gantry angle, and (iii) restricting the overall maximum field size used. The overall process has allowed implementation of an in‐house protocol for IMRT use on an initial clinical site. Results of the verification measurements for the first ten patients treated at this center reveal an average maximum dose per IMRT field delivered of 71.0 cGy, with a mean local deviation from the planned dose of – 1.2 cGy, and a standard deviation of 2.4 cGy.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.Dq, 87.53.Tf</jats:p>",
