Terms such as integrated resources management, ecosystem management, and integrated environmental management have emergedfrom several different fields. This literature reveals concurrence on several substantive elements and some common views on the procedural elements. An operational model to help guide practitioners is currently lacking, but one might emerge through (1) more empirical investigations, (2) greater transfer of knowledge from social sciencefields to the natural resource fields, (3) the incorporation and refinement offrameworksfor collaboration, and (4) increased understanding of institutional changes required for coordinated decision making. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews the recent literature on public infrastructure and economic productivity, with special attention to the particular case of highway infrastructure. Recent evidence suggests that, at the margin, highway infrastructure contributes little to state or national productivity. This is consistent with studies that show relatively small land-use impactsfrom modem highways. Yet the idea that highways enhance economic health is common in the policy and planning communities. Two explanations can help reconcile this divergence between academic research and popular perception. First, some of the economic development observed near highways might not actually be caused by the highway. Second, some of the economic development near highways might be a shift of economic activity awayfrom other areas. Either explanation implies the need for reforms in highway project analysis and funding. This article suggests appropriate policy reforms and directions for future research. </jats:p>",

Parallel field appraisal and facilities engineering required a close working team since during the period of 1992 to 1994 major changes occurred in the description of reservoir fluids. Oil viscosity decreased due to improvements in sampling methods which had significant impact on recommended design parameters. Other key data acquisition and field testing provided confidence in and a linking of relative permeability data and KvKh</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Fluid movement in the interwell region is dominated by gravity forces where up dip injected water slumps to bottom and water coning is a dominant feature. Well spacing of around 700-800 feet are planned. Significant water will be produced, and the cost of water handling is a primary consideration when designing well liquid flow rate. In Captain Field, the optimum well off take rate is found to be between 15,000 to 20,000 bpd.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Development plans include a large waterflood to maintain reservoir pressure at high off take rates. The waterflood will utilize only horizontal water injectors wit11 'tuned' completions. Also, careful consideration of injector placement has taken into account potential future use for polymer flooding.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Captain Field is approximately 90 miles north-east of Aberdeen, Scotland in the UK Continental Shelf Block 13122a in 350 feet of water. The field was discovered in 1977 and it was clear that, although large with nearly 1,500 mmbbl oil in-place, economical extraction of the high density (19° API), viscous (88 cP) and low gas-oil ratio crude (Table 1) would not be easy. Also, the two primary reservoirs, the Upper andLower Captain Sands, are permeable but unconsolidated and of greatly varying thickness (0 - 275 ft). To this end no fewer than 20 appraisal wells (Fig. 1) were required to determine reservoir extent. Also, an extensive aquifer is present and underlies approximately 65% of the hydrocarbons.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Not until performing a ten well appraisal program during 1993, which included a 90-day test of a field development prototype horizontal well, a vertical well water coning test, and further delineation drilling, was it clear that these technical challenges could be overcome. Conclusions from the 1993 appraisal program and subsequent reservoir simulation indicated that successful field development would require nearly 40 horizontal wells up to 6,000 ft long, artificial lift systems to deliver 15,000 bpd from each oil well producer, sand control completions, high temperature and high retention time fluid separation equipment to treat 60,000 bopd and 200,000 bwpd, and a single aquifer lift well to deliver 60,000 bwpd make up water for water flooding at full voidage replacement.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It is often of interest to analyze more compact, less detailed versions. One form of reducing the size of the problem is through an aggregation process. One way in which this has been done is through a column aggregation process, where sets of similar columns are replaced by one representative. A second alternative is to aggregate the original data, in which case the stands and management alternatives are grouped before building a model. Typical approaches for the aggregation processes have been analytical. We present an alternative approach for aggregation based on cluster analysis. Computational results for both types of aggregation show that using cluster analysis can be advantageous. For. Sci. 43(2):274-285.</jats:p>",

A new pump design employing axial flow impellers coupled with high speed downhole turbine drive has been developed, and is the first true downhole multiphase pump. This paper describes the staged research and development program leading to the first field trial installation in the Captain Field, in the North Sea. Development and design requirements are reviewed, with the results from laboratory testing in water and nitrogen followed by full scale loop testing in multiphase fluid, including crude, methane and brine. Test configuration is described, and key performance results reviewed. Special testing defined the nature of fluids and rheology related to high rotational speed pumping of viscous crude and brine mixtures in pumps and pipelines.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Following successful laboratory scale testing, design considerations are reviewed for its application in a field trial. Completion design includes provision for open loop flow and access below the pump assembly for coiled tubing intervention. New downhole monitoring systems employ pump and turbine monitors along with pump flow and reservoir evaluation monitoring. The design results in extended range of pump operability, improved reliability, and improved control and reservoir management.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>As technology improves in horizontal drilling, completion practices, and subsea equipment, the need for high volume downhole pumping systems has increased. Small accumulations or thin oil zones, previously considered marginal, can be exploited economically. But in some applications, pumping systems needed higher gas handling capability because maximizing recovery from individual wells requires larger pressure drawdown. Additionally, horizontal wells located at the top of the productive intervals can encounter free gas caps.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Development of a downhole pumping system that could operate successfully in a gassy environment (higher than 30% gas void fraction), and deliver high reliability was key to exploiting new reserves. This technology could be applied within many major oil compani's existing asset portfolio, such as the Gulf of Mexico or West of Shetlands deepwater environments, and elsewhere in the North Sea. One of the assets that could benefit from this technology is the Captain Field. Although the main area of the field is being developed with Electrical Submersible Pumps (ESP), an isolated gas cap was identified in the eastern section of the field that would limit the reliability of ESP systems, and would limit the withdrawal rate. The field has 19 degree API crude oil, with 88 centipoise (CP) viscosity at reservoir pressure of 1300 psi and 87 deg F.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Following the President’s approval of the program, the National Security Council worked out the details. The group would be comprised of ninety officers and eighty enlisted men divided among the army, navy, and air force, and would be part of the military section of the aid mission but have direct communications with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The head of USAGG as senior army officer would be director of planning and operations and responsible to the chief of the American mission. Final authority, however, would rest with the ambassador, who would approve decisions and continue to deal with the Athens government on high policy. Military matters relating to such policy would come to his attention by the director and through the mission chief’s office. Forrestal, now secretary of defense, directed the joint chiefs to select the men for the operational advisory task force.</jats:p>",

It is assumed that one part of\nthe mechanical system is submitted to specified motions laws, while movements of\nthe complementary part are free. Thus, motion optimization is related to free\njoint movements but it is achieved on the basis of the dynamic model of the\nwhole mechanical system. This approach introduces a non-autonomous state\nequation of a special type in the sense that it can not only depend on the\nrunning time but also on the unknown travelling time. The cost function to be\nminimized involves the travelling time and the actuating inputs. Optimization is\nachieved by applying the Pontryagin Maximum Principle which yields a new\noptimality condition concerning the travelling time dependency of the stated\nproblem. Two simulation examples are presented. The first one shows how the\ndeveloped technique makes possible both the reducing and mastering the dynamic\ncomplexity of a four degrees of freedom-vertical manipulator. Set at four\ndegrees of freedom, the second one deals with a redundant planar manipulator\ncharacterized by a mobile base that is submitted to a specified driving\nmotion.</jats:p>",

Subjects first participated in a number of cognitive ability tests. They then had to plan a trip for a group of 20 people. The results indicate that inhibitory efficiency combined with the flexible use of attentional resources can account for substantial amounts of variance in the planning task. The results support the view that chronological age does not necessarily predict the performance in rather complex cognitive tasks like planning. The data also point at the possibility that deficits in one information-processing component can be compensated by other information-processing components that improve or remain stable in older adults. In order to predict adjustment to everyday contexts it might be necessary to consider individual, differentiated patterns of performance in a variety of basic information-processing components. </jats:p>",

This project was initiated by the Research and Development groups of BP Exploration and Halliburton Energy Services, and sponsored by the European Union's Joule-THERMIE Program which supports the implementation of technology in Europe. The objectives of the project were to drill and complete a dual lateral well with commingled production, at minimum risk and cost, and to monitor and report the production performance. The difference between this project and the majority of multi-lateral wells drilled to date will be the installation of a cemented junction with connectivity, isolation and re-entry capability. The successful execution of this project will provide the industry with data on the long term performance of a cased hole, cemented, junction design. It will also provide production performance from a dual lateral well and give details of the challenges facing the management of such a well in a mature field environment. It is anticipated that this will lead to increases in the application of this technology, improve the economical recoverable reserves from mature fields and reduce the cost of new fields.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Application of multi-lateral wells was limited to wells that did not require through tubing reservoir access for stimulation or water, scale and sand management.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Junction construction advances through system development and testing by Longbottom 1 demonstrated the possibility existed of cost effectively constructing and installing a design which provided isolation, access and connectivity. The experience and learning gained by the implementation of this project, enhances the ability to construct a cased and cemented dual lateral, operate each lateral as a separate well and perform those remedial operations presently available to the industry.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The risk and uncertainty surrounding a project of this nature means that without the support of programmes like THERMIE, initial economics are sensitive when it comes to applying new technology in a mature field environment such as Forties. Remaining well targets are relatively small and production is complicated by demands for sand, scale and water management. In-fill and sidetrack drilling is expected to continue at least until 1999. If the recent success of the in-fill program continues, some platforms will become slot constrained. The application of new technologies, like multilateral wells, are expected to enable more targets to be reached from fewer surface locations. This well is the first step in this new direction.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

So far, the working‐age population has not been affected, but the ageing process is set to leave its mark on the labour force in the next 25 years. An ageing labour force and possible future policy measures in this area will have important repercussions for individual organizations. Research into future trends has shown that the percentage of people aged over 50 in public service will increase from 15 per cent in 1995 to 35 per cent in 2010. Policy measures aimed at stimulating the labour force participation of the elderly will boost this percentage even further. The elderly employees not only hold the highest positions, but also they withdraw from the workforce in limited numbers. Unless the number of jobs is increased, opportunities for promotion and entry into the Civil Service are likely to decline. The only way to counteract an ageing workforce ‐ even if only to a limited degree ‐ is to encourage the retirement of elderly employees and/or to significantly boost the number of jobs within the organization. Such measures would run counter to current political trends. An alternative would be to reassess the position of the elderly within the organization.</jats:p>",

There has been speculation on the implications of this for economic and environmental policy. In this paper I examine this research as a whole and find that unequivocal evidence for an EKC relationship is very scant; that there are important indicators which show a monotonically increasing relationship; that even where there may be an EKC relationship, most of the world's population is still on the section of the curve that is increasing, so that growth in income on the basis of this relationship would result in considerable further environmental damage; and that reviews of overall environmental quality even in the richest countries show that it is still declining. I conclude that from the point of view of environmental sustainability the income—environment relationship is still very problematic and that determined environmental policy will be required if future income growth is to be compatible with sustainable development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In most countries the taxi industry is highly regulated and in cases where deregulation has been attempted, positive outcomes have not always been evident. The taxi industry was one of the very last to be deregulated by the New Zealand government as part of its sweeping restructuring of the country's industry in the 1980s. The author looks at the impact of that 1989 Act. The 1989 legislation, which removed the quantitative controls (deregulation), has been followed by a tripling of the number of companies in the metropolitan centres and a massive increase in the number of taxi cabs. A much wider range of taxi services now exploit different market segments and offer a wider geographic coverage. These changes have been accompanied by a decline in fares in real, if not nominal, terms. As expected, the influx of new players has necessitated the imposition of additional quality controls. Customers have benefited from greater numbers of cabs, shorter waiting times, and a greater range of services. Many more driving jobs have been opened up, although this is widely believed to have been accompanied by reduced incomes and longer hours until the market expanded. The larger firms which existed prior to deregulation have attempted to consolidate their market share in the face of increased competition from newer taxi organisations. There has also been increased competition between taxi and public transport operations as a variety of taxi companies tender for selected routes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The San Francisco Bay Area has taken on a distinct polycentric metropolitan form, with three tiers of hierarchical employment centers encircling downtown San Francisco, the region's primary center. In this paper it is found that polycentric development is associated with differentials in suburban and urban commute trip times: commute trips made by employees of suburban centers are shorter in duration than commute trips made by their counterparts in larger and denser urban centers. Differentials were even greater, however, with respect to commuting modal splits. Lower density, outlying employment centers averaged far higher rates of drive-alone automobile commuting and insignificant levels of transit commuting. Smaller, outlying centers were also the least self-contained, with a large number averaging twenty or more times as many external as internal commutes. The effects of housing availability and prices on the residential locational choices of those working both in urban and in suburban employment centers are also investigated in this paper. Locational choices are stratified by occupational class and type of center. High housing prices in and around employment centers were found to displace workers to residences in other subregions, except in the case of professional workers in fast-growing, outlying centers. These workers were attracted to higher-priced nearby housing. In the empirical analysis, significant segmentation in housing choices among workers in fast-growing suburban centers was found. This could be partly due to selective land-use policies implemented by local governments in these areas. </jats:p>",

In the UK public sector this has been particularly important, given the rise of New Public Management. This has resulted in a shift from issues of policy to issues of management, and the break‐up of traditional bureaucratic structures. These changes have been supported by an increasing focus on setting quantitative targets which cover all aspects of an organisation's performance. This paper seeks to examine the possible role of quantitative targets in planning and control in public sector organisations. Furthermore, through an exploratory study of over eighty planning documents from executive agencies, the nature and breadth of targets being used are examined and discussed.</jats:p>",

Following the classic von Thünen framework, we present a two-sector spatial equilibrium model of a city located at the center of an agricultural hinterland. The city produces industrial goods, and the rural area produces agricultural goods. Both goods are consumed both by urban and by rural residents. Market equilibrium for these goods determines: (1) the spatial size of the region, (2) the urbanization ratio (urban to total population) and the population size of the city, and (3) the rural spatial structure (wage, population distribution, land rent, and agricultural yield). Given various sets of exogenous parameters pertaining to the industrial, agricultural, and transportation production functions and to population preferences, the model is solved numerically, and response functions are estimated and analyzed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I assess the value of regulation theory for studying transformations in governance at the local level, focusing on the issue of local economic development. Adopting a third-generation approach, regulation theory is recognised as having varied success at theorising local governance. More advanced third-generation approaches offer some useful concepts that require integration through mid-level concepts. This is to be contrasted to approaches which ‘read off’ local transformation from broader macroeconomic change. Both approaches are, however, trapped in the regulationist enigma, defined in the paper as the difficulty of employing regulation theory to theorise local transformations in local governance. In order to solve the enigma, I utilise concepts from Jessop's strategic-relational state theory. This approach stresses, amongst other things, the political nature of state intervention. Jessop's approach is, however, not sufficiently sensitive to space and I introduce the notion of spatial selectivity to understand adequately the dynamics of local change. Spatial selectivity implies that the state has a tendency to privilege certain places through accumulation strategies, state projects, and hegemonic projects. The process of geographical privileging, which is implied by the notion of spatial selectivity, takes on both material and ideological forms. This tentative concept is explored through a reworking of theoretical approaches to Thatcherism. I conclude by highlighting issues that spatial selectivity needs to address, namely uneven development and structure—strategy—agency dialectics. </jats:p>",

Several techniques have been developed to make EP practicable to solve a real power system problem and other practical problems. The proposed approach is described in detail for the IEEE‐30‐bus system. Simulation results, compared with those obtained by using a conventional gradient‐based optimization method, Broyden 's method, are presented to show that the present method is better for power system planning even under network contingencies. In the case of optimization of non‐continuous and non‐smooth function, EP is much better than non‐linear programming. The comprehensive simulation results show a great potential for applications ofEP in power system economical and secure operation, planning and reliability assessment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years there has been growing interest in the use of computers within qualitative geography. In this paper we review the types of software packages that have been adopted and outline some of their distinctive features. We discuss the intellectual and institutional reasons for the interest in the software and highlight the ways in which such reasons have shaped the use made of these packages. We argue that only a contextual account of how packages are adopted, adapted, and used can explain the situation in geography. Furthermore we suggest that the archaeologies underlying the packages—their theoretical presuppositions—are remarkably homogeneous and need to be clearly understood before deciding how the packages might be used. We outline how some of these presuppositions have affected the ways in which the packages have been used, and develop—from our own experiences—some points about informal networks of adoption and institutional contexts. The point of this is to suggest the minimal role played by formal software guides and manuals in choosing whether and how to use a package. The paper outlines the current ‘state of play’ and raises issues of future use to be addressed in a second paper on this theme. Our intention is neither to sell a particular package, nor to say “to do X, use package Y”, because such recommendations are often misleading. Rather, our aim is to provoke discussion about the use of software packages in qualitative geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We adapt recent perspectives on the resilience of ecosystems in a stochastic environment to analysis of the effects of public policies of ‘planned shrinkage’ on stressed US urban minority neighborhoods. The ‘synergism of plagues’—a self-reinforcing, interactive mix of contagious urban decay and deterioration in both public health and public order—emerges in the course of a sudden ‘phase transition’ from community-spanning geographically focused social networks within ghetto neighborhoods to a condition of fragmented and isolated subnets. This transition occurs because instabilities inherent in the marginalization of ethnic ghetto neighborhoods synergistically amplify externally imposed stressors, most notably public policies of disinvestment. The amplification, a short-time version of stochastic resonance, may be quite large. </jats:p><jats:p> Our work implies that continued subjection of marginalized US urban minority neighborhoods to public policies of ‘planned shrinkage’ can trigger similar but larger scale—regional and national—transitions in patterns of public health and public order, ultimately placing much of the three quarters of the country's population living in or near central cities at significantly increased risk. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A triangulation-based path planning algorithm for a mobile robot is presented. A circular robot operating in a planar polygonal environment cluttered with polygonal obstacles is considered. The free space of the robot consists of a polygonal region with polygonal holes. A method called bridge building is presented for triangulating a simple polygon with polygonal holes. The free working space of the robot is thus triangulated, resulting in an exact cell decomposition. This enables a triangulation graph to be constructed, representing the topological connectivity of the free space, from which safe paths from the start to the goal can be found. The paths are contained within free channels bounded by the obstacles and the environmental boundaries. An important feature of the process is that many segments of a selected path are parallel to the environmental boundaries. This would enable relatively simple sensing devices, such as ultrasonic sensors, to be used for correcting navigation errors. The algorithm is computationally efficient, being of O( n<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) complexity. </jats:p>",
