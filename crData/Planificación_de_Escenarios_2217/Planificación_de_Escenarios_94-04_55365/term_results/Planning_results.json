      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the possible benefits of combining transportation planning models with geographic information systems (GIS) in the hope that integrating these systems can alleviate the inherent problems of transporta tion planning models, such as user unfriendli ness, labor intensiveness, and theoretical limitations. Specifically, this paper focuses on the issue of incompatibility between GIS and conventional transportation planning models in dealing with network topologies. Resolving this conflict in topologies is a cornerstone for eliminating the user-unfriendliness and labor-intensiveness problems. This paper presents the development of an algorithm that converts GIS topology into transportation network topology. The FORTRAN-based topology conversion algorithm generates transportation networks from GIS carto graphic files and establishes a communication channel between the two systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Public programs for population dispersal are usually based on macro approaches to economic development in the target area. Such programs have failed to reach their goals in many countries, and, therefore, there is a demand for knowledge regarding alternative forms of intervention. In this paper an innovative micro approach is suggested, the principles of which are based on findings reported in the economic and sociological literature on individual migration decisions. This approach was implemented in the central Galilee region in Israel. In the early 1980s fifty-two small communities were established in the Galilee, each with a unique organizational, social, and economic structure suited to the specific requirements and expectations of its settlers. The plan succeeded in attracting the desired type of population (young, highly educated) to the region, and the newcomers viewed the new communities as their permanent homes. Based on this experience and on the analysis of relevant literature, a development strategy of tailor-made community planning is hereby recommended for future projects. It is especially appropriate in the context of developed countries with a slow to zero population growth and with spreading social norms of the postindustrial society. </jats:p>",

Indicators for emergency, clinical, diagnostic and medico‐legal services have been defined. Wide variability of global hospital activities was observed. Variability of turnover rate and bed occupancy was much more than length of stay. Combined utilization and productivity analysis showed that all outlying hospitals were either in the low turnover, low occupancy group or in the high turnover, high occupancy group. Low productivity or inadequate hospital capacity seem to be the major problems. All low turnover, low occupancy hospitals also had low levels of outpatient consultations, and high turnover, high occupancy hospitals had above‐average outpatient activity. About 40 per cent of hospitals did not provide emergency services. About 10 per cent of hospitals were not performing any diagnostic tests. Strengthening emergency service delivery capacity, as well as diagnostic facilities, could improve productivity and capacity utilization. Extremes of turnover and occupancy were not associated with any particular case‐mix pattern. Thus, neither poor productivity and capacity utilization nor overcrowding can be explained by case‐mix differences. Problems of poor performance and inadequate capacity seem to be real.</jats:p>",

However, there is only fragmentary empirical evidence on the revenue, quality and cost effects of cost‐recovery policies in the health care sector. Using parameter estimates from cost and demand functions that were derived from data from a facility and household interview survey in Ogun State, Nigeria, this article simulates various cost‐recovery scenarios for the public sector. The empirical results of the simulations show that, under certain realistic scenarios, cost recovery will generate additional revenue <jats:italic>and</jats:italic> improve quality.

In light of this literature and observations made at Seaside, Florida—the prototypic example of the TND movement—this paper concludes that developments which attempt to adapt TND elements to the realities of modern lifesryles and a metropolitan context will further test TND assumptions and result in compromises necessary for the evolution of the paradigm. </jats:p>",

When pregnant women have complications, their infants are at greater risk of becoming ill, permanently disabled or dying. For every maternal death, there are at least 20 infant deaths: stillbirths, neonatal or postneonatal deaths. Altogether, an estimated 7 million infants each year die perinatally (stillborn or deaths within the first week of life). Low cost, feasible, and effective intervention strategies include: a) improved family planning and abortion services; b) obstetric care at delivery; and, c) prenatal services</jats:p><jats:p>Two hypothetical populations of one million (a low mortality and a high mortality country) are used to illustrate maternal and perinatal program strategies and priorities. In countries with high fertility, major reductions in maternal and infant deaths result both from reductions in the number of pregnancies through family planning and from improved obstetric care. Where fertility is already low, reductions result almost entirely from improved obstetric and prenatal care. The investments required are relatively low, while the potential gains are great. The cost to avert each death in a high mortality population is estimated between $800 and $1500 or as low as $0.50 per capita per year</jats:p><jats:p>The priorities for programs targeting maternal and perinatal health depend on demographic, ecologic and economic factors, and should include the promotion of good health, not merely the avoidance of death.

Average, average incremental and marginal unit costs for standard, shortcourse and retreatment regimens with and without hospitalization have been measured. The average incremental cost per year of life saved through chemotherapy ranged from US $O.90–3.10. In all conditions, short‐course chemotherapy is preferable to standard 12‐month chemotherapy. When hospitalization during the intensive phase of chemotherapy increases the cure rate by 10–15 percentage points, it can be relatively cost‐effective. Analysing the cost‐effectiveness of short‐course and standard chemotherapy, where the depth of the margin of benefit is different, illustrates some of the dangers of simplistic use of cost‐effectiveness ratios.</jats:p>",

The Randstad has a central position in the West European urban core region. National physical planning policies are strongly focused on the Randstad. A number of strategic projects are being developed to promote the attractiveness of the Randstad. At the same time, initiatives have been taken to strengthen the administrative cohesion within the Randstad. We show that the coordination between different strategic projects is weak and that priorities are unclear. A strategic plan for the Randstad is presented, aimed at a strengthening of its international position and its environmental qualities. </jats:p>",

This considerable resource base is the target of planned EOR projects. Although contractor specific field evaluations have been carried out, no previous study has addressed the potential EOR contribution to the Malaysian reserves mix on a broad national scale attempted herein. This paper therefore examines the potential Malaysian reserves additions through the application of suitable EOR technologies. In doing so, the paper proposes a comprehensive approach to reservoir screening and selection of technically feasible and economically viable reservoir-specific EOR processes for Malaysian fields.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results of a screening study indicate that carbon dioxide and hydrocarbon miscible gas displacement processes are the most attractive EOR technology for large scale application in Malaysian reservoirs. Data on resource evaluation, allocation and utilization of natural gases in Malaysia, have been reviewed as to the availability of injectant supplies. These data indicate that significant carbon dioxide supplies in gas fields offshore Peninsular Malaysia and surplus natural gas supplies in Sarawak and Sabah states, provide the injectant needed for commercial miscible displacement operations. Carbon dioxide injectant is preferred for Peninsular Malaysia as it is in close promixity to potential user fields, while natural gas is reserved for onshore industrial and other commercial uses.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Given certain assumptions regarding development timing and industry cooperation, it is found feasible that incremental oil reserves additions of up to three billion barrels could be achieved within fifteen years through the application of proven gas injection technology. The effects of improved reservoir management, for example, better residual oil saturation determination, improved reservoir characterization and more accurate reservoir simulation, have not been factored into this total. However, the realization of these EOR reserves will be predicated upon a broad spectrum of economic, technological and policy constraints, which will require the concerted efforts of both industry and national energy policy makers. This paper also presents details of the constraints which must be removed in order to maximize the benefits of the EOR technologies and associated reserves for Malaysia.</jats:p>",

It traces the history of coalition formation around the Randstad and its complement, the Green Heart. At the heart of growth management is the unparallelled public involvement in land policy and in housing. This paper also shows that coalition building around growth management is pre-programmed in intergovernmental relations and in arrangements to overcome 'individual ministerial responsibility'. Light is also cast on the division of society into ideological blocs and the Dutch welfare state. However, these days, Dutch corporate democracy seems to have few friends. Wholesale reform is being discussed, and so Dutch planners may lose their advantage. Randstad may continue to be seen as their international trademark. Internally, it may lose its appeal and become ever more diffuse in reality. However, a revival of the Randstad/Green Heart idea cannot be excluded either. </jats:p>",

The rehabilitation of degraded land includes a stabilization and a restoration phase, with corresponding measures to be taken and funding modalities to be explored. Restoration measures focus on the rehabilitation of ecosystem functions, but are effective only when preceded or accompanied by measures stabilizing exploitation levels. Short‐term benefits are required to ensure local participation, but may be counterproductive when long‐term ecological rehabilitation is the major objective. Incentives are important policy instruments to enhance participation by rural communities in rehabilitation activities. Long‐term economic, ecological and social (humanitarian) arguments, at a scale surpassing the local level, should receive more attention in the process of justifying investments for land rehabilitation. Some criteria and conditions to be met both at a macro‐scale and at the local level are discussed.</jats:p>",

A closer examination reveals significant differences among them in terms of the state's relations to capital, labour, and the external economy that not only defy reduction to a single model but also show that options for moving away from labour-intensive segments of production for world markets vary considerably. Furthermore, as democratisation movements gain voice, and as the transnationalisation of capital from within these economies proceeds, the high degree of autonomy associated with the developmental state is eroding, and its authoritarian uses of power are increasingly being challenged. </jats:p>",

Specifically, new commercial and office developments are mushrooming along the major traffic arteries. Peripheral centers without a center have sprung up. In this paper, urban forms are described in relation to the architectural form. The new urban form comes with a specific aesthetic programme: the architecture and the planning design of the industrial and office centers in the periphery defy the mass-produced built environment of earlier suburbanization. Rather, ‘individualized’ architectural designs lend themselves to custom-made commercialization of the new urban landscape. Buildings increasingly become billboards which are strategically placed along freeways and rail lines. Finally, in what seems a marked difference to automobile-based peripheral centralization in North America and other parts of Europe, the Swiss example depends heavily on a state-managed expansion of the railroads and light-rail systems. </jats:p>",

First, the context in which performance measurement in the housing service in the United Kingdom has developed is set and lessons are drawn from the use of statutory indicators following the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. By examining the performance indicator regime in Wales it is suggested that the regime is flawed because it provides information which points towards the economic efficiency of service provision rather than explaining the effectiveness of services. This is compounded by the multiple audience that the performance indicator regime is targeted at: tenants, local government, and central government. The conflict arising from the multiple target groups results in the regime being unable to serve properly its primary audience, that is, tenants. To conclude the paper, some alternatives are suggested, and the need for performance indicators to be seen as tools for evaluating the relative efficiency and effectiveness of local authority housing management over time is highlighted. </jats:p>",

Special focus is placed on the textile and apparel industry and the changes it underwent in the 1980s. Rapid increases in wages, labour disputes, currency revaluation, and the high financial costs resulting from high interest rates and a vulnerable financial structure were the most significant triggers. A decline in the rate of increase of labour productivity and shortages of production workers arising from changes in work attitude were also regarded as important triggers. Industrial restructuring in the Seoul metropolitan region has resulted in significant changes in local labour-market structure because of the different labour requirements arising from changes in production systems and organisation. It has also resulted in an altered industrial composition, with a decline in the labour-intensive sector, organisational changes from an increase in subcontraction of production, and different locations. Major corporate strategies under industrial restructuring are discussed in relation to changes in production systems, and product structure, expansion of the internal market, subcontracting and flexible specialisation, job training, and foreign direct investments. </jats:p>",

Six pelvic computed tomography (CT) data cubes were manually segmented akin to current radiotherapy practice on three occasions and the mean times for each data cube recorded to provide baseline measurements. The same images were then segmented using the new region growing algorithm, backed up by manual segmentation and contour editing tools where necessary, and the times compared with the baseline for each data cube. The results confirm that this algorithm can decrease segmentation times by a factor of 2.4 without compromising the quality of the final plan (p &amp;lt;0.0001). Most of this time gain is from a rapid segmentation of the pelvic bones and external contour rather than the soft tissues of the pelvis. We conclude that such algorithms will be of value for segmenting large pelvic CT data cubes for radiotherapy planning by making the procedure less labour intensive.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Olsson's recent paper “Chiasm of thought-and-action” represents a patriarchal form of ‘thought-and-action’. It provides a clear illustration of Rose's argument that masculinist geographical knowledge remains held in tension between voyeurism and narcissism. Although it would seem to cast itself as a bold Nietschzean struggle against the norms of bourgeois culture, Olsson's writing effectively reaffirms the masculinist imperialism upon which such culture is predicated. It exemplifies how the libertine's rebellion remains limited within certain phallogocentric battlements that it only succeeds to further entrench. This critical argument—borrowed in part from the critique of Lacan by the French feminist Irigaray—introduces other questions about Lacan also applicable to Olsson's writing concerning the work of the French psychoanalyst. In particular, the way in which Lacan's account of subjectivity seems to dehistoricise and fix the fate of a universalised ‘subject’ within a world stilled by symbolicism would appear to find a reflection jubilantly seized and extended in the insubstantial shape of Olsson's diagrams of human action. These reified spatial abstractions are nonetheless open to critical receding as recent feminist, lesbian and gay theories have shown. Such recoding indicates how critical theory—despite a widespread antitheoreticism that is vindicated by papers like Olsson's—might still assist any project to escape the dessicated and dead ends collected together in something like the herbarium dreamt as the “Chiasm of thought-and-action”. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the current period of urbanization, which to a higher degree than ever before blurs conventional notions of core and periphery, is explored. Cities today appear as multicentered, nodal, flexible, and global. These trends are examined in the case of Frankfurt, with reference to the concepts developed by world city theory, regulation theory, and from the discourse on space and restructuring. Frankfurt presently faces two kinds of growth and two discourses on growth. First, the expansion of the citadel of the world city and, second, the expansion of world-city-related growth into the periphery. Central and peripheral growth are linked in an oscillating movement of mutually reinforcing dynamics. Examples of peripheral urbanization are presented, with emphasis on the specific role of the airport as a new node of development. In this paper the articulation of these growth dynamics with the local political space of the northern fringe of the municipality of Frankfurt, where rapid restructuring of the urban landscape is under way, is examined. It is argued that the new dynamics of growth which affects the urban periphery in an unprecedented way calls for a new regional mode of regulation. </jats:p>",

When children are deficient in their developmental milestones, it is of concern to their parents.

Intervention requires strategies that use a variety of techniques, dependent on the presentation of symptoms. The level of illness in the parents must also be taken into account because they too may need intervention. Intervention strategies are outlined according to the pattern of delay. </jats:p>",

It is based on the knowledge of the femoral position in relation to the X-ray film, obtained with a lateral radiographic view, and on mathematical calculation to obtain the X-ray focus height and position. Also in the case of a flexed and externally rotated hip, the non-uniform longitudinal and transverse magnifications can be measured. </jats:p>",

There are three characteristics to this pattern: (1) vertical restructuring, that is, upgraded items are continually innovated by Japanese parents; (2) horizontal restructuring, that is, the production of each item is transferred to Asian affiliates after a certain time lag; (3) the time lag in the transfer of the production of an item to Asian affiliates has been shortened, and Asian affiliates have achieved product upgrading at a faster pace than have the Japanese parents. These characteristics will be described in detail for two product lines: video cassette recorders and capacitors. Then some supporting evidence is presented for the third characteristic of this pattern of restructuring. Further, this third trend is explained in association with the change in cost conditions which have arisen from recent high-growth performance in the region. In other words, in the recent dynamism in the Asia-Pacific Basin, the horizontal restructuring of Japanese MNEs has tended to become faster in terms of production transfer. </jats:p>",

The suggestion is that Olsson is striving to escape from what he regards as the ‘flatland’ in which much current social thought is entrenched, and is thereby seeking an altogether less-constraining ‘spaccland’ which will allow him to understand quite ‘other’ truths about the connections between the abstract (the immaterial) and the concrete (the material), I outline something of what Olsson's new conceptual geometry entails, but at the same time question the extent to which this geometry carries with it problems not so different from those that bedevilled ‘spatial science’. Furthermore, I argue that Olsson's will to think ever more abstractly—and in so doing to take his geometry into abstracted realms strangely removed from the contexts of everyday human life—separates him from precisely those everyday contexts in which people cannot help but be ‘philosophers’ dealing with the imponderables of taboos, power, truth, and morality in order simply to ‘get by’. </jats:p>",

Community-level programs have emerged as part of this trend. Communities are, however, dynamic, complex, and fluid. Describing community prevention efforts within the bounds of “normal” science has rendered invisible certain important features. We combined open- and close-ended research methods to study the grassroots prevention efforts of ten communities in the upper midwest. Three basic questions formed our inquiry: 1) how were community prevention actions constructed or planned?; 2) toward whom were these actions aimed?; and 3) what were the major success and problems in carrying out prevention actions? A central finding was the existence of an automatic yet tacit “filtering” process whereby certain people became involved in prevention while others did not. This “us versus them” pattern was expressed as a major barrier to the effectiveness and sustainability of community prevention efforts. Existing as informal, “everyday” knowledge, this problem has largely been rendered invisible by the heavy reliance on close-ended, “check the box” communication between the researcher and the researched. </jats:p>",
