The field of radiation from a single port was stored as a matrix in a library of punched cards, and a sorter and accounting machine were used to combine various fields for rotation, cycling and multi-port therapy. This system was in continuous routine use from then until 1961, when the equipment was replaced by a Bendix G15-D digital computer. Subsequent work by Sterling [2] followed essentially the same method of describing the radiation field as used by the Physics staff at Memorial Hospital [1], except that more powerful equipment has been used. An analytic expression for the dose distribution produced by rotation had been previously applied successfully in 1951 to treatment planning with high-energy X-rays [3].</jats:p>",
