      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article critiques capital market liberalization policies for inhibiting planning and producing results that are negative for many people throughout the world. Capital market liberalization is part of a broader set of economic development policies that constitute a development model that fails to distribute benefits and costs of economic integration in a manner that improves living standards for people most in need. After a discussion of trends in capital flows, the author critiques the theory behind liberalization in terms of limits placed on demand-side public policies, its narrow efficiency criterion, and its tendency to crowd out socially useful investment in favor of short-term returns. The article concludes with a discussion of national and regional planning implications and argues that liberalization is antiplanning because it limits the use of traditional planning policies. The author also considers alternatives including those implied by the development activity of the European Union and a new hemispheric proposal, Alternatives for the Americas. </jats:p>",

To this end, a content analysis of sixty-nine planning syllabi was conducted to identify how and to what extent global themes are being included. The analysis highlighted the interdisciplinary nature of globalized planning pedagogy and the greater emphasis on planning theory and history and economic development. The courses were clustered according to common themes, and these are discussed as they relate to planning practice. Noteworthy pedagogical approaches are highlighted. </jats:p>",

It was started in the 1960s as a “growth pole” in an isolated part of Venezuela, built around a large steel plant and hydroelectric projects. In the 1990s, the model of planning shifted from centralized to decentralized as a result of the election victories of a radical political party and neoliberal restructuring that weakened central government. The story of this dramatic change contains lessons for planning in the context of the recent wave of expansion in the global economy. </jats:p>",

For this, a global, one-world approach to planning education is proposed using mutual learning and the comparative method. This is relevant for students with both domestic and international careers. A review of practitioners’ and educators’ views reveals broad support. However, small schools in particular have difficulty adopting this approach. The planning school at the University of Guelph is a work in progress about how such schools can do so. It has globalized despite small size and resource cutbacks. Challenges remain. Fitting adequate content into a two-year program is a struggle. North-south inequities undermine mutual learning. The global relevance of the approach is untested. </jats:p>",

A number of such properties are discussed in order to construct four agency profiles corresponding to the values and basic ideas of synoptic, incremental, communicative, and advocacy planning. The four identified configurations of style and structure can (1) be theoretical reference points when analysing constellations of planning style and agency characteristics found in practice, and (2) be used for forming hypotheses about such empirical constellations. The analysis responds to the critique raised against procedural planning theories for being abstract and context free and thus unfit to guide planning in real societies where public planning is embedded in particular organisations and institutions. Most of the organisational features dealt with here have been studied in the economic theory of organisation, and this facilitates the construction of consistent and coherent agency profiles. </jats:p>",

Two summary measures are estimated: the cumulative proportion of women of a given parity having a subsequent birth within 60 months of the previous birth (quintum), and the median length of the interval between successive births. The analysis indicates that in Yemen (where the total fertility rate exceeds seven children per woman of reproductive age), women begin childbearing at a relatively early age and a large proportion of ever‐manied women reach high parity at a relatively fast pace. Morocco and Egypt (with TFRs of 3.3 and 3.8 children per woman, respectively) are characterized by delay in the onset of childbearing, a slow pace of childbearing, and a smaller proportion of ever‐married women reaching high parity. In Algeria and Sudan (with TFRs of 4.4 and 4.6 children), delay in the onset of childbearing plays a larger role infertility reduction than do the tempo or the quantum of childbearing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we evaluate the experience of public participation in local transport planning in the United Kingdom. In the context of a new emphasis on participation in central government policy rhetoric and planning guidance, we examine the rationales, methods, and outcomes of recent public participation initiatives. Through drawing on a questionnaire survey distributed to all English highway authorities and a content analysis of provisional local transport policy documents, we explore not only the extent of activity and innovation in public participation, but identify and reflect upon the failures of current practice and the barriers which constrain further development. We conclude that, although examples of at least partial success in developing carefully conceptualised, inclusive, and meaningful participation programmes can be identified, most have been grounded in political expediency. Motivations for seeking public involvement have been instrumental in nature rather than drawing on wider substantive and normative arguments. It is suggested that issues relating to both the supply of opportunities and the level of demand have a role to play in understanding and potentially resolving current barriers to involvement. However, we also stress the need to step back from this dualistic analytical framework and instead to consider the significance of the broader political context and motivations for public participation. It is concluded that future developments in public participation will need to move beyond innovation in terms of technique alone, increasingly to engage with issues relating to the purpose of participation, the management of process and outcomes, and structural conditions which influence individual decisions about ‘taking part’. </jats:p>",

Findings indicate that an irreversible fortuity transition has started as the result of an emerging pattern of birth limitation and continued desire for the traditional long birth intervals. The data suggest that changes in childhood mortality in combination with an increase in women's education, although modest, have created a demand for fertility control among women; that induced abortion may be one of the means through which such demand is being met, particularly in urban areas; and that the economic crisis of the 1980s was the main catalyst that precipitated the onset of transition. Changes in reproductive preferences and practice suggest a diffusion process, from urban and more educated women to rural and less‐educated ones.</jats:p>",

The author’s contention is that despite the strength of global ideas, the global economy, and the power of international political systems and processes, the willingness and capacity of local government to adapt local planning systems to include citizen opinions and the power of local citizens—both women and men—to participate actively in local affairs in small, rural communities are more strongly influenced, at this time, by the nation-state and the individual community’s economic and political place within the nation-state. </jats:p>",

Three family planning regulations are considered: birth‐quota status, contraceptive use, and length of prior birth interval. The results of the study provide support for both compliance and sanction perspectives and suggest that by the late 1980s, the state was less willing than it had been previously to negotiate with couples who had had three children. Evidence is found of cooperation between couples and the state to ensure that each family had at least one son.</jats:p>",

Two of the studies were regional in scope (Leon and Managua) and focused specifically on women's experiences of violence, whereas the third study was a Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) conducted with a nationally representative sample of women. The lifetime prevalence estimates for women's undergoing physical violence from a partner were significantly higher in the Leon study (52 percent) and Managua study (69 percent), compared with that given in the DHS (28 percent). Possible explanations for the differences are examined through pooled multivariate logistic regression analysis, as well as analysis ofsix focus‐group discussions cairied out with field‐workers and staff from the three studies. The most important differences that were found concerned ethical and safety procedures and the interview setting. The results indicate that prevalence estimates for violence are highly sensitive to methodological factors, and that underreporting is a significant threat to validity.</jats:p>",

This study examines the extent to which the decline in abortion in Turkey can be attributed to increased use of modern contraceptives. Trends in induced abortion rates and in contraceptive use are examined among Turkish women together with fertility preferences, changes in the contraceptive behavior associated with abortion, and changes in the propensity to abort unwanted pregnancies. The analysis includes a number of simulations that examine what abortion levels might be in different contraceptive‐use scenarios. Results indicate that the decline in abortion is due to a decrease in the number of abortions associated with traditional method failure.

The present study was undertaken to identify key risk and protective factors for early sexual activity and unprotected sex among secondai‐y‐school students in nine large cities in Peru. Survey data from 6,962 students aged 13–18 are consistent with existing research in indicating that behaviors of Peruvian youth are influenced in important ways by many factors. In the present study, these included region of residence, family economic position, family structure, working for pay, peei‐ behaviors, and self‐esteem. Knowledge of pregnancy and of the risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases and of the means of avoiding both did not, however, differentiate risk‐takers from non‐risk‐takers. The study findings suggest a need fen‐ adolescent health programs to broaden their focus beyond the immediate proximate determinants of behavior, such as sexual and reproductive health knowledge and access to contraceptives, and also to target some of the key contextual factors influencing adolescent behavior.</jats:p>",

These plans are, for the most part, well thought out and detailed. As a result, along with extensive training and exercise programs, industry preparedness is better than it has ever been to respond to and manage an emergency. But how well prepared is industry to handle the business or operational continuity aspects of a crisis or emergency? What plans are in place to deal with the requirement for continuing essential business functions in the face of a disaster? If a major incident occurs to a refinery, terminal, or offshore production platform that requires it to be taken off-line, or damages it beyond repair, are there plans in place to minimize the impacts on the rest of the organization and on the downstream customers? How will this be done simultaneously while managing the response?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper addresses those needs and discusses the requirements that companies in the oil and chemical industry should consider in developing business and operational continuity plans. It explains a multi-step planning process that is being used by many companies around the world to maintain their business edge when a crisis or disaster strikes. This planning process includes such functions as conducting a risk analysis and business impact analysis, developing mitigation and recovery strategies, drafting a continuity plan, developing an awareness program, and building a training and exercising program. The paper also looks at the similarities between business and operational continuity plans and a company's emergency or crisis management plan and address ways in which the plans may be integrated.</jats:p>",

The incident of the multitank Ascania is used in the paper to illustrate how this decision process works in a real spill using 24-hours-a-day, 7-days-a-week, 366-days-a-year response services. The role of software tools for providing rapid, reliable, and relevant information is discussed within the context of these tools being used by trained emergency responders. The paper then illustrates how scenario analysis and running marine chemical spill exercises can be used to plan for a response to chemical spills.</jats:p>",

The government’s assumption is that this approach to decision making will lead to improvements in performance. Although the theoretical costs and benefits of rational planning have been widely debated in the public administration literature, no systematic empirical research on the impact of planning on the performance of public organizations has been conducted. By contrast, the relationship between rational planning and the success of private firms has been investigated extensively. A meta‐analysis and critical review of this evidence suggests that planning is generally associated with superior performance. However, important questions remain unresolved. For example, under what circumstances does planning work best, and which elements of planning are most important? Therefore, although it may be appropriate to encourage public agencies to consider carefully the potential benefits of planning, rational processes should not be imposed upon them.</jats:p>",

OPA 90 changed the fundamental structure of this vitally important planning tool used to articulate the policies and arrangements for oil spill and hazardous material release in a geographic area. A new plan, called an Area Contingency Plan (ACP), was envisioned to be developed by Area Committees that generally include the principle stakeholders in an area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>By and large, the ACP process is working, although the quality of plans varies greatly around the United States. A new planning concept, however, currently in use by some of the leading and most successful businesses in the world, has yet to find its way into planning for oil spills and hazardous substance releases. That new concept, scenario planning, creates the means for capturing the potential for a variety of futures without attempting to predict the future.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The Julian N spill in Portland, Maine in 1996 was considered a success in large measure because the incident followed on the heels of a scenario-driven area exercise. Scenario planning formalizes that process in such a way as to make the ACP reflect the consensus—what incidents might occur, what are the critical areas of concern, and how might they be dealt with in an efficient way. It brings together the response community and others in a way that ensures participation, understanding, and cooperation in the planning process when it is most needed—before an incident occurs.</jats:p>",

From where we are today it is impossible to foresee the answers to these questions. Nonetheless, spatial planning, which in its very essence and function is anticipatory, is duty bound to seek approaches which will allow it successfully to act within, and to interact with, the future landscape. The following text explores one of these potential approaches as it reflects on the possibilities for spatial planning which may be inherent in an approach which interprets the landscape as a “service for service-providers”.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Oil spills in industrialized cities pose a significant threat to their urban water environment. The largest city in Canada, the city of Toronto, has an average 300–500 oil spills per year with an average total volume of about 160,000 L/year. About 45% of the spills was eventually cleaned up. Given the enormous amount of remaining oil entering into the fragile urban ecosystem, it is important to develop an effective pollution prevention and control plan for the city. A Geographic Information System (GIS) planning model has been developed to characterize oil spills and determine preventive and control measures available in the city. A database of oil spill records from 1988 to 1997 was compiled and geo-referenced. Attributes to each record such as spill volume, oil type, location, road type, sector, source, cleanup percentage, and environmental impacts were created. GIS layers of woodlots, wetlands, watercourses, Environmental Sensitive Areas, and Areas of Natural and Scientific Interest were obtained from the local Conservation Authority. By overlaying the spill characteristics with the GIS layers, evaluation of preventive and control solutions close to these environmental features was conducted. It was found that employee training and preventive maintenance should be improved as the principal cause of spills was attributed to human errors and equipment failure. Additionally, the cost of using oil separators at strategic spill locations was found to be $1.4 million. The GIS model provides an efficient planning tool for urban oil spill management. Additionally, the graphical capability of GIS allows users to integrate environmental features and spill characteristics in the management analysis.</jats:p>",

The behavior of heavy oil in water complicates aspects of spill response including location, mapping and containment of spilled oil; assessment of environmental and economic impacts; responder health and safety; prediction of oil movement; comparison of alternative response methods; and measurement and documentation of cleanup effectiveness. Experience shows that the techniques and equipment needed to respond to heavy oil spills are highly specific to the spill location and circumstances of the spill, accentuating the importance of preincident planning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Sound planning is one of the most important tools available for implementing an effective response to oil spills and minimizing their impacts. In this paper response strategies that have been utilized in nonfloating oil spills are examined, and the relative advantages and disadvantages of techniques and equipment employed in those incidents are discussed. The intent of this examination is to help emergency response planners recognize response methods that have worked under conditions they are likely to encounter so they can plan accordingly.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe patents system provides a suitable instrument for monitoring and analysing developments both of a technological/scientific and of an economic nature. It also lends itself for application in connection with the analysis of the spatial distribution of inventiveness. The common aim of the studies reported on in this article is to gain a greater understanding of the spatial structure of patenting activity, of the R&amp;D activities associated with this, and of the innovative potential which it lays bear. An even greater insight can be gleaned if the patent data is considered in a more discriminatory fashion, distinguishing for example between spatial units, patent-claimant registration categories, technical categories and periods of observation, and if this data is linked to further data on such matters as population, type of employment, and research and development activity. The findings of these studies reveal the spatial distribution and the substantive structure of inventiveness — and the fruits it bears — to be quite specific in character and to be patterned by a variety of determining factors.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

No such study has been reported on companies operating in the ASEAN countries. This paper reports the findings of a case study research on this issue which was conducted on seven global companies operating in Singapore. Two frameworks were applied to analyze the nature and extent of integration of environmental management practices into the organizational strategic planning process. The study reveals that the majority of the sample companies have well‐developed environmental management systems in place which satisfies the requirements of the strategic planning criterion of the (Singapore) business excellence framework. These companies are also found to be actively engaged in at least four of the five best practices of environmental leadership framework suggested by Dechant and Altman.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we propose several improvements by describing a new architecture that involves sophisticated planning processes at different levels of the ITS processing and by decomposing the tutor into two different components, one specialized in the tutorial actions planning and the other tailored for the generation of multimedia presentations. Moreover, the user interface is made more robust and flexible thanks in part to the use of planning techniques. These improvements are built on Nkambou, Gauthier and Lefebvre's architecture, but we believe that the most of the important ideas discussed herein may also be exploited in other architectures.</jats:p>",

An  e‐business architecture planning model is developed by identifying 12 generic e‐business models and three axes on which drivers of the information architecture needs of e‐business firms fall. Sowa and Zachman’s information architecture is augmented to further facilitate e‐business information systems architecture planning.</jats:p>",

Both migratory birds and marine mammals move freely between Alaska in the United States and British Columbia in Canada, in the international boundary area known as Dixon Entrance in the North Pacific Ocean. An oil spill on one side of the border may be carried by winds and/or currents into the waters of the adjacent country. Recognition of these facts resulted in the development of the Canada/United States Joint Marine Pollution Contingency Plan, which was signed by the Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) in 1974. Annexes were subsequently prepared for five transboundary areas, including Dixon Entrance. Following the promulgation of these annexes, joint exercises have been held to enhance annex implementation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In September 1999, at the request of the USCG and CCG, the U.S. Department of the Interior, Alaska Office of Environmental Policy and Compliance (DOI-OEPC) took the lead in organizing and chairing a workshop to discuss issues associated with wildlife response activities for oil spills that cross the Canada/United States border in Dixon Entrance. The workshop was held in Prince Rupert, British Columbia as part of a 4-day joint meeting. Workshop participants included representatives from key U.S. federal and Alaska State wildlife resource agencies, Canadian federal wildlife resource agencies, oil spill cooperatives for Southeast Alaska and British Columbia, and the USCG.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Wildlife resource agency representatives participating in the workshop reached consensus that the goal of wildlife protection is to make decisions based on what is best for the wildlife resources and then to determine how the goal can be accomplished within the constraints of each countries regulatory process. Agreement was reached to form a Canada/United States working group to develop a joint wildlife response plan. The plan, which will focus on migratory birds and sea otters, will address issues associated with the removal of dead oiled wildlife from the environment, hazing of unoiled wildlife, preemptive capture of sea otters, and capture and treatment of oiled migratory birds and sea otters. A draft plan will be developed prior to a September 2000, Canada/U.S. Dixon Entrance (CANUSDIX) joint meeting, which will be held in Ketchikan, Alaska.</jats:p>",

Taking as its point of departure current trends in settlement structure in the areas around metropolitan centres, and focusing on their significance for the structure and efficiency of functional linkages, this article looks in quite concrete terms into ways of fleshing out the settlement-structure strategy which envisages a region of “short distances”, and characterised by unusually low levels of private car use, in order to render it capable of contributing towards achieving a sustainable pattern of mobility in metropolitan regions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

While the two sides were able to reach a speedy and lasting agreement on content (general guidelines and aims for regional policy and joint spatial development), the search for a suitable institutional form for co-operation developed into something of a “march through the institutions”. In the end, the political will to unify both states solved the problem of institutional form: as a “partial merger”, the amalgamation of the planning authorities of both states to create the Joint Spatial Development Department was intended to serve as an example of what could be achieved in the run-up to the referendum on “full merger” in May 1996. Berlin’s accretion of competences in the Joint Spatial Development Department has settled the controversy about the extension and the cut of sub-regional planning areas (a planning association for Berlin and its hinterland (Berlin) versus the so-called “pie-slice model” (Brandenburg)).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper \ndescribes a newly developed algorithm for CAD-based dimensional inspection path \nplanning utilizing coordinate measuring machines (CMMs). The algorithm guarantees to \nprovide optimum collision-free inspection probe paths by using the topological \nstructure of the boundary representation (B-rep) solid CAD models of \nthe inspected parts. A concept of automatic generation of optimum \nand collision free path in three dimensional space using available \nCAD database is proposed. The algorithm is generic for generating \nprobe path over prismatic polyhedral parts. It serves as a \nprincipal part of the inspection path planning system. It is \nbased on the modified ray tracing technique which uses a \nB-Rep data from any geometric modeling systems. Between start point \nand target point, an imaginary ray is established and if \nan intersection with part is encountered, an optimal detour path \nis created avoiding interference of the probe with the part. \nThe generated path consists of linear segments joining start point \nand target point by various intermediate points. To locate these \nintermediate points in the consideration space, topological and geometrical structures \nof the part models are used at the time of \ndecision making. To examine and implement the algorithm, a user-friendly \napplication is developed employing AutoCAD Runtime Extension (ARX) development environment \nwith object oriented programming (OOP) techniques, running on a Windows \nNT workstation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified \nby the results of the implementation demonstrating optimum collision-free dimensional \ninspection path generation for four representative prismatic part models. All \nin all, this work contributes to the knowledge-base formation of \nautomated dimensional inspection research area and paves a way for \nthe integration of CMMs into a CAD/CAM environment, thus automate \nthe process of design, manufacturing and quality assurance.</jats:p>",

To expedite oil export, the entrance to the lake was dredged beginning in 1938 and reached its present depth (14 m or 45 ft) in 1960 to permit the utilization of Lakemax oil tankers. The deeper channel, however, also altered the water quality of the lake, principally raising salinity and influencing the development of an anoxic zone. Several solutions to these changes have been suggested including reclosure of the channel, therefore excluding tankers.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This multiyear study focused on determining the quantity and sources of contaminants entering Lake Maracaibo, and then applied several computer models to determine short- and long-term changes in water quality due to modifications of the entry channel and in contaminant loadings. The final part of the study included development and cost analysis of alternative pathways to continue the transport of oil, coal, petrochemicals, and general cargo to and from the lake.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results indicate that the oil industry contribution to contamination is minor compared to that from domestic discharges at the north end and from river inputs to the south, and that changes in channel configuration (including restoration to the predredged condition) do not improve water quality significantly. A concerted effort is needed to reduce land-based contamination to ensure any sustained improvement of the lake's water quality.</jats:p>",

For the Internet strategy, the three options translate into certain actions on the marketplace and in the adoption of specific information technologies. The technology analysis observes the frequency of OFX adoption among the sample population based on the published list of software vendors (Quicken and Microsoft). The pricing analysis is based on each financial institution’s retail transaction account price as calculated through a defined process using the fee structure of the account. The obtained data are then used for an empirical test for any relationships between the adoption of OFX transactional technology and pricing of retail transaction accounts. </jats:p>",

Least‐Cost Planning, however, may offer valuable insights for creating regulatory frameworks for competitive electricity markets. This paper examines some lessons which may be extracted from an analysis of the Least‐Cost Planning experience in the USA and suggests how these lessons might prove beneficial in guiding Australia's electricity industry reform. This analysis demonstrates how market‐based reforms may be flawed if they ignore the history of previous reform processes.</jats:p>",

Among the four major parts of Taguchi experiment, the planning phase includes the most important decision-making issues such as determination of experi ment objectives, quality characteristics, and control factors. The planning phase, however, has not been paid proper attention by experi ment designers. We have developed ADTEP (Agent-based Decision-supporting system for Taguchi Experiment Planning) to facilitate the planning tasks of experiment designer. ADTEP is composed of two agent-based mechanisms. The first employs an Internet agent that collects the domain knowledge from knowledge providers who may be distributed in remote places. Another agent then visualizes the collected knowledge and reports it to the experiment designer. Engineers who would normally have difficulties in collaborating because of limitations on their time or because they are in different places can easily work together in the same experiment team and brainstorm to make good decisions. The second agent-based mechanism offers context-sensitive advice generated by another intelligent agent dur ing the experiment planning process. It prevents the experiment designer from making mistakes, which will increase the feasibility of the experiment and minimize the unnecessary expense of time and resources. </jats:p>",

Wildlife planners in a few states, such as California and Alaska, have committed considerable resources to develop statewide goals, best practices, and standards for wildlife planning and have also described tactical implementation for wildlife protection. In most areas of the United States, however, planning for protection and rehabilitation of wildlife is limited to listing the name and phone number of the regional wildlife volunteer organization.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>How is “success” achieved for wildlife protection and rehabilitation? Wildlife Resource Management Agencies have a responsibility to support the ACP planning process as well as to tell industry what they expect them to accomplish during an oil spill. Without goals and some tangible definition of success it is not possible for planners neither to determine if they have done adequate planning nor to determine if any given spill response actually met the Wildlife Resource Management Agency's expectations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Wildlife Resource Management Agencies should provide the Area Committees with appropriate wildlife protection and response goals, recommended protocols, and best practices. The objective of the February 2001 workshop funded by the Prince William Sound Oil Spill Recovery Institute (OSRI) is to develop national standards and protocols relative to migratory birds affected or potentially affected by an oil spill. Perhaps these protocols and standards could be published in a National Wildlife Plan.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A National Wildlife Plan should enable the Area Committee to identify at least three things: (1) appropriate goals, such as which sensitive wildlife resources are most at risk and should be protected; (2) appropriate protocols and strategies for the protection and rehabilitation of wildlife including countermeasures to protect wildlife habitats and the most useful wildlife hazing and preemptive capture strategies to protect the maximum number of the most critical resources; and (3) levels of wildlife protection and response resources needed to accomplish these strategies.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The building of a National Wildlife Plan will require a thoughtfully structured consensus process. One method would be for representatives of Wildlife Resource Management Agencies to actively participate in workshops or in an ecological risk assessment process designed to reach consensus on a wide range of wildlife issues.</jats:p>",

In practice, informational limitations and cognitive bounds may force firms to sequentially solve the two problems. For example, a firm may plan capacity using limited demand information, and update prices subsequently once additional demand information becomes available. In a simple setting, we characterize the economic loss due to such sequential planning. We use simulation experiments to assess the extent of this loss in more complex settings. We find a relatively low loss if the firm plans for capacity using limited demand information and subsequently adjusts product prices to reflect realized market conditions. However, even “reasonable” restrictions on the subsequent price adjustment (e.g., constraining adjusted prices to always exceed full cost) lead to significant economic loss.</jats:p>",

Thus risks related to undesirable outcomes such as kick and blowout are also influenced. It is however questionable whether the ruling practices for use of quantitative risk analyses in planning of the operations keep up with this development. As the nature of the operations change drastically, use of overall statistics from earlier incidents hardly provides a satisfactory basis for decision making. Such statistics does not reflect the exposure of the specific well to the various kick and blowout mechanisms or the effect of measures introduced to reduce the probability of these mechanisms to occur. KickRisk, a new risk analysis tool with focus on kick and blowout is developed in order to improve the basis for risk-based well control planning. The idea behind this tool is a more detailed system modeling, which enables the planning to include more well- and operation-specific information in the analyses and to obtain a more differentiated risk description. Uncertainty is expressed through probabilities related to factors at a detailed system level and is propagated in kick and blowout probabilities through the logic of the model structure. The intention of this paper is to discuss the requirements for risk analysis methods with respect to kick and blowout in well planning and how these can be met in practice. The principles of the new tool KickRisk are described and the experiences from case studies on real wells are presented.</jats:p>",

McMurdo Station is the largest of all Antarctic facilities (&amp;gt; 1,300 people in summer, &amp;lt;200 people in winter) and has a storage capacity of over 11 million gallons. A single tanker arriving in February each year supplies fuel, which is augmented by a minor amount supplied by U.S. Coast Guard icebreaker. Waterborne spill response equipment is operationally hazardous to use because of broken ice conditions, limited open water, and difficulty of putting equipment into the water. Operating from shore is preferred as the station has extensive pumping, hose, and storage capability. During major spills, alternative response techniques, particularly burning, would be favorably considered. Additional support from outside Antarctica would not be expected to arrive for several days at best.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Outside of McMurdo Station, seasonal field camps are supplied by airlift, and oil is stored in metal drums placed within a containment area. Transport to South Pole Station is by skiequipped C-130 aircraft, and storage is in a new, multitank facility with containment. Oil spills on the ice sheet are unique in that the oil penetrates deep into the snow, making its capture and recovery very difficult. Additionally, because of subzero temperatures, response is very weather dependent, and protection is needed to fully avoid contact with the spilled material.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Compilation to Boolean satisfiability has become a powerful paradigm for solving artificial intelligence problems. However, domains that require metric reasoning cannot be compiled efficiently to satisfiability even if they would otherwise benefit from compilation. We address this problem by combining techniques from the artificial intelligence and operations research communities. In particular, we introduce the LCNF (Linear Conjunctive Normal Form) representation that combines propositional logic with metric constraints. We present LPSAT (Linear Programming plus SATisfiability), an engine that solves LCNF problems by interleaving calls to an incremental Simplex algorithm with systematic satisfaction methods. We explore several techniques for enhancing LPSAT's efficiency and expressive power by adjusting the interaction between the satisfiability and linear programming components of LPSAT. Next, we describe a compiler that converts metric \nresource planning problems into LCNF for processing by LPSAT. Finally, the experimental section of the paper explores several optimisations to LPSAT, including learning from constraint failure and randomised cutoffs.</jats:p>",

This paper considers the institutional structures within which such a directive would be implemented, structures far more complicated than those met by the project EIA Directive 97/11.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper reviews the existing but limited application of SEA to plans in Europe, in particular to regional plans, using an existing framework for the institutional analysis of integrated water management developed by Mitchell. The application of SEA to plans for regional structural funding by the European Commission, to regional and sub‐regional plans in England, the Netherlands and Spain, suggests that it is the overall context that influences the observed variations in both SEA and plan‐making practice. This highlights in particular the strength of the politico‐environmental lobby and the relative powers of planning, sectoral and environmental executives. Approaches to SEA can be modelled as incremental (The Netherlands), stapled (Spain) and concurrent (England). It is perhaps the latter model, an iterative and multi‐staged but ‘weaker’ approach to SEA, that offers a future route to a wider form of sustainability appraisal.</jats:p><jats:p>How well the more formal and ‘stronger’ application of SEA required by the European Union integrates into existing institutional structures remains to be seen.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I document and analyse the evolving firm size structure of the housebuilding industry in North America since World War 2, and place it in a wider context of industrial organisation. This is done first by synthesising the literature on housebuilding, particularly secondary data, to outline the industry's firm size and market share distributions. Second, the literature is extended with new and original data on the housebuilding industry for the province of Ontario, supplied by the Ontario New Home Warranty Program. The data are a complete annual census of builders in the province from 1978 through 1998. Using standard measures of industrial concentration and firm size classifications common to the housebuilding literature, Ontario is placed in the Canadian and North American contexts, to outline how housebuilding has evolved since World War 2. The main findings are that housebuilding shows no long-term trend toward rising market concentration. Rather, the industry's structure appears to change in cycles, while the largest firms have neither the growth rates nor the longevity to produce high levels of concentration common in other industries. On the basis of these findings, I suggest how insights into the firm size structure of housebuilding may benefit from, and contribute to, our understanding of social systems of production and discuss directions for future research. </jats:p>",

They suggest that such constraints derive from the distinctiveness of land as a commodity, the imperfect nature of the land market, the behavioural characteristics of landowners, and the institutional context for land ownership, exchange, and development. From this, they propose a common definition of ownership constraints as a basis for their practical classification. This divides ownership constraints between those that concern deficiencies in, or limitations to, the extent of ownership rights in potential development land and those that relate specifically to the strategies, interests, and actions of those who hold such rights. The various types of ownership constraints that fall under these headings are then explored, with research presented into the extent to which they each disrupted plans to use, market, develop, or purchase eighty large redevelopment sites in four British cities between 1991 and 1995. </jats:p>",

This study considers the perceptions of eighteen parents in rural New South Wales as a means of gathering data on the appropriateness of current service provision models for a range of rural settings. Parents identified cost, inflexibility of existing services, lack of specific service and distance as factors that need to be considered in planning for rural early childhood services. Innovative approaches for enriching experiences of children and families in the rural context were suggested by the participants: flexible use of existing facilities, more outreach services, programs to encourage local development of services, sporting and cultural opportunities and initiatives to entice trained experienced professionals to rural areas.</jats:p>"

It would help staff in supporting their clients if a simple method were available for measuring client participation. The present article describes the development of such a method and its use with one client in a routine IPP meeting. An IPP participation checklist (IPPPC) was developed to assess the participation of one client, Mr B, who has limited verbal communication skills, at his IPP meeting. A questionnaire for staff was also devised to gauge their perceptions of Mr B's participation at the same meeting. Mr B actively participated in much of the meeting; the IPPPC highlighted areas in which he did not participate. Staff members' ratings of his participation were in close agreement. Client attendance at a meeting does not guarantee active participation. The IPPPC shows how far the client has participated in specific aspects of a meeting. It may be possible to increase client participation by the introduction of keyworker meetings, management support and IPP guidelines. The regular use of the IPPPC described in the present paper will guide staff in what to look for when assessing participation and may be especially valuable during staff training.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the problem of planning paths for an elastic object from an initial to a final configuration in a static environment. It is assumed that the object is manipulated by two actuators and that it does not touch the obstacles in its environment at any time. The object may need to deform to achieve a collision-free path from the initial to the final configuration. Any required deformations are automatically computed by the planner according to the principles of elasticity theory from mechanics. The problem considered in this paper differs significantly from that of planning for a rigid or an articulated object. In the first part of the paper, the authors point out these differences and highlight the reasons that make planning for elastic objects an extremely difficult task. The authors then present a randomized algorithm for computing collision-free paths for elastic objects under the above-mentioned restrictions of manipulation. The paper includes a number of experimental results. The work is motivated by the need to consider the physical properties of objects while planning and has applications in industrial problems, in maintainability studies, in virtual reality environments, and in medical surgical settings. </jats:p>",

The first paper in this two-part study highlighted the problems and possibilities of translating the propositions contained in six ‘soft’ theories of local economic growth into measurable dimensions and sets of proxy variables that are hypothesized to determine local economic growth. This second paper focuses on issues of econometric-model design and empirical validation. Given the practical limitations imposed by data availability, the ‘soft’ theories of local economic growth are modeled by a simple conditional ‘gap’ convergence model in which prevailing regional unemployment relativities are determined by a common trend in unemployment and a set of regionally specific variables. The empirical validity of the competing ‘soft’ theories of local economic growth is evaluated by applying test restrictions imposed by the ‘soft’ theories to a general model specification containing eight regionally specific variables that have been identified as potential drivers of local economic growth. The econometric modeling of Australian data suggests that the processes of regional economic performance might be somewhat different from those specified in individual theoretical models. Significantly, the role of local ‘enterprise culture’ is revealed—built on specialization, technological leadership, human resources, and the local integration of firms—though significant caveats are attached to the roles of access to information, institutional support, and interregional trade as promoters of local economic growth. </jats:p>",

To facilitate greater understanding of these products and technologies, a Selection Guide was developed to evaluate their potential benefits and identify appropriate situations for their use.

However, by the mid-1970s, many academics and government agencies believed that growth center policies were not successful in encouraging regional development, and since that time growth center theory has remained, in general, poorly regarded. In the 1960s, the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) implemented a growth center policy. Though much has been written about the ARC, there is little research on the Commission's experience in implementing its growth center policy. The author uses historical documentation from the ARC to assess the Commission's growth center policy, particularly in the context of growth center theory. He then utilizes ARC expenditure data to determine the extent to which the ARC was able to implement what is best termed a ‘modified growth center strategy’. It is concluded that the ARC did not implement a policy that was particularly akin to growth center policy as presented in the theoretical literature; however, it is also concluded that the ARC did implement a modified version of a growth center strategy with some success. </jats:p>",

The Web and GIS tools currently are under review by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Region IV and other project participants. Future plans include distributing the plan on compact disk (CD) and over the Internet. The digital format of the sensitive areas plan, and its future availability on CD and the Internet, should enhance the distribution and use of the information by spill planners and responders, making it easier to transport, access, and update. The sensitive areas plan for inland South Florida should serve as a useful model for developing inland plans in EPA Region IV and elsewhere, and should assist spill planning and response efforts in sensitive inland environments in South Florida and elsewhere.</jats:p>",

The multidisciplinary study included a static numerical representation of the geological model, taking into account all available information and integrating the vertical communication among formations and the reservoir compartmentalization as inferred from the available performance/dynamic data (mainly pressures, production tests and fluid types). Given the very limited dynamic information available and the limitations of seismic imaging in this area, a History Matched coarse grid simulation model was used as a Material Balance tool to study reservoir compartmentalization; evaluate volumes in place per compartment; and estimate well counts and overall recoveries for alternative development scenarios. A key part of the model was an accurate representation of the complex PVT behavior, including depth profiles of oil content in the gas, oil API gravity and initial Rs; as well as GOC depth estimates for each compartment. The study supports the blowdown of the gas cap as the most commercially attractive and less risky development strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The transitional process in China is marked by prominent roles of state institutions, which are a key determinant of the opportunity and reward structure in the newly developing labor market. Migrant labor and the occupational and sectoral changes in the urban economy have further shaped the evolution of the labor market in Chinese cities. In this paper, I argue that labor-market returns are not only functions of human capital but are heavily influenced by state-controlled institutional status. Specifically, I examine the variations in income and benefits returns among nonmigrant urban residents, permanent migrants who possess urban residence, and temporary migrants who are denied permanent residence rights in cities. The empirical analysis employs data from a recent survey conducted in Guangzhou, one of the largest and most rapidly changing cities and one of the most popular destinations of migrant workers in China. The findings show that permanent migrants' income returns are especially high and that temporary migrants' benefits returns are especially inferior. Furthermore, they suggest that permanent migrants' advantaged positions are conducive to their continued success in the labor market when they shift to more profitable occupations and sectors such as commerce and self-employment. The findings of this paper support the notion that in China resident status functions like ascribed attributes that have effects on labor-market returns independent of achieved attributes, and that migration and labor-market segmentation are intricately related to the reward structure in the urban labor market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Important questions that are asked by spill responders as well as those assessing potential impacts are: (I) What is the probability of oiling, above a threshold of concern, for each location near a potential spill site? (2) How soon will oil reach each site of concern? (3) How much oil contamination is expected (on average and worst case)? (4) Is there a potential for impacting biological resources with this oil? Using Applied Science Associates, Inc.'s (ASA) oil spill model (Spill Impact Assessment Package, SIMAP) in stochastic mode, these questions were evaluated for Florida Power &amp; Light (FPL) for a variety of oil types and spill volumes, and for each of FPL's plants and terminals. The model was run many times, randomizing the start time over decade-long wind records. The model evaluates surface oil, shoreline oil, subsurface oil, and low molecular weight aromatics (the most toxic fraction of the oil). Both the mean and worst case exposure thickness/concentration are evaluated. The output includes contour maps, which may be interrogated (with the user interface) to determine the conditions under which worst case oiling occurs. The contours are overlaid on resource maps, showing where resources are most at risk and where protection would be most beneficial.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>FPL uses SIMAP for contingency planning, drills, spill response, and evaluation of fates and impacts of spills. ASA has developed databases for use in the model for the locations around each of FPL's plants and terminals. These data include shore and habitat type mapping, locations of sensitive resources, and current data sets generated by ASA's hydrodynamic model.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The stochastic model may be used as a contingency planning tool or as a component of the ecological risk assessment process. It determines the range of distances and directions oil spills are likely to travel from a particular site, given wind and current data for the area. Practical uses for this information include the determination of which kinds of response equipment should be used in a particular area and where the equipment should be placed to be most effective, what areas are most at risk from possible spills at a specific location, and the expected magnitude of impacts.</jats:p>",

The Site Information and Spill Response Strategy (SISRS) approach was developed to enable involvement and ownership of Port Area Contingency Plan (ACP) strategies among stakeholders, as well as provide consistency in site documentation and strategy development for the widely variable habitats of the long California coast. Through site visits and tabletop discussions, the Area Committee uses this approach to incorporate the input of state and federal trustees, contingency planners, and stakeholders (industry, spill response co-ops and contractors, environmentalists, other agencies) to form a consensus on the appropriate site protection strategies and response resources. This information is stored in the SISRS database.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The SISRS database has important benefits. It generates uniform Site Summary and Site Strategy pages across the six ACPs of California. Through the Internet, the database maximizes the opportunity to use the ACP as both a planning tool and a response tool. As a planning tool, the ACP and the generative database, maintained by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), is the relatively rigid benchmark for the contingency planning for regulated facilities and vessels under state and federal laws, and is a ready digital information source. As a response tool, DFG maintains the SISRS database (on its Web site), which includes strategy revisions as often as the Area Committee approves revisions and updates. This database is used to expedite the spill response and produce Incident Command System (ICS) response documents with the most current information. The response version is a ready source of information for third-party software products for spill response management, such as response forms and resource ordering and management documents.</jats:p>",

Unlike previous prediction schemes which used simple dynamic models and continuously updated an intercept state estimate, the neural network predictor uses a complex function, computed with data acquired from various puck trajectories, and makes a single, timely estimate of the final intercept state. Theoretically, the network can account for the complete dynamics of the table if all important state parameters are included as inputs, an accurate data training set of trajectories is used, and the network has an adequate number of internal nodes. To develop our neural networks, we acquired data from 1500 no‐bounce and 1500 one‐bounce puck trajectories, noting only translational state information. Analysis showed that performance of neural networks designed to predict the results of no‐bounce trajectories was better than the performance of neural networks designed for one‐bounce trajectories. Since our neural network input parameters did not include rotational puck estimates and recent work shows the importance of spin in impact analysis, we infer that adding a spin input to the neural network will increase the effectiveness of state estimates for the one‐bounce case. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",

Treatment plans were developed for ten patients using the Corvus version 3.8 planning system, testing various prescription options, including tissue types, dose volume histogram values for the target and normal structures, beam arrangements, and number of intensity levels. All plans were scaled so that 95% of the clinical target volume received 75.6 Gy; mean doses to the prostate were typically 79 Gy. The reproducibility of the inverse planning algorithm was tested by repeating a set of the plans five times. Plans were deemed acceptable if they satisfied predefined dose constraints for the targets and critical organs. Figures of merit for target coverage, target dose uniformity, and organ sparing were used to rank acceptable plans. Certain systematic behaviors of the optimizer were noted: the high dose regions for both targets and critical organs were 5–10 Gy more than prescribed; reducing bladder and rectum tolerance increased the range of doses within the target; increasing the number of fields incrementally improved plan quality. A set of planning parameters was found that usually satisfied the minimum requirements. Repeating the optimization with different beam order produced similar but slightly different dose distributions, which was sometimes useful for finding acceptable solutions for difficult cases. The standard set of parameters serves as a useful starting point for individualized planning.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.90.+y</jats:p>",

The purpose of the ERA process is to evaluate the ecological trade-offs associated with the use of each of five potential oil spill removal options—natural recovery, on-water mechanical recovery, shoreline cleanup, dispersant use, and on-water in situ burning. The desired outcome of the evaluation is identification of the optimum mix of response options in reducing injury to each specific environment. Evaluations at each location were accomplished through a series of facilitated workshops involving technical experts and resource managers from as many stakeholder organizations as possible. At these workshops, the participants developed relative ecological risk evaluations for response options. At the conclusion of each ERA, the workshop participants felt that the cooperative ERA process had the potential to become an integral part of the area contingency planning process by facilitating the assessment of the effectiveness of response strategies contained in an Area Contingency Plan (ACP). Repeated application of the process for various scenarios should enable an area committee to optimize response strategies over time by maximizing net environmental benefit. This paper describes the process used by the participants and presents a simplified version of the ERA process amenable to shorter timeframes and consequently more scenarios.</jats:p>",

However, little research exists examining how changing the style and information content of the shift report may affect an individual’s ability to process the information they hear. It is suggested that how individuals structure their knowledge, in the form of schema, is an important consideration when examining how they process information.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Design.</jats:bold> This was an experimental study where two independent variables, report style (retrospective vs. prospective) and schema information (schema consistent vs. schema inconsistent) were compared in a factorial design.

Outcome measures included the amount of information that subjects accurately recorded and recalled from the shift report, together with their ability to plan patient care.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Results.</jats:bold> Results indicated that the type of report had a significant effect on an individual’s ability to plan patient care, and type of information content on their ability to accurately record and recall the information they heard.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold> The implications of the results, both for schema theory as an explanation of nursing knowledge, and for the type of report which should be used in acute medical and acute surgical wards are discussed, together with the implications of the study for further research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Numerous studies demonstrate that married women sacrifice their own careers in order to support their husbands' careers by following them as tied migrants, largely independent of their own occupational status. Thus, it appears as if family migration is shaped by the dominant gender roles and gender identities which configure the lives of women and men in married couple families. The motivation for this paper stems from a concern that family migration research has failed to consider that the effects of family migration on the labor-market participation of married women may be contingent on parental status. This research is designed to uncover the individual and joint effects of migration and parental status on married women's labor-market participation. The approach taken in this research is to begin with a very specific type of married couple family—married couple families without children—and to trace how the birth of the first child and migration events independently and jointly determine women's labor-market participation over a 5-year time span. The data for the analysis are drawn from the 1987 through 1992 Family File of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Random effects probit models of labor-force participation and employment indicate a small, short-lived, impact of migration on the employment of married women without children—but for married women with children the negative effects of family migration on both labor force participation and employment are large and endure for many years. </jats:p>",

Test species included embryo-larval stages of Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), two marine mysids (Holmesimysis costata and Mysidopsis bahia), and two marine fishes (turbot, Scophthalmus maximus and inland silverside, Menidia beryllina). Oils were physically dispersed in seawater by vortex mixing in a flask and chemically dispersed using the same approach with COREXIT® 9527 or COREXIT® 9500 applied in a 10:1 oil-to-dispersant ratio to generate maximum exposure concentrations. Continuous exposure tests followed standard testing protocols for 96-hour or 48-hour duration, according to demands of the test species. Spiked exposures reflect continuous dilution of water column concentrations (half-life ∼107 minutes), as observed in the field when oil is dispersed into open waters. Results are reported as the acute LC50s. Tests oils included fresh and weathered Kuwait crude, fresh Forties crude, and a Medium Fuel Oil (MFO) mix. Exposure concentrations for oil tests were quantified using gas chromatography and expressed as the sum of the C10 to C36 components, or TPH(resoived). Dispersant exposure concentrations were verified by UV spectrophotometric analysis. Not all species were tested with each oil and dispersant.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For dispersants tested individually, constant exposure LC50s ranged from 3 to 75 mg/L, with oyster the most sensitive and turbot the least sensitive species. Spiked exposure LC50s ranged from 14 to &amp;gt;1055 mg/L among all test species. Dispersants were up to 36 times less toxic under spiked exposure conditions compared to similar treatments under constant exposure conditions. For oils, LC50s based on TPH(resolved) are similar for both the physically and chemically dispersed oil, demonstrating that dispersant did not increase the toxicity of oils based on measured exposures. Under constant exposure conditions, test species are very similar in sensitivity to the oils, with most LC50s around 0.5 ppm TPH(resolyed). Spiked exposures were 4 to 100 fold less toxic to these test organisms. The more environmentally realistic spiked exposures demonstrate that standard, continuous exposure test data overestimate the potential toxicity of dispersed oil. When laboratory toxicity data are used as part of a dispersant approval process for spill response, the decision should take into account whether exposure durations and sensitivity of test species are representative of conditions in the spill area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The accuracy of the photon convolution/superposition dose algorithm employed in a commercial radiation treatment planning system was evaluated for conditions simulating tangential breast treatment. A breast phantom was fabricated from machineable wax and placed on the chest wall of an anthropomorphic phantom. Radiographic film was used to measure the dose distribution at the axial midplane of the breast phantom. Subsequently, thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs) were used to measure the dose at four points within the midplane to validate the accuracy of the film dosimetry. Film measurements were compared with calculations performed using the treatment planning system for four types of treatment: optimized wedged beams at 6 and 18 MV and two‐dimensional compensated beams at 6 and 18 MV. Both the film‐ and TLD‐measured doses had a precision of approximately 0.6%. The film‐measured doses were approximately 1.5% lower than the TLD‐measured doses, ranging from 0–3 % at 6 MV and 0.5–1 % at 18 MV. Such results placed a high level of confidence in the accuracy and precision of the film data. The measured and calculated doses agreed to within <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/acm20073-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:15269914:acm20073:equation:acm20073-math-0001\" /> for both the film and TLD measurements throughout the midplane exclusive of areas not having charged particle equilibrium. Good agreement was not expected within these regions due to the limitations in both film dosimetry and the dose‐calculation algorithm. These results indicated that the treatment planning system calculates doses at the midplane with clinically acceptable accuracy in conditions simulating tangential breast treatment.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.66.–a</jats:p>",

The hydrolysis and polycondensation of Ru(II)‐3‐4,5‐dihyroimidazol‐1‐yl‐propyltriethoxysilane were performed in different experimental conditions, producing a new organic–inorganic silica. The alkoxysilyl groups available were used for the construction of inorganic backbone by the sol‐gel process, and the imidazole group was found suitable for incorporating Ru(II) by coordination. The coordination of metal complex is retained because there is no leaching from the metal complex containing gels. To ensure sufficient catalytic properties, a series of hybrid materials from tetraethoxysilane was prepared. These materials were identified and catalytic activities were tested for cyclization of (<jats:italic>Z</jats:italic>)‐3‐methylpent‐2‐en‐4‐yn‐1‐ol to 2,3‐dimethylfuran.

The goal of the evaluation was to identify the optimum mix of response options for reducing injury to the environment. For these specific scenarios, the participants concluded that only dispersant use, assuming high effectiveness, had the potential to significantly reduce environmental impact when compared to natural recovery. While water-column effects increased with dispersant use, they were not long term and judged to be of less ecological significance than shoreline or water-surface impacts. Aside from dispersant use, only shoreline cleanup was effective in clearly mitigating impacts, and obviously would not prevent the immediate consequences of the spills. The optimum response was viewed as involving some combination of the various response options. There were some issues with data adequacy in both locations, but both groups felt the information was adequate for the analysis. In both ERAs, participants emphasized that the conclusions were scenario specific, and that additional analyses would be necessary before any significant generalizations could be made.</jats:p>",
