The workshop consisted of a keynote and seven presentations, which were organized into three sessions: From Interaction Diagrams to State Machines, Forward Engineering, and Reverse Engineering. Altogether nine position papers were accepted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A more detailed look is given on the scenario of three-dimensional (3-D) instabilities in the magnetohydrodynamic cylinder flow when the oncoming flow and the magnetic field are parallel. The results presented here are in the frame of linear stability analysis in the range 100&amp;lt;Re&amp;lt;250 and extend the results in our previous letter [Phys. Fluids 9, 3114 (1997)]. As the strength of the magnetic field is increased, a nonmonotonic behavior of the 3-D instability is found. This is mainly due to the fact that the underlying two-dimensional (2-D) flow changes considerably from periodic to steady while different instability mechanisms are counteracting. The behavior at weak magnetic fields depends on the Reynolds number and has either a damping or an enhancing influence on 3-D instability. A local maximum is observed in the 3-D instability curve, close to the critical value for 2-D instability, Nc2-D, leading to 3-D instability at Reynolds numbers as low as Re∼150, i.e., lower than the critical Reynolds number for the onset of three dimensionality, Rec3-D, in the pure hydrodynamic cylinder flow. By increasing the magnetic field strength further, the 3-D instability is first damped while for larger values of N it is generally amplified. Therefore, for strong magnetic fields, 3-D steady flows may exist at Re which are considerably lower than Rec3-D of the pure hydrodynamic cylinder flow. In the case of a transverse magnetic field, a stronger and approximately monotonic damping of three dimensionality was observed with increasing magnetic field strength.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>During the 1990s, no studies of various clinical presentations of syphilis have been published in the indexed literature. However, a change in the clinical profile of secondary syphilis was expected during the last decade with the rapid spread of the HIV epidemic. The objective was to study the mucocutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis in patients attending the STD clinic at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education &amp; Research Chandigarh, India, during the last decade and to compare them with other similar studies published during the 1980s. All patients who were diagnosed with secondary syphilis in our STD clinic from 1990 to 1999 were examined and investigated. Serological response was measured at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months post‐treatment or until serological negativity was reached. Fifty‐three patients (males=34, female=19) during this period were found to have secondary syphilis. The most common symptoms were as follows‐skin rash 38 (71.7%), lymphadenopathy 26 (49%), persistent chancre 4 (7.5%), nodular syphilides 2 (3.8%), lues maligna 2 (3.8%), patches in the oral mucosa 6 (11.3%), condylomata lata 14 (26.4%), split papules 2 (3.8%). Five patients had a thin and conspicuous genital scar of the healed primary chancre. Three patients were HIV seropositive (1 patient each with lues maligna, lichenoid, and nodular syphilides). With the spread of the HIV epidemic, atypical muco‐cutaneous manifestations of secondary syphilis may be seen more frequently than before and may pose problems in diagnosis. In the present study, six patients had atypical manifestations, and three of them were HIV seropositive.</jats:p>",
