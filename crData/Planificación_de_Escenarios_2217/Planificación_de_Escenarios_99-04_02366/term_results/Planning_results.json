Most of the literature, however, deals with the application of strategic marketing planning as it relates to big business. By contrast, this article provides an understanding of how all the key principles can be applied in the smaller business, in the form of a practical framework for plan development. In addition, it features a case study showing how a small UK‐based computer company used the framework to develop its marketing plan.</jats:p>",

Said process, which has been adequately learned by the Corporation, aims at materializing value creation opportunities starting from a comprehensive matching of business needs and new technologies. As a second step, the process determines a close collaboration between Technology Organizations and the Operator Units in order to properly evaluate and transfer new technologies into their ongoing operations. Accurate understanding of current and future operation conditions, is the most important element to assure commitment from both groups.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A correct framing of the business case, including risk assessment for each proposed technology, secures high level support for the whole effort. Provisions are made to implement Projects for the proper integration of available and proposed Technologies for the optimum exploitation of each Asset. As a result each project reduce required time for the transfer and deployment of new technologies by the Asset Units thus materializing the optimum value for the Corporation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The whole Technology Planning process here described has been fully integrated with the ongoing Business Planning and Budgeting system assuring its alignment with the main issues and needs that guide Short and Long Term vision of PDVSA's E&amp;P business, therefore assuring proper funding and support for the Technology effort needed to achieve them.</jats:p>",

Drawing on both  UK and US research, as well as original research conducted at four UK exhibitions, the author provides evidence that exhibitors and visitors not only have differing expectations of exhibitions and trade fairs, but that these differing expectations are incompatible in many cases. Comparisons are made between frequent exhibitors and infrequent exhibitors, and also between those who commit a large proportion of their marketing budgets to exhibiting and those who do not, in terms of their objectives and expectations for the exhibition; the conclusion is that even those exhibitors who exhibit frequently or commit large sums to the activity take scant account of visitor needs.

The Kalman filter using the model output of adaptive filtering. forecasts well the day-to-day variability of maximum and minimum temperature during hot weather season over Madras with an efficiency close to 90%. As the model performs reasonably well over Madras. a coastal station. the same has been tried over Trichy (300 km southwest of Madras), an inland airport station in Tamilnadu to ascertain its efficacy. The efficiency is better than 90% in predicting maximum and minimum temperature within an accuracy of 2°C).</jats:p>"

It uses this device, mounted on an aircraft, to scan up to 20 rectangular regions called swaths to obtain images with resolutions down to one meter. Missions consisting of a designated sequence of swaths and flight paths are planned using mapping software. Previously DSTO had been determining the best tours for missions by visually tracking possible swath sequences from a starting base to an ending base. This method was time consuming and did not guarantee optimality in terms of distance traveled. We developed optimization software tools to plan mission tours more efficiently. DSTO can now plan missions with up to 20 swaths in a few seconds, rather than the hour it took using the visual approach. Proposed tour lengths show an average improvement of 15 percent over those manually produced. The software incorporates methods for dealing with the operational problems of no-fly zones and shadowing associated with images. </jats:p>",

The complex and many-sided determinants of regional development are brought together in a regulationist conceptual framework which emphasizes the socioeconomic patterns of interaction, interfirm linkages and industrial labour relations, supportive institutions, and politics in a region. This conceptual framework for regional studies gives key importance to the regions' institutional resources and the differentiation of regional systems of regulation. From the point of view of a regulationist approach, the quality of a region's system of regulation and the degree of coherence achieved in its development configuration can be seen as a foundation for the region's development potential. </jats:p>",

Although tourism is a long-standing phenomenon in Goathland, over the last few years its nature and impacts have altered in such a way as to cause considerable concern for the resident community. The main catalyst for this change is the fact that Goathland is the filming location for the Yorkshire Television series ‘Heartbeat’, which has not only instigated a manifold increase in tourist numbers to the village but has also heralded a marked shift in the way the local environment is consumed by these visitors. By drawing primarily on the results of qualitative research, where interviews were held with tourists, residents, and key informants, I outline and discuss the value judgements contained within the production and consumption of tourism in Goathland, and carry this analysis onto notions of tourism impacts as voiced by respondents. Furthermore, I link these responses to wider concepts, such as the production and consumption of Englishness, heritage, the rural idyll, country lifestyles, and nostalgia to illustrate how these concepts inflect the local tourism process. </jats:p>",

In this paper I argue that, although the process of globalization has brought about more liberalization and decentralization of political economies at the national level, it has also created a far more regimented and centralized economy and polity at the international level. This shift of the center of gravity of political economy from the national to the international level is what the phrase the new global command economy attempts to grasp. First, I begin with a definition of geopolitical economy as a conceptualization of the complex interaction between states and the world economy. Second, I show how a few global institutions de facto command the world economy with a level of centralization and regimentation similar to that which the centrally planned economies used to exercise at the national level during the Cold War era. Third, I analyze how the new global command economy continues to perpetuate the core-periphery divide through what the G7 economic summit has labeled a new global partnership between developing countries, developed countries, and multilateral institutions. Fourth, the nonmarket forces are introduced as an often neglected factor (in economic analysis) which strongly shapes market forces and the overall trajectory of the world economy. </jats:p>",

To better detect these inefficiencies, the authors defined two new terms, underutilization and overutilization, and illustrated how these measures might be used to evaluate the use of surgical subspecialty ORs. The authors also described capacity planning (optimizing surgical subspecialty block time allotments) using a minimal cost analysis (MCA) model.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The authors evaluated post hoc all surgeries performed over 6 yr at a large teaching hospital. To prepare utilization estimates, surgical records were categorized relative to budgeted OR block time for each subspecialty. Surgical cases beginning and ending during budgeted OR block time were categorized as budgeted utilization, budgeted time not used for surgery was underutilization, and cases beginning before/after budgeted block time were classified as overutilization. Cases that overlapped budgeted and nonbudgeted OR block time were parsed and the portions were assigned appropriately. Probability distributions were fitted to the historical patterns of surgical demand, and MCA block time budgets were estimated that minimized the costs of underutilization and overutilization for each subspecialty. To illustrate the potential savings if these MCA budgets were implemented, the authors compared actual operational costs to the estimated MCA budget costs and expressed the savings as a percentage of actual costs.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The authors analyzed data from 58,251 surgical cases and 10 surgical subspecialty blocks.

The importance of being able to estimate parameters with data collected from individuals who have selected a particular alternative is explained. The main advantage of the new method is that it allows the efficient use of easily collected data. It also allows inferences to be made about the distance-decay rates and attraction parameters, even when only a small subset of stores is sampled from an area. This new version of the retail gravity model has been tested extensively with data for 6 major retail centers in Dallas. The detailed studies include a demonstration of the conventional approaches to trade-area mapping and an explanation of exactly what is different about the method proposed here. Interpretation of the model results indicates areas where a store either gains an unexpectedly high (or low) share of its sales. These methods have immediate application in screening potential locations because the variables used to run the model are generic and easily gathered for other cases. The results also encourage the rethinking of the Huff-based gravity model. </jats:p>",

These institutions are sources of eco-development dollars and of a new ‘global’ discourse, a postneoliberal environmental-economic paradigm. By the logic of this paradigm, nature is constructed as a world currency and ecosystems arc recoded as warehouses of genetic resources for biotechnology industries. Nature would earn its own right to survive through international trade in ecosystem services and permits to pollute, access to tourism and research sites, and exports of timber, minerals, and intellectual property rights to traditional crop varieties and shamans' recipes. I contend that green developmentalism, with its promise of market solutions to environmental problems, is blunting the North-South disputes that have embroiled international environmental institutions. But by valuing local nature in relation to international markets—denominating diversity in dollars, euros, or yen—green developmentalism abstracts nature from its spatial and social contexts and reinforces the claims of global elites to the greatest share of the earth's biomass and all it contains. Meanwhile, the CBD has become a gathering ground for transnational coalitions of indigenous, peasant, and NGO opponents of ‘biopiracy’ and the patenting of living things, and advocates of international environmental justice. They have begun to put forward counterdiscourses and alternative practices to those of green developmentalism.</jats:p>",

The process involves projecting wildlife habitat attributes using a growth and yield model, combining the attributes into an index of structural habitat quality, generating yield tables of structural habitat quality that can be constrained or optimized in the forest planning model, and relating prescriptions for each forest planning analysis area back to the habitat attributes. The result is a map of habitat components. This mechanism is considered the first step in our wildlife habitat assessment procedure in that it focuses on within-stand or within-analysis area structures. Since many wildlife species depend on multiple stands or analysis areas and the spatial arrangement of habitat components to meet their life requisites, the second step in our habitat assessment procedure is to apply spatially explicit wildlife habitat models to the mapped planning solution. The decision support system offers the capability to evaluate the effects of alternative management strategies on wildlife habitat in the context of a forest planning model solution. West. J. Appl.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning the sequence of components (or parts) to be assembled during manufacturing is an important application problem for virtual environments for three main reasons. First, it is a difficult combinatorial optimization but a highly visual problem. Second, a majority of assembly operations in factories (with the exception of simple pick-and-place operations) are still performed manually, because they are difficult to automate. Hence, it is an important problem involving human-machine interface. Third, there are a number of assembly operations which require dextrous operator training. Hence, it is also an important training problem. Recent research suggests a promising approach for assembly determination based on using heuristic rules to generate soft constraints in addition to the regular hard quantitative constraints due to part geometry and topology. We believe that the emergence of virtual environments can enable us to systematically use these soft constraints, which previously has not been possible. In this paper, we report results of experiments involving fifteen voluntary participants using a nonvirtual reality (VR) environment involving blueprints, a nonimmersive desktop VR environment, and an immersive projection-based VR environment to first teach participants skills in handling soft and hard constraints for assembly planning through examples, and then to measure the effectiveness of their learnt skills in solving a different example problem. We have classified soft constraints as infeasibility constraints, reorientation constraints, difficulty constraints, instability constraints, and dissimilarity constraints. A significant observation is that the participants could, on average, perform the assembly operations in approximately half the time in the immersive and nonimmersive VR environments than in the traditional environment using blueprints. </jats:p>",

This article highlights the gap between preconceived communication policies and planning perspectives and the constraints on their realization. As development is only an option that a society takes at a particular historical moment, it reflects on the division in societal structures, and presents a typology of the main leadership structures in Third World countries. Governmental authorities in Third World countries often seem to be more interested in maintaining the status quo than in strengthening the communication capacity of the people. Delay in resolving the problem of information and communication inequality is an inevitable consequence. This calls for a review of fundamental human rights principles and the obligations of all UN members to guarantee freedom of expression and information, and equal access to information and communication channels. </jats:p>",

The Block Grant system creates a piecewise-linear, and potentially nonconvex, budget constraint. As the choice of segment is endogenous—cither as a result of unobserved preference heterogeneity or as a result of random optimisation error—a demand function for local public expenditure cannot be consistently estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS). Instead, a two-error maximum likelihood (ML) estimation procedure is used. The results show a positive income effect and a negative price effect, both of high significance. The OLS estimate of the price coefficient is underestimated relative to its ML counterpart—because of spurious positive correlation between expenditure and price—but the OLS estimate of the income coefficient does not show a substantial bias. The two-error ML estimation results show significant evidence of unobserved preference heterogeneity and some weaker evidence of random optimisation error. </jats:p>",

These themes have raised numerous questions about how one might work to reimagine global politics. One source of reimaginings has been the World Order Models Project (WOMP). For the last three decades WOMP has developed models of desirable futures for a global polity of humane governance most recently posited as an alternative to current processes of ‘globalization from above’. By engaging with activists in social movements over the 1980s and 1990s on peace, justice, and environmental matters, the scholars of the project have developed a series of ‘world order values’ to guide normative considerations of global politics. I suggest, after my reading these documents in the light of contemporary writing in critical geopolitics, that by thinking ethically about politics in the 1990s one may further challenge the geographical assumptions about place and sovereignty and the related conceptual tools brought to notions of alternative politics. The recent WOMP arguments suggest that ‘alternative politics’ is about more than resistance, social movements, and states. These arguments also show in a number of ways that critical geopolitics is about connections and community understood as other than place-bound political entities. </jats:p>",

This implies a shift of attention from inputs and processes to outputs and outcomes. In making that assessment, the authors review other research and present the results of their own survey of all British local governments. They conclude that, if anything, the purchaser—provider split has increased the amount of attention paid to inputs and processes and has done little to focus attention on outputs and even less in respect of outcomes. Although this evidence is by no means conclusive, it does serve to qualify earlier research results that found improvements in outcomes for some services as a result of contracting. </jats:p>",

They also implied that the dominant theoretical paradigm, transaction cost analysis (TCA), provides a poor explanation of observed behaviour. They made a significant contribution by bringing together the economic geography and marketing literature on this topic. However, they did not fully review the contributions of the TCA approach to entry-mode studies in marketing, and this may have biased their conclusions about the value of this theory.

On the whole transport objectives and policy initiatives have not been addressed, in urban policy effected by successive governments since 1977. In part as a consequence, there has been a marked dearth of empirically based intraurban research in which that nexus between transport infrastructure and social and economic renewal has been explored. In the early 1990s, Sheffield proved to be an especially interesting laboratory within which to examine this issue because of the construction of a new light rail-transit system, the South Yorkshire Supertram (SYS), and a substantial programme of new and improved roads. During the period 1992 to 1996, the research team undertook ‘before-and-after’ surveys of the effects of the SYS and enhanced road provision on five elements of urban regeneration: image, property values, land use, business (relocation, and labour mobility. New investment had only a relatively limited impact on regeneration and, where effects could be identified, enhanced road investment proved significantly more beneficial than did the SYS. However, the policy environment within which the SYS was implemented was never likely to maximise regeneration, primarily because of the lack of integration across regeneration agencies and transport providers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contrary to the suggestion that transnational capital has largely subsumed the agency of Australian governments and farmers in shaping rural environments, in this paper I argue that new, often indirect, forms of action have developed within the context of globalisation and neoliberalism. These may be described as forms of ‘action at a distance’, oriented towards shaping both the environment within which people make decisions and the ways in which they are likely to respond to that environment. Since 1989, the National Landcare Program has mobilised around 30% of farm businesses to participate in community Landcare groups based on principles of self-help, cooperation, and localised action. This has initiated a new phase of negotiation over the delimitation of objects of governance, and facilitated the deployment of novel forms of state influence. Of particular importance have been technologies of knowledge that promote the further intensification of agriculture as environmentally rational and responsible, a trend reinforced by the vast bulk of neoliberal agricultural policy. Although neoliberal policy and local Landcare action appear contradictory, they do appear consistent with the self-understandings of Australian farmers as independent and self-reliant—understandings that render more direct forms of state intervention problematic. It thus remains to be seen how profoundly Landcare will reshape rural landscapes. </jats:p>",

In a detailed empirical analysis of EU agri-environment policy, drawing upon seventy interviews with senior officers of the European Commission, members of the European Parliament, and agricultural officials in member states, we demonstrate how the mobilisation of these agenda territories enabled the EP to exert influence in the development of EU agri-environment policy. </jats:p>",

By developing products as a family, the firm can reduce the cost of developing individual product variants due to the reuse of a common product platform. Such a platform, designed in an aggregate-planning phase that precedes the development of individual product variants, is itself expensive to develop. Hence, its costs must be weighted against the benefits of its reuse in a family. We offer a model for capturing costs of product development when the family consists of variants based on a common platform. It is shown that the model can be converted into a network-optimization problem, and the optimal product-family can be identified under fairly general conditions by determining the shortest path of its network formulation. We also analytically examine the effect of alternative product designs on product-family composition, and discuss the implications of investing in new-product technology. Finally, we illustrate our model and managerial insights with an application from the electronics industry. </jats:p>",

One of the largest elements is the planned North European High Speed Rail Network (Paris–Brussels–Köln–Amsterdam–London). This involves five member states, of which one, France, has completed its contribution. Part of the Belgian contribution is under construction, and agreement has been reached on the northern and eastern extensions beyond Brussels. In the United Kingdom the contribution is the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. The planning has already taken nearly ten years and has involved conflicts over route choice, station location choice, environmental issues, and detailed local planning. These include vertical conflicts between national, regional, and local governments and horizontal conflicts between regional and local governments. As it is an international link there are both vertical (EU) and horizontal (inter-national government and inter-local government) issues to be resolved. In this paper we provide a detailed analysis of the issues and the procedures used to resolve identified conflicts and attempt an evaluation of the current procedure for assessing projects of this type. </jats:p>",

In this article I test empirically such assumptions in a low-tech sector, the food and beverage processing industry, with evidence provided by a sample of 4572 foreign patents granted to nationals from major OECD countries over 1969–88 and data on 96 major multinationals. In contrast with most previous research, this study investigates within-industry differences in the impact of the home base. My findings show that the theory is applicable to low-tech sectors. However, the impact of the home country is not homogeneous within industries, and depends on size and international experience of firms. Smaller multinational enterprises and newcomers achieving high profitability tend to be based in countries where the food and beverage national industry is technologically intensive, whereas geography is less crucial to explaining the international performance of very large companies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the 1970s the provision of business support to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Britain has been through quite separate organisations. The Business Link (BL) network, launched in England in 1992, is the latest initiative by which the government has sought to integrate support to SMEs and to shift the primary focus from start-up to established firms with growth potential. In this paper the author examines the provision of business support services available through BL. She reviews the underlying concepts of BL, the associated debates surrounding the initiative, and then presents new survey evidence from BLs on their target market, innovation, and charging strategy. It is found that: (1) the markets are being shifted from the desired targets of larger growth firms towards smaller firms; (2) personal business advisers (PBAs) are being relied on as the main method by which BLs identify potential growth firms; (3) the development of new local services is a low priority for BLs at this stage in their development; and (4) there is an inherent unwillingness to charge for services. The author concludes that the effect of the Department of Trade and Industry's intervention has been to ‘nationalise’ the system of business support. This has had a desirable effect of increasing the level of service availability and service quality, but has also had the effect of reducing local diversity. </jats:p>",

This use of metaphor alludes to the hospital's distinctive design features and represents an attempt to de-emphasise connotations associated with institutionalised medicine, thus normalising the place for children. However, those naming the hospital had more than children in mind. Rather, there was a dual intent: to market the hospital as a distinctive place for monetary donors, as well as promoting a more therapeutic environment for youthful users. Through the vehicle of our case study, we raise questions concerning the competition by health care services for public and private funds. We conclude that there is a need to move beyond viewing hospitals as service entities and equating health care consumption with utilisation behaviour. Rather, a merging of insights from the political economy of health care and new cultural geography literatures can aid the development of more finely textured understandings of the meaning of contemporary health care, and the role of metaphor and marketing in selling places of health care consumption. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Defense and military priorities have changed in the post-Cold-War era in many nations. Decreases in military and defense spending have resulted in layoffs in defense-related industries, creating dislocated defense-dependent workers and affecting economic and social conditions in their communities. How countries cope with the labor repercussions of restructuring in defense differs across nations. Their policy choices are rooted in the historical and institutional paths of their political economies. In this paper the author compares defense restructuring and its effects on workers through an analysis of policies in Sweden and the United States. Both the United States and Sweden have maintained strong military and defense sectors, for different reasons, but demonstrate most-different systems design with regard to labor policies affecting a dislocated workforce. It is argued that the dominant ‘warfare’ state policies of the United States forced the country to develop a set of reactive policies to defense restructuring, more focused on technology and existing defense firms than on the retraining and reemployment needs of its former defense workforce. Sweden's welfare state model, by contrast, enabled defense-sector dislocations to be treated in the same way as other industrial restructuring in the past, by a set of well-developed labor and social policies that encouraged retraining and reemployment of workers. Case studies from both nations highlight these differences. The anticipatory policies in Sweden were better able to cope with structural changes from defense restructuring than were the largely reactive policies of the United States. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent years have seen the establishment of numerous spatially bounded regeneration agencies in the United Kingdom, prominent amongst which have been urban development corporations (UDCs). Attempts to evaluate such agencies have so far focused almost exclusively upon the impacts within formally delimited areas and have neglected to consider the effects on surrounding nondesignated areas. In this paper, an attempt is made to address this by devising a technique for assessing the wider effects of spatially bounded regeneration agencies and programmes. Drawing from a government-commissioned evaluation of UDCs at Leeds, Bristol, and Central Manchester, we explore the extent to which government intervention in delimited areas has generated a net beneficial impact on the wider local economies of the three cities. By use of data on the nature of vacancy chains for commercial properties in the three UDCs and in their respective surrounding areas, an attempt is made to measure the degree of displacement or additionality engendered by UDC activities. </jats:p>",

In doing so, we critique the core belief that underpins it, namely, the notion that housing problems are the product of universal structural conditions that are common to all societies. In turn, we also critique the logical derivative, namely, the notion that housing policies which have been ‘successful’ in their country of origin can be transferred to (that is, exported to or imported by) other societies. To do this, we commence by developing a conceptual framework that is based on the idea of societal ‘divergence’ rather than universalism. This provides a comparative method which we then apply in order to examine the second-home ownership problematic in Britain and Sweden. In doing so, they demonstrate that the problems caused by postwar growth in second-home ownership (and the associated housing policy responses that have been formulated) are particular to each country. To conclude, we make some general observations about the limits of policy diffusion by highlighting the conditions in which imported or exported housing policies are likely to succeed or fail. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields on markers of human fertility. METHODS: A follow up study of time to pregnancy, semen quality, and reproductive hormones was conducted among couples planning first pregnancies (36 males were welders and 21 were non-welders). The male and the female partner were monitored for exposure to ELF magnetic field by personal exposure meters. As summary measures of exposure the median value was calculated together with the 75 percentile value and the proportion of measurements exceeding 0.2 and 1.0 microT, respectively. Each summary measure was divided in three categories: low, medium, and high. RESULTS: Couples in which the man had a medium or a high proportion of measurements &gt; 1.0 microT had a reduced probability of conception per menstrual cycle compared with the men with low exposure, but the result was only significant for the men with medium exposure. This finding was partly attributable to a high probability of conception per menstrual cycle among the men with low exposure compared with non-welders in the original cohort of 430 couples. Other summary measures were not related to probability of conception or other markers of fertility. A possible negative association was found between high probability of conception and female exposure measures based on the median, the 75 percentile, and the proportion of measurements &gt; 0.2 microT, but no association was found with the proportion of measurements &gt; 1.0 microT. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide no consistent support for a hypothesis of a deleterious effect of low level ELF magnetic fields on markers of human fertility. However, due to the relatively small size of the studied population only large associations would be detected.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a generic reference architecture for a manufacturing planning and control (MPC) system, which is tested in the context of the functional specification of MPC systems in medium-sized batch manufacturing companies. While the proposed reference architecture is an adaptation of the manufacturing resource planning (MRPII) model, it can also represent other approaches such as multilevel finite capacity scheduling and hybrid systems incorporating pull control (e.g. kanban). Furthermore, it is not as functionally rigid as the MRPII approach and can support the development of manufacturing planning and control systems to support the identified business processes. It is shown how the reference architecture can be used to represent companies who operate very different MPC approaches. It is also shown that the architecture can support different projects (i.e. business process re-engineering, performance measurement and the implementation of computerized MPC systems). Field tests demonstrate that the architecture is generic, has a broad application, yet is detailed enough usefully to represent the functionality of a suitable MPC system in individual manufacturing environments. </jats:p>",

Eighteen relapses, nine in each treatment group, have occurred 4 to 35 months after radiotherapy; among these, four were pelvic relapses, all occurring after PA radiotherapy. However, the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in pelvic relapse rates excludes differences of more than 4%. The 3-year relapse-free survival was 96% (95% CI, 94% to 99%) after PA radiotherapy and 96.6% (95% CI, 94% to 99%) after DL (difference, 0.6%; 95% confidence limits, −3.4%, +4.6%). One patient (PA field) has died from seminoma. Survival at 3 years was 99.3% for PA and 100% for DL radiotherapy. Acute toxicity (nausea, vomiting, leukopenia) was less frequent and less pronounced in patients in the PA arm. Within the first 18 months of follow-up, the sperm counts were significantly higher after PA than after DL irradiation. </jats:p><jats:p> CONCLUSION: In patients with testicular seminoma stage I (T1 to T3) and with undisturbed lymphatic drainage, adjuvant radiotherapy confined to the PA lymph nodes is associated with reduced hematologic, gastrointestinal, and gonadal toxicity, but with a higher risk of pelvic recurrence, compared with DL radiotherapy. The recurrence rate is low with either treatment. PA radiotherapy is recommended as standard treatment in these patients. </jats:p>",

Unlike traditional evolutionary representation, special representation of individuals and crossover are used for the evolutionary search. Swapping crossover, insertion, and deletion mutations are used as background operators for maximum evolutionary algorithm flexibility. Polygonal obstacles in the world coordinate frame are modeled as circles from visibility and sensor modeling concepts. An appropriate cost (fitness) function is constructed as the only link between the evolutionary algorithm and environment.
