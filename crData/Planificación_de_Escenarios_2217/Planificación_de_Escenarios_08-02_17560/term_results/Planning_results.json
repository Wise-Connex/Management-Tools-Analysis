At first, each stage required greater rigor and care than the previous one in preparing the housing plan. After a while, the state also began reviewing local elements for compliance with state law, challenging cherished traditions of home rule. All the while, however, the focus was exclusively on housing. Most recently, planning implications of housing have forced a broader focus, now also beginning to consider other regional planning concerns dealing with transportation, air quality, and the environment. </jats:p>",

This article looks at the comprehensive physical plan prepared in the late 1920s by Harland Bartholomew and the local Town Planning Commission for Vancouver, British Columbia—a city known for its livability—and analyzes how the plan contributed to and is reflected in the city's public realm. It explores how key public realm proposals of the plan have continued to inform planning policy over the years. In the end, conclusions are reached regarding the power of simple yet visionary long-range ideas for a city's public realm, the value of building on good ideas, and the identity-building possibilities of building a public realm responsive to its unique natural context. </jats:p>",

Three ultimately unsuccessful proposals exemplify these “strategic self-orientalizing” endeavors: “China Village,” a Title I urban renewal proposal (1950-1954); Chinatown Revitalization Plan, an effort to alter Chinatown's streetscapes (1975); and The Unity Arch, an ornamental gate (2002-2005). Examining these proposals revises the history of Chinatown-planning nationally while revealing a story of cold-war machinations, changing immigration patterns, and the rise of identity politics. </jats:p>",

As the Iraqi capital has again become the site for new visions of reconstruction and development, it is important to critically revisit this recent history of the city. </jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the historical basis of the regional, polycentric city concepts that are an essential part of the New Urbanist manifesto. I focus primarily on the regionalism of Patrick Geddes, Lewis Mumford, Clarence Stein, and Benton MacKaye, and the principles laid out in the Regional Planning Association of America (RPAA) in the 1920s. I begin with a brief overview of the main principles of regionalism, culminating in the ideas of the RPAA, and then analyze how these ideas either connect or conflict with New Urbanism and its particular brand of the regionalist paradigm. An essential question for New Urbanists is how their particular version of regionalism stands up against earlier versions, and whether theirs will have a better chance of being implemented. </jats:p>",

At the individual level, age has negative effects and measures of risk orientation have positive effects on the probability of condom use; for women, education has positive effects and Muslim belief has negative effects. Condom use is higher among residents in Moscow and St. Petersburg and lower (for women) among rural residents. Most importantly, the same individuals make different choices about condom use from one sex event to the next, and their choices are systematically related to the nature and duration of their relationship to their partner, as well as to their partner's age. Condom use is prevalent in casual encounters and in those involving new partners or commercial sex workers. Coupled with the strong effects of age for both partners, this pattern represents good news regarding the potential for the spread of HIV in Russia. Other findings are more worrisome: HIV awareness and knowledge of condoms’ effectiveness in blocking transmission of the virus do not influence condom use at all, and married people are relatively unlikely to use condoms even in extramarital encounters and especially in long‐term affairs. Accordingly, interventions should target older Russians who are married and have sex with long‐term nonspousal partners.</jats:p>",

However, the efficient application of LR is contingent on certain basic conditions. In this article, the basic conditions are defined and examined for the successful and efficient application of the LR method within the frame of international literature. The provision of benefits expected from LR rests on the availability of LR models that include the foregoing basic conditions. </jats:p>",

The internal evaluation system, however, typically is based on team feedback, and 20 percent of hospitals reported having no internal evaluation procedure. Some unnecessary procedures, including pubic shaving and enemas, are frequently practiced. Women are restricted in their movement during labor, and the lithotomy position is usually adopted for delivery; the majority of hospitals report strapping women in the delivery position. Most hospitals do not allow social support during labor and delivery. Measures are needed to encourage the best evidence‐based practices regarding normal childbirth, including better evaluation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. International water resources agreements for transboundary rivers in southern Africa are based on system analysis models for water planning and allocation. The Water Resources Yield Model (WRYM) developed in South Africa has so far been the only model applied in official joint water resources studies aimed to form water-sharing agreements. The continuous discussion around the model performance and growing distress over it being South African, where it was originally developed, while South Africa is one of the interested parties in the process, results in an increased controversy over the system analysis results that are often only meant to guide in selecting the options for water resources management in a given set of scenarios. The objective of this study was therefore to assess the model performance of two other models; WAFLEX and WEAP21 in the Umbeluzi River Basin system where the WRYM was previously applied as part of a Joint River Basin Study. A set of basin development scenarios was equally tested in the three models and the results compared. The results show that the three models all are possible tools for system analysis of river basins in southern Africa, although the structure and complexity of the models are different. The obtained level of satisfaction for specific water users could, however, vary depending on which model was used, which causes uncertainties. The reason for the diverse results is the structurally different ways of describing allocation and prioritization of water in the three models. However, the large degrees of freedom in all system models cause even larger uncertainty in the results since the model user can, intentionally or unintentionally, direct the results to favor certain water users. The conclusion of this study is therefore that the choice of model does not per se affect the decision of best water allocation and infrastructure layout of a shared river basin. The chosen allocation and prioritization principles for the specific river basin and the model user's experience and integrity are more important factors to find the optimal and equitable allocation.\n                        </jats:p>"

This article provides an extensive overview of the literature on the history and structure of U.S. wetland conservation policy. The authors focus on regulations that permit wetland destruction in return for mitigation of wetland damage and highlight concerns that current wetland mitigation policies may lead to the redistribution of wetland benefits among specific population groups. Researchers and planners have yet to construct systems that enable them to answer a very basic question : Does wetland mitigation contribute to social disparity and inequity? The authors outline a data collec tion framework for use in determining if and how social disparities may occur during mitigation. They also discuss the use of spatial and temporal preference measures as a tool for addressing these considerations. Finally, they discuss how recent Supreme Court limitations on federal jurisdiction over wetlands may alter the roles and responsibilities of planners, arguing that these new roles may provide the opportunity for planners to fully incorporate social considerations into mitigation decisions. </jats:p>",

This article presents findings from a 2002 survey conducted in six rural villages in Bangladesh suggesting that an extremely high proportion of women believe that husbands’ use of violence against their wives is acceptable. To investigate the reliability and the psychosocial underpinnings of these survey findings, we also examine data from 110 in‐depth interviews and 14 small group discussions. The results suggest that although most abused women in the study had resigned themselves to accept a certain level of violence, they did not condone it, and many abused women said that perpetrators of violence should be punished, and in some cases the punishments they suggested were harsh. We conclude by raising questions regarding the meaning of responses to commonly used questions intended to measure women's attitudes toward intimate partner violence and by discussing policy implications.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Prevailing perspectives on the impacts of globalization on urban form in large, globalizing cities in Asia hold that these cities are experiencing an inexorable process of ‘Westernization’ or ‘Americanization’. Yet this focus on convergence distracts us from the task of analyzing urban change and its causes, leading to analytical muddiness and awkward planning and policy implications. The author presents an alternative framework that focuses on actor-centered analysis, and the importance of understanding historical context. This framework is employed in a case study of recent trends in urban development in Metro Manila, based on interviews, government, private sector, and nonprofit sector documents, and newspapers. It is concluded that, in Metro Manila, a defining characteristic of contemporary urban development is the unprecedented privatization of urban and regional planning. Large developers have conceived of urban development plans on a metrowide scale, and begun to implement these with the assistance of government. This phenomenon has its roots in the historical development of social groups in the Philippines and their shifting interests with the globalization of the Philippine economy. The author concludes that the privatization of planning raises distinct issues for urban planning theory and practice. </jats:p>",

Understanding the Latino urban experience and developing plans to better respond to both the needs of Latino communities and their integration within society is not only relevant, but also urgently necessary. Using the city of Los Angeles as a main lens, in addition to a general look at the urban Southwest, we contribute to the scholarship on the subject with a review of literature on Latino communities. We structure the review as an assessment of the various challenges and opportunities for urban Latinos in the pre-war, postwar, and contemporary city. Focusing on space, culture, economy, and governance, we chart the various roles both the private and public sectors play in meeting these challenges. Our reading of the literature shows that particular government actions in the economic and governance domains in the past had positive impacts on Latino integration, and we call for a similar effort today in addressing contemporary challenges. We conclude by suggesting that future planning scholarship on Latino communities engage the wider urban studies literature, focus on emerging forms of urbanization, and call on planners to sustain increased academic and practical interest in the topic. </jats:p>",

We propose a more rigorous and statistically testable definition of stalled fertility decline that can be applied to time‐series data. We then illustrate the utility of our definition through its application to data from rural South Africa for the period 1990‐2005 collected from a demographic surveillance site. Application of the approach suggests that fertility decline has indeed stalled in rural KwaZulu‐Natal, at about three children per woman. The stall, some 20 percent above the replacement fertility level, does not appear to be associated with a rise in wanted fertility or attenuated access to contraceptive methods. This identification of a stalled fertility decline provides the first evidence of such a stall in southern Africa, the region with the lowest fertility levels in sub‐Saharan Africa.</jats:p>",

This implies that plan generation may be tractable even when a planning problem has an exponentially long minimal solution. We also prove that the problem of plan existence for planning problems with multi-valued variables and chain causal graphs is NP-hard.

In both domains, the aim of the analysis is to reveal policies, ideologies, linguistic structures, etc. that are represented by the discourse. This paper looks not beyond the discourse, but rather at the dynamics of the discourse itself. It does so by means of the SIRN (synergetic inter-representation network) approach that was originally inspired by Bartlett in a study of remembering that also provided the foundation for discourse analysis as practised in cognitive science. The usefulness of the SIRN approach is illustrated by reference to empirical data obtained from participatory observation of a planning team that worked on a plan for the city of Beer Sheva, Israel, during the years 1994—97. </jats:p>",

It lacks prestige because it is seen by many Nigerians as a “bad” form of English and associated with a socially deprived set of people. This paper explores the possibility of empowering NP (and its speakers) by raising the value of the language through status planning, especially in the education system. On the way to realising this goal, it analyses the attitudes of 200 educated Nigerians towards its use as well as towards steps aimed at empowering it. The results show that, although there is no consensus as to whether NP should be granted official status, a large majority of respondents did not favour its use in education. The study highlights three major problems associated with the promotion of NP: (1) lack of economic value, (2) perceived effects on the local languages, and (3) the effect of the use of NP on English language proficiency. The study discovers that empowering<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#en1\"><jats:sup>1</jats:sup></jats:ext-link> NP is a challenge, which will be very difficult to overcome in the near future, and it suggests the way forward.</jats:p>",

The paper examines the relationships between regional theory, different forms of totality and the cartographic impulse, and discusses possible reasons for the Eurocentric cast of some regional research.

The network nodes correspond to the state variable values and the network arcs correspond to the value transitions. The planning problem is to find a path (a sequence of actions) in each network such that, when merged, they constitute a feasible plan. In this paper we present a number of integer programming formulations that model these loosely coupled networks with varying degrees of flexibility. Since merging may introduce exponentially many ordering constraints we implement a so-called branch-and-cut algorithm, in which these constraints are dynamically generated and added to the formulation when needed. Our results are very promising, they improve upon previous planning as integer programming approaches and lay the foundation for integer programming approaches for cost optimal planning.</jats:p>"

A simple function for fluid influx rate distribution in the borehole was then developed. Fluid influx rate is predicted as a function of horizontal borehole length, which is time-dependent. The predicted fluid influx rate at the total depth is used for sizing separators. The total influx volume is predicted by integrating the influx rate over the total time for horizontal drilling. The predicted total influx volume is used for determining the required capacity of reserve tanks. A work procedure was developed for generating fluid inflow rate and influx volume profiles. Application of the procedure is illustrated in solving an example problem. This paper presents drilling engineers a mathematical tool that can be used for sizing separators and reserve tanks during horizontal UBD planning.</jats:p>",

Method: One hundred seventy community-dwelling older adults answered yes-or-no questions about their knowledge of medical conditions and treatments and completed a written questionnaire about their connotations of ambiguous phrases such as “live like a vegetable.” Results: On average, participants answered 78% of all factual questions correctly; however, accuracy ranged from 59% to 94% across individuals. Participants knew the most about basic treatment purposes and procedures and the least about treatment outcomes. Perceptions of equivocal phrases were idiosyncratic, even for conventional terms such as improvement. Discussion: Older adults approach advance care planning with critical misconceptions and individualistic perceptions, about which family and health care professionals may be unaware. Efforts to improve advance care planning should include instruction concerning medical information and encouragement to use explicit language to express treatment preferences. </jats:p>",

Marine and terrestrial conservation planning need to be aligned in an explicit fashion to fully represent threats to marine systems. To integrate conservation planning for terrestrial and marine systems, we used a novel threats assessment that included 5 cross‐system threats in a site‐prioritization exercise for the Pacific Northwest coast ecoregion (U.S.A.). Cross‐system threats are actions or features in one ecological realm that have effects on species in another realm. We considered bulkheads and other forms of shoreline hardening threats to terrestrial systems and roads, logging, agriculture, and urban areas threats to marine systems. We used 2 proxies of freshwater influence on marine environments, validated against a mechanistic model and field observations, to propagate land‐based threats into marine sites. We evaluated the influence of cross‐system threats on conservation priorities by comparing MARXAN outputs for 3 scenarios that identified terrestrial and marine priorities simultaneously: (1) no threats, (2) single‐system threats, and (3) single‐ and cross‐system threats. Including cross‐system threats changed the threat landscape dramatically. As a result the best plan that included only single‐system threats identified 323 sites (161,500 ha) at risk from cross‐system threats. Including these threats changed the location of best sites. By comparing the best and sum solutions of the single‐ and cross‐system scenarios, we identified areas ideal for preservation or restoration through integrated management. Our findings lend quantitative support to the call for explicitly integrated decision making and management action in terrestrial and marine ecosystems.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

Outlining the causes and consequences of this process, this paper suggests that studentification raises important questions about community cohesiveness and that intervention may be required by local authorities if social and cultural conflicts are to be avoided. Detailing the social impacts of studentification in Loughborough, a market town in the English East Midlands, the paper accordingly considers recent housing policies designed to prevent the formation of exclusive ‘student ghettos’. The paper concludes by suggesting that the type of ‘threshold analysis’ utilised in Loughborough may well spread students more thinly across a city, but that the relationship between students and the wider community requires other forms of regulation if town–university tensions are to be effectively managed. Throughout, comparison is made between the Loughborough and other UK university towns where the challenges and opportunities associated with studentification have been differently addressed. </jats:p>",

Four data sets from the UK Census, the Labour Force Survey, the Department of Employment, and Social Security Statistics are used to show changes in employment, unemployment, inactivity, and permanent sickness between 1971 and 2001. The different sources confirm that unemployment becomes increasingly unreliable as a measure of labour market slack. In low-opportunity labour markets many potential workers are not part of the labour force; they are not looking for work or are classified as unemployed. Low levels of opportunity add to measured sickness. The general rule is the greater the degree of labour market slack, the less appropriate unemployment is as a measure of labour reserve. </jats:p>",

Participants with varying levels of musical experience responded to each of four colour-patch stimuli by producing a unique sequence of three taps on three vertically aligned keys. Each tap triggered a tone in most experimental conditions. Response–effect (key-to-tone) mapping was either compatible—taps on the top, middle, and bottom keys triggered high, medium, and low pitched tones, respectively—or incompatible—key-to-tone mapping was scrambled, reversed, or neutral (taps on different keys triggered the same tone). The results suggest that action planning was faster with compatible than with incompatible mappings (and faster than with no tones). Furthermore, the size of this compatibility effect grew with increasing musical experience, which suggests that improvements in auditory imagery ability that typically accompany musical training may augment the role of anticipatory auditory-effect representations during planning. </jats:p>",

This work develops an interactive fuzzy linear programming (FLP) method for solving TPD problems with fuzzy goals, available supply and forecast demand. The proposed method attempts simultaneously to minimize the total production and transportation costs and the total delivery time with reference to available supply, machine capacities and budget constraints at each source, as well as forecast demand and warehouse space constraints at each destination. In addition, the proposed method provides a systematic framework that facilitates the DM interactively to modify the imprecise data and related parameters until a satisfactory solution is derived. An industrial case is used to demonstrate the feasibility of applying the proposed method to real-world TPD problems. Especially, several significant characteristics of the proposed FLP method are presented in contrast to those of the main TPD methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper offers a sustained reflection on the nature of corporeal vulnerability as an inherent and noneliminable aspect of corporeal existence. One of the many remarkable things about the recent interest in embodiment, emotion, practice, and performance, in the body-in-action, in the social sciences is the general lack of thought that has been given to the fact of vulnerability. The paper suggests that thinking through the nature of vulnerability could have a considerable effect on how we think about embodiment as well as on wider processes of subjectification, signification, and sociality. However, because of the persistence of a primary role being given to intentional or auto-affective action in the theorisation of embodiment across a number of theoretical perspectives, vulnerability remains largely unthought of within much current work on the body within Anglo-American social science. Drawing on the writing of Emmanuel Levinas and reflecting on experiences of corporeal expropriation such as insomnia and exhaustion, I suggest how we may begin to think sensibility and the sensuous beyond their almost exclusive interpretation in terms of comprehension, purpose, or intention while retaining the irreducibility of corporeal life to a matter of social construction or contextual epiphenomenon. Thus, the paper develops an account of corporeal life as inherently susceptible, receptive, exposed, as inherently open beyond its capacities, and reflects on the implications of this realisation for thinking about the genesis of meaning and signification and the social relation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a detailed study of the location history of eight software and information technology (IT) enabled service firms, with varying attributes such as age of firm, type of work undertaken, and ownership sited in the southern Indian city of Bangalore. These cases are used to relate urban restructuring occurring in the city of Bangalore to the strategic shifting of location of firms within the urban fabric. While IT firms cannot be strictly classified as producer services, it is possible to contextualise their location decisions in terms of other office-based economic activities, such as producer services. Findings from the case studies are examined in relation to urban growth theories of the 1980s and 90s, which were related to an expansion of the service sector in advanced economies. The literature discussed in this paper explains the role of growth in producer services in suburbanisation of office space and the development of ‘edge cities’ and ‘suburban downtowns’ as alternatives to and in competition with traditional city centres. Studies of office location and contact patterns indicate the retention of management functions in the CBDs, with a consequent relocation of routine office operations to these suburban office spaces. The findings from the firms studied in Bangalore indicate a reverse pattern of peripheralisation of control functions and a retention of routine production functions in the core urban areas. The limited need for face-to-face contacts with actors in the local urban economy and the export-related output of this offshore industry are contributors to this apparent reversal of location dynamics. The paper briefly concludes with directions for future research on such specialised service production activity that is often being located in cities of developing countries, and its impact on the urban structure of these cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the trends marking neoliberalism and the attack on the welfare state from the right is the move toward the privatization of public services. Recent research in both the United States and Canada suggests that residents of the suburbs of large urban regions are more likely to vote for political parties on the right and to support neoliberal policies such as privatization, while the opposite is true for inner-city dwellers. However, the reasons why such a spatial division should occur have received little academic attention. This paper seeks to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the relationship between residential location, spatial factors, and attitudes toward privatization, using survey data collected in the Toronto region. Results suggest that the way urban space influences residents' daily routines and personal experiences may then mediate their perception of the uses of public services and the efficacy of government spending, factors which are found to affect spatial disparities in support of and/or in opposition to privatization. Thus, there is some evidence that urban spatial form is important for understanding the geographic unevenness of support for neoliberalism, and thus ultimately for the production of ideology. </jats:p>",

However, little is known about older adults' advance care plans and the characteristics of those who plan. This study used a stratified random sampling design to survey older adults (n = 203) in the state of Florida regarding their attitudes toward future care and planning behavior in social-environmental, health, and financial domains. Regression analyses were conducted to determine factors most predictive of older adults' attitudes toward future care and planning behavior by domain. Results suggests that gender, age, and functional status predict greater planning behavior and more accepting attitudes toward long-term care, whereas living alone and poor health status are associated with less advance care planning behavior and greater nonaccepting attitudes. Factors associated with a greater likelihood to have advance care planning documents and concrete plans for future care include increased age, higher educational attainment, and female gender. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is simplistic to think of the impacts of new information and communication technologies (NICTs) in terms of a single ‘digital divide’, or even a small number of them. As developments in what has been termed the ‘e-society’ reach wider and more generalised audiences, so it becomes appropriate to think of digital media as having wider-ranging but differentiated impacts upon consumer transactions, information gathering, and citizen participation. This paper describes the development of a detailed, nationwide household classification based on levels of awareness of different NICTs; levels of use of NICTs; and their perceived impacts upon human capital formation and the quality of life. It discusses how multivariate classification of individuals and households makes it possible to provide a context for detailed case studies, and hence to identify how policy might best improve both the quality and degree of society's access to NICTs. The primary focus of the paper is to describe how this bespoke classification is developed, but it also illustrates how it may be used to investigate a range of regional and subregional policy issues. As such, we illustrate how the classification provides a valuable context for study of the e-society and for people's engagement with NICT In more general terms, we anticipate the likely net benefits of combining the most appropriate methods, techniques, datasets, and practices that are used in the public and private sectors. </jats:p>",

Two patients, one with cancer of the cervix and one with cancer of the endometrium, are used as examples to illustrate the advantages of using TAUS. TAUS is used to guide applicator insertion and check the applicator in the treatment position. The dimensions of the uterus are recorded. Brachytherapy isodose plans are generated based on these measurements. Confirmation of uterine dimensions and isodose coverage is obtained using MRI taken after the initial fraction of treatment has been delivered. We illustrate how TAUS is successfully used to correct and verify tandem placement after the patient has been moved from insertion to treatment position. We also show how to use TAUS for conformal planning, based on individually derived target dimensions. TAUS has successfully been used to conformally plan treatment to the uterus and cervix, minimizing brachytherapy‐related toxicity to surrounding structures. Ultrasound is portable, inexpensive and simple to use and allows for accurate, conformal, reproducible and adaptive treatments.</jats:p>",

The land-planning development of the sites without taking into consideration the geotechnical characteristics of the slopes led to the incorrect selection of the new use or to the misplacement of infrastructure. The main purpose of this paper is to present the geotechnical problems that occurred at constructed facilities and to analyse the influence of correct land-planning design on the reduction of rock fall hazard and the cost of slope support measures.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The problems arising from the unsuitable land-planning design of facilities in abandoned quarries are presented by means of case studies from the Athens urban environment. Most of the data are from the case study of the stability problems of the slopes surrounding the infrastructure of the Attiko Alsos Park, constructed in the abandoned quarries of the Turkovounia hill. To highlight that the problems at Attiko Alsos Park are not atypical, two other old quarry sites are briefly reviewed.</jats:p>",

Perhaps nowhere in the USA has the regulation of public space been as far-reaching as in Las Vegas, Nevada, where the financial stakes associated with sidewalks are enormous. This study examines how local officials mediate among varied and competing uses of the sidewalk. In defining the function of the sidewalks narrowly and passively deferring questions of civil liberties, local officials have effectively controlled almost all aspects of public behavior. In recent years, cities have invested in major commercial realization projects. Evidence from this case study suggests that, if successful, these developments will engender more extensive regulation of public life and the further curtailment of the freedoms traditionally guaranteed to citizen activity in public places. </jats:p>",

Moreover, improved risk evaluation was reported as a result. Use of the methodology made the well planning groups able to evaluate the economical consequence of increasing the risk with the purpose of maximizing the hydrocarbon production.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The contingent valuation method has become an established and major part of the toolbox used to produce monetary values for evaluating environmental changes. It has been used to inform everything from the value of ecosystem services to cultural heritage to loss of life. The method has been highly controversial at various stages but despite this, or perhaps due to the publicity, it has grown in scope and scale. Numerous occurrences of ‘bias’ and ‘anomalies’ in results have been addressed by improved design, so providing guidance on perfected approaches to making sure respondents reveal preferences in accord with theoretical expectations. That respondents may not wish to and often fail to conform is seen as a challenge for the design team to be more ingenious with their incentive mechanisms which get respondents to act ‘rationally’. Failing this, data can be classified and treated to derive ‘conservative’ results. I document in this paper how whole areas of evidence from contingent valuation have been removed from consideration by design, with respondents expected to conform to an idealised rational agent model or to suffer branding and exclusion as having the ‘wrong motives’. While the method is then susceptible to manipulation (eg to meet sponsors' requirements), if used more scientifically it also holds the potential to reveal fundamental flaws in economic theory and ways to advance that same theory. </jats:p>",

To determine if metatarsal osteotomies used in forefoot reconstruction to restore the normal anatomical curve would decrease the risk of transfer metatarsalgia, the clinical outcomes of such osteotomies were correlated with the preoperative planning. Materials and Methods: Between 2000 and 2005, 63 patients (73 feet) with persistent metatarsalgia had forefoot reconstructions that included one or more Weil osteotomies designed to restore the theoretically ideal foot morphotype described by Maestro et al. and based on the relative lengths of the lesser rays. Results: The mean preoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score of 36.2 improved to 82.2 post-operatively. Sixty-two (85%) of the 73 feet were pain-free after surgery. Conclusion: In spite of careful preoperative planning, it was difficult to obtain the ideal foot type, and the frequency of transfer metatarsalgia in our patients was similar to that reported in the literature. A significant ( p = 0.03) relationship was identified between the amount of preoperative instability and the risk of developing transfer metatarsalgia. Preoperative dorsoplantar standing radiographs, although helpful in planning surgery to obtain appropriate metatarsal lengths, should not be the only method used for operative planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise-wide optimization (EWO) is a new emerging area that lies at the interface of chemical engineering and operations research, and has become a major goal in the process industries due to the increasing pressures for remaining competitive in the global marketplace. EWO involves optimizing the operations of supply, production and distribution activities of a company to reduce costs and inventories. A major focus in EWO is the production optimization, which often requires the use of nonlinear process models. Major operational items include production planning, scheduliOverview of Planning and Scheduling for Enterprise-wide Optimization of Process Industriesng, real-time optimization and control. This paper provides an overview of major challenges in the development of deterministic and stochastic linear/nonlinear optimization models and algorithms for the optimization of entire supply chains that are involved in EWO problems. We specifically review two major challenges: (a) modeling of planning and scheduling, (b) multiscale optimization. We consider two major applications in batch scheduling and crude oil scheduling. We conclude with a brief discussion on future directions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Unternehmensweite Optimierung (Enterprise-wide optimization, EWO) ist ein neues Gebiet an der Schnittstelle zwischen chemischer Verfahrenstechnik und Operations Research. Wegen steigender Wettbewerbsanforderungen auf den globalen Märkten hat es sich zu einem bedeutenden Ziel in der Prozessindustrie entwickelt. EWO umfasst die Optimierung des Betriebs von Versorgungs-, Herstellungs- und Verteilungsaktivitäten von Unternehmen mit dem Ziel der Verringerung von Kosten und Lagerbeständen. Ein wichtiger Bereich von EWO ist die Optimierung der Herstellung, wozu häufig nichtlineare Prozessmodelle erforderlich sind. Produktionsplanung und -feinplanung, Echtzeitoptimierung und Regelung gehören zu den wichtige operativen Aufgaben. Dieser Beitrag liefert eine Übersicht über die wesentlichen Herausforderungen in der Entwicklung von deterministischen sowie linearen/nichtlinearen stochastischen Optimierungsmodellen und Algorithmen zur Optimierung der gesamten Versorgungskette (supply chain), die Teil der EWO-Problemstellung sind. Insbesondere werden zwei wesentliche Herausforderungen besprochen: (a) Die Modellierung von Planungs- und Feinplanungsaufgaben, und (b) die Optimierung auf verschiedenen Zeitskalen (multiscale optimization). Dazu werden zwei Anwendungen der Feinplanung im Bereich Chargenprozesse sowie Mineralölverarbeitung vorgestellt. Eine kurze Diskussion und ein Ausblick auf zukünftige Arbeiten beschließen den Beitrag.</jats:p>",

Multiple suppliers send raw materials (RMs) to a distribution center (DC) that delivers them to a unique plant where the storage of the RMs and the finished goods is not possible. Then, the finished goods are directly shipped to multiple customers having just‐in‐time (JIT) demands. Under these hypotheses, we show that the problem can be reduced to multiple suppliers and one DC. Afterwards, we analyze two cases; in the first, we consider an uncapacitated storage at DC, and in the second, we analyze the capacitated storage case. For the first case, we show that the problem is NP‐hard in the ordinary sense using the Knapsack decision problem. We then propose two exact methods: a mixed integer linear program (MILP) and a pseudopolynomial dynamic program. A classical dynamic program and an improved one using the idea of Shaw and Wagelmans are given. With numerical tests we show that the dynamic program gives the optimal solution in reasonable time for quite large instances compared with the MILP. For the second case, the capacity limitation in DC is assumed, which makes the problem solving more challenging. We propose an MILP and a dynamic programming‐based heuristic that provides solutions close to the optimal solution in very short times.</jats:p>",

This presents a challenge for managers who must choose appropriate large‐scale spatial frameworks for systematic conservation planning. We demonstrate how systematically collected community data can be used to evaluate existing biogeographic classifications, identify the most appropriate metric for biogeographic patterns seen in other taxonomic groups, and develop an independent biogeographic classification scheme for systematic conservation planning. We evaluated 6 existing biogeographic classifications for New Zealand's nearshore marine environment with community‐similarity metrics derived from abundance and presence–absence data for macroalgae (107 species) and mobile macroinvertebrates (44 species). The concordance between community metrics and the previous classifications was high, as indicated by a high multivariate classification success (CS) (74.3–98.3%). Subsequently, we carried out an independent classification analysis on each community metric to identify biogeographic units within a hierarchical spatial framework. The classification derived from macroalgal presence–absence data achieved the highest CS and could be used as a mesoscale classification scheme in which 11 regional groupings (i.e., bioregions) (CS = 73.8–84.8%) are nested within northern and southern biogeographic provinces (CS = 90.3–98.7%). These techniques can be used in systematic conservation planning to inform the design of representative and comprehensive networks of marine protected areas through evaluation of the current coverage of marine reserves in each bioregion. Currently, 0.22% of the territorial sea around mainland New Zealand is protected in no‐take marine protected areas in which 0–1.5% of each bioregion represented.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Functional terrorism preparedness requires changes in organizational thinking about external environmental threats. This shift in organizational thinking could be led by human resource departments. In order to achieve this goal, HR departments must redefine their role in terms of crisis management, and then four key planning measures for insuring postemergency operations should be observed. Using system dynamics (SD) methodology, this article examines the causes of states in which organizations operate after terrorist attacks. Based on the qualitative analytic approach of causal loops, this article explores the major challenges for HR development prompted by terrorism. Specifically, we focus on changes both to organizational communication and to workforce planning and succession. These activities are a tremendous challenge immediately following a disaster. A functional HR plan must include elements for proactive alertness, the ability to dispatch inventory, evacuation plans, and record preservation coupled with dissemination to employees and explicit employee training and cross‐cultural management. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

Using analytic and numerical methods we determine the conditions relating to g, Λ, and θ which result in three types of emission profile. These consist of: type-I profiles, in which emissions continue to rise but at a reduced rate; type-II profiles which fall, attain a minimum, and subsequently rise from a lower base; and type-Ill profiles which continue to fall over a forecasting period. For all profiles we determine the total reduction in vehicle emissions arising from revised standards, and the sensitivity of the total emissions to changes in their determining factors. Data from the UK are used to illustrate the approach which is extended in a wide range of sensitivity tests to explore differences in emission profiles between advanced industrialised and rapidly developing countries. We show that while it may be necessary for all countries to rely on both technological and behavioural policy instruments to reduce emissions, in advanced industrialised countries it may be more effective to improve emission standards, while, in contrast, moderating the rate of traffic growth may be relatively more effective in the rapidly industrialising world. The profiles resulting from the change in emission standards accompanying the introduction of catalytic converters are used to illustrate the general approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Purpose: To measure the sensitivity of deformable image registration to image noise. Deformable image registration can be used to map organ contours and other treatment planning data from one CT to another. These CT studies can be acquired with either conventional fan‐beam CT systems or more novel cone‐beam CT techniques. However, cone‐beam CT images can have higher noise levels than fan‐beam CT, which might reduce registration accuracy. We have investigated the effect of image quality differences on the deformable registration of fan‐beam CTs and CTs with simulated cone‐beam noise. Method: Our study used three CT studies for each of five prostate patients. Each CT was contoured by three experienced radiation oncologists. For each patient, one CT was designated the source image and the other two were target images. A deformable image registration process was used to register each source CT to each target CT and then transfer the manually drawn treatment planning contours from the source CT to the target CTs. The accuracy of the automatically transferred contours (and thus of the deformable registration process) was assessed by comparing them to the manual contours on the target CTs, with the differences evaluated with respect to interobserver variability in the manual contours. Then each of the target CTs was modified to include increased noise characteristic of cone‐beam CT and the tests were repeated. Changes in registration accuracy due to increased noise were detected by monitoring changes in the automatically transferred contours. Results: We found that the additional noise caused no significant loss of registration accuracy at magnitudes that exceeded what would normally be found in an actual cone‐beam CT. Summary: We conclude that noise levels in cone‐beam CTs that might reduce manual contouring accuracy do not reduce image registration and automatic contouring accuracy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this study we sought to assess the potential of the respiratory tumor tracking system of the CyberKnife to administer 3 fractions of 15 Gy in the treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The CyberKnife plans were compared to those developed for 3-D conformal radiotherapy (3-D CRT) administering 20 fractions of 3 Gy based on a slow CT. Ten patients with stage I NSCLC, who were previously treated with 3-D CRT, were re-planned with the CyberKnife treatment planning system. In the 3-D CRT plan, the planning target volume (PTV) included the gross tumor volume (GTV)<jats:sub>slow</jats:sub> and a 15-mm margin, whereas in the CyberKnife plan the margin was 8 mm. The physical doses from both treatment plans were converted to normalized total doses (NTD) using the linear quadratic model with an α/β<jats:sub>tumor</jats:sub> of 10 Gy and α/β<jats:sub>organs</jats:sub><jats:sub>at</jats:sub><jats:sub>risk</jats:sub><jats:sub>(OAR)</jats:sub> of 3 Gy. The average minimal and mean doses administered to the PTV with the CyberKnife and 3-D CRT were 93 and 115.8 Gy and 61 and 66 Gy, respectively (p&lt;0.0001). The mean V<jats:sub>20</jats:sub> of the CyberKnife and 3-D CRT plans were 8.2% and 6.8%, respectively (p=0.124). Both plans complied with the OAR constraints. In conclusion, 4-dimensional stereotactic radiotherapy can increase the minimal and mean biological dose with 51% and 75%, in comparison with 3-D CRT without significantly increasing the V<jats:sub>20</jats:sub>, respectively. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The health and diet impacts of a large-scale food retail development within a deprived area of Glasgow (Springburn) are reported. The study used a prospective quasi-experimental design which compared changes in diet and psychological health in an area where a new hypermarket was built (the intervention area) with a similarly deprived comparison area in Glasgow (Shettleston). A postal survey was undertaken both before and one year after the hypermarket was built, to assess changes in diet, self-reported health, and perceptions of neighbourhood. Changes in the retail structure of both areas were assessed through a ‘before-and-(repeated)-after’ intervention shop count survey. Qualitative data on diet, the neighbourhood, and the impact of the store were collected through focus groups. The quantitative study found limited improvements in diet and health. There was weak evidence for the impact of the hypermarket on population diet. There was weak evidence that poor psychological health in the intervention area reduced. Amongst those who ‘switched’ to the new hypermarket there was weak evidence of a small improvement in mean fruit and vegetable consumption but good evidence of psychological health improvement. Qualitative and retail survey results reinforce this, identifying perceptions of areal improvement through redevelopment and a small positive impact of the new store on the retail structure of the intervention area. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The authors present a comparative study of intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT) treatment planning employing algorithms of three‐dimensional (3D) modulation, and 2.5‐dimensional (2.5D) modulation, and intensity modulated distal edge tracking (DET) [A. Lomax, Phys. Med. Biol. 44, 185–205 (1999)] applied to the treatment of head‐and‐neck cancer radiotherapy. These three approaches were also compared with 6 MV photon intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). All algorithms were implemented in the University of Florida Optimized Radiation Therapy system using a finite sized pencil beam dose model and a convex fluence map optimization model. The 3D IMPT and the DET algorithms showed considerable advantages over the photon IMRT in terms of dose conformity and sparing of organs at risk when the beam number was not constrained. The 2.5D algorithm did not show an advantage over the photon IMRT except in the dose reduction to the distant healthy tissues, which is inherent in proton beam delivery. The influences of proton beam number and pencil beam size on the IMPT plan quality were also studied. Out of 24 cases studied, three cases could be adequately planned with one beam and 12 cases could be adequately planned with two beams, but the dose uniformity was often marginally acceptable. Adding one or two more beams in each case dramatically improved the dose uniformity. The finite pencil beam size had more influence on the plan quality of the 2.5D and DET algorithms than that of the 3D IMPT. To obtain a satisfactory plan quality, a 0.5 cm pencil beam size was required for the 3D IMPT and a 0.3 cm size was required for the 2.5D and the DET algorithms. Delivery of the IMPT plans produced in this study would require a proton beam spot scanning technique that has yet to be developed clinically.</jats:p>",

We examined local public health agencies’ involvement in community illicit drug policy advocacy and provision related to youths to determine the extent to which public health agencies were involved in local drug policy activities and could potentially provide an infrastructure for policy alternatives. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods. We conducted telephone interviews from 1999 to 2003 with 1793 US public health agencies in 804 communities surrounding schools participating in the Monitoring the Future study. Respondents reported public health agency planning, priorities, and involvement in alternative drug policy advocacy and prevention activities.

Most students lived where public health agencies provided resources for community- and school-based drug use prevention. More than one third resided where public health agencies advocated for drug policy alternatives and more than one quarter where public health agencies were involved in juvenile drug court programs. Such activities were significantly higher in urban communities, in the West, and in sites where the proportion of African Americans was above the national average. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions. Although local public health agencies could increase participation levels in drug policy alternatives, current involvement suggests that agencies may provide a base for supporting the development of public health alternatives to deterrence-based drug policies. Such a base may be more likely in communities with the highest need for such policies and services. </jats:p>",

In order to accomplish this end, the researcher referred to the theoretical background of the instructional design science, for defining the concept of planning instruction, its domains and types. The researcher differentiated among the mental, written, and mental and written types of planning on one hand, and the daily, monthly, seasonally, and yearly types of planning on the other. The researcher also determined the elements of instructional plan to be as follows: educational goals, instructional content, behavioral objectives, instructional strategies, mass media, educational activities, cognitive activators, and evaluation procedures, along with the loop of feedback. In addition, the researcher clarified the reference frame of the instructional plan such as: target population, instructional environment, psychological climate, and budget to be as guidance for the planner during her/his planning. At the end, the researcher draws an ideal picture of the instructional plan by checking the adequacy and consistency of its items. The research came along with applications to be as recommendations for the people who are interested in educational planning and development affairs.</jats:p>",
