A land economist and real estate consultant and appraiser throughout most of his professional life, Hoyt's career combined practice and scholarship, though of a non-academic variety. This article explores Hoyt's intellectual contributions, his melding of practice and theory, and his relationship to the field of planning. </jats:p>",

Many planned unit developments and new-urbanism-style projects have turned to private roads. This paper considers some of the spatial, socioeconomic, and planning implications created by private roads in the Canadian context. While private streets provide a useful tool for achieving design and density objectives, and for transferring the burden of development costs to those who benefit from growth, they exacerbate social segregation and spatial fragmentation of the urban landscape. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper focuses on problems and their causes and cures in policy and planning for large-infrastructure projects. First, it identifies as the main problem in major infrastructure developments pervasive misinformation about the costs, benefits, and risks involved. A consequence of misinformation is cost overruns, benefit shortfalls, and waste. Second, it explores the causes of misinformation and finds that political-economic explanations best account for the available evidence: planners and promoters deliberately misrepresent costs, benefits, and risks in order to increase the likelihood that it is their projects, and not those of their competition, that gain approval and funding. This results in the ‘survival of the unfittest’, in which often it is not the best projects that are built, but the most misrepresented ones. Finally, it presents measures for reforming policy and planning for large-infrastructure projects with a focus on better planning methods and changed governance structures, the latter being more important. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Dutch Parliamentary Commission on Infrastructural Projects has conducted a parliamentary inquiry into the decisionmaking process and implementation control in two major infrastructural projects: the Betuwe Freight Line between Rotterdam and Germany, and the HSL - Zuid— the high-speed rail link which will connect Amsterdam with Belgium and France. The commission proposes a new assessment framework which gives parliament better control of the decisionmaking process for future large projects. In this contribution I discuss the development and design of large infrastructure projects, including the way the territorial impact of these projects is mitigated. I observe that problems are often approached from extremely narrow terms of reference, from one favourite solution, whereby countless potentially worthwhile alternative solutions are dismissed out of hand or enter the picture too late. In addition, problems concerning the mitigation of territorial impacts of infrastructure are misjudged in the beginning, and lead to cost overruns at a later stage. There is too much focus on the infrastructure track and not enough focus on area development. Also, the operation of the infrastructure project is misjudged and attention is too narrowly focused on the investment aspects of the project. I formulate some lessons for the future, not only for the Netherlands, but also for other modern countries. The timely generation and acknowledgement of infrastructure alternatives enhances the democratic process and quality of public decisionmaking. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For urban transportation planners these are challenging times. Mounting practical concerns are mirrored by more fundamental critiques. The latter comes together in the observation that conventional approaches do not adequately account for the irreducible uncertainty of future developments. The author's central aim is to explore whether and how an evolutionary approach can help overcome this limit. Two core hypotheses are formulated. The first is that the urban transportation system behaves in an evolutionary fashion. The second hypothesis is that, because of this, urban transportation planning needs to focus on enhancing the resilience and adaptability of the system. Changes in transport and land-use development patterns and policies, and in the broader context of the postwar period in the Amsterdam region, are analysed in order to illustrate the two core hypotheses. More general implications are also drawn. </jats:p>",

Both Democracity and Futurama were displays at the 1939 New York World's Fair, and like many contemporary New Urbanist projects, both were totalizing visions—holistic attempts to remake the entire American landscape and in so doing link art and life in the name of democracy. It is the author's argument that many New Urbanist planners suffer from what she calls historical amnesia rooted in a myopic form of nostalgia, since, as she demonstrates in the article, the plans for Democracity and Futurama contain both the closest precursors and the root of many of the problems that proponents of New Urbanism are attempting to rectify. By exploring these two historical models within the context of contemporary urban community building, the author calls for the eradication of historical amnesia in further planning for the city of the future and the development of a new model of American urbanism that appropriates nostalgia for more radical ends and grounds it in the present and its problems. </jats:p>",

It focuses on three key factors: political analysis, strategic business approach and international inputs.</jats:p><jats:p>Most of the analyses tend to look at the technical aspects of disease prevention and control, of political analysis there is a marked absence. Yet, we know that wider contextual or macro factors such as power and political decision making can make or break a programme.</jats:p><jats:p>Many senior managers in public sector institutions are preoccupied with day‐to‐day work. Successful businesses in the private sector have some things in common with each other. Outstanding leadership, a strategic and action orientated culture, highly focused on comparative strengths on priorities and quality being some of the key ones. Adopting such successful business characteristics might make the difference to public institutions.</jats:p><jats:p>The move to results based institutions by focussing on outputs and outcomes is for the better. However, we still need to rigorously examine the quality of inputs that the increasing availability of funds is being used on. This is especially so in relation to needing a better balance between aid for health services and that for institutional and health systems development. In addition, technical advisers from development partners need to work more across a ministry of health on institutional and management change to have a greater impact on achieving targets.

Mission accomplishment is achieved by identifying opportunities for such integration through an initial strategic assessment and then by developing, piloting, implementing, evaluating and disseminating programmes and services that meet the documented needs of both civilian and military partners. The civilian and military sectors each have numerous directives, standards, regulations and guidelines that encourage or require such integration. Additionally, challenges identified from response activities during natural disasters such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have highlighted the necessity of achieving a greater level of CIV/MIL integration. Although civilian and military organisations themselves have expressed interest in preparing for joint responses, substantial support by joint CIV/MIL leadership will be required to identify and acquire appropriate resources; initiate planning; develop organisational infrastructure; identify, develop, pilot, evaluate, implement and disseminate specific needs and suitable activities to address them; develop a broad-based constituency advocating for the support and promotion of integration activities; and provide the subject matter expertise and advice required to keep the tasks on purpose and on target.</jats:p>"

Yet, because the emergency management model presumes that recovery quickly follows response, governments focus only on short-term, localized displacement. However, long-term and long-distance displacement exposes a gray area between immediate shelter and permanent housing, along with concerns about vulnerability, housing availability, and land development. We begin this article by discussing the transition between response and recovery. We then review literature regarding social vulnerability, displacement, provision of temporary housing, households' return decisions, and disaster-driven land development and housing construction processes. We close with thoughts on future research to increase planners' understanding of the issues involved and to help them craft effective policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the early 1970s, neighborhood-based movements arose in Portland, Oregon, against freeways, while networks of individuals championed a revival of rail transit. At decade's end, regional leaders rejected two interstate freeways, repudiated a freeway-based regional transportation plan, and agreed to build the beginning of a regional rail system. In seeming contradiction to their anti-auto actions, they also lobbied Congress to change federal law so that they could spend money from deleted interstate highway projects on noninterstate roads rather than on transit. This article documents how planners and power brokers in Portland negotiated among themselves to channel the energy from what began as a citizen- and neighborhood-based revolution into the beginnings of a new consensus about transit, road, and land use development by the end of the decade, one that implicitly recognized personal preference for mass mobility but that explicitly championed designs of transportation facilities to reflect local objectives. </jats:p>",

The model uses high-resolution spatial data in the form of irregularly sized and shaped land parcels, and incorporates synchronous and asynchronous development in order to model more realistically land-use change at the land parcel scale. The model allows urban planners and other stakeholders to evaluate how different subdivision designs will influence development under varying population growth rates and buyer preferences. A model prototype has been developed in a common desktop GIS and applied to a rapidly developing area of a midsized Canadian city. </jats:p>",

Two major concerns are related to public health care outsourcing practice. The first one involves the suitability of the outsourcing strategy in the public sector, principally with reference to the outsourcing of essential clinical services. The second one relates to the actual benefits of the outsourcing practice in health care, in terms of cost reduction and increasing efficiency.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper aims to contribute to the debate and literature on outsourcing through a national survey carried out in the Italian National Health Service.</jats:p><jats:p>In order to achieve the research objective, a questionnaire was developed and, after a pilot test, it was mailed to all Italian public providers. The total response rate was around 42%. Results showed that outsourcing is a widespread phenomenon within health care, especially in the ancillary services area. Moreover, results showed many criticalities of the outsourcing practice in the Italian health‐care sector. On the one hand, criticalities concerned the reasons for outsourcing, the characteristics of the outsourced services and the management of the relationship with the vendor. With reference to essential clinical service, outsourcing, as currently managed by health‐care providers, may potentially weaken their ability to reach its own objectives. On the other hand, criticalities related to respondent‐perceived benefits. Despite the overall positive outsourcing experience expressed in the survey, the results on perceived benefits showed that the effects of outsourcing did not always align to managers' expectations, especially in the cost containment and efficiency area.

In many reserve planning contexts this is an artificial and unrealistic limitation, as multiple categories of protection may be possible and desirable, especially if certain conservation elements such as rare species require special protection or management. In this paper we consider the implications of different levels of protection for species conservation and for the selection of reserve sites. New integer programming models are formulated for this problem of optimal site selection, and are presented in the context of a five-step procedure for identifying tradeoffs in the number of sites selected for each of multiple categories of protection.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Decision making with respect to large infrastructure projects is at least partly based on ex ante evaluations of costs and impacts. Impacts include economic, environmental, and social impacts, sometimes aggregated in a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). For such ex ante evaluations the quality of the related demand and costs forecasts is very important. This paper aims to answer four questions: (1) What is the quality of demand forecasts for large infrastructure projects? (2) What is the quality of cost forecasts for these projects? (3) How can current practices with respect to assessing the demand and cost forecasts be improved? (4) Which implications do the insights have for practice, and which challenges for future research can be derived from the findings? A literature review is used to answer the first three questions. It is concluded that the quality of transport demand and costs forecasts is often very poor, especially for rail projects. This is not so much a lack of adequate forecasting techniques or a matter of insight into the factors determining costs, but more the strategic behaviour of some actors. Improvements therefore should not only be looked for in the area of transport demand and cost-estimation methodologies, but should also focus on the question of how strategic behaviour can be avoided or at least limited. These conclusions are very important for CBA because cost underestimations and demand overestimations have a major impact on the cost-benefit ratio and decrease the potentially positive impact of CBA on the quality of decision making. The paper discusses several challenges for related future research. </jats:p>",

This assumption is not at all evident in the case of urban development, where the behavior of developers and planners is defined by the complex interaction between long-term and short-term plan guidelines, local spatial and temporal conditions, and individual entrepreneurial activity and cognition. In this paper we validate the first-order recursion approach in an artificial game environment: thirty geography students were asked to construct a ‘city’ on the floor of a large room, with each student using the same set of fifty-two building mock-ups. Based on the analysis of game outcomes, the first-order recursive set of behavioral rules shared by all the participants is estimated and further employed for computer generation of artificial cities. Comparison between the human-built and model patterns reveals that the constructed set of rules is sufficient for representing the dynamics of the majority of experimental patterns; however, the behavior of some participants differs and we analyze these differences. We consider this experiment as a preliminary yet important step towards the adequate modeling of decision-making behavior among real developers and planners. </jats:p>",

I define the requirements of a best-practice transport CBA and show the difficulties in achieving these for large-scale projects. The main difficulties discussed are those of forecasting over long time periods, dealing with imperfect competition in transport-using sectors to obtain estimations of wider transport benefits, introducing private finance and appraising network effects. I conclude that CBA can remain a valuable tool as part of the appraisal process but that the inputs to a CBA have to be carefully assessed, and complementary approaches, such as computable general equilibrium modelling, have a useful role to play for very large or network projects. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Whilst it is generally accepted that architecturally or historically significant buildings should be protected in the common interest, conservation policy often raises a series of dilemmas for governments in terms of balancing demands for preservation and change. In 1987 statutory protection for historic buildings in England was extended to the post-Second World War (ie post-1945) era, taking conservation planning into new and sometimes controversial territory. This paper examines the origins and evolution of England's postwar listing programme, exploring the factors that prompted the state to extend protection into such a politically contentious area of conservation policy. Attention is drawn to the lobbying role of influential postwar conservation lobbyists located within and outside state structures in making the case for 1950s and 1960s architecture. However, the politics and practices of postwar listing are ultimately shown to be rooted in the underlying logic of built heritage regulation in England. The paper offers original insights into the state's role as conservation champion and its implications for what gets protected and why from the physical legacy of 1950s and 1960s design. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Rapidly declining groundwater levels since the early 1990s have raised serious concern in Monroe County, Michigan. Hydrological studies suggest that land-use changes have caused this decline. The mechanisms linking land-use and groundwater dynamics are not clear, however. In this paper I present WULUM, the Water-Use and Land-Use Model, an agent-based model that serves as an analytical framework to understand how these processes interact to create the observed patterns of resource depletion, and to suggest policies to reverse the process. The land-use component includes the main groundwater extractors in the county—stone quarries, golf courses, farms, and households. The groundwater component includes the glacial deposits and the underlying bedrock acquifer. The behavior of water users is defined by simple rules that determine their location and consumption. The dynamics of groundwater are represented through infiltration and diffusion rules between each cell and its immediate neighbors. Initial explorations with the model showed that land-use patterns contributed significantly to groundwater declines, while eliminating quarry dewatering did not entirely solve the problem. Both low-density and high-density zoning restrictions improved aquifer conditions over medium-density development, suggesting a nonlinear relationship between intensity of residential use and groundwater levels. Moreover, of all the natural and policy variables, zoning had the greatest influence on urban settlement and therefore on resource consumption. </jats:p>",

Disaster medical assistance teams (DMATs) were deployed to aid victims of the storm as part of the National Disaster Medical System. The response, which included deployment to the New Orleans Superdome, the Louis Armstrong International Airport and West Jefferson Medical Center, provides the basis of this paper. With an estimated 70,000 to 100,000 people seeking refuge in the Superdome, the DMATs set up a triage/treatment area in the basketball/ice arena for an estimated 3,500 special needs (eg elderly) and medical patients. Based on those experiences and the following four weeks of response in New Orleans, this paper addresses business continuity by preparing the individuals and communities of an organisation to be self-sustained, thereby enabling the organisation to focus better on corporate response and recovery. The paper will address corporate emergency preparedness and the areas of communications, command and control, and training.</jats:p>"

Results indicate that the Boomers accumulated more wealth than the previous cohort, largely because they benefited from rising house prices. Nevertheless, some Boomer families are less well off, particularly those headed by those with low education and low income, and minorities. The survey also shows that many Boomers have not planned for retirement, and like the earlier cohort, nonplanners have much less wealth than planners. In other words, lack of planning is tantamount to lack of saving, irrespective of the economic changes observed over the last dozen years.</jats:p>",

As part of a larger multidisciplinary study into climate-related forms of sense-making this paper explores which frames are used by the citizens of Western European countries and, in particular, the Netherlands. Three recent multi-national public opinion surveys were analysed to examine beliefs about climate change in the context of beliefs about energy technology and concerns about other environmental issues, such as natural disasters. It appeared that many citizens had only vague ideas about the energy situation and that these do not constitute an unequivocal frame for climate issues. In contrast, the results suggest that the long-lasting rainfall and severe floods in Central Europe have had a significant impact. Climate change was often framed in a way that articulates its associations with rain- and river-based problems. This result is extremely important for risk communication, because especially in the Netherlands with its vulnerable coastal zones climate change may produce many more consequences than rain- and river-based problems only.</jats:p>",

The current “bird flu' virus, designated as H5N1, is of immediate concern because it has already shown itself in parts of Asia and Europe. There is a fear that it may bring sickness and death on an unimaginable scale, devastate cities and towns, and bring business to a halt. While the virus has so far killed only a few people, there is a possibility that it will mutate into a form which is easily transmissible between humans, resulting in a global pandemic. Should this occur, the US Government estimates that it could result in 207,000 deaths, 776,000 hospitalisations and outpatients, and a staggering US$166bn in economic losses in the USA alone. While the US Government and various industry associations have published many alerts and planning guides, this paper discusses the practical problems of maintaining operations, when people can no longer meet in their usual offices and have to work from scattered locations. Finally, this paper examines the current telecommunications infrastructure, its weaknesses and the keys to a successful telecommunications plan that is sufficiently flexible and robust to maintain a company over many months of dislocation.</jats:p>"

Indeed, data from the Canadian Disaster Database indicate that flooding disasters alone are four times as frequent today as they were 50 years ago. Management of major emergency events requires collaboration among all levels of government as mandated responsibilities become less distinct during crisis periods. This paper focuses on the role of the Meteorological Service of Canada in the management of flood and high-impact rainfall events through an analysis of lessons learned during the 2005 Alberta floods, showing that the Meteorological Service of Canada's risk-based environmental forecasting, warnings and mission-critical operational consultations are key to citizen-focused emergency management services.</jats:p>"

Using Gallaher Group plc as a case study, the authors explore how a structured business impact analysis approach not only satisfied Gallaher's insurance and corporate governance needs, but also provided valuable insight, from a risk management perspective, of operational impediments to the resilience of the business. They discuss how those barriers were overcome to improve Gallaher's operational flexibility and resilience with the ultimate objective of securing the company's strategic brands.</jats:p>"

Additional benefits include long-term sustainable building management and maintenance. There is, therefore, compelling motivation for the building of sustainable projects. This inspiration has led to the development of the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating systems and projects by the United States Green Building Council and the Canadian Green Building Council. Proper building project management (BPM) of such projects is warranted. Pre-project planning is a crucial part of BPM that ensures delivery and performance of construction projects. Pre-project planning is defined as the process that encompasses all the tasks between project initiation and detailed design. There is a positive relationship between comprehensive pre-project planning and enhanced project performance. Given the motivation for environmentally sustainable projects and proper management of constructing such projects, diligent pre-project planning for such projects is required. This paper investigates the use of the LEED rating system in pre-project planning of sustainable construction projects by developing a matrix that combines the LEED and the Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI) developed by the Construction Industry Institute. The conceptual matrix and its application to a case study demonstrates that the value of linking pre-project planning with LEED to improve the decision making process during planning and designing of building projects to improve sustainability.</jats:p>",

World Health Organization travel advisories recommended limiting or postponing travel to Toronto due to concerns regarding local control over the outbreaks. Toronto Pearson International Airport worked with its extended community towards the development of local emergency and continuity strategies reflective of the quickly-evolving multi-jurisdictional requirements. These strategies were developed and implemented through two consecutive waves of outbreaks over the spring and summer of 2003. The experience had a lasting effect on the airport and its related communities in terms of the evolution of its emergency and continuity programmes. Between late 2003 and 2006, a number of reviews, public commissions and enquiries delivered their findings and recommendations. The combined effect was a permanent change in the landscape within which Canadian transportation, public health, emergency response and management operate. But are the changes enough to be ready for the next possible major emergency such as a pandemic?</jats:p>"

The CSA Project participants' dedication to the well-being of their communities reinforced the inclusion, active involvement, and participation of all stakeholders. That key community members had previously chosen not to participate in planning efforts or seek care because of stigma and fear in new immigrant populations was noted by all three sites as a major issue to address in their future planning. The sites selected for the CSA Project demonstrated that community-based Planning Councils, engaged with representatives from the target population, can assess, identify, and provide effective interventions sensitized to the needs of underserved, resilient clients. They also demonstrated that meeting these needs to enhance the common good of the community may require an increased respect for diversity. The CSA Project is one leadership exemplar of providers and clients coming together to find the common good of quality health care for people living with HIV and AIDS These grantee providers and their clients are intimately engaged in this paradigm shift and are taking the lead to redefine the type of health and support services they must provide within the context of the U.S. health care system. </jats:p>",

There were a few researches on preventive maintenance such as inspect\naffairs and facilities management. They couldn’t estimate the operation reliability on railroad vehicle.\nTherefore, this study proposes the preventive maintenance procedure that predict repair period of end\nbeam for uncovered freight car using reliability function and instantaneous failure rate on the basis of fatigue\ntest and load history data.</jats:p>"

Drawing on two years of intensive qualitative research, we argue that the concept of the throwaway society does not bear scrutiny. Rather than throwing things away households are shown consistently to engage in simultaneous practices of saving and wasting when getting rid of consumer objects. Saving and wasting are shown to be critical to materialising identities and the key social relations of family and home. Focusing on self, the couple relation, and the mother–child relation, we show how wasting things is intimately connected to the narration of self and to the enactment of specific love relations. The paper also shows how wasting things is central to moving home, constituting a surplus and then an excess of household possessions. The paper concludes by arguing that to understand the increasing amount of matter being turned to waste in the UK requires a focus on love relations and mobility, and not on the trajectories of things themselves. </jats:p>",

Not all companies could recover from a devastating event like September 11th or a major hurricane, epidemic or pandemic. Indeed, without viable business continuity planning (BCP), many enterprises would simply go out of business. This is one reason why a company's vendors should all have a feasible BCP, regardless of company size. Those companies that do not plan sufficiently for an incident/disaster will be much less likely to recover if such a disastrous event befalls them. The case is made for developing an enterprise-wide vendor management programme that has BCP assessments as a key component, and is covered with process considerations and real-world examples. Identifying these risks and sharing this information with an organisation's senior management is essential to enhance risk mitigation strategies regarding vendor BCP risk.</jats:p>"

Currently winds are provided on a horizontal resolution of approximately 140 km. The study looked at resolutions varying between 160 and 40 km. A theoretical calculation was undertaken using published variance power spectra, which quantify the wind variability as a function of horizontal scale. This calculation also used a published formula for the time saving in flying across an area of constant vorticity. The results of the theoretical calculation were expressed in terms of the time saving on a transatlantic flight lasting typically 8 h stemming from a resolution change from 160 to 80 km. In this case the answer was well under one second. It is thought that such a small incremental benefit could not be used to justify the practical steps needed to exploit high resolution data. The more practical part of the study involved running an optimum routes diagnosis package with variable resolution input data. Input data at resolutions of 160 and 40 km were considered. Although this approach was only applied to a restricted number of cases and routes, it confirmed the theoretical result. © Crown Copyright 2007.

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">An ongoing relationship with government is essential to a robust and evolving business continuity plan. Each level of government plays an important role in handling a disaster, and private sector firms must understand those roles and what they can and cannot expect from the public sector in a time of crisis. Through a relationship with the public sector, firms may be able to obtain daily incident information, access to an operations centre during an emergency, and cooperation in learning more about evacuations, credentialing, pandemic planning and other critical issues. This paper demonstrates the value of forging such a relationship with government through a regional partnership. Especially during a crisis, state and local government cannot coordinate effectively with each individual company. Therefore, coalitions constitute a valuable tool for interaction. Through a regional partnership, firms can also participate in the national public-private partnership on homeland security that has been established since September 11th. The information thus obtained will be most valuable to business continuity planners. Moreover, firms will have a voice in government emergency planning at all levels. The first such partnership was established by ChicagoFIRST, and this organisation serves as a case study about the methods by which firms benefit from such a partnership.</jats:p>"

S. General Accounting Office, 2003) and organizational culture (European Union, 2003).  Sawyer (2005) found that the leaders and managers of online learning programs (from from the academic community, business and industry, the non-profit sector and government) needed hhelp developing and executing strategic plans for their programs, people and systemsave ha.  When evaluating whether to move content to (or develop content for) an e-Learning program, deciding to purchase tools and/or content, internally designing a new distributed learning system, or beginning to plan for the future, Sawyer (2005) found that the state of the research at that time left the decision maker(s) to make critical choices based on their skill (and/or desire) to assemble and analyze the necessary information that would lead to relevant considerations being taken into account.  One large area where the hleaders and managers of online learning programs needed help developing and executing strategic plans for their programs was that they needed a single source that could be located and leveraged to gain an insight into online learning’s goals, benefits or problems to use as a decision aid or analysis tool.  Until now, a comprehensive list did not exist.  Sawyer’s 2005 study was designed to present a comprehensive list of online learning’s goals, benefits and problems that could be applied as a decision aid/analysis tool to aid in strategic planning.  This paper presents some of the key findings from this exploratory study which used the emergent, inductive approach of content analysis to conduct a cross case analysis of 607 research reports published over a two year period to establish the existence and frequency of the dependent variables goals, benefits and problems.  This analysis resulted in the identification of 61 goals that have been set for online learning programs, 131 benefits that have been documented, and 371 problems that have been encountered. Conceptual and relational analysis were concurrently applied to identify key concepts and their semantic relationships which resulted in the development of  a concept map that, when combined with the content analysis,  led to the identification of seven recommended online learning communities, as well as a consolidated planning and decision aid to help decision-makers in their strategic planning effort.</jats:p>"

According to the reviewed evidence, domestic energy deprivation simultaneously shapes, and is shaped by, the institutional relationships between policy actors at different levels of governance, and the day-to-day interactions between vulnerable households and the built environment. It is contingent on three sets of processes: the socioeconomic implications of energy reforms in postsocialism, the inadequate energy efficiency of the homes of energy-poor households, and the mismatch between housing needs and heating systems at the household level. As a result of such interdependencies, households may become ‘imprisoned’ in particular types of sociospatial arrangements that contribute to the emergence of poverty. </jats:p>",

Combining sociological and social philosophical thoughts with insights from science and technology studies, I rethink the social understanding of money and disability. I explore how (visual) dis/ability is situated in everyday practices and suggest that it can be understood neither as an individual bodily impairment nor as a socially attributed disability. Both money and blindness become visible as complex sets of calculate practices, linking bodies, material objects, and technologies with sensory practices. These practices, I conclude, draw attention to the heterogeneous fabrication of sociality and to the emerging dis/abling spaces of calculation that unfold in the course of everyday life. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The public participation geographic information systems (PPGIS) research agenda has explored the issue of equitable access and use of geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data among traditionally marginalized citizens, in order to facilitate effective citizen participation in inner-city revitalization activities. However, prior research indicates that PPGIS is a complex process, with uneven outcomes. The author contends that such unevenness can be explained by use of a new theoretical framework drawn from the literature of politics of scale and networks. The author contends that the PPGIS process occurs in ‘spaces of dependence’, containing localized social relations and place-specific conditions. The politics of securing this space leads to the creation of ‘spaces of engagement’ at multiple scales. Within these spaces, networks of association evolve to connect multiple actors from public and private sectors with community organizations. Such networks can contain structural inequities, hierarchical dominance, and fluctuating resources. But these networks also transcend political boundaries and are dynamic and flexible, enabling individuals to manipulate and modify them. In trying to control the revitalization agendas and the material resources required, the actors and community organizations construct politics of scale. For some community organizations, such scalar politics and creative alliances with critical actors allow them to navigate territorially scaled networks of power skillfully in order to gain an effective voice in decisionmaking activities. But other community organizations lag behind, and are not able to form relationships in order to secure their urban space. By the use of new empirical data, coupled with a new theoretical framework, the author aims to contribute both to greater theorization and to better understanding of the uneven and contradictory nature of PPGIS processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Somewhat surprisingly the concept of dwelling remains largely unconsidered within contemporary geographical thought. Despite signs of a renewed interest in the term it remains all but bereft of a sustained critical appraisal and as a consequence firmly tied to the name and writing of Martin Heidegger. The aim of this paper is to begin to open the concept up beyond this attachment and to provide a rationale for its reassessment. Through a double reading of dwelling, once via Heidegger and again via Emmanuel Levinas, I offer a twofold consideration of how the concept can be assembled, orientated, and organised. Where Heidegger organises and articulates the concept around an enclosed figure being-at-home-in-the-world for Levinas dwelling gains its significance from a constitutive openness to the incoming of the other. These are two accounts, then, which differ radically in their apprehension of the concept and in the unfolding of its implications but which agree on the central importance of the concept in the determination, figuring, and phrasing of subjectivity, sociality, and signification. Ultimately, what emerges from these opening remarks is a depiction of two attempts to make thought respond to and reckon with the event of space: two attempts to bring to thought the space between us. </jats:p>",

While a number of studies have explored the various sites of scientific practice and the role of space in the constitution of experimental matters of fact, far less attention has been directed toward the cultural geographies of experimental science and the extrascientific zones in which modes of experimental practice were themselves developed and contested. Drawing on the reception of professional psychiatry in interwar Berlin (1919–1933), the author traces an alternative set of ‘experimental systems’ which seized on and countered the credibility of psychiatric expertise. The focus is on a series of modernist experiments in interwar Germany which actively reconfigured psychiatric science as a series of critical aesthetic interventions themselves tasked with performing ‘scientific experiments’. The paper is triangulated around three case studies, which chart the multiple traffickings between psychiatric experimentation and modernist art. The first revisits the traumatic reenactments of Berlin Dada in the broader context of mechanized war, rationalized work, and metropolitan life. The second explores the psychotechnical techniques that were crucial to the operations of Brechtian epic theatre, and the third case study explores the relationship between clinical therapy and modernist fiction as it came to characterize the work of Alfred Döblin during the 1920s. The paper concludes with further reflections on the significance of the ‘modern experimental turn’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many algorithms have been proposed that create a path for a robot in an environment with obstacles. Most methods are aimed at finding a solution. However, for many applications, the path must be of a good quality as well. That is, a path should be short and should keep some amount of minimum clearance to the obstacles. Traveling along such a path reduces the chances of collisions due to the difficulty of measuring and controlling the precise position of the robot. This paper reports a new technique, called Partial shortcut, which decreases the path length. While current methods have difficulties in removing all redundant motions, the technique efficiently removes these motions by interpolating one degree of freedom at a time. Two algorithms are also studied that increase the clearance along paths. The first one is fast but can only deal with rigid, translating bodies. The second algorithm is slower but can handle a broader range of robots, including three-dimensional free-flying and articulated robots, which may reside in arbitrary high-dimensional configuration spaces. A big advantage of these algorithms is that clearance along paths can now be increased efficiently without using complex data structures and algorithms. Finally, we combine the two criteria and show that high-quality paths can be obtained for a broad range of robots. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine the rise of corporate finance boutiques in London's financial district from the early 2000s onwards. These small firms, typically employing no more than 25 people, specialise in a single corporate finance client sector (such as telecommunications or the media). It is argued that the growth of these boutiques is best understood with reference to the changing circumstances faced by London's established investment banks. Boutiques grew both in number and in size whilst well-known investment banking brands suffered significant decreases in profit margins, and redundancies were made across the financial services sector more widely. Two related theoretical perspectives are deployed to understand the growth of corporate finance boutiques in London within a ‘relational marketplace’. First, the concept of a marketplace is developed by spatialising recent work in new economic sociology on markets. Second, a relational perspective is used to conceptualise the coconstitutive networks that exist between corporate finance boutiques and investment banks within this marketplace. </jats:p>",

How do non-Estonians who have grown up in a socialist system and have finished their education in the late 1980s or early 1990s experience a societal transformation? Were structural and institutional changes brought about by a minimum of adaptations and fluctuations or a by maximum of turbulence and mobility? How successful were they in converting resources gained in the old system into other types of assets in post-socialist conditions? The paper is based on in-depth interviews conducted in 2003 and 2004 with non-Estonians graduating from secondary educational institutions in 1983 and belonging to the so-called “winners” cohort. One of the central results of the analysis is that non-Estonians’ behaviour was not so much directed by purposeful biographical projects but rather it could be characterized as an adaptation to new circumstances. Opportunities proved to be less a matter of individual control and planning than of unfavourable structural conditions. Our analysis indicated the stability of relative rankings in social hierarchy despite the huge amount of job moves. It was evident that having only higher education did not guarantee non-Estonians a stable position in the labour market. Broad social network helped to realize this resource.</jats:p>"

The region faces close to a doubling of the urban population in fifteen years. This urban transition poses an opportunity as well as a management challenge. Urban areas represent underutilised resources that concentrate much of the countries' physical, financial, and intellectual capital. Therefore it is critical to understand how they can better serve the national growth and poverty reduction agendas. The paper challenges several common ‘myths’ that cloud discourse about urban development in Africa. I also take a hard look at what the urban transition can offer national development, and what support cities and local governments require to achieve these results. I argue that, rather than devoting more attention to debating the urban contribution to development in Africa, real energy needs to be spent unblocking it. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) is a new drug-free method to ablate undesirable tissue of particular use in cancer therapy. IRE achieves cell death within the targeted tissue through a series of electric pulses that elevate the transmembrane potentials to an extent that permanently damages the lipid bilayers throughout the treated region. Although the IRE procedure is easy to perform, treatment planning is complicated by the fact that the electric field distribution within the tissue, the greatest single factor controlling the extents of IRE, depends non-trivially on the electrode configuration, pulse parameters and any tissue heterogeneities. To address this difficulty, we instruct on how to properly model IRE and discuss the benefit of modeling in designing treatment protocols. The necessary theoretical basis is introduced and discussed through the detailed analysis of two classic dual-electrode configurations from electrochemotherapy: coaxial disk electrodes and parallel needle electrodes. Dimensionless figures for these cases are also provided that allow cell constants, treated areas, and the details of heating to be determined for a wide range of conditions, for uniform tissues, simply by plugging in the appropriate physical property values and pulse parameters such as electrode spacing, size, and pulse amplitude. Complexities, such as heterogeneous tissues and changes in conductivity due to electroporation, are also discussed. The synthesis of these details can be used directly by surgeons in treatment planning. Irreversible electroporation is a promising new technique to treat cancer in a targeted manner without the use of drugs; however, it does require a detailed understanding of how electric currents flow within biological tissues. By providing the understanding and tools necessary to design an IRE protocol, this study seeks to facilitate the translation of this new and exciting cancer therapy into clinical practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Tibetans are often imagined as authentic, pure, and geographically undifferentiated, but Tibetan identity formation is, in fact, varied and deeply inflected by national location and transnational trajectories. In this paper I examine the frictions of encounter between three groups of Tibetans who arrived in the USA around the same time, but who differ in their relationships to the homeland. The numerically dominant group consists of refugees who left Tibet in 1959 and of exiles born in South Asia; second are Tibetans who left Tibet after the 1980s for India and Nepal; and third are those whose routes have taken them from Tibet directly to the United States. Whereas the cultural authority claimed by long-term exiles derives from the notion of preserving tradition outside of Tibet, that of Tibetans from Tibet is based on their embodied knowledge of the actual place of the homeland. Their struggles over authenticity, which play out in everyday practices such as language use and embodied reactions to staged performances of ‘traditional culture’, call for an understanding of diaspora without guarantees. In this paper I use habitus as an analytic for exploring the ways in which identity is inscribed on and read off of bodies, and the political stakes of everyday practices that produce fractures and fault lines. </jats:p>",

Without senior support, it may be an uphill battle to get the time and attention needed from various groups within an organisation. The right attitude and approach can have everything to do with future success. Delivering results and demonstrating an association with shareholder value will provide a platform to justify and even increase the investment in continuity-related activities. This will enable the development of a deep and lasting relationship with business partners and at the same time empower a drive of accountability throughout the organisation. Once progress is underway, it is important to test what has been developed. And, in case all else fails, it is critical to have established contingency plans through a well-formulated crisis management strategy. This may not only get a company out of a serious bind, but may also regenerate interest in exploring the resources and support needed to ensure successful continuity for the organisation.</jats:p>"

Structural decomposition techniques can also be applied in social accounting matrix (SAM) models, which provide a complete representation of circular flow by adding factor-income generation and household-income distribution to the intersectorial transactions. The author uses structural decomposition analysis to reveal the factors that contribute to the changes in SAM multipliers over time. In particular, she analyses how modifying the patterns of intermediate demand, private consumption, and factor-income distribution modifies the income-generation process. Two SAMs are used, one for 1990 and one for 1994, in an empirical application for the Catalan economy. The results show that the regional multipliers in 1994 were smaller than in 1990, mainly because of a reduction in the structural coefficients of the model. </jats:p>",

However, this paper parallels recent academic moves to look beyond the North and concludes that global cities also exist in the South. It further introduces Cape Town as a contemporary example of one such city that is becoming more worldly in both appearance and outlook. The city's position as an up-and-coming global city can be accredited to a range of comparative advantages and strategic interventions including successful rejuvenation strategies, gentrification of certain neighbourhoods, a rising number of foreign visitors, and the construction of a world-class international convention facility. While it may not be a top-ranked competitor, Cape Town does display global city characteristics such as a growing aggressiveness on the part of urban planners and development practitioners in foreign investment attraction, strategic marketing campaigns, and the hosting of high-profile events that provide valuable lessons for aspiring secondary global cities. </jats:p>",

It has been conducted in historic urban areas where the physical environment is in need of regeneration and leisure and tourism can create new uses for redundant or under-used premises, generate jobs and stimulate investment. There is also a risk, however, that development may alienate the very people who are supposed to benefit most from regeneration. InSITU captured the knowledge, views and preferences of those who are likely to be affected, so that workable solutions can be designed and benefits maximised. This was achieved through the innovative application of Geographic Information Systems for Participation (GIS-P) to widen participation in urban design and heritage provision and allows that participation to feed more directly into the policy process. The paper outlines two cases in York. One demonstrates the role local people have in outlining the benefits and drawbacks of a public space, and change that might be made to it (problem definition). The second considers the role of local people in appraising the utility of a proposed cycle/pedestrian route on the site of a former factory (option generation/appraisal). The benefits and limitations of the GIS-P approach are assessed: benefits are inclusion of hard to reach groups in the process, ease and clarity of result dissemination and level of detail captured. Limitations include prioritising conflicting stakeholder concerns, the stage of the policy process at which stakeholders are consulted and the level at which this methodology and subsequent findings are useful (local/regional). Finally, an assessment is made of to whom these findings are useful (to policy makers and/or developers).</jats:p>"

Software production and related information technology services are outsourced to firms offshore or, more specifically, to places where labor skills appropriate to these industries are available at lower costs. Notable offshore destinations include: India, Russia, Ireland, Israel, Romania, and Ukraine, among several others. The offshore outsourcing of software production involves complex introductions, reorganizations, and compositions of production chains and management structures in the continuing negotiation of how relations and work processes will be governed across spaces. The author documents the roles of certification—ISO 9000 and CMM—as new governmental forms that shape understandings, perceptions, and strategies for becoming recognized within the offshore. Drawing on field research with over twenty firms in St Petersburg, Russia, the author proposes that certification is an emergent form of governance that embodies specific processes of globalization. </jats:p>",

I conclude that the use of indicators at the community level may tell us more about central–local relations within contemporary governance than about the construction of subjects and objects to enable governance with regard to sustainable development. </jats:p>",

In contrast, in this paper we argue that strong internal heterogeneity combined with general trends similar to those experienced elsewhere in the world make local economic development (LED) as likely to succeed in SSA as in other low- and middle-income countries. The likelihood of success depends mostly on place-specific conditions. Many of the most prosperous parts of the continent already have the basic enabling conditions for the design and implementation of LED strategies in place. Less favourable resource endowments, poor accessibility, and relatively weak civil societies can undermine the viability of LED outside the wealthier and most prosperous areas. In smaller urban areas and intermediate regions and city-regions, which lack only a few of the basic preconditions for LED, further capacity building may still enable the success of the approach. In contrast, LED may not be relevant for the poorest and most remote parts of SSA, where existing conditions do not provide a strong enough base on which to build LED strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyzes the relationship between state-oriented and neoliberal approaches to environmental regulation by examining simultaneous efforts to protect the endangered Steller sea lion and to privatize the fishery for Alaska pollock. Because these policies were designed and implemented at the same time and for the same industry, this case offers a unique opportunity to explore in detail not transitions from one type of policy regime to another but, rather, how these different policy regimes articulate. Rather than focusing on reregulation which occurs when neoliberal restructuring shifts away from traditional regulation while simultaneously developing new, market-oriented forms of regulation, this paper focuses on a different kind of reregulation which occurs when state-oriented and market-oriented approaches must coexist. Analysis of how regulators themselves write about the conjunction of these policies reveals that the two forms of regulation can be complementary. To the extent that neoliberal restructuring has environmental benefits, these are mediated through traditional environmental protections, and although restructuring is presented as a means of mitigating the negative economic effects of state-oriented regulation, these effects are quite consistent with the goals of restructuring. Further, this analysis also reveals the power of neoliberal discourse. Despite their own statements about the complex articulation of the policies, regulators attribute benefits to privatization and problems to state-oriented regulation. This case highlights the inability of neoliberalism to subsume its outsides—alternatives are already existing—but also highlights that these outsides can themselves come to support what they seem to oppose. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Stimulated by recent controversies about the headscarf in France, this paper offers a fresh look at the spatial and urban dimensions of the work of Frantz Fanon. While there is widespread agreement that the work of Fanon (which preceded the so-called ‘spatial turn’ in social theory) includes powerful spatial dimensions, there is no consensus about the status of ‘space’ in Fanon's texts. Postcolonial theorists, whose reading of Fanon dominated the Anglo-American academic world until recently, have applauded the prevalence of spatial metaphors in Fanon's work as a sign for the latter's discomfort with dialectical thought and matters of historical transformation and thus as a sign for ‘third-space’ thinking. Representing a new, heterodox wave of Fanon interpretation and insisting on Fanon's Hegelian–Marxist, radical Black, and phenomenological preoccupations with liberation, other readers have detected a shift from spatial to temporal concerns in Fanon's work. While building on this latter reading of Fanon, I argue that the spatial aspects in Fanon's work are neither a function of a philosophical imperative of nonrepresentability nor in contradiction with his concerns about temporal transformation. Fanon analyzed everyday racism as an alienating spatial relation, treated colonization as spatial organization, and viewed decolonization in part as a form of reappropriating and transforming spatial relations in the colonial city and through the construction of nationwide sociospatial alliances. Fanon's complex historical-geographical perspective on everyday racism, the colonial issue, and national liberation makes it possible to link his work to Henri Lefebvre's insights into the processes by which postwar French urbanization mediated a shift from colonial war to the ‘colonization’ of everyday life in the metropole. Given the growing role of controlling urban space in the core and peripheries of our neo-imperial world, excavating an urban and spatial Fanon is promising for strategies to emphasize the urban dimensions, microaspects and macroaspects, and multiple scales of what colonization means today. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper begins with two observations: that UK homes appear to have accumulated increasing numbers of domestic technologies, yet new houses are smaller, on average, than those built before 1980. The spatial pressures placed on homes that result from the accumulation of technologies are explored by drawing upon forty household interviews which enquired into the domestic organisation of kitchen and bathroom technologies and practices. Many households have responded to such spatial pressures by extending or reformulating their domestic spaces: such that kitchens are becoming increasingly multifunctional spaces and bathrooms are multiplying. It is argued that these trends are not simply driven by an unstoppable tide of material possession but reflect context-specific arrangements related to the temporal and ideological structuring of domestic practices. Technologies and practices coevolve with the result that new demands are made on homes—the commodities and objects with which we live our lives influence our experience of space and the value placed on different physical configurations. Domestic technologies are therefore implicated in the structure and reproduction of practice and hence in the choreography of things and people in time and space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, we study strategies in incremental planning for ordering and grouping subproblems partitioned by the subgoals of a planning problem. To generate a rich set of partial orders for ordering subproblems, we propose an algorithm based on a relaxed plan that ignores the delete lists. The new algorithm considers both the initial and the goal states and can effectively order subgoals in such a way that greatly reduces the number of invalidations during incremental planning. We have also considered trade-offs between the granularity of the subgoal sets and the complexity of solving the overall planning problem. We propose an efficient strategy for dynamically adjusting the grain size in partitioning in order to minimize the total complexity. We further evaluate a redundant-ordering scheme that uses two different subgoal orders to improve the solution quality, without greatly sacrificing run-time efficiency. Experimental results on using Metric-FF, YAHSP, and LPG-TD-speed as the embedded planners in incremental planning show that our strategies are general for improving the time and quality of these planners across various benchmarks. Finally, we compare the performance of the three planners, the incremental versions using these planners as embedded planners, and SGPlan<jats:sub>4.1</jats:sub>. </jats:p>",

Further, we seek to understand how these differential engagements impact on young people's future trajectories through the development of different competencies. We contend that, precisely how young people are positioned in networks of global–local connectivity matters profoundly, both for the performance of their present identities, and for their future life chances. </jats:p>",

Within the West Gulf Coastal Plain Bird Conservation Region in the south‐central United States, populations of this quail species have declined 6.8% annually. These declines sparked calls for land use change and prompted implementation of various conservation practices. However, to effectively reverse these declines and restore northern bobwhite to their former population levels, habitat conservation and management efforts must target establishment and maintenance of sustainable populations. To provide guidance for conservation and restoration of habitat capable of supporting sustainable northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain, we modeled their spatial distribution using landscape characteristics derived from 1992 National Land Cover Data and bird detections, from 1990 to 1994, along 10‐stop Breeding Bird Survey route segments. Four landscape metrics influenced detections of northern bobwhite: detections were greater in areas with more grassland and increased aggregation of agricultural lands, but detections were reduced in areas with increased density of land cover edge and grassland edge. Using these landscape metrics, we projected the abundance and spatial distribution of northern bobwhite populations across the entire West Gulf Coastal Plain. Predicted populations closely approximated abundance estimates from a different cadre of concurrently collected data but model predictions did not accurately reflect bobwhite detections along species‐specific call‐count routes in Arkansas and Louisiana. Using similar methods, we also projected northern bobwhite population distribution circa 1980 based on Land Use Land Cover data and bird survey data from 1976 to 1984. We compared our 1980 spatial projections with our spatial estimate of 1992 populations to identify areas of population change. Additionally, we used our projection of the spatial distribution and abundance of bobwhite to predict areas of population sustainability. Our projections of population change and sustainability provide guidance for targeting habitat conservation and rehabilitation efforts for restoration of northern bobwhite populations in the West Gulf Coastal Plain.</jats:p>",

While it normally forms part of multilivelihood strategies and its overall significance is the subject of some debate, it nonetheless is an important feature of both urban landscapes and urban survival. This paper examines the current status quo of urban agriculture in Lusaka, the capital of Zambia. Structural adjustment and downscaling of the key copper mining sector seems to have forced more people into various informal survival strategies, including urban agriculture. Despite the apparent growing significance of urban agriculture, as illustrated by significant recent vegetation clearances around the city, official policy remains ambivalent and it has not been adequately supported or catered for in urban planning. While it remains officially illegal, controls are seldom enforced and urban farmers persist with what is a key household survival strategy under trying circumstances. </jats:p>",

Should the virus mutate, however, thereby enabling transmission between humans, pandemic avian influenza would rapidly ensue. Much of the risk governing animal-to-human transmission of the virus depends upon cultural factors located in poultry market exposure, traditional animal husbandry methods, and healthcare and health-seeking behaviour. In the event of a viral mutation, these cultural factors will correspondingly influence human-to-human transmission risk. Given that social and cultural risk factors for transmission are local and specific to communities, this poses a problem for businesses attempting to address risk factors specific to their workforce. This paper recommends that businesses perform evidence-based assessments of their workforce, to survey individuals regarding the aforementioned cultural factors. Businesses should work with local health authorities to use these assessments for culturally-specific health messaging to decrease employee risk for transmission of avian influenza in its zoonotic stage, as well as in the event of a human pandemic.</jats:p>"

Experiment 1 used primes that were unrelated to targets and found a masked onset priming effect of equal size for high-frequency and low-frequency target words. Experiment 2 used form-related primes as used by Forster and Davis, and again found that the effect of onset mismatch was not dependent on target word frequency.

In order to enable empirical research on this topic, in this paper we propose and examine the concept of environmental support. On the basis of a review of recent literature in gerontology, public health, environmental psychology, landscape architecture, and urban design, we argue that the supportiveness of neighbourhood environments that make outdoor activity (eg, walking) easy and enjoyable is conducive to a better QOL for older people. We introduce three ways of conceptualising environmental support focusing on the following: personally meaningful outdoor activities, environmental attributes found relevant to people's activities, and unmet needs for daily activities. Several conceptual frameworks that incorporate environmental support, QOL and other potentially salient constructs are also presented. We suggest possible future research directions employing this concept. </jats:p>",

We find that efforts to regularize land titles to confer de jure security of tenure have not been encouraging. By contrast, infrastructure investment efforts have performed better—they have conferred de facto security of tenure and also ameliorated living conditions. Over time project-based learning and microlevel innovations have helped improve upgrading performance. To create broader and sustainable benefits, however, upgrading needs to go to scale. We propose an upgrading strategy with the following elements—a programmatic approach that links slums to citywide systems, is channelled through government, and combines a community-demand and participation approach with supply-side constraints and rules of access. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tokyo had two fantastic chances to rebuild its urban areas based on ideal city planning. Unfortunately, it failed to take them. The first chance was after the Great Kanto Earthquake, which leveled Tokyo in 1923. The second chance was just after World War II, when the US Air Force flattened Tokyo with a carpet bombing that left 330,665 citizens dead, 2,316,325 houses burned to the ground, and a deserted area of 40,000,000 ha. The Tokyo metropolitan authorities failed again, mostly due to the desperate living conditions during the postwar occupation. Tokyo was therefore hastily and haphazardly reconstructed of combustible wooden housing without a planned sequence. In the decade from 1945 to 1955, Japan suffered every time typhoons hit the archipelago. These disasters prevented effective disaster management measures from being adopted to mitigate damage. National disasters continued to be local rather than national matters until well after 1955 and urban restoration based on advanced urban planning was sacrificed to economic growth, although economic growth greatly assisted restoration of urban areas. When the Korean war broke out in 1950, the US military force had many military requirements that stabilized economic conditions in Japan. Many business and manufacturing plants were restored but without long-term urban infrastructure planning. In 1959, the Ise Bay typhoon caused 4,697 deaths, left 407 missing and 38,921 injured, and destroyed 557,501 houses. This disaster forced the Japanese government, which had not formulated a framework for disaster mitigation management, to begin studying formulation of the Basic Disaster Measures Act. The Ise Bay typhoon highlighted key problems in disaster mitigation measures, resulting in the formulation of the Basic Disaster Mitigation Act in November 15, 1961.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the middle of the 1990s two international environmental management standards became available for European companies: the European Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) and the International Organization for Standardization's ISO 14001. Companies that wanted to implement a standardized environmental management system were confronted with the choice between their national standard, the European standard, or the international one. In the past decennium, the national standards have been abolished and the number of ISO 14001 certified companies has outnumbered the number of EMAS-registered organizations. The speed at which and the extent to which ISO 14001 has outnumbered EMAS differs, however, between countries in the EU-15. We argue that a country classification based on the degree of statism of the collective agency on the one hand, and the degree of corporatism of society's organization on the other, offers a valuable perspective for analyzing the evolution of the uptake of both standards in a country. We present the cases of Germany, the UK, France, and Sweden, and conclude that in countries characterized by a more societal organization of authority, private alternatives for national regulations like ISO 14001 are welcomed and adopted with enthusiasm. In countries characterized by a rather statist organization, such alternatives are looked upon with more suspicion resulting in delayed uptake. Whereas ISO 14001 is a purely private initiative, voluntary registration to the EMAS regulation creates a link between the company and the authorities. In contrast to corporatist settings, this frightens off business participation in associational countries. </jats:p>",

After a discussion of the philosophy and sociology of experiment, the author considers a set of field practices conducted under the auspices of the Canadian Government's Polar Continental Shelf Project. Drawing on archival and oral historical research, he argues that field scientists had to deal with a number of logistical, corporeal, and epistemic difficulties in the High Arctic. It is demonstrated that these obstacles hindered attempts to develop a scientific literature based upon experimental practices during fieldwork. In doing so, the author attempts to set new agendas for historical geographers of science around the analysis of the geographical sciences, whilst also contributing to discussions about the epistemic status of variegated field practices. </jats:p>",

All these have resulted in Suzhou municipality's rapid growth in the information-technology industry and its embeddedness in the fusion of the global and local contexts. However, we will also demonstrate that the power asymmetry of global players and local states in this area has resulted in the creation of industrial clusters that are institutionally embedded but technologically delinked from the localities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When a human or animal reaches out to grasp an object, the brain rapidly computes a pattern of muscular contractions that can acquire the target. This computation involves a reference frame transformation because the target's position is initially available only in a visual reference frame, yet the required control signal is a set of commands to the musculature. One of the core brain areas involved in visually guided reaching is the dorsal aspect of the premotor cortex (PMd). Using chronically implanted electrode arrays in two Rhesus monkeys, we studied the contributions of PMd to the reference frame transformation for reaching. PMd neurons are influenced by the locations of reach targets relative to both the arm and the eyes. Some neurons encode reach goals using limb-centered reference frames, whereas others employ eye-centered reference fames. Some cells encode reach goals in a reference frame best described by the combined position of the eyes and hand. In addition to neurons like these where a reference frame could be identified, PMd also contains cells that are influenced by both the eye- and limb-centered locations of reach goals but for which a distinct reference frame could not be determined. We propose two interpretations for these neurons. First, they may encode reach goals using a reference frame we did not investigate, such as intrinsic reference frames. Second, they may not be adequately characterized by any reference frame. </jats:p>",

In conformal therapy, beams of radiation are applied to a patient from different directions, where the aperture through which the beam is delivered from each direction is chosen to match the shape of the tumor, as viewed from that direction. Wedge filters may be used to produce a gradient in beam intensity across the aperture. Given a set of equispaced beam angles, a mixed-integer linear program can be solved to determine the most effective angles to be used in a treatment plan, the weight (exposure time) to be used for each beam, and the type and orientation of wedges to be used. Practical solution techniques for this problem are described; they include strengthening of the formulation and solution of smaller approximate problems obtained by a reduced parametrization of the treatment region. In addition, techniques for controlling the dose-volume histogram implicitly for various parts of the treatment region using hot- and cold-spot control parameters are presented. Computational results are given that show the effectiveness of the proposed approach on practical data sets. </jats:p>",

There is an increasing need for knowledge‐based systems for supporting caseworkers in the decision‐making of treatment planning. This paper presents a hybrid case‐based reasoning approach for building a knowledge‐based treatment planning system for adolescent early intervention of mental healthcare. The hybrid case‐based reasoning approach combines aspects of case‐based reasoning, rule‐based reasoning and fuzzy theory. The knowledge base of case‐based reasoning is a case base of client records consisting of documented experience while that for rule‐based reasoning is a set of IF–THEN rules based on the experience of social service professionals. Fuzzy theory is adopted to deal with the uncertain nature of treatment planning. A prototype system has been implemented in a social services company and its performance is evaluated by a group of caseworkers. The results indicate that hybrid case‐based reasoning has an enhanced performance and the knowledge‐based treatment planning system enables caseworkers to construct more efficient treatment planning in less cost and less time.</jats:p>",

Active government and NGO support for small scale irrigation farming coupled with their encouragement of community development led to the emergence of the Ngolowindo agricultural cooperative which serves as a useful model and example of locality-based development in Africa. After providing a context for the study in terms of both contextual literature and details specific to the Malawian context, the paper examines how the cooperative emerged, how it operates, what role the supporting NGO plays, and how products are sold.

Analysis of the grounds for non‐compliance indicate that they undermine patient autonomy, and aspects of the policy are inconsistent with current common law and statutory regimes that allow an adult to complete a legally binding AHD. The policy therefore threatens the patient self‐determination, which it endorses, and places doctors who participate in advance care planning at legal risk.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We used point-count data collected as part of Bird Studies Canada's Boreal Forest Bird Program to validate habitat suitability models for 22 forest bird species in Ontario's Habitat Suitability Matrix. We found that many of the species'models performed relatively poorly in discriminating between occupied and unoccupied sites, primarily due to the high error of commission rates (false positive predictions). Since species presence and abundance were assessed by single, five minute point counts, insufficient sampling was at least partly responsible for some of the observed over-prediction. Results suggested that model parameters for at least nine of the species tested (hairy woodpecker [Picoides villosus], blueheaded vireo [Vireo solitarius], red-eyed vireo [Vireo olivaceus], red-breasted nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], Swainson's thrush [Catharus ustulatus], hermit thrush [Catharus guttatus], Tennessee warbler [Vermivora peregrina], Blackburnian warbler [Dendroica fusca] and dark-eyed junco [Junco hyemalis]) should be reviewed to improve the predictive capability of the models and to ensure appropriate consideration of the habitat needs of these species during forest management planning.

Prior studies have found reduced effects of the illusion for the grip-scaling component of grasping, and these findings are commonly interpreted as evidence that different visual systems are employed for perceptual judgment and visually guided action. In the current experiments, the magnitude of the illusion was reduced by comparable amounts for grasping and for judgments that preceded grasping (Experiment 1). A similar effect was obtained prior to reaching to touch the targets (Experiment 2). The effect on verbal responses was apparent even when participants were simply instructed that a target touch task would follow the verbal task. After participants had completed a grasping task, the reduction in the magnitude of the illusion remained for a subsequent verbal-response judgment task (Experiment 3). Overall, the studies demonstrate strong connections between action planning and perception. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This pilot research project sought to provide a postoccupation assessment of a new mental health inpatient unit in East London, built under the Private Finance Initiative scheme. Qualitative discussion groups or unstructured interviews were used to explore the views of people who had been service users (but were currently well) and of nursing staff and consultants working in the new hospital. The participants gave their views on the aspects of the hospital which were beneficial or detrimental to well-being and the reasons for their views. Informants discussed hospital design in terms of: (1) respect and empowerment for people with mental illness; (2) security and surveillance versus freedom and openness; (3) territoriality, privacy, refuge, and social interactions; (4) homeliness and contact with nature; (5) places for expression and reaffirmation of identity, autonomy, and consumer choice; and (6) integration into sustainable communities. Themes emerging from this research were interpreted in light of ideas from geographical research on therapeutic landscapes constituted as physical, social, and symbolic spaces, as well as research from environmental psychology. The findings have practical implications for hospital design and underline the need to consider empowerment of patients in decisions over hospital design. We note the challenges involved in determining therapeutic hospital design given changing models of care in psychiatry, lack of consensus over models of care, and the varying and somewhat conflicting requirements these imply for the physical, social, and symbolic attributes of design of hospital spaces. We also note the implications of our findings for an interpretation of therapeutic landscapes as contested spaces. </jats:p>",

The modules consist of: (1) stochastic generation of hourly precipitation scenarios that maintain the characteristics and variability of a 45‐year hourly precipitation record from a nearby rain gauge; (2) conceptual transformation of generated precipitation into daily streamflow using varied infiltration rates and estimates of the basin antecedent moisture conditions; and (3) surface‐water to ground‐water interaction for four downstream microbasins that accounts for alluvial ground‐water recharge, and ET and pumping losses. To maintain the large inter‐annual variability of streamflow as prevails in Southern Arizona, the model framework is constructed to produce three types of seasonal winter and summer categories of streamflow (i.e., wet, medium, or dry). Long‐term (i.e., 100 years) realizations (ensembles) are generated by the above described model framework that reflects two different regimes of inter annual variability. The first regime is that of the historic streamflow gauge record. The second regime is that of the tree ring reconstructed precipitation, which was derived for the study location. Generated flow ensembles for these two regimes are used to evaluate the risk that the regional four ground‐water microbasins decline below a preset storage threshold under different operational water utilization scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The significant environmental cost associated with management of products at the end-of-life has resulted in the emergence of ‘producer responsibility’ legislations to encourage increase in recovery and recycling practices. In the case of electrical and electronic equipment, one such legislation, namely the ‘Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive’, requires manufacturers to assume financial and legal liability for recovery and recycling of their products at the end-of-life. The current recycling applications of electrical and electronic waste are often developed on ad hoc basis and mainly attributable to the hidden economic value within used products. However, owing to stricter regulations on end-of-life product recycling, it is now essential to evaluate the recycling costs and environmental benefits of reclaimed products and materials as well as the selection of appropriate recycling strategy. The present paper describes the initial investigation in the realization of a computer-aided recycling process planner for electrical and electronic products. The assertion made is that such a systematic approach to producing bespoke eco-efficient recycling process plans for individual products will significantly improve the value recovery from recycling activities. </jats:p>",
