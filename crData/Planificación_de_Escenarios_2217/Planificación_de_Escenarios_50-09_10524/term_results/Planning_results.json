      "abstract": "<jats:p>With due regard for the pitfalls and the principles which have been learned by experience, decentralization systems may be developed according to the variable resources and needs of differing areas. It is little wonder that this movement is gaining momentum so rapidly, for it accomplishes so much simultaneously. Graduate training for the resident is strengthened. The physician-to-be, whether pediatrician or general practitioner, learns more of the type of problem he will be facing when soon he will be out on his own. Continuing postgraduate education is brought to the general practitioner in his own area and in relation to his own patients. A direct channel is established between the urban center and the rural practitioner. The medical school and its teaching hospitals extend their services not only through the immediate community but also through the state and even into neighboring states which do not have the advantage of a medical school. The latest results of research, new diagnostic aids and therapeutic procedures are brought immediately to physicians and hence to children even in the remote areas. When this program is effective, the children living in the counties which were classified as isolated are isolated no longer.</jats:p>",
