TCT accounts for public land-use planning and development control, and suggests some alternative forms that governance of land development and the property market could take. The basic elements of a conceptual model enabling the institutional analysis of land-use planning and development control systems are: (1) an integrated TCT; (2) a transactions-based representation of the land and real-estate development process; and (3) a repertoire of alternative forms of governance, ranging from statutory planning and regulation to contractual covenants. These elements are developed for application in an institutional analysis of the Israeli statutory planning system. </jats:p>",

Remote sensing and GIS are used to supply information on environmental constraints and locations of growth centers for the simulation. The model is able to consider different criteria, such as urban forms, environmental suitability, and land consumption for the planning of sustainable cities. Seven different types of urban forms and developments that range from compact–monocentric, compact–polycentric, compact–monocentric–environmental, compact–polycentric–environmental, dispersed, highly dispersed, to very highly dispersed developments were simulated by using the model. The model can generate urban forms and developments with fractal structures that are close to real cities. The simulated patterns were evaluated by using different cost indicators related to sustainable development principles. </jats:p>",

In this paper we report a study of urban planning in New Zealand under this new regime. Amendments to the Local Government Act were designed in large part to facilitate the administration of the Resource Management Act, the authors of which wanted to emphasise the sustainable management of the biophysical environment and dramatically to limit local government's involvement in urban and social planning. Ironically, the strategic planning provisions of the amended Local Government Act gave local government contradictory powers. We discuss the nature of this contradiction and its impacts on the ways in which district planning under the Resource Management Act and strategic planning under the Local Government Act have combined to create new and unforseen approaches to urban planning and management in New Zealand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new type of dynamic spatial model is described: graph-cellular automatoa (graph-CA). First, the proximal model of space and geo-algebra are briefly introduced. Then, the graph-CA model is described, with an emphasis on understanding it as a reworking of the proximal model of space and also of geo-algebra. It is shown that graph-CA with particular structural properties defined in terms of the relationships between subsets of cells are a useful generalisation of traditional cellular automaton (CA) which enable meaningful descriptions of model structure to be developed. This enables further development of novel types of model in the same ‘family’ while retaining links to simpler, better understood examples. It is further argued that the derivation of the graph-CA from both the graph and CA formalisms permits the simultaneous use of well-developed ways of describing model structure and process dynamics, and that this could form the basis of a research programme into the elusive relations between the two. The relationship of graph-CA to other discrete models is briefly discussed, and a classification scheme which indicates the particular geographical interest of such models is suggested. </jats:p>",

There are, however, a number of flaws in the existing button designs that can affect the quality of land-suitability assessment. In this paper, we first examine two common problems of redundancy and underrepresentation in button design, and then present a button system that is free from these problems. </jats:p>",

This issue of public–private mix in not‐for‐profit hospitals is discussed in terms of the experience with PMS gained in selected advanced market economies. Then, the major contours of the Israeli system of health care, and the gradual evolving of patient‐financed medical services within government acute‐care hospitals in Israel, is described. The experience gained in the few public hospitals in Jerusalem that have been operating PMS is assessed critically. The concluding part reviews the advantages and disadvantages of these developments in public and government acute‐care hospitals in Israel. It is concluded that PMS in public hospitals in Israel represents a policy aimed primarily at benefiting a select group of senior physicians in those hospitals.

Few studies have focused on employee perceptions of these structural changes. This study aims to describe employee reactions following a merger between two Norwegian hospitals. A Grounded theory approach has been used in this study. The theoretical model is based on empirical data collected from employees directly affected by the structural change process. Employee resistance was found to be the core category. Three categories were found in relation to this core category; goal uncertainty, organizational culture and individual insecurity. Different perceptions and interpretations of vaguely formulated goals lead to employee resistance. The difference between the organizational cultures in the two hospitals impeded the merger according to the project plan, and very few positive results could be seen. Individual insecurity regarding the future was experienced in connection with the implementation of structural change. The authors propose a strategy to counteract resistance in similar mergers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> State-of-the-art computer technology has improved the integration of different types of representations and data and has provided new possibilities for manipulating results. Consequently, the use of computers has been widespread in urban design and the planning process. The potential that computer virtual environments brought for describing future developments to the public at large is enormous. Nevertheless, when imagery and realism dominate the communication process, they may obscure important issues that relate more to the underlying logic of urban design fabric. A sample of 23 university students from nonarchitecture courses and a sample of 23 students from architecture (contrasted group design) were used for analysing differences in their evaluation on form and content of a video presentation concerning an urban design project in Lisbon. The urban design project was focused on an important avenue of the city—Avenida da Liberdade. Several representation methods and different techniques for viewing images were used on video presentation: photography, colour film, 3D-rendered model with animation, plans, and photomontage. The results highlighted the power that imagery and realistic computer models have, when used in an unbalanced way, for overshadowing differences between subjects. This is because at the end of the questionnaire both groups had a positive opinion about the urban design project, but significant differences were found in relation to their evaluation and understanding of both content and form of video presentation. </jats:p>",

Traditional Turkish street networks are characterized by discriminant functions of several space-syntax-related indices, as well as by image-analysis and graph-theoretical indices. A set of space-syntactic indices is found to be powerful enough to distinguish the traditional street network among others, particularly axial ringiness, implying that the formation of large blocks is a typical feature. The relative abundance of closed-end edges is found to be another important feature of the traditional street network. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the 1990s, the Italian National Health Service (INHS) experienced a major reform introducing regionalization, quasi‐markets and managerialism. The combination of quasi‐markets and regionalization has produced an interesting scenario: 21 Regional Governments designing their own organizational and funding models to achieve the desired combination of equity, efficiency, freedom of choice and cost containment. This paper reports the results of a research project carried out in 1998–99 to identify such models, verify their actual states of implementation and analyse the resulting incentives for individual health‐care organizations. Overall, most Regions have designed their models according to the ‘LHU‐centred’ template, under which most public hospitals remain under Local Health Unit (LHU) control, LHUs are funded by their Regions on a capitation basis and each LHU is expected to reimburse other LHUs, Independent INHS Hospitals (IHs) and accredited private providers for services supplied to its residents. Reimbursements are activity‐based according to Regional fee schedules. The major exception is Lombardy, Italy's largest and wealthiest Region, which has formally opted for the ‘purchaser–provider split’ template, with LHUs acting mostly as purchasers while IHs and accredited private professionals and organizations act as providers. In practice, however, many Regions still show significant features of the traditional cost‐reimbursement system. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This cohort study examines the period 1994–98 in 11 Swedish county councils. Four hundred and eighteen physicians were studied in Stockholm County Council, which has a performance‐based reimbursement system, and in ten councils without such a system. The results show that professional power and autonomy are considered to be very limited in all councils, and that they have decreased during the period studied. Professional autonomy is, however, more limited in Stockholm. The limitations in Stockholm are more related to financial considerations, whereas the limitations in the other councils are more due to guidelines and lists of recommended drugs. Professional autonomy and power were found to be important determinants for quality of care, and the physicians in Stockholm estimated the quality of care lower than their colleagues in the ten other councils. Thus, our study suggests that the performance‐based reimbursement system might fail to reach the desired results due to its negative impact on professional power and autonomy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The major difficulties in electromagnetic regional hyperthermia are the occurrence of systematic stress and local high temperatures (hot spots). This thesis describes the development of a planning system to get more insight in hyperthermia treatments. The system is based on a finite‐difference time‐domain computer model to calculate the specific absorption rate (SAR) distribution within a patient. Segmenting a CT data set into fat, muscle, and bone and using literature‐based values of the dielectric properties results in the required dielectric patient model. Because the SAR computation on CT‐resolution (1×1×5 <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8567-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8567:mp8567-math-0001\" /> would require 310 days, this high‐resolution is down‐scaled to a lower resolution of 1 <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8567-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8567:mp8567-math-0002\" /> (computation time 2.8 hours). The use of the HTP system reveals the close relation between SAR distribution and patient anatomy, stressing the need for high‐resolution computations. For this purpose a method called quasistatic zooming has been developed: from the low‐resolution <jats:italic>E</jats:italic>‐field distribution the high‐resolution potential distribution at the surface of a small subvolume is calculated. With this potential distribution and the high‐resolution patient geometry, the high‐resolution SAR distribution is computed using a quasistatic SAR model. Repeating this procedure yields the high‐resolution SAR distribution for an arbitrary volume of interest. With this method it takes 4.3 days to compute CT‐resolution SAR distributions. SAR maxima that are predicted by both quasistatic zooming and high‐resolution SAR modeling are not predicted by low‐resolution computations and vice versa. Hence, zooming is required for reliable treatment planning. Whether SAR maxima lead to hot spots depends on local blood flow (discrete vasculature, local perfusion) and will be investigated in a succeeding project.</jats:p>",

A ‘triad’ is articulated to inform such politics, which brings together three notions: the spatial dialectics of injustice, the right to the city, and the right to difference. The notion of spatial justice is employed as a theoretical underpinning to avoid abusive interpretations of Lefebvrian rights in a liberal framework of individual rights. The case of French urban policy is used for illustrative purposes. Finally, the notion of égaliberté is introduced as a moral ground on which the triad may be defended. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scientific evidence about the seriousness of the climate threat to agriculture is now unambiguous, but the ex- act magnitude is uncertain because of complex interactions and feedback processes in the ecosystem and the economy. Climate-related factors that would affect agricultural productivity in coming decades are: changes in temperature, precipitation, carbon dioxide (CO ), fertilization, short-term weather variability and surface water 2 run-off. Simulation of future climate in India under A2 scenario by IITM, Pune and Hadley Centre, UK, indicate that during the last quarter of present century the country will experience an increase in mean annual tempera- ture by 3-5C. Summer monsoon rainfall will increase by 20%, and extreme rainfall events would rise sharply in western and south-central parts. However, the arid western Rajasthan and the adjoining Punjab and Haryana will possibly experience notable decline in summer monsoon, and slight increase in winter rainfall, with pro- nounced variability in rainfall and fewer rainy days. Consequently, there will be higher incidence of droughts and floods in arid western India, affecting both rainy ( kharif) and winter ( rabi) season crops. Since a number of high- value crops are grown during the rabi, the negative impact on farmers economy would possibly be higher. Change in CO concentration too can show uncertainty in crop yields, but studies on the interrelationship be- 2 tween changes in rainfall, temperature and CO concentration and their effect on yield changes are quite few. 2 Adaptation and mitigation strategies to address the impact of climate change on agriculture are needed ur- gently through new research and proper interpretation of the accumulated research results from the decades of dryland research under different agro-climatic settings. Use of alternative crops or cultivars adapted to the likely changes, alteration in the planting date, and management of plant spacing and input supply might help in re- ducing the adverse impact. Use of resource-conservation technologies and a shift from sole cropping to diversi- fied farming system is highly warranted. Horticulture and agro-forestry need to be given more encouragement. Enabling policies on crop insurance, subsidies and pricing related to water and energy uses need to be strengthened at the earliest. Policies that would encourage farmers to enrich organic matter in the soil need emphasis. Also, it is necessary to develop a robust early warning system of spatio-temporal changes in weather as well as other environmental parameters. Contingency crop planning will require greater attention. Long-term strategic approaches to efficiently conserve and utilize rain water on the one hand and in-season tac- tical approaches to mitigate the adverse effects of weather aberrations on the other are also needed. Consider- ation of depletion rate of soil water is more important when the crops are grown primarily on stored soil water. Under such situations, wide rows and low plant populations are highly desirable. Water-conservation practices will become economically feasible when nutrient deficiencies are also corrected. Late onset of monsoon rains often leads to delayed planting and specific crop contingency plans have been developed for different agro-cli- matic zones to address the issue.</jats:p>"

The article examines the impact of these on land use planning in the region, which has traditionally adopted a centralised, technocratic approach to policy making that denied the realities of sectarian division. The new policy agenda directly challenges this style of planning and has included a number of initiatives that could partially open the planning system to public scrutiny and force it to incorporate issues of social justice. This article describes the partial success in implementing these measures and makes an interim assessment of their potential impact and broader policy relevance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The rapprochement of humanism and structuralism on the one hand, and quantitative and qualitative approaches on the other hand, has not addressed an implacable difficulty which continues to haunt both spatial science and ‘critical’ human geographies. That difficulty concerns the ontological and ethical status of numbers, and their relationship to concepts, events, and sensations. The paper engages with this difficulty through a combination of theoretical and literary writings, most notably Woody Allen's film Deconstructing Harry, Samuel Beckett's play Not I, and Derrida's work of Dissemination. Insofar as ‘one’ lacks consistency—by disavowing difference, alterity, and innumerable numbers—its deployment is invariably unbecoming, repressive, and ill-mannered. The ethical response is to divine ‘another way of working with numbers’, as Derrida once intimated; to prevent some ones from taking hold. The outcome is a form of poststructuralist geography that takes flight from all kinds of pointillism. After an opening scene that lays out the general setup of quantification and its qualification, the first section of the paper employs the notion of a soft ontology in order to prepare the way for ‘another way of working with numbers’ that is occasioned by a sensitivity towards the ontological buzzing and solicitation that accompanies processes of subjectification, objectification, identification, and enumeration. The paper concludes with an affirmation of a ‘disturbing geography’ that leaves everything in perpetual suspense. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Representations of quantitative geography, both by practitioners and by others, have tended to associate quantification with empiricism, positivism, and the social and academic status quo. Qualitative geography, by contrast is represented as nonempiricist or postempiricist, sensitive to complexity, contextual, and capable of empowering nonmainstream academic approaches and social groups. Attempts to engage in debate between these positions rarely challenge this dualism, reproducing the representation of quantitative geography as logical positivism, and a dualism separating quantitative and qualitative geography. I argue that this dualism can be broken down, by deconstructing the underlying representation. I discuss why this representation came into existence and how it was stabilized; how close attention to the practices of quantitative geographers, and particularly to the evolution of these practices, reveals its inadequacies; and what new possibilities for quantitative practices emerge from this deconstruction. GIS, one of the recent manifestations around which representations of quantitative geography polarize, is used as a case study to illustrate these arguments. I pay particular attention to the question of the relevance of quantitative practices for an emancipatory human geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One influential approach to environmental problems holds that their solution requires the definition of full liberal property rights over goods that will enable their value to be registered in actual or hypothetical markets. How adequate is that solution? In this paper I offer reasons to be sceptical, by placing recent liberal arguments in the context of older debates about property, in particular those concerned with the distribution of care. Although proposals for the extension of liberal property rights over environmental goods often appeal to arguments from the need to distribute care, I show that there are conflicts between them. Care for particular places that embody the life of a community that has an existence over time is often expressed through resistance to liberal property rights. We express mutual obligations to members of a community through a denial of exclusive property rights over certain common goods. Also, what constitutes care for environmental goods itself is contested across class, occupation, culture, and history. Conflicts between those with different conceptions of care are often expressed through conflicts in property rights. The justification of property rights by appeal to particular accounts of proper care has, from the time of Locke to the present, been invoked to legitimate the appropriation of goods. The introduction and maintenance of liberal property-rights regimes involves the creation and sustenance of a particular distribution of social power, and should be understood as such. </jats:p>",

I critically review recent attempts to conceptualise the social role of cars and subsequently suggest a three-dimensional model to theorise automobility further as a modern mobility paradigm. This theory of automobility assigns central importance to the subjects, the vehicles, and the spatiotemporalities that are involved in, and produced by, the car-system. For the purpose of outlining the content and internal dependencies of this three-dimensional model, I make use of theoretical assumptions gleaned from transport geography, modernisation theory, as well as the sociology of technology. Furthermore, I argue that a somewhat orthodox form of automobilisation has become reflexive in the course of a growing public recognition of the inherent threats of the car to culture and nature. Under reflexive automobilisation almost all ‘auto-subjects’ are engaged in defining, interpreting, and responding to ‘auto-risks’. They do not necessarily do this, however, in a self-critical fashion. Instead of fostering the rise of a different, postautomotive mobility paradigm, their responses often merely lead to a reproduction of traditional ‘auto-scapes’. </jats:p>",

In order to do so, popular groups joined forces with students and professionals. They sought to demonstrate new models of urban and peri-urban development that met their inhabitants’ needs while avoiding the chaotic informal processes by which most low-income settlements develop. They also sought to ensure good natural resource management and the protection of their rich and diverse cultural heritage. Last but not least, they searched for new approaches to community-based organizational replication in harmony with the environment. This paper describes the many projects implemented in San Miguel Teotongo, Cananea and Sierra Nevada which included new schools, health centres and community museums, settlement lay-outs with planned and installed infrastructure, markets, the protection of green areas and historic sites and the development of new agricultural products and eco-tourism. It also included community-based mapping of municipalities to allow better management of natural resources. The paper also describes how these initiatives have developed over the last 20 years and their role within Mexico’s complex political changes, including their relations with different political parties. </jats:p>",

Originally seen as universal, and therefore outside space and place, studies in science, technology, and society (STS) located it first in specific locations—laboratories—and then in narrow networks linking laboratories. This double location implied that science is caught up in and enacts two topological forms— region and network—since objects in networks hold their shape by freezing relations rather than fixing Euclidean coordinates. More recent STS work suggests that science and technology also exist in and help to enact additional spatial forms. Thus some technoscience objects are fluid, holding their form by shifting their relations. And yet others achieve constancy by enacting simultaneous absence and presence, a topological possibility which we call here fire. The paper concludes by arguing that the ‘global’ includes and is enacted in all four of these topological systems. </jats:p>",

They cannot be chosen on the basis of efficiency considerations alone, as what is efficient depends on the institutional structures themselves and the interests they defend. The author highlights some important distinctions between various property regimes: whereas categories like private, common, and state property all may imply some degree of co – ownership and overlap along some dimensions, the logic of each system, ideally defined, may be quite distinct. The author shows that there is nothing inherent in a resource that demands a certain regime. Property regimes are social constructs and must be defended by judgment, not by necessity. The author demonstrates that the main role of property regimes is to defend certain interests. Furthermore, they seem to influence which interests are formed or become activated. The preferences which form the basis for efficiency evaluations are thus dependent upon the chosen system. In this way, technically oriented evaluations like cost – benefit analysis are caught in severe circularities. The implication of this for policy is that the evaluation of regimes implies taking a stand concerning what we want to become, both as individuals and as a society. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although partnerships are emerging as a central feature in governance arrangements in advanced capitalist societies, much discussion has taken place on the value and effectiveness of the approach. In recent years this debate has come to the fore in Northern Ireland, as a plethora of partnerships have been increasingly applied across a wide range of different government programmes at different levels of governance. Using a map of partnership arrangements in Northern Ireland, the author examines three case studies with a view to analysing the value and importance of partnership and assessing the activities that they do best. From this analysis, the author then discusses the future of partnership governance, outlines a number of areas for new research, and presents an agenda for development. As the case studies suggest that too much emphasis has been placed on developing a ‘process’, to the detriment of product outcomes, it is argued that partnerships need to adopt a dual approach to development by combining an inclusive process with greater strategic focus. At the regional level, however, a partnership framework is needed to facilitate coordination, reduce duplication, and improve understanding between partnerships, and between partnerships, local authorities, and government departments. Moreover, by adopting an inclusive approach, a partnership framework has the potential to provide a voice for the socially and politically excluded and to encourage participative planning and pluralist policymaking. </jats:p>",

The study found that it is not possible, at least at this time, to develop such a methodology. Numerous problems were encountered in making expenditure estimates. First and most important, expenditure accounts are not always readily available. Even when these accounts are available, they may require some adjustments. In some instances, for example, the salaries of health workers who also provide family planning are in the health accounts, whereas in other cases the workers covered in the family planning accounts spend some of their time providing health services. Allocation variables then must be developed to separate spending on family planning from that on health. In some instances allocation variables were developed and used to separate family planning from health expenditures, but in this case allocation variables were not available and a cost analysis was performed. It is concluded that it takes considerable time and effort to estimate expenditures, and that the approach that was followed varied by country, reflecting the data available to make estimates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Housing provision in China has undergone significant changes since economic reform. In the early stage of reform the objective was to solve the problems that are internal to the socialist economy, namely unrecoverable housing investment and housing shortages. The state adopted policies to ‘commodify’ and ‘decentralise’ housing provision. The mode of provision was transformed from a centrally allocated budget to shared investment contributed by state work-units, local governments, and individual households. Since the 1990s Chinese cities have seen increased foreign investment in real estate development and consequently experienced an unprecedented building boom. Little is know about the impacts of globalisation on housing development. The purpose of this paper is to examine the changes in housing investment and to highlight the dilemma of housing ‘commodification’ in the process of globalisation. Specifically, foreign investment contributed to initial capital formation in real estate development and more importantly helped to create a marketised housing segment. The buoyant market price demonstrated the profitability of real estate, thus attracting more capital into housing development. The combined effect of marketisation and globalisation has led to increasing social spatial differentiation and inadequate housing provision to marginal social groups. </jats:p>",

However, the validity of this approach can be questioned. The author briefly reviews property rights and decisionmaking on matters involving environmental values. Two examples are discussed: nature conservation, and the planting of genetically modified crops. The examples are considered in relation to existence values, citizens' preferences, problems associated with aggregating social preferences, and the observation that there are costs associated with exercising rights. The problems of the use of opportunity costs as a means of compensation for lost rights to environmental values are those of (1) who should determine the values; (2) whether payments should be made as compensation or as fines; and (3) who should receive the payments. These problems raise issues of equity, particularly as poor people often have claims to rights over areas with high environmental values. In conclusion, the roles of equity and sovereignty in the distribution of entitlements are emphasised and the difficulty of taking a policy decision to use market mechanisms for conserving biodiversity is discussed. </jats:p>",

A GIS tool was used to define and identify the critical pollution areas and sources. Pollution source information such as population, livestock, industry and land use were collected on the basis of the individual village boundary. The industrial, land use and living pollution were aggregated by the GIS overlay analysis capability to obtain the combined pollution load within the watershed. Priority areas for the mitigation of the pollution were defined considering the pollution loading rate, distance of stream from pollution source, and political, religious, and touristic values of the area. This research noticed that Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur municipalities are the major polluting areas and living beings are the major factors of Bagmati River pollution. Delivery ratio for the watershed was found to vary from 40-69% for BOD and nitrogen but the delivery of phosphorus was exceptionally high (92% at Gaurighat and 77% at Chovar) due to cremation activity of the Hindu religion on the riverbanks. Thus, the priority areas for the mitigation of the carbonaceous and nutrient source pollution were identified. At present the land use and industry impaired a very low contribution compared to the huge pollution load from the municipalities to the river system.</jats:p>",

The methodology consists of defining a suitable motion law for the load, and subsequently determining, via dynamic inversion, the corresponding command function for the system. The method inherently assures the robustness of the control scheme despite inaccuracies in the estimation of the stiffness constant and of the damping of the transmission. The main contribution of the paper lies in the definition of a simple optimization procedure which allows the system inversion point that minimizes the residual vibration to be found. Experimental results show that in this way the identification phase is less critical and performances can be significantly improved.</jats:p>",

This has followed concerted calls to make health promotion a familiar and recognized part of nursing practice. Despite this, however, current health‐related practices are still unstructured, haphazard and under‐evaluated. This state of affairs is further compounded by the lack of any generic and systematic nursing planning process model by which health education/health promotion programmes are applied in practice. This paper puts forward the case for such a model, develops it, and demonstrates its possible application in clinical settings.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Method.</jats:bold> A systematic literature review was conducted in order to develop a new theoretical perspective for health promotion/health education nursing practice. The proposed model has evolved from this new perspective. The process of developing this model has drawn on existing contemporary planning models – using them as a means to develop a conceptual framework. Consequently, the proposed model seeks to critique, adapt and adopt some of their components within a nursing context.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> If the current situation continues, in which planning process models are not adopted as a routine part of practice, then nursing may well remain a ‘bystander’ in health promotion/health education.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> After 1949 China's welfare system developed on the basis of a status division between urban and rural residents. Urban and rural societies were profoundly influenced by the respective organization of their welfare systems, which shared the feature of being fixed to specific places (rural) or enterprises (urban). Reform of core institutions is constrained by path dependency. Knowledge of those constraints, however, can aid efforts to shape new paths. In this paper we examine how institutional legacies of urban – rural status differentiation continue to structure economic and welfare reform. China's reform process has been characterized by an unusual degree of decentralization and local experimentation. As a result, the nature of change is not easily seen by examining only laws and policies related to welfare. Instead, broader changes in the economy and the loosening of controls on mobility have interacted with the locality/enterprise welfare systems to generate diverse local outcomes. After an overview of the welfare institutions and the reform process, we draw on field research in industrializing rural areas in Guangdong to describe a pattern we label ‘local citizenship’ where welfare benefits are elaborated for the locally born while excluding migrants. </jats:p>",

Presents and discusses exploratory research into the perception of crime/deviancy, fear of crime and “defensible space”, in relation to a range of characteristic UK housing designs. This investigation concerns the perceptions of planning professionals, convicted burglars and other users and provides both qualitative and quantitative analysis of results from a series of interviews which presented slide representations of terraced, semi‐detached and detached housing designs in addition to low‐rise/walk‐up flats and high‐rise flats. Where possible, two contrasting versions of the same design were presented to probe the influence of “image” in the perception of crime and “defensible space”. The results from this exploratory investigation underpin Newman’s theory of “defensible space” in that a “hierarchy of place” appears to exist with regard to housing designs. However, the “image” of each design is perceived to be a significant contributing factor in relation to the criminogenic capacity of each design presented. Wilson and Kelling’s “Broken Windows” theory is also supported by these research findings.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Debates about the relationship between globalization and state power have often relied on a static view of spatial scales as discrete stages for social interaction. Focusing instead on the ‘production of scale’, several researchers have argued that globalization leads to rescaling of the state, as regulatory powers are realigned both upwards to supranational regimes and downwards to regional, local, and urban governance structures. Although this perspective quite usefully treats scale as relational, this ‘glocalization’ argument remains somewhat schematic and does not allow for a full range of possible scalar configurations. Highlighting instead heterogeneity of scalar relations, in this paper I analyze the ways that United States' fishery development in the North Pacific produced both national power and transnational economic activity. After extending political jurisdiction over waters up to 200 nautical miles from shore, the United States implemented fishery development policies that emphasized the ‘Americanization’ of the Alaska pollock fishery at the expense of an international, particularly Japanese, fishery. The outcomes of these policies, however, have been international partnerships, foreign direct investment, and increased international trade, all of which have made the pollock industry simultaneously national and transnational. Efforts to assert and implement control over ocean territory produced both the national state and globalization, which were mutually reinforcing rather than antagonistic. Treating national states and the global economy as complex, contingent scalar configurations facilitates analysis of the causes of variability in state – economy relations. </jats:p>",

Second, cultural proximity refers to two entities being relationally close to one another, with geographic proximity often not being required. Third, network proximity refers to two entities being associated through or with a third entity, again with geographic proximity often not being required. Geographies of links between entities—people, enterprises, places, etc—trace networks of relations. Geographic proximity remains crucial, but the relational spaces of geographic networks that selectively connect entities in different ways around the world are just as important. In this paper some elements from actor-network theory are used to approach the investigation of multiple proximities. The argument is exemplified through a recent case study of the restructuring of trans-port logistics of newsprint manufactured in Australia.</jats:p>",

Employee morale was so diminished from six years of constant reorganization and downsizing that the newly appointed vice-president was skeptical that the department would be able to meet its new goals unless a highly participative process was used. The project therefore was designed to use an input-reaction process between employees and managers to create a shared vision, strategic plan, and measurement system. Past projects of this nature had involved management personnel only and often goals were not achieved because few employees felt motivated by the “top-down” directives. This process produced a motivating vision, a highly doable performance plan, and a well-accepted measurement system within the allotted project schedule. </jats:p>",

On the perceptual side, the dominant cognitive view largely underestimates, and thus fails to account for, the impact of action-related processes on both the processing of perceptual information and on perceptual learning. On the action side, most approaches conceive of action planning as a mere continuation of stimulus processing, thus failing to account for the goal-directedness of even the simplest reaction in an experimental task. We propose a new framework for a more adequate theoretical treatment of perception and action planning, in which perceptual contents and action plans are coded in a common representational medium by feature codes with distal reference. Perceived events (perceptions) and to-be-produced events (actions) are equally represented by integrated, task-tuned networks of feature codes – cognitive structures we call event codes. We give an overview of evidence from a wide variety of empirical domains, such as spatial stimulus-response compatibility, sensorimotor synchronization, and ideomotor action, showing that our main assumptions are well supported by the data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There have been many claims that the introduction of parental choice for schools in the United Kingdom would lead to further socioeconomic segregation between schools. However, little evidence of this has actually emerged. Instead during the first half of the 1990s, in particular, the number of children living in poverty became more equally distributed between UK secondary schools. Part of the explanation for this lies with the prior arrangements for allocating children to schools, typically based upon designated catchment areas. In this paper we argue that the degree of residential segregation that exists in England ensured that schools were already highly segregated before the introduction of market reforms to education, and has continued to be the chief determinant of segregation since. We then suggest that the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which advocates a return to the use of catchment areas and distance to school when allocating places in oversubscribed schools, may be leading inadvertently to increased socioeconomic segregation between schools. </jats:p>",

However, the social significance of occupation, though acknowledged, has rarely been applied spatially. In this study, we employed these three concepts to examine the social environment of the entire metropolitan employment space as defined by job location. Smallest space analysis was used to identify and compare the sociospatial segregation produced by workers' occupational distribution in employment and residential spheres. This empirical study focused on metropolitan Tel Aviv, Israel's largest urban area, using the latest available national census. Our findings show that the social milieu of employment differed from that of residence: blue-collar workers were segregated from white-collar workers; managers, clerks, and salespersons formed the core group; and gender and ethnic divisions characterised the sociospatial realm of employment. Overall, most employees changed their social environment when they went to work. The study indicates that spatial segregation, within each sphere and between the two spheres, is intrinsic to the capitalist – patriarchal order. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper critiques the learning-region literature on two related points. The first is that the learning-region analysis of labour markets is theoretically underdeveloped, because it underestimates the difficulty of overcoming systematic skill mismatches, underinvestment, and free-rider practices which characterize unregulated labour markets. Second and relatedly, because it does not link the problematic nature of labour-market governance to the conflicts and contradictions of state policy, the learning-region literature effectively ‘depoliticizes’ policymaking. The paper draws on a case study of the development of local boards for training and adjustment in Ontario, Canada, and develops an alternative framework utilizing a critical governance perspective which stresses how knowledge and learning must be seen as part of state accumulation and hegemonic strategies. Such strategies are contingent on the representation of stakeholders, in particular business, and current attempts to develop decentralized associational networks are often part of what Jessop terms metagovernance. In the case of Canada, decentralization from the federal to provincial scales is viewed as crisis and cost driven and in many ways antithetical to stakeholder governance. Thus in Ontario, the development of a stakeholder-based form of labour-market governance has been marginalized by shifts in state-accumulation strategies and the inability and disinterest of business in representing itself in such stakeholder institutions. Furthermore, the local boards' generation of knowledge based on inclusionary networks and information is at odds with a state and business emphasis on knowledge derived from exclusive networks and geared to short-term profit maximization. </jats:p>",

On the basis of the assumption that the paid informal work of the unemployed is low-paid employment conducted for unadulterated economic reasons, the aim is to deter these rational economic actors by ensuring that the expected cost of being caught and punished is greater than the benefit of participating in such activity. Using structured interviews with the unemployed in UK lower income urban neighbourhoods, however, I found that pure economic motivations do not predominate when the unemployed participate in this work. Instead, such work is principally used to help out others, or to cement or forge social networks, or both. In consequence, I argue that there is a need to couple deterrence with the provision of alternative coping mechanisms in order to eradicate paid informal work. I conclude by proposing several policy initiatives that could act as a substitute for such work. </jats:p>",

The process involved the establishment of a local steering committee, 11 months of injury surveillance, a critical review of the evidence base, community consultations and assessment of community resources. There were 412 recorded injury cases during the surveillance period, with higher rates among men, manual workers, those aged 15–34 years, sport/leisure activities and around the home and farm. Salient issues for residents included a lack of access to safety information and skills, particularly with regard to first aid and bush fire for isolated residents and rurally inexperienced new residents. While injury prevention was identified as an important issue for the community, the rapidly changing size and nature of the community and its infrastructure made this a particularly challenging issue. Challenges included limited availability of volunteers from key sectors, lack of formal data collection systems, difficulties in mobilising support for a broad issue like injury, limited communication networks and the negative impact of distance and role uncertainty on community ownership of the program. This case study illustrates the steps involved in an effective community‐based needs assessment addressing injury prevention. Such an approach, if carried out systematically, will help ensure that the strategies and programs developed will be both appropriate and likely to obtain the support of the local community.</jats:p>",

However, forming a safe flight-plan is a complex and difficult task. An initial experiment hypothesized that an in-flight planning tool would aid the pilot in forming and verifying flight-plans. Results identified problems with the planner's interface, highlighted the myriad concerns that pilots must address in creating an emergency flight plan, and identified potential benefits with having the system provide a safe plan. Two further studies are discussed in this paper. The first examined whether the pilots' difficulties came from specific features in the interface or from the inherent difficulty of the task.

This may foster the development of theory-motivated interventions to support improved planning and validation of human-performance measurement methods in team settings. We studied the effects of planning medium (i.e., paper map versus shared electronic whiteboard) and team organizational structure (i.e., functional versus divisional) on the ability of C2 teams to develop effective pre-mission plans and on their resulting performance using a team-in-the-loop simulation. Findings suggested that the groupware condition fostered collaborative planning behaviors. The results also indicated that teams who used the electronic whiteboard for planning enjoyed a performance advantage over those teams who planned using a paper map and markers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Spruce Budworm Decision Support System (SBW DSS) quantifies the marginal timber supply (m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>/ha) benefits of protecting stands against spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.)) defoliation. It allows the user to quantify the volume benefit of protecting alternative areas and determine effects on forest development and annual allowable cut. Implementing the SBW DSS on a land base involves seven steps: (i) defining the base defoliation, or an explicit forecast of the defoliation level included in yield forecasts; (ii) compiling historical defoliation; (iii) defining base volume yields; (iv) obtaining the harvest schedule from the land base management plan; (v) building the stand impact matrix, which quantifies direct impacts of defoliation; (vi) building the forest impact matrix, which quantifies indirect impacts of defoliation on harvest schedules; and (vii) building the stand-history file, which contains all stand-level and defoliation data. These tasks are usually completed every 5 years. The remaining aspects of the planning methodology are implemented annually, including (i) recording the previous year's defoliation, (ii) estimating potential defoliation in the current year from budworm survey data, (iii) calculating volume loss or protection priority, (iv) generating budworm-caused volume loss maps, (v) digitizing potential spray blocks, and (vi) evaluating the protection program. Using ARC/INFO<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> and ArcView<jats:sup>®</jats:sup> geographic information system programs, the Protection Planning System component (PROPS) generates volume loss maps that can be used to help design and analyze costs and benefits of insecticide spray programs. Implementation of PROPS for the 450 000 ha Upper Miramichi Crown License in New Brunswick is described. Under \"normal\" and \"severe\" budworm outbreak scenarios, defined based on predictions of 19992008 defoliation, losses of 6.6 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> and 16.7 × 10<jats:sup>6</jats:sup> m<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> of spruce (Picea sp.)  balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) volume were projected to occur on this land base. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to introduce the clinical application of a newly developed compact computed tomography system (Ortho‐CT) to assess three‐dimensional (3‐D) images for the preoperative treatment planning of implants in the posterior region of the mandible. To evaluate the 3‐D images, we scanned using the Ortho‐CT system the mandible with a radiopaque template placed in the posterior region. The Ortho‐CT images provided excellent information for evaluating the morphology of the mandible, and for showing the location of the inferior alveolar nerve, mental foramen and the relationship of the template to the bone. We consider that Ortho‐CT is a useful aid to preoperative treatment planning of implant therapy in the mandible.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes a conceptual framework for applying a multi-agent system to process planning for integrating design, process planning and shop floor scheduling so that a distributed, cooperative and integrated process planning system is constructed. The problem in process planning has been mapped onto a multi-agent architecture based on multistage cooperation. The multi-agent system has some common characteristics, such as distribution, autonomy, interaction and openness, which are helpful for the traditional architecture to be transferred to the distributed, cooperative architecture for process planning system. An agent-based framework for an integrated, distributed and cooperative process planning system (IDCPPS) integrates all the activities of process planning into a distributed intelligent open environment. Agents in the agent-based framework for the IDCPPS can be organized dynamically and cooperate with each other to perform an appointed task flexibly. In addition, using CORBA technology, a prototype system of the IDCPPS is implemented. </jats:p>",
