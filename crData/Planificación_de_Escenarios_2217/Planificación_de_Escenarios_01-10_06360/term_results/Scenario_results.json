Defines the portal as a gateway to information and a one‐stop Web site that tries to satisfy most personal daily Web needs. Lists the core functions, applications and priorities of a portal. Categorizes portals into three major types: horizontal, vertical and corporate, based on specific application or area. Presents the Asian scenario of Internet growth and popping up of portals with a country wide portal list. Despite the constraints of infrastructure, Net access and low awareness, the Indian portal scenario resembles a gold rush with the phenomenon of “get‐online, get‐rich”. Lists the major Indian portals: rediff.com, indiainfo.com, expressindia.com, indiatimes.com, sify.com, ciol.com, etc. Identifies the factors for portal success as access route, strategic alliance, content route, alternative content route and examines general versus specialized portals, with examples. Concludes that the future is for niche portals that cater for sophisticated users, provide knowledge for competitiveness, and adopt new Internet technologies, connective issues and local content.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A Multi-Scenario Modelling approach was used to select a field development option that is robust for most if not all of the sub-surface realisations. This approach was adopted for the Jintan carbonate gas field, located offshore Sarawak, Malaysia in the South-China Sea. The Jintan field will be developed as a satellite to the nearby M1 offshore gas production facility for the supply of gas to the MLNG Tiga plant, which is currently under construction. First gas is in July 2003. Significant value has been added through an integrated, multi-discipline sub-surface study which provides the basis for the field development plan: (1) cost savings of more than 60% were realised through integration of Jintan in Shell's existing gas infrastructure of Sarawak and by reducing the number of wells from 12 to 6, (2) the expectation initially-in-place volumes increased by approximately 1 Tscf to 4 Tscf of gas.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Key uncertainties for the Jintan field are gross rock volume (GRV) and porosity, permeability (tight streaks, karst and fault features), the initial pressure (due to possible depletion from the nearby producing fields) and the effective aquifer strength. The applied workflow to model these uncertainties included structural uncertainty modelling, stochastic inversion, static reservoir modelling and dynamic simulation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The deliverable of the (Jason) stochastic inversion study were 93 combined depth/porosity models. Five of the 93 depth/ porosity models were selected for the final porosity modelling and exported to the 3D static reservoir simulation software. The static modelling resulted in 11 different static models, which were used for the dynamic modelling.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In the dynamic simulator, the initial pressure uncertainties were combined with the 11 static models into 33 sub-surface realisations which were then combined with different aquifer strengths and karst realisations. For each of the realisations an optimal development option was selected based on the currently expected capacity/offtake requirements and possible future changes/flexibility.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The resulting field development plan is robust for the following reasons: The selected development option caters for the uncertainty range of almost all modelled subsurface scenarios.Dependent on the subsurface scenario, 4 to 7 wells will be drilled. The exact number of wells required to provide a given capacity will be determined during the drilling phase.Well head compression is required in almost all scenarios but never within the first years therefore allowing sufficient time to monitor the reservoir performance and, if required, execute a compression project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The described workflow, with a high level of integration between the subsurface disciplines, demonstrates the value of multi-scenario subsurface uncertainty modelling in situations where large uncertainties exist.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Vendor rating is a process having strategic implications for managing a supply chain. Vendor rating can be done using analytic hierarchy process either by a single decision maker or by a group of decision makers. This approach may suffer from some drawbacks including bias in estimation process. A methodology is proposed in this paper which makes use of estimation of the rating by a group on an individual basis following the principle of anonymity. A statistical analysis is carried out to determine the confidence intervals for the estimates of the composite rating of the vendors. The procedure presented here helps in identifying those members whose opinions may significantly deviate from that of the group. Emphasis is placed on establishment of confidence limits in group decision‐making. Participants in group decision making, whose opinions fall outside the group’s confidence limit, are further studied to understand the source of variation. Implementation guidelines have also been provided to account for the dynamic nature of the vendor evaluation process and to take appropriate actions in managing the vendor rating process in the overall supply chain.</jats:p>",

Maximum harvestable yield was obtained when sunflower was sown in mid-January. Very early sowing (20 December) did not generate any advantage not only for the earliness but also for the yield components; however, later sowings (5 and 20 February) resulted in overall reduction in crop duration, poor seed setting, hastened maturity ultimately culminating in lesser sunflower yields. Cooler temperature prevailing during the initial crop establishment, particularly under the earlier sowing dates (20 December, and 5 January), imparted considerably longer seed emergence period. Sunflower hy- brid PSH 569 recorded the highest seed yield (2.06 t/ha), excelling SH 3322 by 3.5% and PSFH 118 by 13.8%. Correlation studies indicated stronger association for yield components and yield with the weather variables during flowering and seed-filling period, therefore, reveals a decisive factor to optimize sunflower yield by adjusting sow- ing time under changing climatic scenario.</jats:p>"

Simulation experiments are used to compare these protocols with DSR, which has been shown to incur less control overhead that other on-demand routing protocols. The simulations show that DST requires far less control packets to achieve comparable or better average delays and percentage of packet delivered than DSR, and that BEST achieves comparable results to DSR while maintaining routing information for all destinations.</jats:p>",

Seen in this way, HHM brings strongly to our attention the fact that different methods within TSS can result in different sets of risk scenarios for the same underlying problem. Although this is not a problem practically, it is a bit awkward conceptually from the standpoint of the “set of triplets” definition of risk, in which the scenario set is part of the definition. Accordingly, the present article suggests a refinement to the set of triplets definition, which removes the specific set of scenarios, found by any of the TSS methods, from the definition of risk and casts it, instead, as an approximation to the “true” set of scenarios that is native to the problem at hand and not affected by the TSS method used.</jats:p>",
