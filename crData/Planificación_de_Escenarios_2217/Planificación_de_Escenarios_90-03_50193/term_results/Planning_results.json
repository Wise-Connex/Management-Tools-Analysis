      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines a study of recreational preferences designed to assess the usefulness of the method of hierarchical information integration for the study of complex decisionmaking processes which involve many potentially influential attributes. We assume that individuals who face complex decision problems initially group or classify influential attributes into subsets called decision constructs; then they rank these decision constructs into some overall preference for or choice among competing opportunities. To implement this conceptualization of individuals' cognitive processes we first measure overall preferences for recreational choice alternatives by creating separate experimental designs to study how individuals define each decision construct. Next we develop a design to integrate the decision constructs themselves so that we can observe how individuals' choices among, or preferences for, recreational opportunities change as we change how good an opportunity is with respect to each decision construct. The results of the study suggest that hierarchical information integration may be a potentially useful method to study complex decisionmaking problems of interest to planners and policy makers. Some avenues for further research are discussed. </jats:p><jats:p> Substantively, our results indicate that natural environment and accessibility, and maintenance have the most influence on the Eindhoven sample's preferences for and choices among parks. Some heterogeneity in preferences is also observed. </jats:p>",

Most AI planners to date have been based on the STRIPS planning representation. This representation has a number of limitations. Much recent work in plan representation has addressed these limitations. It was shown that Decision Theory can be used to remove a number of the limitations. Furthermore, the decision theoretic framework provides a precise definition of rational behaviour. There remain open questions within decision theory regarding belief revision and causality. It should be noted that these problems are not artifacts of the representation. Rather they arise because the rich representation allows their formulation. Some work integrating AI and decision theoretic approaches to planning has been done but this remains a largely untouched research area.</jats:p><jats:p>We see two main avenues for fruitful research. First, the straightforward decision theoretic formulation of planning is computationally impractical. Techniques need to be developed to do efficient decision theoretic planning. Work in AI plan generation has exploited information contained the structure of qualitative representations to guide efficient plan construction. These techniques should be applied to decision theoretic representations as well. Second, AI has developed many representations that allow useful structuring of knowledge about the world. Decision Theory has concentrated on representing beliefs and desires. Integration of AI and decision theoretic representations would yield powerful representation languages. Some of the benefits of such work can already be seen in the research combining temporal and decision theoretic representations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Bei den guten Windverh√§ltnissen in Norddeutschland ist die Marktdurchsetzung von Windenergie im wesentlichen von der Verf√ºgbarkeit von Standorten (‚Äútechnisches Potential‚Äú) sowie der H√∂he der bezahlten Einspeisepreise (‚Äúwirtschaftliches Potential‚Äú) abh√§ngig.Die vorliegenden Windmessungen zeigen, da√ü jedenfalls im langj√§hrigen Durchschnitt Hauptwindrichtungen nicht so stark ausgepr√§gt sind, da√ü eine Konzentration der Windkraftanlagen senkrecht zur Hauptwindrichtung und damit eine bessere Ausnutzung der Standorte m√∂glich ist. Erste Messungen in norddeutschen Windparks zeigen, da√ü beim √ºblichen Anlagenabstand von zehn Rotordurchmessern eine abschattungsbedingte Verminderung der Windstromproduktion von √ºber 10% zu erwarten ist.Erste systematische Absch√§tzungen ergeben ein Standortpotential f√ºr 30 000 bis 60 000 Anlagen der derzeit gebauten Standardklasse mit 25¬†m Rotordurchmesser und 250‚ÄØkW installierter Leistung. Eine vollst√§ndige Aussch√∂pfung dieses Potentials bedeutet eine Windstromproduktion von 10 bis 20 TWhe, also 15 % bis 30 % des derzeitigen Stromverbrauchs in Norddeutschland.An besonders windg√ºnstigen Standorten sind Windkraftanlagen bereits heute einzelwirtschaftlich konkurrenzf√§hig mit Produktionskosten von rund 0,25 DM/kWhe. Die derzeit f√ºr Windstrom bezahlten Einspeisepreise von 0,10 DM/kWhe entsprechen nur etwa der H√§lfte der Stromkosten in neuen Kernoder Kohlekraftwerken.Die Bundesregierung gew√§hrt derzeit im Rahmen des ‚Äú100-MW-Windprogramms‚Äú einen Zuschu√ü von 0,08 kWhe Windstrom, der als Verg√ºtung f√ºr seine geringeren Umweltkosten aufgefa√üt werden kann. Sobald die gro√üen Energieversorgungsmonopole eine marktwirtschaftlich gebotene Einspeiseverg√ºtung von rund 0,20 DM/kWhe bezahlen, kann sich Windenergie am Markt durchsetzen: Eine Abdeckung von 15 % des norddeutschen Stromverbrauchs erfordert rund 30 000 Anlagen mit 25¬†m Rotordurchmesser bei etwa 15‚ÄØMrd. DM Investitionskosten.</jats:p>"

Um genauer messen zu k√∂nnen, bedarf es in diesem Fachbereich genauerer Ma√üst√§be.Um dieses Ziel zu erreichen, sollten Ans√§tze im Fachbereich Naturschutz, regionale Leitbilder auszuarbeiten, weiterentwickelt werden.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents a new method for planning collision-free paths for robots with any number of joints. It is particularly well suited for use with kinematically redundant robots. The algorithm is general in that it does not impose restrictions on the geometry, motion, or payload of the robot. It does not try to locate an optimal path. Instead, it attempts to locate a reasonable path while mapping a minimal amount of configuration space (c-space). The method involves iteratively modifying a connected path between the initial and goal configurations to avoid all intervening obstacles. Information from the world model is used to guide path modification. This approach is of particular value in high-dimensional cases for which exhaustive searches are impractical. In the worst case, the algorithm maps a straight-line path in c-space to the goal and the surfaces of the interfering obstacles along this path. An example for a seven-degree-of-freedom robot is included.</jats:p>",

This study finds that nearly all surveyed editors, as community elites, favored community planning, but by 1985 saw this planning as an aspect of community growth more than an instrument of community control. Yet editors from complex, pluralistic communities did tend to see planning as part of maintaining community social order and control more than did editors from smaller communities. </jats:p>",

In this paper it is demonstrated that this is not a universal limitation.

A review of trends in labour productivity indicates that significant regional differences persist throughout the study period. Specifically, labour productivities in Atlantic Canada and in Manitoba and Saskatchewan are significantly lower than those in central Canada and the far western provinces. A model that decomposes growth in labour productivity into the contributions of growth in the capital-labour ratio, scale economies, and technical progress while controlling for business cycle effects is estimated for each of five Canadian regions. Alternative specifications are employed in order to help distinguish between the effects of internal scale economies and agglomeration economies. The results support the hypothesis that agglomeration economies make a significant contribution to growth in labour productivity. Although rapid growth in the capital ‚Äî labour ratio contributed significantly to growth in labour productivity in the Atlantic region, it was not sufficient to erase regional differences. </jats:p>",

In this paper such a project is outlined, and then utilized empirically with a case study of the historical and current evolution of Brooklyn, New York, illustrating that the formation and dissolution of neighborhoods is a function of the changing types of jobs at successive historical moments, the structure of the housing market, the geography of preexisting residential formations, and the cultural and ideological characteristics of immigrant communities. </jats:p>",

The growth of suburban homeownership in Toronto demonstrates the point. Ownership levels increased rapidly among all social classes. More middle-class women were doing their own housework. As a result they came to value smaller and more affordable homes. Many working-class men built their own homes. Some of these homes were in unserviced districts at the suburban fringe, where household tasks were more arduous. In both cases the growth in owner-occupation depended upon an increasing amount of unpaid work within and upon the home. Toronto's experience is exemplary and challenges the belief that, in the early 20th century, suburban homeownership was a middle-class phenomenon. The prevailing model of the city in this period must be revised to incorporate the fact that unpaid labour played a vital role in determining people's housing situation and standard of living. </jats:p>",

Physicians, residents, nurses, and social workers were presented with 16 hypothetical case scenarios and asked to: (1) rate the appropriateness of four discharge options (nursing home, community nursing, adult day, and outpatient clinic care), and (2) select the most appropriate discharge plan for each case. Four within-group variables were included in the scenarios: physical impairment, caregiver availability, follow-up required, and patient compliance. Decisions were greatly influenced by caregiver availability. When a caregiver was available, respondents preferred community-based options (i.e., community nursing care or outpatient clinic); if the case involved complications (i.e., severe physical impairment, heavy follow-up, noncompliant patient), they considered community nursing care more appropriate than outpatient clinic. When a caregiver was unavailable, respondents preferred institution-based options (i.e., nursing home or adult daycare); if there were complications, they considered nursing home more appropriate that adult daycare. </jats:p>",

It was expected that tax reform would shift the burden of taxation from individuals to corporations and from lower to higher-income p√©rsons, but it has also shifted the aggregate burden of federal income tax from the general population to US citizens over the age of sixty five. Total federal income taxes for the general population declined by nearly $36 US billion, but increased for older citizens (that is, those over the age of sixty five) by nearly $3 US billion. The shift in taxes is progressive, however, in that low-income older Americans pay less federal income tax and those with high incomes pay more. </jats:p><jats:p> At the same time, state income tax payments increased for most US citizens as a result of federal tax reform, but more so for older citizens than for the general population.

The postindependence era is subdivided into two phases: A first phase of continued separate development, and a second phase in which former ‚ÄòEuropean‚Äô rural councils and the ‚ÄòAfrican‚Äô district councils are being amalgamated. The research is based on representative samples of audited accounts. The postindependence income and expenditure trends of the two main rural local authorities and of the District Development Fund are presented. Disparities between and within types of local authorities are calculated. Against this background the (amalgamated) Rural District Councils Act (1987) is examined and key issues are highlighted.

The major thrust of the policy was to ameliorate economic and fiscal problems of distressed cities. The policy achieved only modest success, and was quickly swept away by the Reagan Administration. In this paper, the policy is reviewed, and the major factors which limited its success are identified. It is concluded that the major problems were inherent political and substantive barriers to effective urban policy, not fortuitous events or mistakes of the Carter Administration. These inherent problems will likely forestall future US efforts to implement an urban policy. An understanding of the problems is important for policymakers in other nations, particularly European nations which are now facing urban problems similar to those which generated the US effort. </jats:p>",

The tensions between these sets of rights are considered in the light of contests of interpretation over Section 7 rights and its relative powers with respect to property rights.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The internationalisation of the Japanese construction industry is inextricably caught up with the rise and rise of one company, Kumagai Gumi. Between 1955 and 1983 it accounted for more than 10% of all contracts awarded to the fifty-seven members of the Overseas Construction Association of Japan, a figure that outranked the ‚ÄòBig Five‚Äô domestic giants‚ÄîKajima, Ohbayashi, Shimizu, Taisei, and Takenaka Komuten. Any scepticism about the choice of Kumagai Gumi as the international pacesetter should be swept away as it captured more than one-third of all overseas contracts won by Japanese construction contractors in 1985 and 1986. Nevertheless, the discussion of Kumagai Gumi's meteoric rise must be seen against the broader international picture. In 1978, only ten Japanese firms were ranked in the ‚Äòtop two-hundred‚Äô construction contractors worldwide‚Äîa hierarchy dominated by sixty US contractors. By 1985, thirty-four Japanese firms were ranked in the ‚Äòtop two-hundred‚Äô firms‚Äîthe same number as from the United States. Why had this remarkable change occurred? Conventional answers are sought in terms of economic forces and bureaucratic power. Rather than follow this logic we speculate that changes in the nature of Japanese construction exports are correlated with variations on foreign policy, which in turn reflect changes in the dominant factions within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party‚Äîan emphasis in accord with Japanese scholars who suggest that since the early 1970s politicians have wrested control over decisionmaking from the bureaucrats. Consequently, attention is focused on overseas contracts won by construction firms, and by Kumagai Gumi in particular, to gauge if the changes in their distribution reflected marked shifts in foreign policy directions associated with three key prime ministers‚ÄîTanaka, Fukuda, and Nakasone. </jats:p>",

Using information provided by the annual Census of Production, the focus of the analysis is size-specific spatial change in manufacturing unit numbers, where size is defined in terms of employment bands. For Great Britain as a whole, a decline of over 20% in total unit numbers is recorded, with higher rates of decline occurring in the larger units. If the period 1976‚Äì1987 is divided into four subperiods, some growth is detected in the last subperiod, particularly in the smaller size bands. Analysis at the regional level indicates a similar pattern, and although ‚Äònorthern‚Äô regions appear to be more adversely affected in general than ‚Äòsouthern‚Äô regions it is concluded that the relatively higher rates of decline amongst larger manufacturing units is a spatially invariant characteristic. Within the regional analysis the influence of size structure upon regional manfacturing change is also examined. Finally, examination of changes occurring at the county level shows a greater disparity of performance, and also shows that regional outcomes can be dominated by the growth or decline of manufacturing in particular counties. </jats:p>",

Central themes that emerged from this experience included the importance of documenting the development processes and context of the community; the utility of a multiple-method, multiple-perspective approach; the appropriateness of both quantitative and qualitative information; and the necessity of grounding such an evaluation in the community through discussion, negotiation, responsiveness, and timely provision of results. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author compares the coalmining disputes of 1926 and 1984‚Äì85 and concentrates on the similarity shown by the spatial patterns of support for both actions. It is argued that the failure of the recent strike was not the result of the disappearance of a traditional solidarity but involved the reproduction of regional traditions of industrial relations. The geography of the 1926 dispute is not satisfactorily explained by economic coercion. It was also related to the coalowners' determination to end national wage bargaining and produced by varying degrees of commitment across the coalfields. In Nottinghamshire a group of internal contractors, who saw the strike as a denial of individual liberty and as a political abuse of mining unionism, organised a return to work. A sense of a violation of individual rights, which centred on the lack of a national ballot, was also fundamental to the failure of the recent strike in this coalfield. The cultural inheritance which shaped this response should be set within the context of the restructuring of the industry and of a decentralisation of wage bargaining. The conclusion drawn is that understanding economic change is not furthered by exaggerating the simplicity and homogeneity of past geographies. </jats:p>",

The study reveals that the most powerful factor in explaining the growth of public social expenditures is the proportion of the population that is elderly. Weaker, but statistically significant, positive relationships are also found linking public social benefits to electoral turnout, levels of unemployment and inflation, and dependence on foreign trade. There is little evidence of trade-offs between benefit expenditures and expenditures for defense. Nor is there a significant relationship between benefit expenditures and the self-interest of bureaucrats administering programs, the extent of unionization, or the partisan orientation of the national legislature. </jats:p>",

Sie analysieren das Studierverhalten und den √úbergang vom Studium in das Erwerbsleben und versuchen die Frage zu beantworten, welchen Handlungsstrategien die Absolventen nach Verlassen der Universit√§ten folgen.Auf den Universit√§ten selbst studiert eine wachsende Studentengruppe angesichts der Besch√§ftigungskrise und der eingeschr√§nkten Aufnahmef√§higkeit des akademischen Arbeitsmarktes im Sinne einer Selbst- und Neigungsverwirklichung. Bei diesen wird das Studium so etwas wie eine eigene Lebensform mit einer deutlichen Tendenz zur Hinausverz√∂gerung des Studienabschlusses.In den Wahrnehmungen und Bewertungen der Studenten und Hochschulabsolventen spiegeln sich deutlich die ung√ºnstigen Berufsaussichten wider, die noch von der besonders angespannten Lage auf dem regionalen akademischen Arbeitsmarkt in Westniedersachsen negativ verst√§rkt werden. Ein gesicherter, unmittelbarer Einstieg in das Erwerbsleben gelingt im westlichen Niedersachsen den allerwenigsten. Die Phase des Berufseinstiegs dehnt sich immer weiter aus; sie wird zunehmend variantenreicher und sie ist h√§ufig gekennzeichnet von wechselnden √úbergangsformen wie Aushilfsjobs, befristeter Teilzeit- und wenig anspruchsvoller Arbeit, Arbeitslosigkeit und Weiterbildung/Zweitstudium. Diese h√ºrdenreichen, gelegentlich turbulenten und mit vielen Entt√§uschungen verbundenen √úberg√§nge sind verantwortlich daf√ºr, da√ü der Status des Berufseinsteigers und -anf√§ngers bei vielen relativ lange anh√§lt. In seltsam abgehobenem Kontrast dazu vollzieht sich derzeit √ºbrigens die Diskussion um zu lange Studienzeiten.Im Zuge des √úbergangs ist auch eine verst√§rkte Hinwendung zu Formen der ‚Äúneuen‚Äú Selbst√§ndigkeit und zur sog. Schattenwirtschaft beobachtbar.Ein Hauptschwerpunkt der vorliegenden Analysen liegt in der Pr√ºfung der Frage, inwieweit Formen der beruflichen Flexibilit√§ts- und r√§umlichen Mobilit√§tsbereitschaft beim √úbergang in das Erwerbsleben wirksam sind. Beim Wechsel vom Status des Studenten in den des Absolventen nimmt generell die Bereitschaft im Hinblick auf diese Handlungsorientierungen ab. Rein gr√∂√üenordnungsm√§√üig √ºberwiegen die (mittleren) Kategorien der bedingt Flexiblen bzw. r√§umlich Mobilen, jeweils flankiert von geringer besetzten Auspr√§gungen der sehr Flexiblen/sehr Mobilen auf der einen und den Unflexiblen/Immobilen auf der anderen Seite. Im Detail sind keine Korrelationen zwischen den einzelnen Auspr√§gungen der beiden Variablenkomplexe nachweisbar, sondern sie bilden mehrdimensionale, clusterartige Typen.Mit Hilfe verschiedener kontingenz- und clusteranalytischer Verfahren wird schlie√ülich statistisch belegt, da√ü die Einzelauspr√§gungen zur beruflichen Flexibilit√§t und regionalen Mobilit√§t in keinem linearen Zusammenhang zueinander stehen. Sie korrelieren mit wichtigen Variablen in unterschiedlicher Weise, bilden unterschiedliche Cluster und entstammen verschiedenen inhaltlichen Zusammenh√§ngen. Deshalb sollte jede Untersuchung auf eine methodisch getrennte Erfassung dieser beiden Inhaltsbereiche bedacht sein.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract. </jats:bold> Although auditors often determine an upper bound on the amount of error in individual accounts, their primary concern is with the overall amount of error over several accounts. This paper presents a combined bound procedure for determining such an overall upper bound when using the moment method of monetary unit sampling (MUS). A procedure is also presented for determining optimal sample sizes over several independent accounts. The new combined bound procedure provides the moment method of MUS with the same type of flexibility that is currently available for the Stringer method of MUS. In addition, the new sample size planning procedure provides the combined moment bound with added flexibility and options that are not available when using a combined Stringer bound approach. The effectiveness and efficiency of both procedures has been investigated using 4324 separate simulation studies. The results indicate that the combined upper confidence bounds of the moment method are significantly smaller than those provided by the most attractive Stringer‚Äêbased combined bound method. Further, the sample size planning procedure can be an effective audit tool.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>R√©sum√©. </jats:bold> Bien que les v√©rificateurs fixent souvent la limite sup√©rieure du taux d'erreur acceptable pour des comptes particuliers, leur pr√©occupation premi√®re touche le taux global d'erreur pour un ensemble de comptes. L'auteur propose un proc√©d√© permettant d'√©tablir une limite combin√©e visant la d√©termination de cette forme de limite sup√©rieure globale gr√¢ce √† l'utilisation de la m√©thode des moments appliqu√©e √† l'√©chantillonnage en unit√©s mon√©taires. Il propose √©galement un proc√©d√© visant la d√©termination d'√©chantillons de taille optimale pour un ensemble de comptes ind√©pendants. Le nouveau proc√©d√© de limite combin√©e fait appel √† la m√©thode des moments d'√©chantillonnage en unit√©s mon√©taires avec le m√™me type de souplesse que l'on peut actuellement obtenir en utili sant la m√©thode de Stringer. De plus, le nouveau proc√©d√© de planification de la taille de l'√©chantillon livre une limite combin√©e r√©sultant de l'application de la m√©thode des moments en m√™me temps qu'il offre une souplesse plus grande et des possibilit√©s que n'offre pas la m√©thode de Stringer. L'efficacit√© et l'efficience des deux proc√©d√©s sont analys√©es √† l'aide de 4324 √©tudes de simulation distinctes. Les r√©sultats indiquent que les limites de confiance sup√©rieures combin√©es obtenues par la m√©thode des moments sont beaucoup plus faibles que celles que l'on obtient par l'application de la m√©thode de la limite combin√©e, plus attrayante, bas√©e sur la m√©thode de Stringer. De plus, le proc√©d√© de planification de la taille de l'√©chantillon peut √™tre un instrument de v√©rification efficace.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1984, we interviewed 105 Belgian families with a Cystic Fibrosis (CF) child in order to assess the impact of the birth of their CF‚Äêchild on subsequent family planning and to evaluate their attitudes towards prenatal diagnosis. Three years later, in 1987, they received a mailed questionnaire for an updating of the reproduction data and to assess their knowledge and intentions with regard to the new possibilities of DNA diagnosis. The birth of a CF‚Äêchild had a major impact upon subsequent family planning. This effect was found both in the reproductive plans reported by the parents and in the occurrence of pregnancies during the follow‚Äêup interval. This effect can be attributed mostly to the recurrence risk and consists of postponing pregnancies as well as of deciding against further offspring. If the CF‚Äêchild was the firstborn, the chance of having another child was greater than if there was already a healthy child before the birth of the CF‚Äêchild. Nevertheless, only 47% of the families in which the CF‚Äêchild was the firstborn, and who could be followed for an average period of 7 years, had another pregnancy. A large majority of families intended to use prenatal diagnosis should a pregnancy occur. In half of the pregnancies that occurred between 1984 and 1987, a prenatal diagnosis was performed. On the other hand, there is less consensus about pregnancy interruption should prenatal diagnosis reveal an affected fetus. In both 1984 and in 1987, more than half of the parents thought they would decide to have an interruption, but it is worth noting that a considerable proportion of interviewees could not make up their mind or were against it. It is also striking that one‚Äêthird of the group held a different opinion in 1984 as compared to 1987.</jats:p>",

It argues that a complete consideration of this language-policy issue needs to include both bilingual-education legislation and the widespread concern for English usage; that English-only goals need to be contrasted with other language-planning goals; and that both the underlying orientations and the future implementation of English-only policies properly belong in the arena of debate.</jats:p>",
