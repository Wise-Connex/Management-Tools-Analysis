This represents an increase since 1940, of 1,667,000 or about 51 per cent. The Pacific Gas and Electric system peak in 1940 was 1,125,000 kw. In December, 1948, it was 2,050,000 kw under daylight-saving time. Standard time would have added 160,000 kw. If the current trends continue, it is estimated the peak in 1951 will be 2,633,000 kw. Planning the required steam-generating capacity to carry its proper share of this unprecedented load growth is discussed in this paper.</jats:p>",
