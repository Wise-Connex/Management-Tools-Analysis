I have no wish to emulate such a performance, but perhaps I can spend some preliminary minutes in establishing what it is I am going to talk about. The more one reads and listens the more apparent it becomes that the word ‘planning’ means all things to all men—from planning next year's summer holiday to planning the American space programme. In all cases, though, there are common features. There is a goal to be achieved. The achievement of that goal is generally subject to a certain number of constraints, or limiting factors, such as the amount of time available or a limit on the financial budget. In most cases, also, there are several ways of achieving the goal and these have to be evaluated in terms of respective advantages and disadvantages, taking into account the known constraints, and one of them selected as the optimum solution. If this is then adopted as the plan, it has to be put into action, and of course the more complex the plan the longer the period of its implementation and, during that period, fresh constraints may arise, conditions may change and continuous modifications have to be made to the original statement of intent to adapt it to changing circumstances.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper advances two propositions. The first is: It is important to know why one wishes to plan in a particular instance. Sometimes it is better not to intervene; and at other times it may be preferable to resort to other mechanisms of public intervention than planning, such as licensure, public utility status, and pricing schemes. </jats:p><jats:p> The second proposition is advanced more tentatively at this time: Schools should concentrate on teaching the techniques of planning. True, techniques are not all-important in planning. However, one can learn the limitations of techniques and the relative worth of value judgments from a critique of past planning efforts. This is the second part of a course in the Foundations of Health Planning, or the third if the bases for planning are taken as the first. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper is based on a presentation given to the Seminar on Planning at The Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore on October 15, 1970. Much of the author's inquiry into health planning was supported by U.S. Public Health Service Grant Number HS00363, Research Program in the Economics of Health, from the National Center for Health Services Research and Development, which terminated on September 30, 1970. </jats:p>",

Brief case studies of styles of planning for health services in the United States, Sweden, and Great Britain are presented in this paper. It is contended that since there are very few scientifically verified criteria regarding adequacy of personnel and facilities, proper volume of use of services, and how much health services should cost, conscious planning becomes at best arbitrary. Types of personnel and facilities are quite uniform in all countries determined by technologic imperatives. There are, however, differences in health services organization and systems, sources and amounts of funding, ratio of personnel and facilities to population, and use of services. It is, therefore, suggested that varying organizations, structures, and use result from differing social and political contexts, both historical and current. The health services of each country are a reflection of their problem-solving styles. The open-ended nature of health services precludes a standardized health services system from country to country, analogous to airports. </jats:p>",

Our advanced science and technology have not taken root on a broad basis in the health field. Yet categorical planning has been done in several fields of health ever since the enactment of the Social Security Act in 1935. Planning was initiated in the fields of maternal and child health and crippled children by the federal Children's Bureau. </jats:p><jats:p> This article gives some examples of both categorical and general approaches to health planning, how they came into being, and what planning concepts and processes were developed and used. These examples may be of some value to planners who have to employ categorical approaches—largely pragmatic—pending the time that comprehensive national health planning becomes feasible. </jats:p><jats:p> The categorical areas chosen for discussion are: (a) health facilities, (b) heart, cancer, stroke, and kidney disease (Regional Medical Programs), (c) mental health, and (d) American Indian health. The general area includes comprehensive health planning. </jats:p><jats:p> Following the passage of the Social Security Act of 1935, personal and environmental health services have been fragmented into a number of pieces. In 1971, utter confusion reigns in the federal and state structure and functions of health. Hopefully, the Congress may soon realize that a national system of health services is essential to provide 205 million people with the quality and distribution of services—without financial barriers—that $70 billion dollars a year should buy. Certainly the experiences gained with the categorical approaches to health planning can be of value to governmental leaders and their advisers as they prepare comprehensive health policies and national health plans for the 1970s. </jats:p>",

Previous research has demonstrated that the differential found between the two religions could not be attributed to differences in the Hindu and Muslim ideologies. The practice of Purdah among the Muslims is suggested as a factor which contributes toward Hindu-Muslim differences. Such social and demographic factors as socioeconomic status (husband’s occupation, education, and landholding), age, age at mar1:1-a_ge, and education of women, total llvmg children, and cooperative membership were considered as other possible reasons for the differential. It was found that even when these social and demographic factors were controlled the Muslim-Hindu differential was relatively constant.

If we are to survive, this will have to be drastically changed by the year 2000. To achieve this, we need to begin to change our thinking, today. We badly need wider social planning, giving us more alternatives‐more thought on where we are going. Reasonableness requires blending of planning and construction‐but a sharp line of independence is essential. We must think about all the consequences of a particular act. Through intensive professional development and achievement of professional expertise, many outstanding technicians often move into vital decision making positions within their respective agencies. As planners, they see a part of the action but miss the big picture. Problem solutions become restricted to agency or individual authorities and are not always the best alternative. Thus, the planning field is overflowing with solutions to our every problem but many solutions offer spot control, and while the black spot is removed from the garment the white spot remaining from the solution offers little consolation to the wearer.</jats:p>",
