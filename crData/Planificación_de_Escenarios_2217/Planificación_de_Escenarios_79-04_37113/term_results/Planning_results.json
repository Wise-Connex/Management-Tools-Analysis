It is a central, essential function of management, because a manager must lay out some pattern of action in order to direct effectively the functioning of the organization. While managers plan, by habit and by instinct, the functioning of large modern organizations requires that plans be shared, so that groups of managers act in coordinated patterns toward accomplishment of agreed objectives. Thus, planning has become an organizational process in addition to the individual process of each manager.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper discusses a rational basis for urban decisionmaking including the role of individual freedom of choice. It identifies the differing objectives of the various parties involved (the individual, the community, and the authority) and the resulting different choices of those parties. If the problem is specified in such a way that the authority is indifferent to the options offered, the objectives of the remaining parties, the individuals and the community, are more closely aligned and conflicts in choices between the parties are reduced. Subject to this condition of the indifference of the authority, contours of equal cost to the community are identified in the decision-parameter space. A two-level decision process is then feasible, in which choices between points along a contour, that is, between options of equal community cost, may be offered to individuals acting independently, but decisions to move between contours, that is, to change community cost, must be made by the community as a whole. Decisions made at the individual level also provide feedback for use at the community level. </jats:p><jats:p> It is recognized that in this decision process the individual decisionmakers are not a homogeneous group, and the effects of this diversity on perceived utility values and on choices is also examined. This diversity must in fact be matched by diversity in the solutions supplied, if the needs of all individuals are to be met. </jats:p><jats:p> The mechanism for matching diverse supply to diverse demand is freedom of choice. The losses incurred when this freedom is restricted, for example, by restricting diversity, are formulated. </jats:p><jats:p> Community objectives may be blurred by the diversity of individual preferences, by the inability to define or measure these preferences, and by the facts that they are many, that they interact, and that the weightings on them are not known. A technique which seeks the perceived optimal plan in the light of these blurred objectives is presented. </jats:p><jats:p> All these various concepts are considered in relationship to public participation in planning. </jats:p>",

SoCal Gas, like other major gas distribution utilities, has undergone a dramatic change during the past decade. Since the late 1960's the supply of gas nationwide has not been sufficient to meet the demand for this premium fuel. This fact has caused a redirection by many of the nation's gas companies, including SoCal Gas, to concentrate more effort in obtaining new supplies of gaseous fuels. These include natural gas from traditional sources; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and synthetic natural gas (SNG) from coal, tar sands, solid waste, liquid waste, biomass, and liquid petroleum feedstocks.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The excellent potential for nonconventional gas supplies' providing a significant amount of energy in the future has opened up a new frontier for engineers in the energy field. At SoCal Gas, we actively participate in or monitor other companies' efforts in participate in or monitor other companies' efforts in virtually all areas of the gaseous energy field. This activity complements the many other more traditional opportunities available for petroleum engineers interested in a utility career or a career in utility-related gas supply activities. My company currently has petroleum engineers working as gas storage reservoir engineers, engineers working on gas exploration and development programs, staff engineers working in supply planning and forecasting functions, and as transmission and distribution pipeline engineers.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>It's a pleasant change for me to be speaking with you today. Many times, in recent years, I've had to speak to groups who were not particularly friendly-about subjects that were sometimes dull and occasionally controversial. But today I'm talking to engineer about jobs in the utility business. For me, that's a pleasure because I'm a graduate engineer and have built my career in the gas utility business. I don't expect to be controversial today because the only news I'm going to give you will be good news—about interesting jobs in an interesting business.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>A CHANGING INDUSTRY</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>As you might expect, the gas business, like other present-day industries, has undergone great changes present-day industries, has undergone great changes during its development. The company I'm associated with, Southern California Gas Company, is no exception. For example, in more than a century of operation, we've come the full circle in our search for fuel supplies. In the late 1800's we went as far as Australia to obtain coal for gas production. In the early 1900's we depended on energy from gas and oil fields that were closer to home, sometimes right in our own back yards. Now we're back on a worldwide search for future gas supplies, and one of those sources will be gas again produced from coal.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Let me give you some further insight into how the gas business has been changing. During the period before World War II, the gas distribution companies in the United States, and California in particular, relied on local production for their supply of gas, either through manufacturing from coal or oil or through development of nearby fields. That arrangement worked well until demand for natural gas began to outstrip the production of local supplies.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>By the late 1940's many gas distribution companies, including Southern California Gas Company, were unable to meet the rising demand from local sources. As a consequence, they began to look farther afield for gas supplies. It was during that period that gas from large fields discovered in various regions of the U.S., particularly in the Southwest, was sold in interstate markets. For the most part, this gas was found in conjunction with oil, or as a result of exploring for oil.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Since many of those new gas sources were distant from urban markets where the gas would be sold, a transportation system had to be constructed, ushering in the development of interstate gas transmission companies. It became the purpose of these interstate transmission companies to buy the gas from the producer, transport, and resell it to individual producer, transport, and resell it to individual distribution utilities, some up to 1000 miles away. The distribution companies then sold the product to the end user.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<p>The depression burst upon the nation in the summer of 1929 and did not subside for a decade. Unemployment was computed officially at 8.7 percent in 1930, 15.9 percent in 1931, and 23.6 percent in 1932. It did not dip below 20 percent until 1936, and it would not go below 5 percent until 1942. As the figures demonstrate, the appearance of FDR in the White House, whatever it did for the nation’s “spirit,” did not solve the problem of unemployment. FDR’s first attempt at a cure for the country’s economic ills was the same as Hoover’s—balancing the budget—and similarly unsuccessful. Balancing the budget by reducing spending was the exact opposite of what J. M. Keynes, the English economist, had prescribed for the depressed economy. Keynes argued that in a depression public spending had to be increased, not decreased, to put people back to work. The nature of their jobs was not as important as the salaries they earned. It was their paychecks that would start the economy going again as they used them to buy goods and services, pumping money into the depressed economy. As Keynes himself put it: . . . If the Treasury were to fill old bottles with banknotes, bury them at suitable depths in disused coal-mines which are then filled up to the surface with town rubbish, and leave it to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again . . . there need be no more unemployment and, with the help of the repercussions, the real income of the community, and its capital wealth also, would probably become a good deal greater than it actually is. . . . What Keynesian logic could not accomplish, the German and Japanese threat to the “free world” and its “free economy” could. “In the Second World War the equivalent of the . . . buried bottles full of money were the tanks, the bombers, and the aircraft carriers.” They did the job, as Keynes had predicted. In the course of the war, the nation spent itself out of the depression.</p>",

The discussion, that regards this part, will be necessarily summarized, because a complete and detailed presentation of these subjects appeared recently in literature. In this occasion, anyway, it is worthwhile to recapitulate at least the main concepts, concerning:the methods, that allow accurate prediction and evaluation of the overburden, pore pressure and fracture gradients from the analysis and elaboration of seismic data, drilling parameter sand electrical logs;the criteria of application of this information to well planning, in particular for what adequate and justifiable selection of casing points, casing design, fracture jobs, mud and cement technologies etc., is concerned.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>In the second section, the paper describes in detail the field results of three particularly significative and among the deepest wells drilled by AGIP in the Po Valley.

The main deposition is formed by clastic sediments from Oligocene to Quaternary, originated by the erosion of ancient and recent relieves.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Health Systems Agencies (HSAs), the new regional health planning agencies established by the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974, have as their major goals quality, accessibility, continuity and cost containment. One of the tools for cost containment available to HSAs is their active participation in the statewide certificate-of-need (CON) program. To help anticipate how HSAs may play their CON roles, this article reviews the CON decisionmaking processes of two Comprehensive Health Planning (CHP) agencies, the predecessors of HSAs. While most CHPs lacked specific health plans and powers, the two California agencies examined have had both regional plans and roles in CON programs comparable to the present HSAs'.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our focus is on the decisionmaking process rather than the effectiveness of CON programs. A simple descriptive model is developed based on the assumptions that the planners seek satisfactory, rather than optimal solutions and that the data available to them are extremely limited. The cases analyzed suggest that, while most projects exceed the bed need standards, institutions were almost always able to demonstrate a need through various special circumstances. Once a need has been shown, the agency was able to deny an application only if a better alternative were available.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This study suggests two approaches to improving regional health planning decisionmaking. First, identified needs can be better met either by increasing the agency's ability to generate alternatives or by encouraging health facilities to submit competing applications. Second, a regional health care budget would force the agency to make choices among competing needs.</jats:p>",

It may be especially important to be able to isolate key variables which can be consolidated into a few indices of environmental conditions as they are related to health. Such indices might be used to identifying associations among groups of variables, such as specific geographic area. The indices may also provide insights into environmental health relationships which are worthy of further epidemiological investigation. Canonical correlation analysis is a multivariate statistical technique which provides a means of identifying associations among groups of variables, such as health and environmental measures. The technique can produce weighted indices of environmental conditions as they are related to health within a city or region. This paper describes what canonical correlation is, and outlines how it might be used for these purposes. An illustrative application based on data collected for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is also presented. </jats:p>",

A regional-scale land-use–transport model is developed which may be used for the analysis of decentralization options. The model searches for regional-development configurations that minimize the combined costs of providing urban infrastructure and of intercity transport. The objective function is a nonlinear function of the regional activity distribution, and a sequential search procedure is used to identify the least-cost alternative. The capabilities of this allocation-simulation model are demonstrated by several example analyses for the Delhi commuter region. </jats:p>",

None of the possible modifications wholly satisfies theoretical requirements in terms of the doubly constrained model, and the advantages and limitations of various approaches can only be assessed in an operational situation. For this reason some of the findings from a study of the Amersfoort region are presented which help to throw light on this problem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the use of 1971 journey-to-work census data for London, the spatial distributions of home and workplace locations at different distances from the city centre were analysed for the main modes of transport. The relationships among the fundamental quantities such as density, trip length, modal split, and level of car ownership were also investigated. These analyses were compared with those of corresponding 1966 data. The comparisons show that although the home density in 1971 within the first 2 km from the city centre decreased by approximately 21%, while the workplace density decreased only by approximately 4%, the actual number of workplaces within this range of distance fell by about 2·5 times that of the homes. The overall decrease in homes and workplaces resulted in a 9% drop in the total number of internal trips for London as a whole. Resolving these trips by modes of transport shows that rail, bus, and walk trips had decreased while car trips had increased. As a result, the most common mode of transport to work switched from bus in 1966 to car in 1971. This also contributed to the overall increase in the average trip length in 1971. The analysis on the level of car ownership for 1971 shows that more than 50% of the households located more than 12 km from the city centre had at least one car. On average, the number of cars per household in 1971 was approximately 0·64. </jats:p>",

The study began with the derivation, from published experimental results, of functions relating ultimate crop yield to the magnitude and timing of water deficits, i.e., of the productivity of irrigation water. To obtain the net benefit of the project, the relation between the harvested area and output and the on‐farm production costs was then suggested. The cost of supplying the irrigation water to the proposed area and of distributing and applying it to the field was determined, thus completing the Benefit‐Cost equation. A computer simulation model was then established to search for the irrigation project design capacity and area to maximize the net present value in the Benefit‐Cost analysis for the development proposed.</jats:p>",

The evidence indicates that increases in the minimum wage over the period 1947–1976 have had a significant impact on employment patterns. Minimum-wage legislation has had the effect of decreasing the share of projected employment and increasing vulnerability to cyclical changes in employment for the group of workers most marginal to the work force—low-wage employees. </jats:p>",

The evaluation focused on a system of integrated models developed at the University of Washington which simulate processes and activities within the forest ecosystem. A major part of the system is a hydrologic model which predicts changes in discharge, stream temperature, and concentrations of suspended sediment and dissolved oxygen based on information generated by other models representing intensive management practices. The evaluation consisted of applying the system to a 72,000 acre tract of forest land, validating the models with two years of discharge and water quality data from a 93,000 acre watershed, and determining the pertinence of hydrologic modeling for management purposes. Results show several potential uses of hydrologic modeling for forest management planning, especially for analyzing the effects of timber harvesting strategies on water quality.</jats:p>",

The comprehensive rural watershed land and water use plan developed by this procedure is inexpensive in time and money, understandable by the layman, and scientificially sound. It is based on presently available information. This water resource planning procedure has been demonstrated in several town planning projects.
