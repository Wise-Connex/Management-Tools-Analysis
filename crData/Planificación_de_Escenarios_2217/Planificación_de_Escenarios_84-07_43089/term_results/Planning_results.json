The illustration may be more of a managerial exercise than a true real world application, but illustrates the potential of this type of analysis. In fact, in smaller business organisations, on‐going practical planning using MRP could very well be accomplished using these techniques.</jats:p>",

Baylis's contribution is of great importance to the historiography of wartime and post-war British foreign and security policy, filling a void in our knowledge of these crucial years. However, we would like to make some critical comments on his treatment of the Post-Hostilities Planning Staff report ‘Security in Western Europe and the North Atlantic’, which is such a central feature in his contribution. According to Baylis this particular study by the PHPS (an interdepartmental study group created by the British War Cabinet) laid down ‘a reasonably coherent set of attitudes’ regarding post-war European co-operation. The PHPS, collecting together much of the current thinking in both Foreign Office and military circles, advocated the formation of a Western European-Group as a kind of insurance against a rearmed Germany ors if the world organization failed to materialize, against a potentially hostile USSR. The report marked the formation of a ‘consensus’ among Foreign Office and military officials involved in post-war planning.</jats:p>",

There was a relatively high level of contraceptive awareness, but the overall practice of modern contraception in both rural and urban areas is low. Despite the rural–urban differences in socioeconomic levels, awareness of family planning is only slightly higher among the urban respondents. The level of usage for the urban respondents is slightly higher than for the rural respondents.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the author develops and tests a model of regional responses to national business-cycles. The model divides cyclical decline in each state into two sectors: a basic sector and a nonbasic sector. The industrial mix, capital—labor ratio, age of capital stock, level of unemployment insurance benefits, labor shortage, and extent of labor-force unionization of a state are hypothesized to influence the response to national recessions by the economy of a state. Employment decline in the nonbasic sector of the economy of a state is a function of employment decline in basic industries and is transmitted through a short-run multiplier. </jats:p><jats:p> The model is tested on data from five post World War 2 recessions between 1950 and 1975. The findings indicate that industry mix at the two-digit Standard Industrial Code level explains 36% of the across-state variation in cyclical employment. The results also indicate that an old capital-stock, a nonunion labor force, and generous unemployment insurance benefits promote cyclical stability in state economies. </jats:p>",

Urban forms and their content should be considered as independent of each other. Urban change appears as a dialectical process, whereas the spatial order of a city seems to be a geometrical and topological phenomenon with a logic of its own. Urban forms persist because a city is a self-organizing system. Such systems, analyzed by biologists such as Atlan, are able to absorb random perturbation while conserving their order.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The role of agricultural expansion investment in improving the income redistribution conditions in society has been of considerable concern to planners. In this paper an approach based on distributing the newly developed land to a poorer sector (landless farmers) in society to gain agricultural revenues and improve their income is investigated. A mathematical optimization model is built to determine the distribution of land and a pricing policy established for the new areas in such a way that (1) a specified (by the government) income increase to the farmers can be achieved, (2) a predetermined level of recovery of the expansion cost can be insured, (3) high agricultural efficiency in the new land can be maintained, and (4) redistribution benefits can be maximized. In a case study application of the model, no conflict is found between the economic efficiency and income redistribution cirtieria in agricultural expansion investment within the planning framework presented in the companion paper (Allam and Marks, this issue). For a specified cost recovery condition it is found that the least cost planning alternatives give the opportunity to the largest number of landless farmers to own the new land and receive a specified income increase from the agricultural revenues, but a conflict between government return from the investment and redistribution objectives is found. This conflict is addressed and the trade‐off between the two objectives is illustrated.</jats:p>",

An attempt is then made to trace out the impacts of different forms of corporate change during the period 1978–1982. In the second part of the paper, I concentrate on one large multinational corporation which has long associations with the Bristol area, and trace some of the local impacts of different phases of corporate growth over a longer time period. This paper is only a preliminary to a deeper and more wide-ranging analysis of the local economy, and, in the conclusions, I identify various lines of further inquiry. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agricultural expansion planning in developing countries where there is extensive government involvement in the planning process can be defined in a two‐level hierarchy. At the first level, the role of the agricultural expansion investment in achieving the strategic goals of the sector is to be determined. At the second level, analysis of the agricultural expansion is to be carried out in such a way that the strategic decisions from the first level can be implemented. The focus of this paper is on the analysis of investment scheduling, the major issue of the second level. A mathematical optimization model is built to aid in analyzing the scheduling problems of land development, crop selection, drainage water reuse, and capacity expansion of the irrigation and drainage networks. A minimum cost criterion is used, where costs of land development, farming, irrigation and drainage infrastructures, maintenance and operations, and pump stations are considered. The model has a nonlinear objective function to account for economies of scale and linear and nonlinear constraints. A fixed charge approximation is used for the nonconvex cost functions, and a mixed integer programming algorithm along with an enumeration procedure is used for solving the model. The solution procedure guarantees global optimality for the approximated problem. A hypothetical expansion of 70,000 acres (28,350 ha) based on data from the Nile Delta in Egypt is used as a case study to illustrate the procedure under different conditions of irrigation water quality.</jats:p>",

It focused on mathematical modeling as a means of assessing the broader issue of the nation's ability to analyze and plan courses of action to deal with current and long‐range water problems. OTA found that models capable of analyzing many pressing water resource issues are currently available and that these models have significant potential for increasing the accuracy and effectiveness of information available to managers, decisionmakers and scientists. Surveys and workshops conducted by OTA, however, indicate that institutional constraints to modeling—including inadequate Federal support services for model dissemination, training, and technical assistance, and maintenance—have impeded modeling from realizing its full potential. The states, in particular, are hard pressed to fulfill their present responsibilities without an improved capacity to use the best available analytical tools, which they rely on the federal government, in part, to provide. Many major federal agencies, however, lack an integrated plan for developing and supporting models; in the absence of a comprehensive strategy, federal agencies are often unresponsive to both state and federal problem‐solving needs.</jats:p>",
