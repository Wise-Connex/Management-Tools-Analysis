The operation of the platforms is governed by reservoir engeering, operational and production policy considerations. This paper describes the production/injection control system as incorporated into a volatile oil reservoir simulator for use as a field management tool.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Production and injection operations are controlled at three levels in an offshore oilfield: At the individual well level in which rates, well inflow performance, pressure constraints and well bore hydraulics play a role.At the platform level in which well rates have to be controlled within available capacities (oil/gas/water production, gas/water injection).At the field level in which total fluid production from the field is governed by pipeline/tanker capacity, allowing shortfall to be taken up by platforms operating with spare capacity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To meet gas sales contracts and/or flaring constraints use is made of gas wells operating in a dual injection and production role (\"gas-control wells\").</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Such gas-control wells enable surplus gas production to be reinjected or alternatively gas to be produced to meet a gas sales contract.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper further describes the possibilities of the well management package to implement a policy of voidage replacement or pressure maintenance in distinct reservoir partitions (zones). Pressure maintenance is defined as maintaining the hydrocarbon pore volume averaged pressure at datum. Such strategies interact with the total available injection capacity of the platforms and/or the distribution of capacity usage over the platforms.</jats:p>",

Recently, however, the general plan has been the object of much criticism in view of its evident failure to guide urbanisation and urban development in the required manner. One basic reason for this is the dislocation between physical and economic planning, and this in turn derives from several features of the Soviet planning system, including the priority which is given to economic planning, the different agencies responsible for the two types of planning, and the different time-spans and control mechanisms employed. Policy has recently concentrated on the need to ensure co-ordination in urban development and to develop comprehensive planning for cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the authors present results of a series of experiments in which the inputâ€”output structure of the State of Washington (as reflected in 1972 survey-based inputâ€”output tables) is approximated from similar data for the nation (as given in the 1967 survey-based US tables). Variants of two kinds of nonsurvey approaches are employed. These are purely-nonsurvey methods (including, for example, adjustments according to simple location quotient measures) and partial-survey techniques (such as the RAS method). Comparisons between nonsurvey results and the Washington data are made on the basis both of regional coefficient matrices and of their Leontief inverses. Comparisons are also made with the results of several other studies that have utilized similar nonsurvey approaches. Certain procedures appear promising, especially when used in combination with survey estimates of regional value added and/or exports. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A three-dimensional conceptual model of residential mobility for owner-occupiers is proposed using the methods of facet theory (after Guttman). Three conceptual dimensions (facets) of buyers' reasons for moving are defined, based on the contribution of job-related motives, family-related motives and housing values. The conceptual model is tested by a multivariate statistical analysis (smallest space analysis) of a national sample of 1052 house purchasers. Facet theory permits the formulation of hypotheses about partitions in an n-dimensional space divided into clearly defined regions such that the model can literally be reconstructed in that space. Thus empirically verified, the model can be used to generate a typology of fourteen distinct mover types, and profiles are presented of their search behaviour and housing outcomes. The methods and findings are discussed in terms of their contribution to and extension of a behavioural approach to residential mobility. </jats:p>",

In particular, an integrated framework is developed which enables heterogeneity and nonstationarity to be explicitly included in stochastic models of binary choice behaviour. The emphasis is upon minimum assumptions about the nature and determinants of heterogeneity and nonstationarity, as any uncontrolled variations may result in the identification of spurious adaptive behaviour. Moreover, all the models are readily calibrated and tested using widely available computer software. Some assessment is made of the flexibility of the modelling framework with respect to its potential for handling attrition in panel membership, more extensive choice sets, and exogeneous variables. </jats:p>",
