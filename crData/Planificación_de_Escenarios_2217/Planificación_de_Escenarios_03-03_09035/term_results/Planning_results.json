After identifying a series of gaps in the radical planning literature, the article uses a longitudinal study (1994-2001) of collective action in an urban settlement in Indonesia as a heuristic device to develop a more nuanced model of radical planning. The study illustrates how cumulative participation in state-directed planning, community-based planning, and covert planning over time resulted in a sense of collective agency that served as a foundation for demanding political reform at a moment when state control was weakened. </jats:p>",

Data are drawn primarily from the 1997 and 1999 Delivery of Improved Services for Health (DISH) evaluation surveys, which collected information from representative samples of women and men of reproductive age in the districts served by the DISH project. Additional time‐trend analyses rely on data from the 1995 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey. Logistic regressions are used to assess the associations between BCC exposure and family planning attitudes and practices, controlling for individuals' background characteristics. To minimize the biases of self‐reported exposure, the analyses also explore cluster‐level indexes of the penetration of BCC messages in the community. Results indicate that exposure to BCC messages was associated with increased contraceptive use and intention to use. Some evidence of self‐reported bias is found, and the pathways to fertility‐related behavioral change appear different for women and men.</jats:p>",

In so doing I draw on the concept of agonism and introduce the political into Habermas' moral theorization. Where the personal and the political intersect there is a role for psychology. I illustrate how Habermas' communicative theorizing was itself partly developed from a psychoanalytical tradition before introducing some of the concepts popularized by Jacques Lacan. I conclude that development of communicative planning theory could usefully retain some of Habermas' psychological foundations while turning to the work of Lacan as a basis for an enhanced understanding of the realities of planning practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Data from a cohort study of 7,336 newly married fertile couples conducted between 1987 and 1995 were used to analyze contraceptive method choice, switching, and discontinuation in two districts of Shanghai. Twelve percent of couples reported that they had had sexual intercourse before marriage. Only one‐third of those exposed to premarital risk of conception were protected by some form of contraception, mostly by withdrawal and periodic abstinence. As a consequence, a majority of these couples conceived, prompting rapid marriage in most cases and induced abortion among one‐fourth of them. After marriage, about half of the couples used contraceptives to postpone the birth of their first child, but of these, 40 percent experienced an unintended pregnancy. Method choice was dominated by condoms, withdrawal, and abstinence. After the birth of their first child, almost all couples (98 percent) adopted contraceptives, but one‐third of them used ineffective methods. Failure and discontinuation rates were high, giving rise to a high incidence of induced abortion. Increasing numbers of couples switched to the IUD, and this was the preferred method for the majority by the third year following childbirth. These results suggest that wider method choice that includes hormonal contraceptives should be provided to meet couples' needs in Shanghai and that the family planning program's attention should be focused specifically on sexually active unmarried individuals and on the availability of postpartum services.</jats:p>",

Stressing two important conditions with respect to the conception and institutionalization of participatory processes, the paper examines the policy's failure in its participatory agenda, whereby contrary to its participatory rhetoric, communities and other actors have not established a positive or synergistic relationship, but rather one best defined by a zero-sum perspective: the private sector interests have hijacked the participatory discourse, and communities' interests have been marginalized. </jats:p>",

In particular, the links between poverty and women's educational status and the use of maternal health‐care services are investigated. The survey findings demonstrate a significant decline in the use of maternal health‐care services in Tajikistan since the country gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. They show changes in the location of delivery and the person providing assistance, with a clear shift away from giving birth in a medical facility toward giving birth at home. More than two‐fifths of all women who gave birth in the year prior to the survey delivered their baby at home. Women from the poorest quintile are three times more likely than women from the richest quintile to undergo a home delivery without a trained assistant.</jats:p>",

Adolescents' views about desirable qualities in a spouse as well as more direct indicators of gender‐role attitudes are examined, including opinions about whether wives should defer to their husbands, share in household decision making, and have the responsibility for performing domestic tasks. The findings regarding spousal characteristics reflect strong gender differentiation. Girls and boys provide divergent profiles of an ideal spouse, profiles that reflect traditional gender roles. Girls are significantly less likely than boys to favor educational inequality between spouses, however. Neither boys nor girls have egalitarian gender‐role attitudes, although girls are significantly more likely to express less traditional attitudes. Multivariate analyses indicate that girls' and boys' attitudes do not vary consistently and significantly by socioeconomic background; in particular, increased schooling does not always promote egalitarian attitudes. The implications of these findings are discussed.</jats:p>",

GIS offers a solution to this problem by providing analysis and visualization capabilities.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>A geographic information system (GIS) is useful in responding to oil spills because it can integrate a large amount of marine, coastal, and oil production/transportation data. The key to making use of the GIS is collecting and maintaining critical data, such as wind speed, wind direction, ocean current direction, density, and pH in data bases, so that it is available in case of a spill. Once spill has occurred; these pre-existing data-bases are queried, and the vector maps are analyzed to see what the major concerns are.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper envisages our model for an offshore field along the east coast of India. Using GeoMedia Professional for analysis in this fragile environment with unpredictable climatic conditions, we process available data - physical parameters and chemical parameters - to predict the extent and location of a spread.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This methodology in general may be useful to predict oil spill movement of any coastal region. This capability enables us to prepare for oil spills and respond more quickly, thereby minimizing the damage to the environment. Thus GIS can be used as an excellent decision-support tool for contingency planning, risk assessment, and remedial operations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction:</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Protecting the environment while producing, transporting, refining and marketing fuel is a challenge the petroleum industry must meet every day. For all of the benefits oil has brought to modern society, risk is inherent in taking it from the Earth - in drilling wells, storing fuel for future use and transporting it from place to place.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>We have an obligation to protect nature from accidental oil spills from our operations that can damage an ecosystem. The petroleum industry is working closely with government agencies, universities and research centers to reduce the frequency and impact of oil spills.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Oil spills can cause serious threats in marine environments as well as result in significant environmental damages in highly sensitive areas. Severity of impact of an oil spill depends on variety of factors, including characteristics of oil itself. Even large spills of refined petroleum products such as gasoline evaporate quickly and cause only short-term environmental effects. On the other hand heavy crude's and water in oil mixtures may cause widespread and long lasting physical contamination of shorelines. But, the overall effects of this oil spills can be reduced through proper pre-spill planning.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It organizes the literature into six groups according to the type of benefit being measured, namely, output; productivity; production costs; income, property values, employment, and real wages; rate of return; and noncommercial travel time. The central question addressed by the papers reviewed is whether public investments in transportation yield long-term economic benefits. While the different studies arrive at different numerical answers, most of them do indicate a positive and statistically significant relationship between such investments and economic benefit measures. Transportation planners engaged in the effort to win funding for the best of competing projects would gain by an awareness of that economic benefit literature and by applying the methods to measuring benefits of their projects. </jats:p>",

During the same period, the TFR in the capital city of Addis Ababa declined from 3.1 to 1.9 children per woman. Even more striking than the magnitude of this decline is that it occurred in the absence of a strong and effective national family planning program. In this study, the components of this fertility decline are identified using the Bongaarts framework of the proximate determinants of fertility. The results of a decomposition analysis indicate that a decrease in the age‐specific proportions of women who are married, followed by an increase in contraceptive use are the most important mechanisms by which fertility has declined in Addis Ababa. Poor employment prospects and relatively high housing costs are likely factors that encourage couples to delay marriage and reduce marital fertility.</jats:p>",

While the health education literature does include descriptions of efforts to diffuse research, programs, curricula, and workplace policies and examples of instruments for measuring aspects of the diffusion process, it does not include an overview of program diffusion principles and practices. The purpose of this article is to provide program planners with research and practice based insights into the program diffusion process. After identifying and defining key program diffusion terms, discussing diffusion’s theoretical bases, and arguing for more pro-active program replication among health educators, the author discusses program diffusion options (dissemination and/or replication), presents existing criteria for identifying model programs, puts forward typical reasons why program replication fails, and suggests specific strategies for increasing the likelihood of successful program replication. The paper ends with a call to plan programs with replication in mind</jats:p>"

This paper discusses the importance of detailed planning when undertaking a UBO and the consequences when conducted improperly.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>UBO has demonstrated numerous times that:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Higher penetration rates (&amp;gt;2X) can be realized Higher productivity (&amp;gt;2X) can be achieved Higher reserves recovery are achieved</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>UBO has proven to reduce development costs, on multi-well projects. The timing for this cost reduction depends largely upon:</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>the well construction staff in charge of the operation the rate of knowledge transfer from the experienced personnel (service technicians) to the operator the utilization of the information by the operator.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The current knowledge base of UBO is miniscule compared to conventional Overbalance Operation (OBO) knowledge. Access to this knowledge base and implementing the value of the knowledge are critical to expansion of the technology and the establishment of credible operating practices. Global industry organizations such as the International Association of Drilling Contractors (IADC), Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), and Gas Technology Institute (GTI) have dedicated significant time and resources to promote the exchange of knowledge and develop safe operating practices of UBO. These organizations should be accessed to reduce the learning time for companies considering the use of UBO equipment and services.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The critical keys to achieving the benefits of UBO, are planning and execution. Several real case histories are presented, which demonstrate the impact of critical planning and execution on project cost. Accessing the knowledge base and implementing lessons learned will enable the user to achieve a successful UB Operation.</jats:p>",

In a first step, future rehab needs are quantified with a cohort-survival model from the present stock of assets taking into account the specific service lives of its components. Utility managers may choose in the short and medium range from many rehab options: doing more or less, sooner or later, on particular network components and with specific rehab technologies at lower or higher cost. So, in a second step, alternative medium-term rehab programs are specified and tested for their effects. The annual costs and benefits of these alternative rehab programs are forecast with the cohort-survival model beyond the rehab program period to capture the long-term effects of rehabilitating these long-lived assets. Advantages and disadvantages of alternative rehab programs are systematically compared to find out which one is most appropriate under local constraints. However, whereas the survival of network components can be forecast over very long periods with sufficient accuracy, many other characteristics of the water supply system that must be considered for finding the best network rehab strategy may take unforeseeable paths into the far future. Therefore, a scenario writing tool was developed allowing consistent scenarios for particular water utilities to be created and to test whether the alternative rehab programs are robust enough to meet all eventualities of the future. This approach is illustrated by a case study from East Germany.</jats:p>",

The absence of any evident symptoms of a serious crisis possibly goes some way to explaining why there currently appear to be no significant impulses to embark on further steps towards consolidation of the region. Although clear progress has been recorded over recent years in respect of co-operation within the Hamburg metropolitan region, structural limits exist which cannot be overcome.

Drawing on accessibility analyses based on private-car use, the future population potentials of so-called “higher-order centres” have been recalculated in order to gauge the long-term significance of such centres for spatial planning within the state. In the light of current levels of infrastructure endowment and capacity utilisation, the authors are able to proceed to formulating recommendations for a future system of “central places” which strives to mediate between blanket supply and economic viability. The current and anticipated shortcomings thus revealed in respect of accessibility provide important pointers toward the types of supplementary structure-policy measures which the state will need to adopt in the future.</jats:p>"

Spatial forest planning involves mathematical programming techniques to incorporate both commodity and noncommodity goals with spatial aspects into a forest plan. Among the factors that encourage spatial forest planning are regulations and voluntary guidelines on the patterns of harvest units and wildlife habitat, the desirability of using forestland efficiently to meet various goals, and the need to evaluate and schedule activities across multiple ownerships in landscape-level plans. Factors that discourage its adoption include technological, financial, and personnel hurdles, as well as insufficient data with which to inform the models.</jats:p>",

Principles that led to <jats:italic>fatwas </jats:italic>(rulings) in both these theological traditions, together with the main arguments of the debate between the proponents and opponents of family planning in Islam and the Higher Judge's interpretation (Islamic Courts in Jordan) of the position of Islam on family planning, are included. Men's and women's views are summarized, based on the findings of natural group discussions and in‐depth interviews conducted in 1998 with couples and individuals within their social networks in the different contexts in Jordan. Based on a gap analysis between doctrine, policy and people's beliefs, this study shows a need for family planning programmes to address men and women in a culturally sensitive manner: Men shape reproductive decisions. It is therefore argued that if men were more pro‐actively involved in family‐planning awareness campaigns, there might be a transformation of values and perceptions around fertility and family planning. Another conclusion drawn from the findings is that local resources, especially religious men, can be instrumental in promoting political trust in—and a sense of ownership of—family planning programmes in Jordan. Using local resources in advocacy for family planning, based on the cultural context of <jats:italic>Shari’ah</jats:italic>, seems effective in changing the reproductive behaviour of men.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this article is to provide program planners with research and practice based insights into the program diffusion process. After identifying and defining key program diffusion terms, discussing diffusion’s theoretical bases, and arguing for more pro-active program replication among health educators, the author discusses program diffusion options (dissemination and/or replication), presents existing criteria for identifying model programs, puts forward typical reasons why program replication fails, and suggests specific strategies for increasing the likelihood of successful program replication. The paper ends with a call to plan programs with replication in mind.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes fraud risk factors identified by practicing auditors relative to their own clients, and the relationship of those factors to fraud risk assessments and audit planning decisions. When the U.S. Auditing Standards Board (ASB) developed SAS No. 82, a major concern was whether and how to incorporate specific fraud risk factors into the standard. This issue remains important, as the ASB and the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB) continue to examine auditor's responsibilities for fraud detection. This paper contributes to the literature by providing evidence on the prevalence of certain types of fraud risk factors in audit practice and their impact on audit planning. To address these issues, we asked practicing Big 5 auditors to identify specific fraud risk factors of an actual client, assess the client's level of fraud risk, and plan audit tests to address fraud. We find that a high proportion of clients exhibit one or more fraud risk factors, most frequently related to industry/competitive position, management integrity, internal control system quality, financial condition, and pressure to meet financial targets. While fraud risk factors are often documented, fraud risk assessments are not well related to the number of those factors, overall or by individual type. All types of fraud risk factors are statistically associated with some form of audit testing response, but the nature of the audit test planned varies by risk factor type. Results of the study also show that the effect of fraud risk assessments on audit test planning varies according to the nature of the audit test planned.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The sanitary problems promoted by the rapid urbanization process in developing cities are usually resulted from the absence of planning, high population concentration and inadequate water and wastewater infrastructure for low income people. Because the provision and planning of water supply and is a complex task, a modeling approach was used to enhance the understanding of the process and the aspects involved. In the development of a model, not only the technical aspects were taken into account, but other aspects related to the provision of drinking water and the water resources protection were also analyzed, such as institutional, financial, socioeconomic, environmental and public health. In the modeling process two different methods of conceptualization were used to describe the urban water flow through the water and wastewater systems linked to various aspects related to their implementation in large developing cities. The urban water systems of five large metropolitan areas in Brazil were also evaluated for the complete model. It is expected that the modeling approach developed in this paper consists of a valuable methodology for water supply and sanitation planning in Brazilian cities, and other developing cities with the same characteristics. The suggested conceptual model could, at least, provide more than a starting point for a useful urban water management tool.</jats:p>",

As a result of the great dynamics of selective migrations/moves it became clear that the social segregation of the housing quarters is already far advanced. In addition to the forecast developments in the large housing estates, where a process of decline is partly already reinforcing itself continuously, further problematic developments of housing quarters are emerging in the ordinary areas from the period of industrial expansion and_ — which has been completely ignored in previous considerations so far_ — in some new suburban housing estates.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intensity and energy modulated radiotherapy dose planning with protons and very‐high energy (50–250 MeV) electron beams has been investigated. A general‐purpose inverse treatment planning (ITP) system that can be applied to any combination of proton, electron and photon radiation modalities in therapy has been developed. The new ITP program uses a very fast proton dose calculation engine and employs one of the most efficient optimization algorithms currently available. First, the ITP program was employed to investigate intensity‐modulated proton therapy (IMPT) dose optimization for prostate cancer. The second application was to evaluate the potential of intensity‐modulated very‐high energy electron therapy (VHEET) for dose conformation. For an active proton beam delivery system the required energy resolution to reasonably implement energy modulation was found to be a function of the incident beams' energy spread and became coarser with increasing energy spread. For passive proton beam delivery systems the selection of the required depth resolution for inverse planning may not be critical as long as the depth resolution chosen is at least equal to FWHM/2 of the primary beam Bragg peak. In the study of the number of beam ports selected for IMPT treatment of the prostate, it was found that a maximum of three to four beams is required. Using proton beams for inverse planning of the prostate instead of photon beams gave the same or better target coverage while reducing the sensitive structure dose and normal tissue integral dose by up to 30% and 28% of the prescribed target dose, respectively. In evaluating the potential of VHEET beams for dose conformation, it was found that electron energies greater than 100 MeV are preferable for VHEET treatment of the prostate and that implementation of energy modulation in addition to intensity modulation has only a modest effect on the final dose distribution. VHEET treatment employing approximately nine beams was sufficient to give good dose conformation. Compared to intensity‐modulated x‐ray therapy (IMXT) of the prostate, VHEET provided comparable target coverage but significantly greater sparing of the sensitive structures (10%) and normal tissues (12% of the prescribed target dose).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inaccurate dose calculations and limitations of optimization algorithms in inverse planning introduce systematic and convergence errors to treatment plans. This work was to implement a Monte Carlo based inverse planning model for clinical IMRT aiming to minimize the aforementioned errors. The strategy was to precalculate the dose matrices of beamlets in a Monte Carlo based method followed by the optimization of beamlet intensities. The MCNP 4B (Monte Carlo N‐Particle version 4B) code was modified to implement selective particle transport and dose tallying in voxels and efficient estimation of statistical uncertainties. The resulting performance gain was over eleven thousand times. Due to concurrent calculation of multiple beamlets of individual ports, hundreds of beamlets in an IMRT plan could be calculated within a practical length of time. A finite‐sized point source model provided a simple and accurate modeling of treatment beams. The dose matrix calculations were validated through measurements in phantoms. Agreements were better than 1.5% or 0.2 cm. The beamlet intensities were optimized using a parallel platform based optimization algorithm that was capable of escape from local minima and preventing premature convergence. The Monte Carlo based inverse planning model was applied to clinical cases. The feasibility and capability of Monte Carlo based inverse planning for clinical IMRT was demonstrated. Systematic errors in treatment plans of a commercial inverse planning system were assessed in comparison with the Monte Carlo based calculations. Discrepancies in tumor doses and critical structure doses were up to 12% and 17%, respectively. The clinical importance of Monte Carlo based inverse planning for IMRT was demonstrated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The simultaneous upward and downward rescaling of regulation has dramatically altered welfare provisioning systems in very different national contexts during the past thirty years. Frequently lost in the literature on rescaling, though, is the notion that localities have not been ‘given’ power in the same way that international institutions have. Though local institutional variation accounts for more difference in welfare provision than before, there are clear policy boundaries that are policed by market regulators of various sorts. This paper explores the impact of rescaling on public housing provision in the United States to illustrate better this point. I demonstrate that basic demographic, housing stock, and federal funding differences are now less important determinants of uneven public housing production than was the case during the Keynesian era, and that local institutional differences are now playing a greater role in the production and management of public housing. With such institutional differences unleashed, enormous variation in the quantity, quality, and management of public housing is now emerging. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally water reticulation systems have been operated so that pipeline repair/renewal occurs on a reactive basis, based upon the number of failures, the consequence of failure and the cost. Planning for future replacements and the costs associated with these has been based upon a best guess of pipe lifetimes, which have generally been very conservative, when compared to the actual pipe life obtained. Factors such as the required level of customer service, trade-offs between repair and renewal, or operating practices such as pressure reduction or shut-off block reduction have not been widely considered, except when they are required under the water authorities operating licence. To allow long-term strategies to be implemented for the repair/renewal of water pipelines, a Pipeline Asset and Risk Management System (PARMS) is being developed. This planning model has been designed to allow a range of “what if” scenarios to be analysed to determine their effects on water authorities’ long-term costs. This model is based upon whole of life costing and includes data on externality and customer impact costs. It analyses the failures of individual pipe assets, rather than the traditional practice of predicting failure of pipe cohorts, currently used by many authorities. This paper discusses the application of the PARMS planning model to allow selection of pipeline repair/renewal, and briefly analyses the influences that a range of customer service or operating decisions can have on a water authority’s capital and operational expenditure.</jats:p>",

Unemployment and migration loss is most pronounced in the East German cities. Nevertheless they dispose of several favorite preconditions for growth in the future: their endowment with qualified human capital, public research and with enterprise-oriented services is above average. This contrasts with a low density of firms. The East German cities have a weak tax base and are disproportionally dependent on financial assignments by the state. Besides the East German cities the data show another “problem group” consisting of the cities of the Ruhr. The disparities between the West German Regions discovered in the 80s are still existing.</jats:p>"

This study drew upon the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault to provide an analysis of the micro politics of care planning. This involved the analysis of text from two sources: the academic literature and interview material gained from a number of professionals working in health and welfare services for people with learning disabilities. Drawing upon this research material, the first part of this paper briefly explores the relationship between policy, professional practice and the people who are the subjects of that practice. The discussion then moves on to consider Foucault's five methodological precautions and the way power produces a localised web of activity that identifies specific targets for management. In this process power draws into the web a range of informal and formal practices that initially lie outside of the web. The discourse produced through the activity surrounding care planning provides the evidence of this flow of power. This discourse then takes on the status of science (truth), which reproduces this activity.</jats:p>",

Efficiencies could be achieved by automating or semiautomating this process. While challenges remain, there are adequate solutions to semiautomate the scan-register-integrate tasks. On the other hand, view planning remains an open problem---that is, the task of finding a suitably small set of sensor poses and configurations for specified reconstruction or inspection goals.

This cannot be accomplished using simple stereotactic angiography, but requires a combination of stereotactic biplanar angiographic images and stereotactic contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CT) scans. In the present study the authors describe a method in which three-dimensional (3D) rotational angiography is integrated into stereotactic space to aid treatment planning for radiosurgery.</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Methods.</jats:italic> Twenty patients harboring AVMs underwent treatment planning prior to linear accelerator radiosurgery. Planning involved the acquisition of two different data sets, one of which was obtained using the standard method (a combination of biplanar stereotactic angiography with stereotactic CT scanning), and the other, which was procured using a new technique (nonstereotactic 3D rotational angiography combined with stereotactic CT scanning by a procedure of image fusion).</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">The treatment plan that was developed using the new method was compared with that developed using the standard one. For each patient the number of isocenters and the dimension of selected collimators were the same, based on the information supplied in both methods. Target coordinates were modified in only five cases and by a limited amount (mean 0.7 mm, range 0.3–1 mm).</jats:p>\n<jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> The new imaging modality offers an easier and more immediate interpretation of 3D data, while maintaining the same accuracy in target definition as that provided by the standard technique. Moreover, the new method has the advantage of using nonstereotactic 3D angiography, which can be performed at a different site and a different time with respect to the irradiation procedure.</jats:p>",

Two heuristics have been developed for solving the model, based on local search and simulated annealing principles, respectively. The efficiency of the heuristics was evaluated on a sample of test problems involving 10–, 20–, and 40–node networks. In the analysis both solution quality and computing effort were taken into account. The approach was used to analyze the ongoing transformation of the Portuguese main road network. The results obtained so far indicate that the model is a valuable decision–aid tool for inter–urban road network long–term planning.</jats:p>",

We test these hypotheses using data collected from presidents in 118 family firms. The results show that the propensity of a trusted successor to take over significantly affects the incidence of all succession-planning-related activities. Succession planning may, then, be the result of push by the successor more than of pull by the incumbent. Such a view has negative implications for the succession process that the family firms in our sample follow. </jats:p>",

However, it was only recently that researchers began to consider the impact of `private' time structures and experiences in the life course. As working hours become increasingly flexible and the boundaries between work and private life become blurred, attention is drawn to the conflicting relations between time structures in the public and in the private sphere. In the following text we focus upon the significance of occupational time constraints for private life and life planning by couples in young adulthood. Based on an empirical study we explore the different ways in which the temporal structures of training and paid work, and of commitments to significant others are reflected in the biographical decisions of young women. Through case studies we illustrate the knowledge about occupational time structures that young women draw on when making biographical choices. We also examine the ways in which young women are establishing links to their partner's life course and life planning. Finally we discuss the opportunities and risks of various biographical configurations between paid work and commitments to others. </jats:p>",

When the world is highly unpredictable and we are working from a limited range of expectations, however, our expectations will frequently be proved wrong. Scenario planning offers a framework for developing more resilient conservation policies when faced with uncontrollable, irreducible uncertainty. A scenario in this context is an account of a plausible future. Scenario planning consists of using a few contrasting scenarios to explore the uncertainty surrounding the future consequences of a decision. Ideally, scenarios should be constructed by a diverse group of people for a single, stated purpose. Scenario planning can incorporate a variety of quantitative and qualitative information in the decision‐making process. Often, consideration of this diverse information in a systemic way leads to better decisions. Furthermore, the participation of a diverse group of people in a systemic process of collecting, discussing, and analyzing scenarios builds shared understanding. The robustness provided by the consideration of multiple possible futures has served several groups well; we present examples from business, government, and conservation planning that illustrate the value of scenario planning. For conservation, major benefits of using scenario planning are ( 1 ) increased understanding of key uncertainties, ( 2 ) incorporation of alternative perspectives into conservation planning, and ( 3 ) greater resilience of decisions to surprise.</jats:p>",

Using the concepts built by the sociology of experience, we consider the experience of mobility as a combination of five mobility logics. A case study in a specific area with particular variety of experiences tends to show that on the one hand mobility appears as a potential that every individual may use according to the logics we describe. In the other hand, mobility seems to be inseparable from daily activity routines. These hypothesis lead to a critical review of transport planning practices, based on travel modelling, discrete choice theory and technical efficiency of public transport.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p xml:lang=\"fr\">Cet article analyse les déterminants de la mobilité quotidienne en considérant l'usager des systèmes de transport comme un acteur social.

La description et l'analyse de ces expériences sur une étude de cas nous amène à considérer la mobilité à la fois comme une ressource que l'acteur social reste libre d'activer ou non, et comme un ensemble de pratiques indissociables du reste des routines quotidiennes. Elles nous incitent aussi à poser un regard critique sur les pratiques contemporaines de planification basées sur l'existence de choix chez chaque individu et sur l'importance de l'efficacité instrumentale du transport public dans l'évaluation de ses performances.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forest management in Sweden today, as in many other places, involves the management of multiple resources for diverse purposes, such as promoting biodiversity, recreation, hunting, carbon sequestration, and reindeer herding as well as wood production. Sustainability is no longer related only to timber production; it now embraces the composition, processes, and functions of the entire ecosystem. Moreover, pressure from substitute products requires the production of timber, wood fuel, etc., to be economically competitive. The increased complexity of forest management has intensified the need for improved instruments for analysis and decision support. In response to this, a research programme aiming to develop new systems for forest management analysis and planning was recently initiated at the Forest Faculty, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), in which research efforts in different fields are being linked in a common framework to generate models and methods with the following desired attributes. The new systems should be designed with (i) a modular structure to allow the development of different applications, (ii) the landscape as the basic planning unit, (iii) the tree as the basic unit of projection of the tree layer, (iv) models of the interactions between processes and the management of the tree layer, and (v) models for evaluating risks and uncertainties in the data acquired and model projections. We believe that the separation of the system into a decision phase and a projection phase should facilitate the analysis of large and complex multiresource planning problems and suggest in this paper possible avenues for implementing such a feature. Since spatial problems are inherent in many biodiversity-related applications, we propose that appropriate spatially structuring principles should be included in the design of the system. The complex trade-offs involved when selecting ecosystem models in relation to the purpose of the analysis and data availability are highlighted. </jats:p>",

The demographic pattern of the major cities in both countries from 1890 onwards and the renewals of the centres of these cities are also discussed. Other sections are dedicated to the plans proposed for the same cities in the 1920s and to urban representations, such as ideas about social reform, the role of hygiene as a point of departure for planning, and the relationship of ideas on Taylorism (scientific management) and the city. The paper also discusses the planners opposition to elections, when they claimed that they were the only ones qualified to deal with urban problems and therefore they should be employed in the state apparatus.</jats:p><jats:p>Other concerns of the paper are the use of planning as an element of nation building and ideas defining eugenics (race ‘betterment’) as an important aspect of city planning. I conclude by arguing that, if implemented, city planning was a way of creating an industrial culture, disciplining society through the city, although the industrial proletariat has never made up the majority of the population in Brazil or Argentina. Even if many aspects of the plans proposed for both countries were not implemented, the discourse of planners can be seen as a will to discipline society through the city. This discipline would affect the freedom of movement of human bodies, and is therefore approached through Foucault's concepts of bio–power and discipline</jats:p>",

In recent years the number of new or alternative food supply chains and networks that incorporate claims of sustainability and quality has grown impressively. However, compared to conventional food supply chains and networks these alternative chains and networks remain rather small. By using the example of Dutch wheat and bread, in this paper I demonstrate that the prevailing sociotechnical regime constrains the growth of new promising sustainable food supply chains and networks. Constraints are both of a technical and an institutional nature. Strategic niche management is proposed as a promising design tool to overcome some of the encountered constraints, with the aim of contributing to a transition towards a more sustainable sociotechnical regime. </jats:p>",

Using a case study of Berlin I analyse first the challenges facing the city's three major utilities as a result of shifting patterns of resource consumption and overcapacity in parts of their networks. In the second part I examine the responses of the three utilities to these challenges in the context of recent institutional changes to infrastructure provision; exploring how the utilities are moving towards greater spatial differentiation in their network management and what interest they have in brownfield regeneration. </jats:p>",

Healthcare delivery is often managed with limited, if any, coordination with local health management structures. In situations where refugees remain in the host country for many years, sustainability issues inevitably arise. Refugee‐hosting governments may ultimately be called upon to assume the management and funding of refugee services. Planning for service integration, while protecting against declines in service quality, is a challenge in the typically resource‐poor host environments. This paper discusses these issues by presenting the experience of the West Nile districts in northern Uganda, and describes quality design as a relevant planning methodology.

This paper demonstrates the application of fMRI for including cortical activation into a treatment plan produced on our commercial treatment planning system (CMS XiO™). A patient with an intracranial tumour near the motor cortex was studied on a 1.5 Tesla GE Signa scanner. Images from conventional MRI, used to define the planning target volume (PTV), and from fMRI, used to define the organ at risk (OAR), were transferred to the treatment planning system. Three plans were generated with similar treatment intent and compared to assess the dose given to the OAR. These were: 1. a conventional plan; 2. an IMRT plan optimised to cover the PTV and; 3. an IMRT plan optimised to additionally spare the OAR. Results show that 21% of the motor cortex (OAR) receives 90% of the prescription dose when planned conventionally. This is reduced to 9% when IMRT is used, and to 2% when fMRI data is included. This novel approach can be extended to other functional areas of the brain, giving rise to a more conformal avoidance radiotherapy technique, which may help to preserve patient's quality of life.</jats:p>",

It represents one of the earliest such investigations within an African refugee population. The investigation took place in the Dimma refugee settlement in south‐western Ethiopia and study participants included Sudanese refugee men and women and Ethiopian female sex workers. Methods used for this investigation included focus group discussions, behavioural surveys and serologic testing. The main outcome measures of the investigation were HIV/STI knowledge, attitudes and behaviours and biological markers for HIV, syphilis and herpes simplex 2. The study findings indicate that in the early 1990s, knowledge about AIDS and condom use was low among Sudanese refugee women and not one reported having ever used a condom. Furthermore, sexual contact between refugee men and sex workers was frequent during the time of this study and the prevalence of HIV and other STIs was high. The results confirm a widely held assumption that highly mobile and transient populations in Africa are susceptible to STIs and HIV, in large part due to their knowledge, attitudes and behaviours.</jats:p>",

Errors in the radiation source description are propagated through the dose calculation. With the emergence of linear accelerators whose dosimetric characteristics are similar to within measurement uncertainty, the same radiation source description can be used as the input to dose calculation for treatment planning at many institutions with the same linear accelerator model. Our goal in the current research was to determine the initial electron fluence above the linear accelerator target for such an accelerator to allow a dose calculation in water to within 1% or 1 mm of the measured data supplied by the manufacturer. The method used for both the radiation source description and the patient transport was Monte Carlo. The linac geometry was input into the Monte Carlo code using the accelerator's manufacturer's specifications. Assumptions about the initial electron source above the target were made based on previous studies. The free parameters derived for the calculations were the mean energy and radial Gaussian width of the initial electron fluence and the target density. A combination of the free parameters yielded an initial electron fluence that, when transported through the linear accelerator and into the phantom, allowed a dose‐calculation agreement to the experimental ion chamber data to within the specified criteria at both 6 and 18 MV nominal beam energies, except near the surface, particularly for the 18 MV beam. To save time during Monte Carlo treatment planning, the initial electron fluence was transported through part of the treatment head to a plane between the monitor chambers and the jaws and saved as phase‐space files. These files are used for clinical Monte Carlo‐based treatment planning and are freely available from the authors.</jats:p>",

The paper describes how I have worked with the Old Order Amish to respond to these challenges and to create public policies that will allow them to maintain their human and agricultural diversity and small‐scale sustainable farm practices. Four case studies illuminating the oppressive land‐use regulations along with the emancipatory responses to the oppression are examined.

For a target occupancy in excess of 80%, this simple calculation will typically underestimate the number of beds required. More seriously, it provides no quantitative guidance information about other aspects of critical care demand such as the numbers of emergency patients transferred, deferral rates for elective patients and overall utilisation. The combination of appropriately analysing raw data and detailed mathematical modelling provides a much better method for estimating numbers of beds required. We describe this modelling approach together with evidence of its performance.</jats:p>",

Implementation issues are grouped into two broad categories; those associated with the organization’s structure and those concerned with the plan development process.

We acknowledge the importance of discursive constructions and metaphorical representations of economic space, and extend the argument by examining the practices that may follow from such discourses. With use of empirical data from a firm-level survey and interviews with representatives of electronics firms in Singapore, we focus on contested interpretations of the Asian economic crisis at the firm level: how they might differ from state-driven discourses, and the extent to which state discourses (embodied in ministerial speeches and policy initiatives) were accepted, contested, and negotiated through firm-specific practices. The different counterdiscourses and responses of local and foreign firms are also compared. Results show that discourses at the national (state) scale were challenged and contested by firms within the same national space economy because of such material conditions as firm-specific circumstances, spatial extensiveness of their intrafirm and interfirm networks, and their access to various formal and informal information channels. The sampled firms offerered their own readings of the crisis that often contradicted the effectiveness and usefulness of certain policy responses orchestrated at the national scale. Their abilities to weather the crisis were also differentiated significantly between local and foreign firms. The study therefore highlights the importance of understanding the complex interrelationships between discourses and practices at different spatial scales and their capacity to produce (un)intended geographical outcomes. </jats:p>",

Transitions out of poverty and transitions into poverty are estimated by using discrete duration models that control for individual and family-level characteristics, duration effects, and local labour-market variables. After controlling for individual and family-level characteristics, probabilities of exiting poverty were found to be higher and probabilities of entering poverty were found to be lower for those individuals living in labour markets which experienced increases in the proportion of the population in employment. The relative contribution of labour market variables is substantially smaller than individual and family characteristics in determining transitions out of and into poverty. Whether changes in employment in the local labour-market were biased towards manufacturing or services did not have a systematic influence on poverty exits and entrances. The link between employment conditions in the local labour market and poverty suggests that the poor did share in the gains from economic growth in the 1990s. This finding gives support to the idea that expansionary demand policies at the local level could help to mitigate the economic position of the economically disadvantaged. </jats:p>",

We used static and dynamic spatial models to evaluate whether a proposed wolf reintroduction to the southern Rocky Mountain region ( U.S.A ) would advance recovery by increasing species distribution beyond what might be expected through natural range expansion. We used multiple logistic regression to develop a resource‐selection function relating wolf distribution in the Greater Yellowstone region with regional‐scale habitat variables. We also used a spatially explicit population model to predict wolf distribution and viability at several potential reintroduction sites within the region under current conditions and under two contrasting predictions of future landscape change. Areas of the southern Rocky Mountains with resource‐selection‐function values similar to those of currently inhabited areas in Yellowstone could potentially support&gt;1000 wolves, 40% within protected areas and 47% on unprotected public lands. The dynamic model predicted similar distribution under current conditions but suggested that development trends over 25 years may result in the loss of one of four potential regional subpopulations and increased isolation of the remaining areas. The reduction in carrying capacity due to landscape change ranged from 49% to 66%, depending on assumptions about road development on public lands. Although much of the wolf population occurs outside core protected areas, these areas remain the key to the persistence of subpopulations. Although the dynamic model's sensitivity to dispersal parameters made it difficult to predict the probability of natural recolonization from distant sources, it suggested that an active reintroduction to two sites within the region may be necessary to ensure low extinction probability. Social carnivores such as the wolf, which often require larger territories than solitary species of similar size, may be more vulnerable to environmental stochasticity and landscape fragmentation than their vagility and fecundity would suggest.</jats:p>",

All the main engineering information used for making decisions while planning and at well site, drilling performance and production evaluation are included.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As the targeted formations are consolidated, UBD did not bring any special concern in terms of wellbore collapse. In order to achieve the required bottomhole pressure, nitrogen was mixed with a synthetic base mud (SBM) after flowing down through the annular space between the 9 5/8″ and 7″ casings and passing through a 1″ aperture in the 7″ casing. After that, the mixture went up through the annulus between the 7″ casing and the drill string. This concentric casing approach for injecting gas made possible the use of conventional MWD, but it brought some concerns about the maintenance of the UB condition while operating.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first ML well UB drilled in Brazil successfully combined the following different technologies: (1) ML level 2; (2) UB condition, and (3) medium radius build-up drilling system. It also involved four different parties where the operating company worked together with three service companies to build a team and achieve operational goals.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>As the reservoir pressure was not sufficient to sustain the flow of oil to the surface, this paper also addresses the design of the pilot well, which was specifically prepared for operating with a sucker rod pump (SRP). Finally, from the perspective of the reservoir engineers in charge of developing this field, the oil production is presented and evaluated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Respiratory motion during intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) causes two types of problems. First, the clinical target volume (CTV) to planning target volume (PTV) margin needed to account for respiratory motion means that the lung and heart dose is higher than would occur in the absence of such motion. Second, because respiratory motion is not synchronized with multileaf collimator (MLC) motion, the delivered dose is not the same as the planned dose. The aims of this work were to evaluate these problems to determine (a) the effects of respiratory motion and setup error during breast IMRT treatment planning, (b) the effects of the interplay between respiratory motion and multileaf collimator (MLC) motion during breast IMRT delivery, and (c) the potential benefits of breast IMRT using breath‐hold, respiratory gated, and 4D techniques. Seven early stage breast cancer patient data sets were planned for IMRT delivered with a dynamic MLC (DMLC). For each patient case, eight IMRT plans with varying respiratory motion magnitudes and setup errors (and hence CTV to PTV margins) were created. The effects of respiratory motion and setup error on the treatment plan were determined by comparing the eight dose distributions. For each fraction of these plans, the effect of the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery was simulated by superimposing the respiratory trace on the planned DMLC leaf motion, facilitating comparisons between the planned and expected dose distributions. When considering respiratory motion in the CTV‐PTV expansion during breast IMRT planning, our results show that PTV dose heterogeneity increases with respiratory motion. Lung and heart doses also increase with respiratory motion. Due to the interplay between respiratory motion and MLC motion during IMRT delivery, the planned and expected dose distributions differ. This difference increases with respiratory motion. The expected dose varies from fraction to fraction. However, for the seven patients studied and respiratory trace used, for no breathing, shallow breathing, and normal breathing, there were no statistically significant differences between the planned and expected dose distributions. Thus, for breast IMRT, intrafraction motion degrades treatment plans predominantly by the necessary addition of a larger CTV to PTV margin than would be required in the absence of such motion. This motion can be limited by breath‐hold, respiratory gated, or 4D techniques.</jats:p>",

In such a situation the triangular test is more appropriate than the Lan &amp; DeMets method. When a treatment effect is no different from, or better than, placebo the triangular test is also superior but the importance of premature termination of the trial in such cases has to be balanced against the inevitable reduction of information that the trial can provide.</jats:p>",
