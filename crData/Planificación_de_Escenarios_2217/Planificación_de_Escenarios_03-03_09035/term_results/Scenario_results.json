Drawing upon the lessons learned from the deployment of the SME Gateway in South Africa, we highlight a number of pilot projects illustrating the importance of context in assessing critical success factors. We proceed to explore the role of business services providers and conclude by suggesting a road map for turning the promises of the Internet into reality for small and medium size enterprises.</jats:p>",

When the world is highly unpredictable and we are working from a limited range of expectations, however, our expectations will frequently be proved wrong. Scenario planning offers a framework for developing more resilient conservation policies when faced with uncontrollable, irreducible uncertainty. A scenario in this context is an account of a plausible future. Scenario planning consists of using a few contrasting scenarios to explore the uncertainty surrounding the future consequences of a decision. Ideally, scenarios should be constructed by a diverse group of people for a single, stated purpose. Scenario planning can incorporate a variety of quantitative and qualitative information in the decision‐making process. Often, consideration of this diverse information in a systemic way leads to better decisions. Furthermore, the participation of a diverse group of people in a systemic process of collecting, discussing, and analyzing scenarios builds shared understanding. The robustness provided by the consideration of multiple possible futures has served several groups well; we present examples from business, government, and conservation planning that illustrate the value of scenario planning. For conservation, major benefits of using scenario planning are ( 1 ) increased understanding of key uncertainties, ( 2 ) incorporation of alternative perspectives into conservation planning, and ( 3 ) greater resilience of decisions to surprise.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a CGE model is used to analyze the effects of rapid reduction of costs of solar power generation, an important RET, in India. Alternate scenarios of cost reduction of solar power, hybrid scenarios with a carbon tax and a scenario of only carbon tax are compared with a reference scenario. Simulation results show that under such a scenario, high penetration of solar technology, economic gains, and modest emission reduction are achieved. The analysis shows that compared to accelerated solar technology scenario, a carbon tax achieves superior mitigation. Broad policy implications for developing countries are drawn in the context of global climate change debate.</jats:p>",

During the past two decades of the twentieth century, community colleges faced expectations to expand their purposes beyond transfer and occupational education, to serve employers’ needs for training, and to accommodate more students in need of basic skills. Drawing on focus group data, this article examines what community college presidents characterize as the demand-response scenario for their colleges, the ways they work within it, and how they seek to move beyond it. The analysis focuses on their accounts of appropriate organizational responses, showing how institutional logics embedded in the wider context allowed for a range of legitimate responses yet also fostered ambiguity about their identity and societal role. </jats:p>",
