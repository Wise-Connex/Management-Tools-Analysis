The objective of this paper is to consolidate and extend the metaphor of planning theory as a lens, with the primary concern being to provide assistance to planning educators, students, and researchers in approaching planning theory. The lens metaphor is also contended as a useful construct in crafting a sense of community in the face of calls for theoretical diversity in planning theory. </jats:p>",

But it can also provide insights into current dilemmas of planning practice as it explains the origins of institutions and techniques and documents the concerns of planners in earlier generations. This paper highlights the relevance of historical writings, by planning pioneers and by historians, to contemporary planning theory by analyzing how planning pioneers framed public problems and professional discretion in early development regulation. A case-study on the adoption of housing laws in late 19th-century New York City illustrates the benefits that planning theorists, including those working in a communicative perspective, can derive from historical research. </jats:p>",

An integrative framework associates complementary (contingent) planning paradigms with various forms of rationality, to suggest that the association between planning and rationality continues unabated. Discussion should shift from questioning the link between rationality and planning to asking what kinds of planning and rationality particular cases, situations, or contexts demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographic information systems (GIS) assume an increasingly large role in North American land use planning. Although GIS is often promoted as an answer to both democratic and sustainability issues in planning, this paper calls these premises into question and suggests a less ambitious role for GIS technology in the planning process in the new millennium. The contributions of critical theory to conceptions of decision making and action in planning, as well as a case comparison study of government GIS systems and those of community groups in British Columbia's Gulf Islands are considered. Both strains of argument lead to the conclusion that more than new technology, fresh commitments to communicate and to share planning power and responsibility are needed for more democratic, interactive land use planning. </jats:p>",

The twin risks of unwanted pregnancy and HIV/AIDS infection remain central concerns of reproductive health programs. However, we do not know how sexually active men and women perceive these risks, nor the strategies they consider appropriate to cope with these risks, nor the difficulties they face in trying to adopt appropriate sexual behaviors to minimize them. This study seeks to provide insights into perceptions, coping strategies, and constraints in the changing behavior of sexually active people in Nakuru District, Kenya. Twelve focus‐group discussions were conducted, the results of which show that people in the study area consider the two risks to be serious problems, but that they neither use condoms within marriage nor refuse their partners sex even if they perceive a risk of acquiring HIV. These findings call for serious efforts toward fostering behavioral change in this area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Islamic Republic of Iran arguably has one of the most successful family planning programs in the developing world. This success is all the more interesting for advocates of population programs because the political leaders of the Islamic regime were once strongly opposed to family planning. Indeed, after gaining power following the 1979 revolution, they were responsible for dismantling Iran's relatively new family planning program and introducing pronatalist policies. This article provides an account of the different phases of the population policy in Iran and examines the diverse elements that led politicoreligious leaders to revise their views about fertility control and to participate in creating a workable family planning program. The complex formal and informal strategies that the political experts, the media, the religious authorities, and the government of the Islamic Republic adopted in order to achieve this about‐face are described. The analysis is based on data collected by the first author during anthropological field research in 1993–96, by means of informal interviews with officials, with medical personnel, with family planning clients, and with religious leaders</jats:p>",

The resulting intergovernmental conflicts provide a window, as a part of urban governance, into conflict management. This paper focuses on such conflicts and the several ways of resolving them that have been attempted in southeastern Korea, centred on the country's major port of Pusan. In one way or another, conflicts with neighbouring Kyungnam Province have been festering since the administrative separation of Pusan as a metropolis, coequal in rank with the province of which it had been the capital. Three approaches of solving the region's problem were tried, all involving the central government in Seoul: aggressive annexations by Pusan of Kyungnam territories; a bland form of nonbinding mediation through an administrative device called ‘association’, and, most recently, a tripartite collaborative form of interregional planning involving Pusan, Kyungnam Province, and the national Ministry of Construction and Transportation. Based on enabling legislation, the collaborative planning approach appears to be working and has been adopted by a number of other conflicted regions in Korea. </jats:p>",

The total fertility rate (TFR) averaged 3.3 births per woman of reproductive age over the period, a major drop from earlier estimates in the same area (6.0 births in 1970–74). Age‐specific fertility rates showed an atypical bimodal pattern. They were decomposed into two components of similar magnitude: premarital fertility (among women aged 12–26) and marital fertility (among women aged 15–49). The decomposition revealed the two underlying modes: a mode of premarital fertility (among women aged 18–20) and a mode of marital fertility (among women aged 28–30). Premarital fertility accounted for 21 percent of all births and for 47 percent of births among women aged 12–26. This pattern of high premarital fertility appears to reflect a low incidence of contraceptive use before the first birth, especially among adolescents, a low prevalence of abortion, and a high contraceptive prevalence thereafter. This finding calls for a reorientation of the family planning policy, which until now has targeted married women and women who have been pregnant once, but has failed to address the contraceptive needs of young women before their first pregnancy, especially adolescents.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship between local government officers and elected members is central to the decisionmaking processes associated with planning, as with many other areas of public policymaking. Legal responsibilities and issues of accountability and legitimacy lie at the heart of the relationship between officers and members, with interaction mediated and constituted through ritualised communicative encounters such as committee meetings and associated reports, and less formally through ad hoc contacts. Given the importance of this relationship it is striking that there has been relatively little research into the influences on officers and members within everyday planning practice. In this paper we will explore the extent to which a consideration of the language used in planning practice can inform our understanding of the relationship between planners and politicians. Thinking within the planning field about the role of language as a mechanism for reflecting and constituting power has been dominated by the work of Jürgen Habermas and Michel Foucault. However, despite the increasing attention focused on the importance of language and communication, work within the planning community has tended to concentrate on normative issues of how planning ought to operate in society rather than situating these theories within the ‘real’ world of practice. The objectives behind the case study research evaluated in this paper are therefore twofold. First, to explore the role of language and discourse in reflecting and constituting relations of power in a planning authority on the south coast of England and, second, to explore the value of Foucault's and Habermas's ideas as tools of research in planning. On the basis of this study we conclude that there are some important theoretical and methodological difficulties in connecting the ideas of Habermas and Foucault to the world of everyday planning practice. </jats:p>",

The post-occupancy evaluation found that satisfaction with housing does not depend on whether a house is attached or detached and that house design can be more important than site design. Putting more houses on less land makes privacy more difficult to attain, and it may force a trade-off between open space and adequate auto accommodation. The findings support the kind of regulatory flexibility that will allow developers to maintain density levels while allowing residents the space they say they need. Adherence to regulatory standards, however, is not sufficient in evaluating a subdivision proposal. The planner needs to evaluate the location, footprint, and orientation of each dwelling and to take differences in site design into account when determining the amount of off-street parking to mandate. </jats:p>",

To taxpayers, growth management promises more efficient delivery of public facilities and services. To developers, growth management promises more certainty. To citizen activists, growth management promises resolution of development problems in advance, instead of on an ad hoc basis. These promises are heroic. Nonetheless, even if only partly successful, communities engaged in growth management should out-perform other communities in overall economic output. This paper evaluates the economic performance of 182 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with 1990 populations between 100,000 and 500,000 over the period 1972 to 1992 with respect to presence or absence of growth management efforts such as urban growth boundaries, urban service limits, and state or regional oversight of local planning. We find a positive association between the presence of growth management and economic performance; communities engaged in growth management realized marginal improvements in economic performance relative to other communities, ceteris parnbus. </jats:p>",

In this article, empirical evidence on the accessibility and quality of services provided through the Indian family planning program is reviewed and synthesized. The review highlights the serious and systemic shortcomings in quality of care that characterize the Indian program in such areas as restricted method choice, limited information provided to clients, poor technical standards, and low levels of follow‐up and continuity of care. The factors constraining higher service quality are subsequently reviewed, and the prospects for improving quality of care within the Indian program are assessed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The exclusion of neighborhood organizations and households from active participation in the planning process lies at the heart of the current sanitation planning crisis in many cities in developing countries. This paper describes a demand-driven planning approach for urban sewerage, in which neighborhood organizations and households are involved in an active partnership with government planners and other technical staff. We argue that planners must reorient their thinking from city-level master planning toward the neighborhood. This change in focus requires that government officials and planners study household and neighborhood demand for improved water and sanitation services in order to design a deal that municipal and higher-level governments can afford, that is technically feasible, that is attractive to households, and that has public health and environmental benefits. A case study of the sanitation situation in Semarang, Indonesia, illustrates how an innovative set of participatory tools can be used to assess household and neighborhood demand. </jats:p>",

This enables reasonably uniform doses to be delivered to a well-defined region extending from the surface, whilst at the same time sparing underlying tissue. Above about 20 MeV the fall-off of the curve becomes progressively less steep with energy, and the separation of the high-dose and spared regions becomes increasingly blurred. Energies higher than this can be used for deeper-seated tumours in a manner similar to megavoltage photons. However, the majority of linear accelerators that provide clinical electron beams provide energies within the range 4-20 MeV and this chapter is mainly concerned with their use. Discussion is limited to the parameters affecting either the dose distribution or the link between monitor units (mu) and dose. Calculation methods are considered, where appropriate, but no detailed discussion is given of more complex algorithms.</jats:p>",

Therefore, inexpensive, accessible tools that rely on symptoms, signs, and/or risk factors have been developed to identify and treat reproductive tract infections without the need for laboratory diagnostics. Studies were reviewed that used standard diagnostic tests to identify gonorrhea and cervical chlamydial infection among women and that provided adequate information about the usefulness of the tools for screening. Aggregation of the studies' results suggest that risk factors, algorithms, and risk scoring for syndromic management are poor indicators of gonorrhea and chlamydial infection in samples of both low and high prevalence and, consequently, are not effective mechanisms with which to identify or manage these conditions. The development and evaluation of other approaches to identify gonorrhea and chlamydial infections, including inexpensive and simple laboratory screening tools, periodic universal treatment, and other alternatives must be given priority.</jats:p>",

In the light of concrete `language policy events' and the debates - parliamentary, in the media and in academic discourse - in relation to these, the aim of the paper is to discuss which domains within language matters are considered objects of national political intervention and for which reasons. French language policy which is relatively explicit will be compared with more implicit Danish language policy. The interrelations of ideologically and pragmatically founded reasons for intervening in various language matters will be discussed: In an internationally oriented world, where cultural and linguistic pluralism prevail at the expense of national homogeneity, which role is left for national language policy, if any? Can a phenomenon which traditionally has been considered mainly as a tool for uniting nations possibly become a tool for granting and improving democracy in modern Western European societies' internal and external communication? Or should national governments once and for all leave such matters to individual choices, EU language policies or market forces? Answering in depth to these broad questions is not the ambition of the paper, whereas outlining tendencies in the ongoing political discourses connected to the issue is the aim, in the light of the approaches in the scientific study of language planning and language policy.</jats:p>"

It begins with patient diagnosis, contains a number of steps to patient treatment, and carries through with on-going follow-up. One crucial step in this process is the determination of the location and extent of disease relative to adjacent critical normal tissues. This can be done in a variety of ways, ranging from simple clinical examination to the use of complex imaging modalities, sometimes aided by contrast agents. Another step of the process is the selection of the necessary radiation beams to provide an adequate coverage of the tissues at risk, while minimizing the dose to healthy normal tissues. Before treatment is initiated, this treatment plan needs to be confirmed by an imaging procedure to ensure that the beams traverse the desired anatomical volume and correlate accurately with respect to critical structures.</jats:p>",

In this chapter, the various types of equipment that are available and their general specification are described. Criteria for machine selection are then presented, followed by a discussion of treatment-room design and protection considerations.

We will also see reasons why interval temporal logics have not become very popular: these include undecidability and a lack of expressive completeness.</jats:p>",

But are there not also (regional) milieus which — far from being creative or innovative — are hostile to innovation, or even “sclerotic”? The author shows that it is possible to proceed from the assumption of a life-cycle for regional milieus within a heuristic model and that specific factors have to be developed in order for a milieu to be capable of being deemed “creative”. The article concludes with a number of propositions and reflections on how creative milieus can be promoted and on their relevance for regional policy.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

As society demands a higher quality environment, odour pollution increases in importance as an amenity issue. Planning authorities can refuse planning permission on the grounds that the odour nuisance from the proposed development will be detrimental to the amenity of the area. Planningauthorities are therefore in the unique position of being able to prevent odour pollution. Potential odour polluters are under increasing pressure to demonstrate to planning authorities that odour has been minimised as far as possible. The communication of technical odour control data and assessments, through mechanisms such as Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA), is becoming an important part of the decision making process. The lack of specific odour policy and guidance within the planning arena is highlighted. The reconstruction of Derby Sewage Treatment works (STW) is used a a case study to highlight how a technical assessment of odour emissions, using the WRc Sewage Treatment Odour Production (STOP) Model can be successfully used within the planning arena to achieve planning permission with no additional conditions.</jats:p>",

It begins with a critical analysis of the principles and postulates of the vision of sustainable spatial development and of the current state of implementation of this vision in Germany, in particular with regard to more comprehensive spatial planning. The article then goes on to focus in turn on the origins, content and organisation of regional management in Rottal-Inn, as well as on its effectiveness with regard to projects it has been applied to and its managerial efficiency; this in turn leads into a discussion of the contribution of process- and implementation-orientated regional management to sustainable spatial development. Departing from the view occasionally encountered which might be expressed as “Regional planning is dead — long live regional management”, the authors conclude by drawing some conclusions regarding area-specific regional management and its links to regional planning.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Although, since the 1970s, all of Germany’s urban regions have instituted partnerships to bring together urban authorities and the rural authorities of the surrounding region, in the majority of cases these have been charged solely with co-ordinating the local-authority planning function, and only to a lesser degree with the joint delivery of local-authority services. With the completion of the European single market, many agglomerations have created stand-alone regional companies to work within the economic-development field. Attempts to intensify co-operation in other areas have however failed. Remedies to this problem are seen in varying the boundaries of urban regions and in the active support for voluntary partnerships provided by state governments.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In providing this option, the legislature was reacting to the requirements of more efficient planning and for closer co-ordination of the various tiers of planning. In this article the regional masterplan is discussed as a new instrument of regional and land-use planning. Within this context the article identifies normative planning elements of regional masterplanning, which are exemplified in more concrete terms by reference to the Munich region. The article discusses such issues as the matter to be included in the textual component of the plan, as well as the cartographic representation of the regional masterplan. It concludes by pointing out a number of problem areas in implementation and discussing attempts at finding solutions.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In doing so, they liberate the quality concept from the narrow product or service focus to encompass total conformance to customer requirements in spite of the existing functionalization and departmentalization of modern complex structures. In addition to these key components, a customer-driven organization demands building and nurturing a customer satisfaction culture and value system that makes quality improvement and heightened concern for customer satisfaction a permanent aspect of organizational life.</jats:p>",

Two examples are the local innovative milieu investigated by the GREMI research group, and the discussion on urban governance. Both models are concerned with the description and analysis of structures and actions in regions and towns.

The audit risk model prescribes that audit program plans should be designed to respond to client risk factors. Auditors should be able to identify potential errors that may occur given the risks present and design program plans to test for the presence of these errors. Client inherent-risk factors were varied between subjects to create high- and low-risk conditions and a seeded error enabled assessment of effectiveness in hypothesis generation and audit test planning.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>We find that client risk factors have pervasive effects throughout planning, affecting the concentration on error hypotheses, audit program effectiveness, and justification for audit tests. However, risk factors were not associated with differences in extent of testing or with justification of extent decisions. Our findings also suggest that recognition of risk factors may provide a stimulus to auditors with less experience to improve performance in the planning process. These results highlight the importance of identifying and communicating client risk factors to all audit team members in the planning stage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent processes of European integration have influenced profoundly the fortunes of cities across Western Europe. Although some cities have benefited, others have been impacted adversely. Income inequalities result from economic growth differentials occurring between different cities over time. The theoretical literature differs on whether increased integration promotes or reduces income disparities. The European Union (EU) assumes that rising inequalities will impair EU growth and lead to even greater disparities. Empirical analysis has concentrated on the EU-defined regions because of problems of urban data availability and comparability. Using regional data, I identified that the overall level of inequalities changed little for the metropolitan regions between the early 1980s and the early 1990s. Urban disparities were cyclical—decreasing during strong EU growth and increasing in slower growth years. Factors outside direct local government control, including relative location within Europe, reinforced the traditional strong-core—weak-periphery spatial pattern of development. I argue that additional factors specific to cities, such as limited EU urban policy and funding, contributed to overall higher and more sharply rising inequalities since the late 1980s for cities compared with regions. The positive linear relationship between levels of national income and urban disparities has implications for economic polarization within richer member states and for EU efforts to reduce inequalities by raising the level of development in poorer countries. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The AICPA has taken the position that accreditation of CPAs in specific areas of practice is an important aspect of repositioning the CPA profession for the future. The AICPA currently offers two designations exclusively to CPAs, one of which is the Personal Financial Specialist (PFS) designation. However, the issue of accrediting CPAs by granting official AICPA designations is a complex and highly debated issue with opposing sides having compelling arguments supporting their positions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>CPAs and other professionals specializing in personal financial planning have opportunities to obtain designations other than the PFS. This paper examines the relative value of these alternative options for financial planners. Specifically, the research was designed to examine the differential effects of alternative financial-planning accreditations on users' perceptions. These perceptions relate to various professional attributes of a financial planner such as their knowledge and expertise, objectivity, and level of trust and ethics possessed. In addition, these perceptions relate to fees charged and the influence that the designation has on the public's choice of a financial planner.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Our results indicate that the CPA designation used in conjunction with the PFS designation is generally perceived to signal a higher level of professional attributes than the other designations examined in the study. In addition, a CPA with a PFS designation has a significantly greater influence on the public's choice of a financial planner than do the other designations. These results suggest that important benefits may accrue to CPAs from holding the PFS specialty accreditation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Both the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Operations Research (OR) communities are interested in developing techniques for solving hard combinatorial problems, in particular in the domain of planning and scheduling. AI approaches encompass a rich collection of knowledge representation formalisms for dealing with a wide variety of real-world problems. Some examples are constraint programming representations, logical formalisms, declarative and functional programming languages such as Prolog and Lisp, Bayesian models, rule-based formalism, etc. The downside of such rich representations is that in general they lead to intractable problems, and we therefore often cannot use such formalisms for handling realistic size problems. OR, on the other hand, has focused on more tractable representations, such as linear programming formulations. OR-based techniques have demonstrated the ability to identify optimal and locally optimal solutions for well-defined problem spaces. In general, however, OR solutions are restricted to rigid models with limited expressive power. AI techniques, on the other hand, provide richer and more flexible representations of real-world problems, supporting efficient constraint-based reasoning mechanisms as well as mixed initiative frameworks, which allow the human expertise to be in the loop. The challenge lies in providing representations that are expressive enough to describe real-world problems and at the same time guaranteeing good and fast solutions.</jats:p>",

As part of the Kyrgyz-Swiss Forestry Support Program, the Chair for Forest Biometrics and Computer Sciences of Dresden University of Technology and the Swiss Federal Institute (WSL) are therefore developing tailor-made methods of compiling sample-based forest inventories on a national and forest enterprise level. Concentric circles are used as the sample unit; on a national level, these are combined to produce clusters of three trial plots. They are distributed using a systematic dot grid with varying density according to the level of assessment (national or forest enterprise) and forest type. The parameters in the catalogue, definitions and measurement rules are harmonized. An operational forest definition allows the results to be compared with international studies. The production of maps and the implementation of a GIS are essential for both inventories. Current conditions in the country make the development of these methods difficult;despite this, the work should be completed by the end of the year 2000.</jats:p>",

The main idea of the first approach, referred to as <jats:italic>Constrained Optimisation \n(CO)</jats:italic> is to represent the free space of the workspace as a set of inequality constraints using vehicle configuration variables. The second approach converts robot path planning into a <jats:italic>Semi-infinite Constrained Optimisation (SCO)</jats:italic> problem. The function interpolation technique is adopted to satisfy the start and goal configuration requirements. Mathematical foundations for Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), Boolean operations and approximation techniques are also presented to reduce the number of constraints, and to avoid local minima. The advantages of these approaches are that the mature techniques developed in optimisation theory which guarantee convergence, efficiency and numerical robustness can be directly applied to the robot path planning problem. Simulation results have been presented.</jats:p>",

This study of China's economic performance against the recent Asian financial turmoil suggests that the Chinese central state has played a crucial role in the growth and restructuring of the national economy. The immediate impact of the financial crisis on China has been limited although the long-term effects remain uncertain. China has so far narrowly escaped the crisis primarily because of a state-led capital injection in mid-1998 to stop economic downturn, an austerity program that led the overheated economy to ‘soft-land’ prior to the crisis, and stringent state control of capital flow into and out of the country. Contrary to the ‘end of the nation-state’ claim made by many globalization prophets, the Chinese socialist state has remained an active agent interacting with global market forces. The interplay between the socialist state and transnational capital has been a place-specific phenomenon despite the pervasive assertion of ‘the end of geography’. A dialectical approach is needed for analyzing the triangular nexus of interaction between the central state, local state, and global market forces in China in the current age of volatile globalization.</jats:p>",

As there are numerous combinations the arrangement of the fabric roll sequences for each cutting lay, it is difficult to construct a roll planning to minimise the fabric wastage during spreading in apparel manufacturing. Recent advances in computing technology, especially in the area of computational intelligence, can be used to handle this problem. Among the different computational intelligence techniques, genetic algorithms (GA) are particularly suitable. GAs are probabilistic search methods that employ a search technique based on ideas from natural genetics and evolutionary principles. This paper presents the details of GA and explains how the problem of roll planning can be formulated for GA to solve. The result of the study shows that an optimal roll planning can be worked out by using GA approach. It is possible to save a considerable amount of fabric when the best roll planning is used for the production.</jats:p>",

Over the last two years the Kalgoorlie campus has been re-engineering its structure, including its management practices and teaching and learning strategies. Just as the administration has to be lean and mean in these economic times, so the teaching and learning has to be cost effective, however our main reason for bringing in flexible learning is to improve customer service' and increase the number of student enrolments. In other campuses offering flexible learning it has been found that offering more control and choice dramatically increases enrolments. Our market is aimed at adults and adults have a more practical approach to their educational needs and also more experience to bringto the learning process. Flexible delivery both attracts students and is an economical method of delivery. We have been moving piecemeal towards a more flexible approach but the opening of a flexible learning centre is an announcement to the world that we are committed to our customers. In February I was given a project to open a flexible learning centre in nine weeks. I could access $50,000. I did manage to access another two small grants; however we were operating on a shoestring. It has taken 9 months [just like a baby] but we have a successful outcome. The following are some of  my findings as I researched the topic and some conclusions I reached.</jats:p>"

These methods are structured processes for engaging large numbers of people to: (1) enhance the amount of relevant information brought to bear on a problem; (2) build commitment to problem definitions and solutions; (3) fuse planning and implementation; and (4) shorten the amount of time needed to conceive and execute major policies, programs, services, or projects. Proponents of such methods claim that they provide sets of concepts, procedures, and tools that can help public and nonprofit organizations and communities deal effectively with change. On the other hand, a number of boundary conditions surround the successful use of the methods. The authors compare and contrast seven approaches most frequently used in the public sector in the United States and abroad (i.e., Real Time Strategic Change, Search Conferences, Future Searches, Strategic Options Development and Analysis, Strategic Choice, Technology of Participation, and Open Space Technology) to illustrate their comparative strengths and weaknesses and to develop an agenda for research.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors contribute to the developing literature on call centres by providing detailed empirical evidence on the spatial unevenness in the distribution of call centre activity. They argue that the driving forces of call centre growth, whether as the rationalisation of back-office functions or as entirely new entities, have been corporate strategy and the pursuit of low-cost competitive advantage. Thus, although technological developments at the heart of call centre operations render them relatively ‘footloose’ in locational terms, the search for specific characteristics makes certain regions (and parts of regions) more attractive than others. By using a sample database of call centres, the authors describe the characteristics of call centres in the United Kingdom in terms of size, sector, and spatial distribution. They then attempt to explain the determinants of call centre location at the county level through a multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that there is a propensity to site call centres close to existing concentrations of allied activity, with preferences for densely populated areas mediated by needs to maintain employee access and avoid staff turnover problems. This has important implications for the spatial division of labour, with call centre growth likely to reinforce existing spatial unevenness in employment in key service activities. The authors conclude by considering the implications of these findings for contemporary urban and regional development, as well as providing a number of suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

The project charter is important to the success of a project, transforming agreements and facts into a documented project management approach. This output begins to organize and document a project's need and expected outcomes at the beginning of the project management process and provides a foundation on which to base project decisions. This paper evaluates the completeness and effectiveness of a project charter template as a project management tool. In addition, a project charter is developed for an information system development project initiated by a hospital-based clinical laboratory, addressing the problem of a complete lack of a repeatable project management process within an entity whose adaptation of formal project management methods is immature. A section-by-section assessment of the justification for inclusion in the Tryon and Associates Project Charter (Tryon and Associates, 1998) adopted by St. John Medical Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma USA, based upon a review of project management literature, is accomplished. In addition, a working project charter for use in the planning phase of one of Regional Medical Laboratory's (RML) current information system development projects—RML Turnaround Time System—is constructed and evaluated. This study of project charter components, combined with the development of a formal planning document for an authentic project in progress, provides an opportunity to introduce, validate, and integrate the concept of a formalized project initiation process. </jats:p>",

The SHAHRP study is unusual in that it has a primary aim of harm minimization rather than non‐use or delayed use. The SHAHRP intervention aims to reduce harm by enhancing students' abilities to identify and deal with high‐risk drinking situations particularly likely to be encountered by young people. The intervention involves eight lessons in the first year with five booster lessons in the subsequent year. The SHAHRP research will follow individual students exposed to both the alcohol and health promotion interventions over 3 successive years taking measures in: knowledge; attitudes; patterns of use; context of use; alcohol‐related harm associated with the student' own use; alcohol‐related harm associated with other people's use of alcohol. This paper describes the evidence‐based conceptual components and design of the study by providing a review of the health and drug education literature particularly related to components that have the potential of influencing behaviour.</jats:p>",

Using a data set of Internet domain name developed in the summer of 1998, I show that three regions—San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles—are the leading centers for Internet content in the United States in terms both of absolute size and of degree of specialization. In order to understand better how the industrial structure of a region impacts the formation of the Internet content business, I provide an analysis of how the commercialization of the Internet has changed from 1993 to 1998 and explore the relationship between existing industrial sectors and the specialization in commercial domain names. Over time there appears to be a stronger connection between Internet content and information-intensive industries than between Internet content and the industries providing the computer and telecommunications technology necessary for the Internet to operate. Although it is not possible to assign a definitive causal explanation to the relationships outlined here, this paper provides a first step in theorizing about the overall commercialization process of the Internet. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article offers a radical reinterpretation of the chronology of control over reproduction in England's history. It argues that, as a result of post–World War II policy preoccupations, there has been too narrow a focus in the literature on the significance of reductions in marital fertility. In England's case this is conventionally dated to have occurred from 1876, long after the industrial revolution. With a wider angle focus on “reproduction,” the historical evidence for England indicates that family planning began much earlier in the process of economic growth. Using a “compositional demography” approach, a novel social pattern of highly prudential, late marriage can be seen emerging among the bourgeoisie in the course of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There is also evidence for a more widespread resort to such prudential marriage throughout the population after 1816. When placed in this context, the reduction in national fertility indexes visible from 1876 can be seen as only a further phase, not a revolution, in the population's management of its reproduction.</jats:p>",

Data were collected over 28 weeks in 1997 at 2 FP clinics in the low-income harbour neighbourhood of North Jakarta. Among 486 consenting female FP clients, prevalence of chlamydial infection was 9.3%, gonorrhoea 1.2%, trichomoniasis 4.5% and syphilis 0.8%. Clinically observed abnormal vaginal discharge, cervical inflammation and vaginal lesions/ulcers were all associated with cervical infection ( P &lt; 0.05), but insufficiently sensitive (&lt; 60%). Clinical diagnosis for cervical infection had 48.8% sensitivity, 75.4% specificity, but only 18.3% positive predictive value (PPV). On-site Gram stains for gonorrhoea were 83.3% sensitive and 94.5% specific, but had only 16.1% PPV. Presence of mucopurulent cervicitis was only 39.6% sensitive for cervical STD, with PPV of only 16.3%. Development of an affordable and accurate detection tool for chlamydial infection remains the main obstacle to effective RTI/STD management in this population. </jats:p>",
