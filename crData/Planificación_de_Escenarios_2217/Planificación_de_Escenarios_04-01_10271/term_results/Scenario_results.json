A well drawn failure case illustration generates a good image of the failure event in the readers mind, thus succeeds in passing the failure knowledge to the reader. A carefully produced diagonal scenario expression has the same effect. We demonstrated the power of these two fundamentally different representations through an experiment: A failure case illustration alone was shown to a group of people who were asked to define a diagonal scenario expression for the case. The reverse test started from a diagonal scenario expression to reach an illustration that the group had no prior knowledge about. Our tests showed that people can produce a fairly good representation in the other form starting from either an illustration or a diagonal scenario alone.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The ever-increasing severe economic damage imposed on national and world wide economies by severe weather, the need for sufficient and safe water resources for an increasing world population, and the threat of adverse climate change led to this critical assessment of the state-of-the-art of weather modification (WM) and to a proposal of a road map for the future.</jats:p><jats:p>Special attention is given to rain enhancement because it is further developed than snowpack augmentation, hail suppression, tornado and hurricane modification, and other weather-related disaster control ideas. The question of what makes a rain enhancement experiment acceptable to the scientific community is answered by the World Meteorological Organization's (WMO) criteria, which address statistical evaluation, the measurement of rain, the understanding of nature's precipitation processes with the underlying physics and dynamics of clouds and cloud systems, and the transferability of experiment design. These criteria are no longer specific enough or satisfactory and will have to be reconsidered.</jats:p><jats:p>An actual WM experiment also involves a variety of techniques and technologies, aspects that need to be complemented by numerical modeling of clouds and cloud responses to seeding. Modeling also allows assessment of the extra-area effects, that is, detrimental effects of precipitation on adjacent areas. Assimilation models may be giving better estimates of the rain at the ground because they can integrate restricted information from radar and rain gauges with mesoscale meteorological and remote sensing, as well as hydrological, data. However, massive improvements in computer capacity are required to handle these problems.</jats:p><jats:p>Weather modification has been progressing very slowly in the past because of the enormity of the problem and the fact that the precipitation process is far from being understood. Considering that rain increases are attempted within a range of 10%–20%, the lack of knowledge at corresponding accuracy is particularly evident in the fields of cloud physics, cloud and cloud systems dynamics, weather forecasting, numerical modeling, and measuring technology.</jats:p><jats:p>Benefits of new intensive studies of precipitation processes will not be limited to WM; they are also vital to improving weather forecasting and climate change modeling. There is one additional aspect of WM; WM can also be used to test newly developed precipitation physics and models by studying if the clouds react to seeding in the predicted manner.</jats:p><jats:p>This article is a wake-up call to put more intellectual and financial resources into the exploration and modification of the precipitation processes in all their forms. All these points lead to the suggestion of an outline of a national precipitation research and weather modification program.</jats:p>",

As well as having to abandon NES, we would have to look for a different–for a nonnomological–way of accounting for the presence of natural regularities. Some natural regularities can be explained in terms of others. But once we get down to the level of the basic regularities–those that cannot be explained in terms of others–there is no plausible way of accounting for them in natural terms. Rather, the only explanatory approach with any prospect of acceptability is to suppose that the basic regularities are deliberately brought about by some supernatural personal agent or group of agents. This is what I call the personal‐agency approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Within the framework of the nuclear power plant lifetime issue, the assessment of the French 900 MWe (3-loops) series Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) integrity was performed. A simplified analysis has shown that one of the most severe loading condition is given by the small break loss of coolant accidents (SBLOCA) due to the pressurized injection of cold water (9°C) into the cold leg and down comer of the RPV. Two main physical phenomena, considered important for the RPV cooling transient, were identified during numerical application obtained with EDF CFD tools. These phenomena are the fluid flow separation and the plume oscillations in the down comer. In order to consolidate these numerical results with the EDF home code, called Code_Saturne, an experimental study has been carried out with the new EDF R&amp;D facility. This transparent experimental model is based on the representation at 1/2 scale of a cold leg and a third of down comer including a thermal shield. The experiments were realized by injecting of salt water flow (density effects) in the cold leg according to a similitude study based on Froude number conservation between experiments and reactor scenarios. Firstly, this paper presents the main qualitative experimental results, based essentially on visualizations of different injections of dyed salt water in the cold leg and in the down comer. The physical phenomena observed showed a qualitative good agreement between visualizations and numerical results. Secondly, this paper presents the first experimental results of the assessment of the fluid flow separation in the experimental model obtained with temperature probes inserted in the down comer. We showed, in the experiments analysis, the fluid flow separation and the jet oscillations were detected. The next step will consist to compare these quantitative experiments with numerical study which will be carry out with Code_Saturne.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Scenario analysis has been used as a technique to support strategy formulation for several decades. During scenario analyses, the effects of different possible futures (scenarios) on the performance of an organization are assessed. Moreover, actions are formulated to deal with these effects. This analysis may help organizations to prepare themselves to take effective actions when one of these futures manifests itself. A scenario approach to strategy formulation depends on intelligence gathering: one should (1) have relevant environmental information to build effective scenarios, and once a set of scenarios has been defined, one should (2) continuously monitor the environment to determine in what direction the future is moving. The usefulness of scenario analysis to focus intelligence activities—specifically the direction and analysis stages of the intelligence cycle—has been noted by several authors (e.g., Ellis, 1993; Tessun, 1997). In this chapter we will focus on scenario analysis as a tool to support the direction stage. In particular, scenario analysis may lead to a set of relevant early warning variables. Specific attention will be paid to the role of ICT tools (specifically groupware tools) to support the construction of scenarios and to derive a set of relevant early warning indicators.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Modellers of large-scale forestry scenario models face numerous challenges. Information and sub-models from different disciplines within forestry, along with statistical and mathematical methodology, have to be considered. The individual biological sub-models (i.e. models for recruitment, growth and mortality) applied in large-scale forestry scenario models are in general well documented and extensively evaluated. However, evaluations by means of full-scale comparisons of observed and predicted values for continuous forest areas, where the totality of the large-scale forestry scenario model including interactions between sub-models and other parts of the model, are considered, have rarely been seen. The aim of the present work was to test the totality of the Norwegian large-scale forestry scenario model AVVIRK-2000, and thereby evaluate the applicability of the model for use in management planning. The test was done by means of successive inventories and accurate recordings of treatments over a period of 30 years for a property comprising 78.5 ha forest-land. Seen in the perspective of management planning, the differences between observed and predicted values for potential harvest level, growing stock and growth were small, e.g. a difference between observed growing stock in year 2000 and growing stock in the same year predicted from 1970 of 2.6%. The model may therefore be applied for practical purposes without any fundamental changes or calibrations of the biological model basis. However, the present test should be seen as an example that failed to falsify the model, rather than a final validation. As long as the model is in practical use, further evaluations should continue and subsequent possible calibrations should be performed.</ja:p>"

Simple models of trapped charge distributions permit, next, quantitative estimates. With respect to the linear increase of δ from 0 towards its nominal value, δ0, the initial phase is characterized by a deficit of δ for incident spots in the submicron range and incident charge of a few 102 primary electrons (PEs). This deficit occurs even when charging is as a whole negative and it results from a partial mirror effect for the less energetic δP secondary electrons (SEs) (directly excited by the PEs) combined to attraction of δBSE (excited by the backscattered electrons) towards the central spot while the more energetic δp SEs are successively focused and next defocused. The next phase starts for incident charges in the pC range and it concerns the evolution of the total yield, δ+η from its nominal value up to the unity. Besides the increase of the SEE yield, the external slowing down of the PEs plays the main role in the compression of the distribution of newly trapped electrons. The main dynamical aspects of the internal field are also established and its influence on the trapped charge distribution is easily deduced. The present analysis is supported by some published data and the consequences concern any type of insulating material irradiated with defocused probes and “short” pulse excitation (for δ0 measurements) or stationary fine probes (for the investigation of the space charge effect by the mirror method) or scanning beams (in scanning electron microscopy).</jats:p>",

The cycles, already presented in a recent paper (ASME GT 2002-30117), have water/steam as working fluid, the compression phase both in liquid and vapour phase, the internal combustion between pure oxygen (O2) and chemically heated natural gas-based syngas, and the CO2 capture and sequestration by water condensation from the exhaust gas. The aim of the economic analyses is to estimate the investment per MW and the levelized discounted cost of the electricity (COE) produced by a power plant based on the cycles here proposed in comparison with a standard reference combined cycle power plant (SRCC). To evaluate the equipment costs, several cost functions of the most important operative parameters have been introduced and tuned with actual data. Using the least square regression technique, explicit functions of the COE have been proposed to highlight the cheapest operative conditions with a derivative approach. Moreover, a wide scenario analysis has been carried out, varying the most important investment parameters, as, for example, the discount rate. In particular, some maps of the COE and break-even carbon tax (BECT) behaviour have been constructed to test the importance of the market uncertainty on the economic results obtained. Finally, the possible technological progress effect on the BECT with a cost reduction of some innovative equipment and the O2 production has been investigated in depth with the 2k factorial design scenario analysis. The O2 production has resulted the most important parameter from the economic point of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Use of multimedia and new technologies has become very common in education and the corporate training industry. Unlike text-on-the-screen (page-turner) instructions, multimedia based interactions involve audio, video, animation and rich graphics. These attributes are very appealing to learners, and have become the predominant approach to deliver self-paced learning material. The use of multimedia and computer-based training has improved web-based as well as computer-based training and instructional delivery tremendously. However, providing an authentic learning experience requires much more than multimedia. It requires an active learning approach built on sound principles of instructional design. Scenario Based Learning (SBL) is an effective pedagogical approach which utilizes new technology and provides an excellent framework for active learning. This paper presents a SBL approach and its application to teach engineering. This approach will engage learners, increase their interest, improve knowledge retention, and facilitate understanding of the physical meaning behind abstract concepts.</jats:p>",

The X-ray source is located near the rim of a young (age &lt; 30 Myr), large (diameter ≈ 700 pc) ring-like star forming complex possibly triggered by the impact of a dwarf satellite galaxy through the gas-rich outer disk of NGC 4559. We speculate that galaxy interactions (including the infall of high-velocity clouds and satellites on a galactic disk) and low-metallicity environments offer favourable conditions for the formation of compact remnants more massive than “standard” X-ray binaries, and accreting from a massive Roche-lobe filling companion.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research has established that traditional linear, didactic approaches to teaching through lecturing are at best only tenuously connected to the ultimate aim of achieving competency. In order for classroom instruction to become relevant and meaningful, the process of learning must be motivating and exciting, and the basis of learning should be focused on discovering and not memorizing or regurgitation. We believe a guided discovery process is the most effective way to convert a passive classroom lecture into an engaging active learning experience. Scenario Based Learning (SBL) is an effective approach that provides an excellent framework for active learning. It offers an effective way of engaging learners and building competency mastery. This paper describes the initiatives currently underway at Cal Poly Pomona to develop and implement SBL approach to teach major concepts in basic freshmen and sophomore level engineering courses.</jats:p>",

The solution envisaged intends to verify the possibility of managing the accidental event within the pressure vessel, ensuring that the CORIUM is confined and cooled. The core catcher, elaborated at the DIMNP, is made of a ceramic pebbel bed (Alumina Al2O3) contained in a metallic or Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) structure. The paper illustrates a theoretical model to simulate the thermal-mechanical behaviour of the pebble beds under extremely high loads, developed by the authors. This model has been used to design the core catcher and to determine the effective conductivity and the effective stiffness of the pebble bed. These values have been used in order to implement a numerical model of the core catcher. The results of the thermal and mechanical coupled simulation have permitted to determine the maximum time that the core catcher could resist and the mechanical resistance of the core catcher in the case of RPV external or internal cooling. The preliminary analyses performed have emphasised the good performance of pebble bed core catcher in order to mitigate the envisaged severe accident.</jats:p>",

Used widely in business applications, it allows planners to anticipate problems, reevaluate assumptions, and reflect on consequences of those alternative futures. In this article, scenario planning is applied to public health, specifically to illustrate the four steps in scenario planning for public health using a health department’s desire to address chronic disease prevention and control. An unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are considered to be key risk factors. The scenarios are presented in table format and are for illustration purposes only. Many other plausible scenarios could be constructed. Scenario planning allows stake-holders to define a desired, shared vision of the future, but more important, they can better prepare public health professionals to be successful in a constantly changing environment. </jats:p>",

The main objective of the study was to investigate characteristics of the physicians&amp;apos; information needs to provide insight into the development of a conceptual guidance approach in information retrieval. The analysis focused on categories, search contexts, and patterns of the questions with respect to the scenarios. The results of the study showed that physicians&amp;rsquo; information needs exhibited distinct characteristics according to the scenarios, and that their needs could be expressed with a relatively small number of question patterns. These observations supported our approach of using patterns of information needs in facilitating digital information access.</jats:p>"

In this paper, the future emissions of greenhouse gases from Irish agriculture are projected using an economic model of the Irish agricultural sector. Coefficients from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used to convert the raw agricultural data from the economic model to emission levels. These projections are generated under two different scenarios: the first is a baseline result, which holds the present agricultural policy environment – the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) – constant for the projection period. The second result is the projection of emissions under a particular policy reform scenario. The effect of this scenario on emissions is measured relative to the baseline result.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paradigm shift that the Internet has brought about in communication has opened up a plethora of opportunities for outsourcing business processes (BPO) across continents. Success lessons in manufacturing sub-contracting are found to be relevant for under- standing the logic of BPO. Outsourcing involves transferring certain value contributing activities or processes to another firm to save costs and for the principal to focus on its areas of key competence. The possibilities of disaggregating value elements for the purpose of creating value in them at the sub-contractors‘ premises and final aggregation and synthesis at the parent organization are determined by the nature of industry, limitations of coordination and control, product maturity, and level of inter-firm competition. </jats:p><jats:p> IT-enabled services (ITES) includes services that can be outsourced using the powers of IT; the extent to which this is possible depends on the industry, location, time, costs, and managerial perception of the risks involved. The Internet has facilitated execution of several activities, previously done within geographical proximity to the firm, from remote low-labour cost locations, drawing both transaction cost and production cost efficiencies. </jats:p><jats:p> Some of the factors that come in the way of parents setting up their own operations in India and have significant implications for the growth trajectory of Indian BPOs are: direct cost of operations and scale economies long-term assessment of India as a low cost centre cost-benefit assessment of own vs rented possible loss of control over their transactions and confidentiality and security of the data if an outsider handles them brand implications of perceived drop in quality robustness of existing systems and processes. </jats:p><jats:p> Many BPO firms do not seem to realize the possible exit barriers and strategies to manage exit, if necessary. What happened in the dot com era can very well happen in the BPO space also unless care is taken to manage this rapid growth while retaining productivity and quality. </jats:p><jats:p> Two key capabilities required for success in ITES space are: capabilities to understand customer needs in the specific domains and acquiring business (BD capabilities) and capabilities to execute them efficiently (Ops capabilities). ITES firms are likely to bifurcate their firm into two parts based on these two critical success factors. </jats:p><jats:p> The successful segregation of value elements in a number of processes has enabled value configuration in as many ways as required by customers, both in the case of product and service components of customer value. The current trend in outsourcing will go up when such analysis-synthesis becomes a routine. This will be accelerated also because the capabilities required to do so depend not only on technical skills and knowledge in a domain but also strong process capabilities. </jats:p><jats:p> The trend of outsourcing is likely to continue to grow in the future despite temporary political protests because of the robust arguments outsourcing finds for itself in the economics literature, both in terms of transaction and production cost advantages. Sub- contractors need robust systems and processes along with adequate domain knowledge and assured physical infrastructure for this to happen. </jats:p><jats:p> In any case, the Indian BPO firms have to consistently prove their capabilities to deliver and create near indispensable situation for the parent to survive without them. This will not only involve growing technical and domain expertise, but also refinement in systems and practices, while keeping costs under control. In essence, BPO firms have to manage their consolidation and growth challenges simultaneously. </jats:p>",

The snowpack structure model SNOWPACK (developed at the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research) was used for calculating snow conditions at six different locations in Finland for the decades 1980–89 and 2080–89. Regional climate model (RCAO) data from the Rossby Centre, Sweden, were used as input to the SNOWPACK model. Ten years from the RCAO control run and scenario run were chosen, and the snow conditions for different snow zones were calculated for these winters. The snow-cover depth and duration decreased at all locations in the scenario run cases, and the snow-cover quality also changed between the control and scenario runs: grains were bigger, snow was warmer and denser, and the fraction of faceted snow decreased while the fraction of icy or melting snow increased, even in mid-winter. Finally, the variability between different global climate predictions was analyzed. Significant differences were found between different climate-model outputs. The inter-model variability is comparable to the interannual variability of a single model. The qualitative conclusions from the scenario run do not critically depend on the climate-model variability.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Behavior modeling has proved to be successful in helping uncover design flaws of concurrent and distributed systems. Nevertheless, it has not had a widespread impact on practitioners because model construction remains a difficult task and because the benefits of behavior analysis appear at the end of the model construction effort. In contrast, scenario-based specifications have a wide acceptance in industry and are well suited for developing first approximations of intended behavior; however, they are still maturing with respect to rigorous semantics and analysis tools.This article proposes a process for elaborating system behavior that exploits the potential benefits of behavior modeling and scenario-based specifications yet ameliorates their shortcomings. The concept that drives the elaboration process is that of\n            <jats:italic>implied scenarios</jats:italic>\n            . Implied scenarios identify gaps in scenario-based specifications that arise from specifying the global behavior of a system that will be implemented component-wise. They are the result of a mismatch between the behavioral and architectural aspects of scenario-based specifications. Due to the partial nature of scenario-based specifications, implied scenarios need to be validated as desired or undesired behavior. The scenario specifications are then updated accordingly with new positive or negative scenarios. By iteratively detecting and validating implied scenarios, it is possible to incrementally elaborate the behavior described both in the scenario-based specification and models. The proposed elaboration process starts with a message sequence chart (MSC) specification that includes basic, high-level and negative MSCs. Implied scenario detection is performed by synthesis and automated analysis of behavior models. The final outcome consists of four artifacts: (1) an MSC specification that has been evolved from its original form to cover important aspects of the concurrent nature of the system that were under-specified or absent in the original specification, (2) a behavior model that captures the component structure of the system that, combined with (3) a constraint model and (4) a property model that provides the basis for modeling and reasoning about system design.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Chinguetti Field was discovered in 2001 offshore Mauritania in 800 m of water. It comprises deepwater, mid-slope turbidite reservoirs, trapped in a dome over a salt diapir. The hydrocarbons are compartmentalised by concentric radial faults, in a low net:gross sequence, with oil mainly in channel sands. The large number of uncertain variables requires a structured approach and a rigorous assessment of the potential sub-surface scenarios. The field is of moderate size and risks in this deepwater environment need to be managed carefully.The main sub-surface uncertainties were identified by uncertainty framing and are briefly described in the paper. They include:structure;hydrocarbon contacts;fault seal;distribution of the channel systems;frequency and amalgamation of channel sands;shale drape;internal channel heterogeneity;effective pressure support;rock-fluid interaction;rock compaction;fluid composition/properties; androck properties.A statistical experimental design determined 27 scenarios should accurately model the probability distribution of reserves. A 3D model was made for each and run through the dynamic simulator to estimate economic ultimate recovery (EUR). Multivariate statistical analysis produced a response equation for EUR and the probability distribution. This is more rigorous than the standard method which produces mid, high and low case models, for which there is no adequate way to assign their probability of occurrence.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the framework of the \"SEISIMPACT-THES\" project (Koutoupes et al., 2004; Savvaidis et al., 2004) a GIS database has been designed to include information on a wide range of components related to seismic risk within the broader area of the prefecture of Thessaloniki. One of these components refers to the distribution of strong ground motion produced by large earthquakes and the ability of a potential future user of the database to retrieve information regarding the distribution of strong ground motion from past destructive earthquakes in the area of Thessaloniki, as well as relative information for realistic future scenario earthquakes in the same area. The selection of future scenario earthquakes that may affect this urban region of interest is based on a combined review of historical data, previous probabilistic and deterministic hazard assessments, seismotectonic and microseismicity studies, relocated seismicity in northern Greece and the experience gained from worldwide research. In this study we present the results from hypothetical rupture of one fault that is located at the suburbs of the city, the Asvestochori fault. Empirical relations applicable to Greece (Papazachos &amp; Papazachou 2003), as well as seismicity information are combined to determine the dimensions of the scenario earthquake source. Strong ground motion for the selected scenario is simulated using the stochastic method for finite faults (Beresnev and Atkinson, 1997). Uncertainties due to unknown parameters such as the rupture initiation point and the distribution of slip on the fault plane are taken into account by examining a large number of random scenarios. The average values from these multiple scenarios are then used to compile maps of strong ground motion parameters (e.g. peak ground acceleration and spectral acceleration). Although the examined scenario earthquake is moderate in size (Mw 5.2), the level of the resulting strong ground motion parameters is indicative of the potential destructiveness of the examined source. Due to the simplicity in the underlying assumptions of the stochastic method, the results of this study are a first-order approximation to the problem of defining expected shaking in the wider area of Thessaloniki. Other strong motion simulation methods of more deterministic character will also be applied for the same purpose in the framework of the SEISIMPACT-THES project.</jats:p>"
