      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper considers how NHS Direct is affecting demand for primary care in particular out‐of‐hours services from GPs. This is reviewed through a 3‐year study of NHS Direct and HARMONI, the integrated telephone health helpline based in West London. It describes the policy background and development of the services on the site, and some of the outcomes of the HARMONI commissioned research to answer the question ‘Has NHS Direct increased the workload for HARMONI doctors?’.</jats:p><jats:p>The research adopted both a qualitative and quantitative approach using cross‐sectional and longitudinal analysis of the data collected. The analysis of the data reveals the issues as both complex and dynamic in nature. The research shows that while there has been no significant change to the total volume of activity, changes within patient groups notably the elderly and children, and in individual GP practices may be significant. In addition, the changes in organizational arrangements may influence significant changes in referral patterns such as GP out‐of‐hours visits. This was confirmed in the interview data indicating a link between the change in nurses' role from gatekeeper to patient advocate, which happened when they ceased to be employees of the part‐time co‐op and began to work instead for the 24 hours, 7 days a week NHS Direct service.</jats:p><jats:p>The conclusions drawn are that behavioural and organizational changes are at least as significant as the evidence‐based computerized decision support software in changing the demand for primary care. Further evidence cited is that a different demand pattern of calls was experienced by those local GPs not integrated into out‐of‐hours provision at NHS Direct West London at the time of the study.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>German town planners are increasingly involved in development projects outside Germany. These projects comprise town planning ventures in the developing countries of the ‘Third World’. German universities have taken steps to contribute to this development manifold. In this context online courses are considered particularly suitable for advancing and intensifying the North-South Dialog. The University of Oldenburg has been offering such online-courses during the last 8 years. The questions that arise in a spatial context are: What lessons can be learned from town planners in developing countries and which of the experiences gained in Europe will advance North-South cooperation. The evaluation and experience of an online course carried out with young professionals of 15 Developing Countries allow the identification of both common features and differences.</jats:p>"

Today, the increased dependency on technology and tighter requirements in terms of recovery speed imposed on e‐business and Web‐based services have made recovery plans more complex. Disaster recovery planning, which plans for failures of components of the IT infrastructure and system or network outages, misconfigurations, and natural disasters, should be treated as a necessity by conscious system administrators, managers, and CEOs. In this chapter we discuss disaster recovery planning, illustrating the main phases of the planning process and the techniques that can be used to provide for recovery.</jats:p>",

This paper aims to investigate the role of artography, in relation  with the study of regional development, especially in relation with the preparation of map types that are relevant and need for both planning and regional development processes. Planners have agreed that maps are highly neede in the planning process, but much is still debated as to ways of presentation, contents of theme, and suitable scala for planning purposed. There are two groups of maps neede by planners, i.e. status maps that are neede before planning and maps that are neede during the planning process. The selection of how much information needed to be drawn on maps for the aims of regional planning, is a difficult problem to solve and also challenge for us, especially geographers. This paper is only a desription of our contribution of thoughts, not based on any research, but is a compilation from various source/ideas, particularly from cartographer who are experienced in their new field, i.e. “Regional Planning Cartography”.</jats:p>"

The success of this endeavor is dependent on many factors, such as advertising, marketing, and the trends of the consumer. Success is usually measured in the amount of goods or services sold as well as pages viewed and registered users. As this success grows, the challenge is to provide a system that is not overengineered but at the same time is robust enough to provide the required services at an acceptable level of performance. In this sense, the development of a Web‐based system is an exercise in optimization that balances cost versus performance and benefit to the end customer or consumer. This optimization exercise is referred to as capacity planning. This chapter explores the discipline of capacity planning and describe some of the key components, tools, and processes used to perform effective capacity planning.</jats:p>",

Yet existing approaches to health system analysis often fail to capture the complexity of the responses required to address this challenge. In this paper we describe the results of a pilot study using a rapid appraisal technique to assess the performance of the health care system in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet central Asian republic. The study focuses on diabetes, a condition whose effective management requires a coordinated response involving many components of the health care system. The study sets out a conceptual framework in which the system is seen from the perspectives of users, health professionals and policy‐makers. It sees the effective delivery of health care as dependent on appropriate investment in human, physical, intellectual and social resources. The study reveals important weaknesses in all of these areas, although it also notes that current policies, while constrained by the legacy of the past and by limited resources, are beginning to tackle them. This pilot study indicates that rapid appraisal, using a condition such as diabetes, where those affected can be easily identified, offers a means of gaining important insights into a health care system.

Documentation of these assessment techniques helped the department obtain a six-year accreditation by the TAC-ABET commission. The twelve assessment methods described in this paper form a part of strategic planning process that is normally followed in the School of Engineering and Applied Science. The principle is to document how the department keeps tabs on its education commitment. The assessment practices adopted by the department effectively incorporate the feedback received, in a constructive manner. Furthermore, the department has concentrated its efforts on developing a mechanism that primarily focuses on closing the loop, in each of the twelve methods outlined.</jats:p>",

In more than 30 years of evolution, ERP systems have undertaken a significant transformation from function‐specific applications to fully integrated process‐driven systems that operate over the Internet. ERP is identified as an extended enterprise management system that integrates traditional ERP applications (manufacturing, distribution, financials, human resources, marketing, and sales) with supply chain management (SCM), customer relationship management (CRM), and B2B e‐commerce applications. The chapter describes the main ERP principles—integration and automation—as well as ERP features—process‐driven systems, single database, company‐wide information, scalability, etc. It also focuses on the ERP groups of applications emphasizing the core applications, application enhancements, and e‐commerce solutions. The chapter details ERP benefits and drawbacks. It discusses ERP solutions for various industries and small companies and presents ERP hosting utilizing applications service providers (ASP). Finally, the chapter describes the ERP selection and implementation process, concentrating on selection criteria and implementation measurements.</jats:p>",

For this purpose we represent a method which utilizes a special class of rational curves called Rational Frenet-Serret (RF) [8] curves for robot trajectory planning. RF curves distinguished by the property that the motion of their Frenet-Serret frame is rational. We describe an algorithm for interpolation of positions by a rational Frenet-Serret motion. Further more we provide an analysis on spatial frames (Frenet-Serret frame and Rotation Minimizing frame) for smooth robot arm motion and investigate their applications in sweep surface modeling.</jats:p>",

Truly complete security protects three areas: (1) internal network and application services, (2) perimeter network access and application services, and (3) external network and services. To minimize security risks in these areas as well as to raise overall confidence in the e-commerce service, businesses must address problems with practical solutions involving privacy and security. Establishing an e-commerce trust infrastructure encompasses confidentiality, data integrity, non-repudiation and authentication. Striking the right balance between functionality and accessibility in e-commerce demands technical security measures. It also requires management vigilance with non-technical measures such as routine assessments of vulnerabilities, policies, education and a focus on making processes and policies easy to understand and simple to implement and monitor compliance.</jats:p>"

The overall purpose of this paper is to examine the interplay between Swedish municipal planning and information technology (IT). More specifically, the focus is on the use of IT as a means to stimulate local development and on the difference that space makes in this process. A theory of IT planning as a spatio-temporal learning process is developed in an attempt to highlight the links between space, time and thought-and-action in relation to IT. </jats:p>\n     <jats:p>The summary of an inquiry covering 85% of the municipalities in Sweden is presented along with five case studies of the municipalities of Arvidsjaur, Arvika, Gotland, Helsingborg and Ystad. Some general tendencies within Swedish planning today and the role of planning in a flexible political economy are outlined. The paper concludes with a discussion about the connections between IT, municipal planning and geographical rationalities.</jats:p>"

Since the introduction of the Doi Moi policy in 1987, health care services have been liberalized, medical practitioners have received the right to open private hospitals and private pharmacies are booming.

The costs were allocated to cost centres and cost units by a stepping‐stone method.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Major findings</jats:title><jats:p>As expected, the average costs per inpatient day at a central hospital are about 300% of the costs of provincial hospitals and about 600% of the costs of district hospitals. However, the costs of some laboratory procedures and operations done at district hospitals are higher than those of provincial or even central hospitals. The main reason for the high costs of some procedures at district hospitals was the low quantity of these procedures at that level. This is a strong indicator that some procedures, in particular major operations, should not be performed in Vietnamese district hospitals.

This condition constitutes the features characteristic of the living space which consist of natural and social environment. One of the natural environment elements, neede to the spatial lay-out planning, is the dynamis geomorphology. The process of the dynami is some times accelerated and increased by natural and anthropogenic factors. The abnormality in both acceleration and the increase will cause a natural disaster, which is based on the landscape approach it is called the geomorphologic hazard. In connection with such event thematic map of geomorphologic hazard describes the disaster susceptibility of an area. The geomorphologic hazard map is an output map whose information is obtainable from thematic map conneting with population, land use, topography, geomorphology, rainfall, hydrological data, and slope classification. Both land use and population maps desccribes the anthropogenic factors. The role of the geomorphologic hazard map, in the planning of spatial lay-out and environmental management, i.e. preventive, represive, rehabilitative, and serves as the basis for interpretation and management of living spere. By putting geomorphologic hazard into map compilation of spatial lay-out (cultural and non cultural area map) a footstep advance is the reached to guarantee human security and their treasures, and human well-being as an integral part of human living prosperity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Akhir-akhir ini, setidaknya sejak lima tahun terakhir banyak kalangan yang menyangsikan relevansi dan keandalan teori dan praktik perencanaan kota konvensional (Rational Comprehensif Planning/ Prosedural Planning) yang selama ini dianut. Diperkirakan tidak lebih dari 30 persen dari materi yang tertuang dalam rencanaa-rencana kota di Indonesia yang dapat diimplementasikan. Tulisan ini dimaksudkan untuk mengkaji teori dan praktik Rational Comprehensif Planning dalam konteks Indonesia. Rational Comprehensif Planning (RCP) merupakan model perencanaan yang sangat dipengaruhi oleh Classical Scientific Method yang dilandasi oleh pendangan postivisme dan Cartesian – Newtonian. RCP ditegakkan atas asas rasionalitas. Dalam lingkup perencanaan identik dengan menggunakan pendekatan keilmuan (scientific approach) di dalam proses penganalisaan dan cara pemecahan masalah. Dengan demikian, rasionalitas menuntut dasar pertimbangan yang sistematik dan evaluasi yang tepat terhadap berbagai alternatif cara untuk mencapai tujuan. Untuk dapat menerapkan rasionalitas dalam proses perencanaan maka di samping diperlukan perencanaan yang ‘serba tahu’ dan mampu mensintesiskan semua persoalan yang muncul, juga dibutuhkan informasi yang lengkap dan menyeluruh dalam cakupan perencanaan. Di Barat RCP sudah mengalami fase krisis, di Indonesia model perencanaan ini sedang mengalami masa puncak dengan RUTRK-nya. Di sini terlihat bahwa kita tertinggal cukup jauh dalam hal perkembangan pemikiran tentang perencanaan. Sejak lima tahun terakhir muncul berkembang beberapa paradigma lain yang lebih berorientasi pada kkomitmen kerakyatan, sebagai akibat ketidakpuasannya terhadap RCP yang dianggap kurang berhasil menyelesaikan konflik tata ruang di kota yang cenderung intensitasnya semakin meningkat.</jats:p>"

Despite the fact that the web phenomenon is relatively new in the profession and not yet entirely explored, there is evidence which suggests that e-services are amongst the most rapidly growing sectors in the profession today. Numerous e-technologies for planning purposes have already been developed, and often fully integrated into the planning practice. This paper explores the state of the art in the field, and discusses the way the e-based alternative could be utilized in everyday planning practice. At the outset, the existing know-how is presented, followed by the assessment of the tools against the principles of a good planning practice. The challenges to the alternative are highlighted in the last section, and debated vis-?-vis the observed benefits. Implications for concrete planning practice are at the heart of the overall discussion.</jats:p>"

Together these successful activities of municipal economic policy make a noticeable contribution to the local growth of employment (“local policies matter”).</jats:p>"

It’s major objective is to offer products with delivery times and prices comparable to mass produced goods. Hereby assigned possibilities are not only limited to the customization of appearance but affect a multitude of customer requirements, e.g. functions, technical attributes, or structural arrangements. Two major steps in designing customizable products are the product structure planning and the designing of CAD-models. The work presented in this paper specifies the mutual interdependencies as well as the data, which has to be exchanged in this alternating process. For an iteratively optimized planning of customizable products, knowledge will be extracted from parametric design for a further adaptation in the product spectrum structure. Using appropriate algorithms, the need for structure modifications will be derived, with the objective of eliminating critical interdependencies from the basic structure. The alternating data exchange between parametric product modeling and abstract structure planning helps to integrate bi-directional requirements (e.g. new techniques in manufacturing) or boundary conditions appearing at different design phases.</jats:p>",

The author contends that epidemiological data or needs assessment surveys should collect data to provide information on the epidemiology of different stages of the caries process in order to enable planners to design tailored programs to prevent dental caries. In a rapidly progressing caries environment, conventional approaches to delivering preventive measures may not work. The author also contends that dental public health programs should expand their vision to influence how dentists are detecting, diagnosing and managing dental caries. Dentists’ restorative decisions have significant impact on the oral health status of a nation. Henceforth, detecting the early or noncavitated caries level and preventing these lesions from progressing to the cavitated stage (or being restored) could have a significant impact on the oral health status around the world. There is a need for more research on the best methods to detect, prevent and treat early carious lesions.</jats:p>"

By its main concern on area planning, i. e. the availability of planning apparatus at local (regional) level, comprehensive local (rural) resource analysis, and multi-disciplinary approach, it is expected that the weakneses of centralized planning which, among others, concentrates on economic growth can be reduced or even eliminated. This paper tries to explain the place of social service planning in the rural development concept above. The approach used is by discussing the place of service planning in the national development policies; collective decision making system, especially related to planning procedure and process; and social service problems in rural areas. </jats:p>"

Concerning the spatial order, the water is greatly needed in a variety of life. As the other resources, the reserve of the water also get limited. Because of its limitation, it is necessary to control the potential water sources in a territory before determining a design of good spatial order.

The paper reviews examples of innovative applications of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Sustainability Appraisal (SA), in relation to EU Structural Funds, the new generation of UK Regional Plans, and UK Multi-Model Transport Corridor studies.

Our work with over 30 Non‐Governmental Organizations (NGOs) implementing USAID's Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP)‐funded projects revealed the need for a study to develop a framework for sustainability assessment in these projects. We surveyed NGO informants and project managers through semi‐structured interviews and questionnaires. This paper summarizes our study findings.</jats:p><jats:p>The NGOs share key values about sustainability, but are skeptical about approaches perceived as disconnected from field reality. In their experience, sustainable achievements occur through the interaction of capable local stakeholders and communities. This depends strongly on enabling conditions, which NGO projects should advance. Sustainability assessment is multidimensional, value‐based and embeds health within a larger sustainable development perspective. It reduces, but does not eliminate, the unpredictability of long‐term outcomes. It should start with the consideration of the ‘local systems’ which need to develop a common purpose.</jats:p><jats:p>Our ability to address the complexity inherent to sustainability thinking rests with the validity of the models used to design interventions. A participant, qualitative research approach helped us make sense of sustainability in NGO field practice. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

This paper argues that land-use planning officers need to have an understanding of these wider factors in order to award public anxieties an appropriate weight. It tests this contention by examining planning officers' understandings of public concern about the environmental risks posed by waste-to-energy incinerators. Recommendations are made as to how public concern can be accurately and transparently assessed in terms of a full range of psycho-sociological factors. </jats:p>",

The Internet as a marketing channel is interactive, accessible, ubiquitous, and integrates marketing communication with commercial transactions and service delivery. As a channel, the Internet both sends content to an audience, and acts as a route to a group of customers. In order to build presence, e‐merchants enter a world of new marketing concepts such as banner ads, click through, affiliate networks, URL's and portals. The role and value of brands takes on new dimensions. The potential for building relationships is inherent in every transaction and dialog. No longer does the marketer need to speculate about customer needs; they actually know customer‐purchasing profiles. Customer service, customer profiles and customisation present important marketing opportunities. Value creation both requires and strengthens mutual dependence. Communities, including customer communities and virtual business communities are important contexts through which mutual value can be created. By drawing a broad picture of marketing communication in an Internet world, this article seeks to establish a context for innovation, development and research.</jats:p>",

Promoted by central government, which has emphasised the overarching role of the Frameworks as a key reference for all regional plans, strategies and policies, their preparation and use in practice has offered scope for innovation and variety which are revealing of the relationships and tensions between various interests at the regional level. This paper assesses the effectiveness of the Frameworks, focusing in particular on their use in practice in appraising the sustainability of other regional plans and strategies, and their role in resolving conflicts. The paper also examines their role in integrating a consistent understanding of sustainable development, and reflects on the implications for different meanings of sustainability. It draws on work commissioned by the English Regions Network from CAG Consultants and Oxford Brookes University. A central aim of the research project was to evaluate how effective RSDFs have been in providing a direction and a vision for regional activity to progress sustainable development.</jats:p>"

For the Rhine-Main area, on the other hand, a regional structure has been introduced with the Conurbation Act that has been less successful since its introduction in 2001. Instead the debate on how the Rhine-Main region should be structured and which kind of regulation such a polycentric urban agglomeration needs has broken out again. This article attempts to outline current regionalisation processes taking the theoretical approach of action-theoretical social geography as a point of departure and to identify constellations of actors who are currently occupied with developing suggestions for a future- and policy-oriented regional structure in the Rhine-Main area or with asserting their influence in the corresponding debate. In order to do this, different examples of regional initiatives and organisations are presented and questioned critically in terms of their significance and effectiveness.</jats:p>"

The studies also highlighted concern that multiple placements have a deleterious impact on children. As a consequence, permanency planning frameworks were developed to address the problems of welfare drift, the essence of permanency planning being timely decision-making and concurrent planning. However, there appear to be some systemic issues impacting on the application of the permanency planning framework. There also remains a policy preference for family preservation, which adversely affects permanency planning. The need is to conceptualise permanency planning as existing along a continuum of planning options for children, co-existing with family preservation models.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems offer a software-based system that handles an enterprise’s total information system needs in an integrated fashion. Such systems have seen a significant growth in the last decade in the US, Europe and Australian markets and, more recently, increasing growth in Asian countries. This increase in demand for ERP systems in Asia offers opportunities for the provision of high-quality ERP education programs in the region. This paper describes the issues and barriers associated with integrating ERP systems into university curricula. It outlines the experiences of Victoria University in offering ERP education through a strategic alliance with SAP. The University is extending its offshore programs by offering ERP education in the region to take advantage of the current increase in demand in ERP applications. To assist with the delivery of offshore ERP education an ERP e-Learning model has been developed that integrates synchronous and asynchronous content. Asynchronous e-learning does not involve the presence of a teacher. Typically the learning content is located on a web server that students can access using the Internet. Synchronous e-learning requires the learner and teacher to be present in the event at the same time. It is a real-time, instructor-led online learning event in which all participants are available at the same time and can communicate directly with each other. The model uses four technologies to facilitate teaching: application service provision (ASP), web-CT, computer-based training and virtual classroom technology. The ERP e-learning model provides an innovative and efficient means to deliver ERP curriculum. It is able to provide greater flexibility in offshore subject delivery and to maximise student learning outcomes. This is particularly relevant in light of recent international medical (SARS) and terrorists incidents.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>As part of organizations' drive towards supply chain integration. Collaborative Planning (CP) emerged in the late 1990s. Lack of visibility of demand (in the form of point of sale data) and inventory holding status across the supply chain, together with adversarial relationships between trading partners remain as significant barriers to the goal of supply chain integration. Collaborative planning, originating from the consumer packaged goods industry, is an approach that promises to overcome these barriers, and seeks through joint planning and development of a clearer understanding of the dynamics of the supply chain replenishment process to deliver some of the promised benefits of actual supply chain integration. A case study of six organizations across three tiers of a supply chain in the UK grocery sector identifies many critical enablers and inhibitors at strategic, tactical and operational levels, both between and within the case study organizations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A widespread method employed in product planning is to use quality function deployment (QFD), which provides a means of translating a single customer’s needs into a product’s design requirements. Whereas, mass customization oriented product family planning should translate a group of different customers’ needs into all kinds of engineering characteristics in a product family life cycle by mapping the complicated information between adjacent stages of a product family development cycle so that the customer group’s needs can be carried out in a product family, which needs to develop a batch of products at the same time. Unfortunately, there is lack of a tool to supporting the product family planning at present. Aiming at this problem, this paper proposes a new approach to extend the house of quality (HoQ) in order to fulfill the product family planning for mass customization. Firstly, hypergraph (HG) theory and QFD are brought together, and the processes of information mapping between the adjacent stages of a product family development cycle are described through a relational hypergraph (RH). Secondly, primary-input driven paths in a relational hypergraph, which represent the different information at the same domain in a HoQ, are placed on the left or at the bottom of a HoQ, and secondary-input paths in a relational hypergraph, which represent the different information at the adjacent domain in a HoQ, are placed at the middle array of a HoQ, an extended HoQ (EHoQ) is obtained according to the method described as above, which provides the tool of planning a batch of products at the same time. Finally, the process of translating a group of different customer group’s needs into engineering characteristics is illustrated by means of an EHoQ.</jats:p>",

We must develop products which both benefit the individual Business Unit customer base, and which create synergy to produce the best possible offerings to the broader marketplace. The knowledge we gain through customer contacts and direct customer participation provides the basis from which we develop the Technology Road Map. This Road Map development process can be compared to painting a picture, where the background colors and features correspond to drivers related to the Customer and the prevailing features of the market environment. The subsequent layers of detail include broad Technical Objectives and then specific Technical Goals which will support achieving those Objectives.

Non governmental organizations (NGOs) are frontline implementers of low‐cost and effective child health interventions, but their progress toward sustainable child health gains is a challenge to evaluate. This paper presents the Child Survival Sustainability Assessment (CSSA) methodology—a framework and process—to map progress towards sustainable child health from the community level and upward. The CSSA was developed with NGOs through a participatory process of research and dialogue.</jats:p><jats:p>Commitment to sustainability requires a systematic and systemic consideration of human, social and organizational processes beyond a purely biomedical perspective. The CSSA is organized around three interrelated dimensions of evaluation: (1) health and health services; (2) capacity and viability of local organizations; (3) capacity of the community in its social ecological context. The CSSA uses a participatory, action‐planning process, engaging a ‘local system’ of stakeholders in the contextual definition of objectives and indicators. Improved conditions measured in the three dimensions correspond to progress toward a sustainable health situation for the population. This framework opens new opportunities for evaluation and research design and places sustainability at the center of primary health care programming.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In Class III malocclusion, the overjet is reduced and may be reversed, with one or more incisor teeth in lingual crossbite. In the early mixed dentition, and in older patients with mild skeletal discrepancies, orthodontic treatment usually involves proclining the maxillary anterior teeth into positive overjet. When the permanent dentition has established, orthodontic therapy is usually aimed at compensating for the underlying mild-moderate Class III skeletal discrepancy by proclining and retroclining the maxillary and mandibular incisors, respectively. In contrast, adolescent and non-growing patients with severe Class III skeletal discrepancies require a combination of orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery to correct the underlying skeletal pattern. Adolescent patients with moderately severe skeletal discrepancies require careful treatment planning because they are often at the limits of orthodontic compensation, and further mandibular growth may prevent a stable Class I occlusion from being maintained with growth. In this situation, treatment should be limited to aligning the maxillary arch, accepting that orthognathic surgery will be required to correct the underlying Class III skeletal discrepancy when skeletal growth has been completed. This article will inform dental professionals about the aetiology, assessment, diagnosis and treatment of patients with Class III malocclusions. Specifically, the types of orthodontic treatment that can be completed at the various stages of dental development and skeletal growth will be discussed. </jats:p>",

Historically the reserve margin has been less than 20 percent, although new generation is introduced every year. In the planning for new plants, consideration must be given to the location, choice of fuel, environmental impact and in a democratic society, their public acceptance. Based on projected growth demand, a decision was made in 1996 to build a 4,000 MW gas fired combined cycle power plant at the Dah Tarn location. The project has offered many opportunities to international equipment suppliers and local contractors. As a government entity, Taiwan Power Company follows the Government Procurement Law in procurement of equipment and services which is designed for open and fair competition and protection of the interests of the Owner. The uniqueness of the site and its surroundings, and the division of work between participants has presented some design and engineering problems that need to be overcome in the execution of this plant.</jats:p>",

This paper attempts a system level modeling for sheet metal process planning for integration purposes. Many attempts have been made in the past proposing sheet metal process planning systems at implementation level based on product data models. However, process planning activity is knowledge intensive. An effective system is possible only if both data and knowledge models form a basis for it. This paper describes modeling a sheet metal process planning system before actual implementation, with data and knowledge models as a basis. Previous attempts at sheet metal process planning concentrated only on implementation and limited categories of data models. Moreover in these attempts data and knowledge models have been proposed without attempting to relate the two. The same have been over come in the present work. A frame work consisting of data and knowledge models for process planning is also proposed and discussed.</jats:p>",

Faculty who are motivated to plan assessments and use outcome data should take leadership in the process.  The process consists of determining the outcomes to be assessed, the measures to be used, and the standards to be reached.  When data has been collected, it must be evaluated and used to make improvements.  Finally, the assessment process itself should be assessed.  This article gives examples of assessment methods for all levels of assessment at the institution, but especially at the program and course levels.  A departmental assessment blueprint is included.

This new policy field deals with the complex subject of a balanced and sustainable development of the European territory. In spite of the ambitious objectives a respective competence at community level shall not be established. Common goals shall be achieved by voluntary co-operation. The institutional context in the field is marked by a permanent risk of high and unilateral costs of transaction and this in turn presses even actors willingly to co-operate to choose the exit option. The framework of co-operation turns into a new trap, which can block the co-operation process. This can be avoided if actors accept a stronger coupling of their co-operation.</jats:p>"

This paper introduces an agent based optimization algorithm that combines stochastic optimization techniques with knowledge based search. The motivation is that such a merging takes advantage of the benefits of stochastic optimization and accelerates the search process using domain knowledge.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most transportation problems consist of moving carriers of stationary cargo. Pipelines are unique in the sense that they are stationary carriers of moving cargo. As a consequence, the planning problem of these systems has singularities that make it very challenging. In this paper we present the Pipesworld model, a transportation problem inspired by the transportation of petroleum derivatives in Petrobras’ pipelines. Pipesworld takes into account important features like product interface constraints, limited product storage capacities and due dates for product delivery. The relevance and unique characteristics of Pipesworld has been recognized by the Artificial Intelligence planning community. Pipesworld has been selected as one of the benchmark problems to be used in the Fourth International Planning Competition, a biannual event to benchmark the state-of-the-art general purpose artificial planning systems. We report the results obtained by general purpose artificial intelligence planning systems when applied to the Pipesworld instances. We also analyze how different modelling techniques may be used to significantly improve the planners’ performance. Although the basic algorithms of these planners do not incorporate any specific knowledge about the pipeline transportation problem, the results obtained so far are quite satisfactory. We also describe our current work in developing Plumber, a dedicated solver, aimed to tackle effective operational situations. Plumber uses general purpose planning techniques but also incorporates domain specific knowledge and may work together with a human expert during the planning process. By applying Plumber to the Pipesworld instances, we compare its performance against general purpose planning systems. Preliminary tests with a first version of Plumber shows that it already outperforms Fast-Forward (FF), one of the best available general purpose planning systems. This shows that improved versions of Plumber have the potential to effectively deal with pipeline transportation operational scenarios.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Life cycle management of RPV heads is a significant issue for utilities with PWR plants. Experience has shown the potential for primary water stress corrosion cracking (PWSCC) of the Alloy 600 CRDM nozzles and/or Alloy 182 J-groove welds which can lead to leaks if allowed to propagate. Non-destructive examinations to detect the PWSCC at an early stage are expensive and potentially time consuming while failure to perform timely inspections can lead to leaks, boric acid corrosion, and the possible need to perform repairs during outages when no provisions have been made for inspections or repairs. Decisions regarding the optimum long term strategic plan can be made based on economic modeling of alternative strategies in combination with probabilistic risk modeling based on plant-specific and industry generic inspection results. This paper describes the key factors in developing a strategic plan that takes into account planned costs, potential repair costs, costs of lost production, and other consequential costs, while ensuring safety. Modeling tools discussed include welding residual stress analyses, fracture mechanics calculations, crack initiation and growth modeling, and probabilistic Monte Carlo simulation.</jats:p>",

This has resulted in enlargement of the spatial data market. New technologies, presented in computer applications, have greatly expanded the number of users of these products. The philosophy of spatial data collecting has changed; analogue maps and plans printed on paper have been replaced by digital data bases which enable their presentation in a way that is the best for a particular user. Further, digital spatial data bases provide the possibility of their further upgrading by users. The two aspects, with respect to circumstances mentioned above, are very important in the process of data bases production and distribution. Firstly, the users of these data bases should be the ones who decide which of the available bases could satisfy their requirements, or in other words, what is the data quality level necessary for a certain application. On the other hand, the visualization of digital data bases could often mislead, since review of data bases could present data with better accuracy then the actual one. Thus, certain methods that would point to a quality of the selected data in the process of their analysis should be available to users. Specific, already adopted international standards, or specially developed procedures and methodologies, so called de facto standards, could be used in this data processing, enabling the estimation of these data quality. The development of Open GIS concept requires the adoption of widely accepted standards for spatial data quality. It is recommended that ISO standards should be accepted, firstly TC211 standards which are related to geographic information and geomatics. The realization of projects on ISO standards should be finished by 2006, so, all participants of these data bases should be both familiar with this project and ready to adapt to the given solutions. The basic components defining quality of data bases are explained by this work, and the results of the standardization regarding the procedures and methodology of their quality assessment, obtained so far, are also presented.</jats:p>"

An optimization approach is adopted to rationally evaluate these characteristics. In this approach, on/off and rated/part load status of operation of equipment and energy flow rates are determined so as to minimize the hourly energy charge subject to satisfaction of energy demand requirements. In this optimization problem, performance characteristics of the microturbine and desiccant air-conditioning units are modeled in consideration of the influence due to ambient air temperature. Moreover, the influence due to ambient air humidity is also considered in the desiccant air-conditioning unit using the psychrometric diagram. The implementation of the numerical analysis method, discussed in this paper, to two cogeneration systems, clearly shows economic and operational benefits of using desiccant air-conditioning.</jats:p>",

Through effective utilization of the Web and Java technologies, this system is independent of the operating system, scalable and service-oriented, and can be used by a geographically distributed design team to organize concurrent engineering design activities effectively.</jats:p>",

The manufacturing processes of job shop operations are rather complex, especially at shop floors where highly mixed products in small batch sizes are handled simultaneously. In addition to the fluctuating job shop operations, unpredictable events like job delay, urgent job insertion, fixture shortage, missing tool, and even machine break-down, are regularly challenging the job shop operations. Targeting the fluctuations, this research proposes a DPP (distributed process planning) approach to generate process plans that are responsive and adaptive to the changes. In this paper, a function block enabled approach is introduced. It is expected that the new approach can largely enhance the dynamism of fluctuating job shop operations.</jats:p>",

In an experiment, auditors from different industry specializations complete a hypothetical audit case set in a specific (bank) industry, which creates either a match or a mismatch between the auditors' industry specialization and the hypothetical client's industry. Furthermore, I manipulate the industry-specific case information to achieve differential audit risk levels. I also provide the auditors with a set of preliminary audit procedures and a constrained time budget. I find that the auditors' knowledge of the client's industry improves their audit risk assessments and directly influences the nature and the perceived quality of their audit-planning decisions. In addition, the auditors' knowledge of the client's industry moderates the sensitivity of the auditors' planning decisions to their audit risk assessments.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mobile inverted pendulum robots consist of an elongated pendulum body with two motors mounted on it for driving the wheels. The velocity and position control of such a vehicle is challenging because of the coupling of the pendulum’s pitch angle from the vertical and the Cartesian motion of the vehicle. On using a nonlinear transform to effect partial feedback linearization, the system dynamics transforms to two subsystems: a linear system with the vehicle’s pitch and in-plane orientation, and a nonlinear system of internal dynamics. In this paper, the problem of utilizing such a partial feedback linearization for optimal trajectory planning of such vehicles is considered. Due to the resulting linear subsystem with vehicle pitch and in-plane orientation, these configuration variables can be controlled by a linear controller (C) using a nonlinear feedback. The planning approach presented in this paper considers the time-constant (τ) of the linear controller C explicitly. A band-limited Sinc-function interpolation is used to plan the variables in the method of collocation. This ensures that high frequency signal content which cannot be handled by the controller C, is absent in the planned trajectory, making the plan better implementable by the controller. The planned trajectory takes the vehicle from point to point, while keeping the vehicle pitch bounded and avoiding obstacles. The optimality condition considered in the algorithm is the length of the path. The optimization problem posed after collocation, is then solved using a standard Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) solver. Simulation results show that the tracking controller C is able to follow the planned trajectory when no initial planar Cartesian error is present.</jats:p>",

The goals of the research area 1) to know actually the distribution of arial zoning at pollution level of the groundwater; 2) to determine the priority scale of clean water supply. Data analysis used in the researh are tendentious analysis and geographical information system. The result shows that groundwater quality at the research place decreases. It can be proved by tendentious analysis that most of the groundwater quality conentration parameter – after being examined – the lower plae, the higher conentration. There are 21 quality parameters used for that research, 15 out of those have an inclining tendency, while the others are flat and decline. The result of 2 overlapping maps, atual zoning and potential zoning, shows that there is mismatching of risky polluted area. It is caused by human fators, some of them are population density, well construction, bad sanitation, individual septi tank, and industrial disposal from irrigation. Based on the result of the research, clean water district corporation is expected to be able to determine priority scale of clean water supply to Surakarta and its surrounding.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The former system and practice of planning in Yugoslavia collapsed as early as towards the end of 1980s, not to be substituted for in the sequel by a new and legitimate development planning mode that has been compatible with the key processes and factors of the post-socialist transition, i.e., political pluralisation, privatisation, marketisation, and so forth. Under the recent circumstances, a number of new ?ideologies of planning? came to the surface, thereby rendering the current practice a peculiar mix of various concepts of ?quasi/pseudo planning? exercises, imbued with new biases, partisanship dominating the public scene, the notion of public interests almost lost, low transparency regarding the value and interest background of planning, etc. In effect, two general practices have been dominating the planning area, i.e., ?crisis management?, and ?planning-supporting-the-wild-privatisation-and-marketisation?. To a large extent, this has been caused by a poor experience, i.e., a lack of planners/experts to work under the new circumstances (?transition?), paralleled by a lack of critical mass of social and economic actors interested in the sustainable development matters and supportive to them, and a wide spread anti-planning stance among the political and economic elites (?architects of the transitional reforms?). A more modernising and emancipatory model, e.g., ?planning-supporting-complex-transformation of society?, seems to be still out of sight for some time to come. As the new coherent planning theory might not be expected for a longer period, preferably a preliminary planning heuristics would have to be elaborated, to more or less ?safely? direct the practice within the strategic framework defined. In this context, a number of specific issues of expertise would also have to be resolved, ranging from general theoretical and methodological issues, via practical methodologies, to the key issues within the triangle power ? knowledge ? action. Specifically, this should also apply to the majority of development planning policy documents that have been worked out in the recent period.</jats:p>"

ERP benefits are important for a number of reasons, including establishing a match between what ERP systems benefits are—as compared to ERP expectations—setting a benchmark for other firms, and measuring those benefits. ERP benefits also are central to the business case for deciding whether a firm will invest in an ERP system. It is found that some benefits vary across industry, while others seem to be important to firms independent of industry. In particular, tangible benefits are largely industry-independent, while intangible benefits vary across industry. In addition, when compared to an earlier study by Deloitte Consulting, the results are statistically consistent with their findings, but find substantial additional intangible benefits.</jats:p>",

This paper examines exploratory interviews with senior managers from a selection of “established” organisations in contrasting retailing sectors. Its purpose is to explore the challenges and issues faced by these large retailing organisations in establishing competitive Internet businesses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Seamless integration of manufacturing planning activities, though being imperative for application of advanced technologies, is still not completely developed. Integration between design and manufacturing systems is usually done within tightly implemented suite of CAD/CAM applications. However, there is a need to integrate these applications into a wider framework in which manufacturing knowledge is incorporated into planning tasks, and tasks may be executed in distributed environment. This paper proposes such a framework. The methodology is based on integration of CAM software with rule-based process planning on several levels. The basis for this approach is existence of feature based CAD model that is usually designed in CAD package. The process-planning task can be performed in two modes: traditional mode and distributed mode. In traditional mode, tightly integrated CAM package is used to create necessary tool paths and detailed specification for particular geometry from the design. They are exported into a CAPP package for cost optimization and sequencing for the final NC program. Distributed mode allows utilization of rule base for creation of manufacturing operations. Results are imported into CAM package for tool path generation and NC code post processing. CAD/CAM package exports its feature into rule-based process planning system. For each feature, rules are fired in order to select the most appropriate machining operation, tool, and cutting parameters. Process sequencing can also be performed. In both modes, integration may be carried out between different computers using TCP/IP protocol to enable distributed processing of different tasks. The current results in implementing the prototype, which supports proposed methodology and few test cases of both operating modes, are also described.</jats:p>",

The vast majority of surface water withdrawals in the basin are used for irrigation, but current water supplies are frequently inadequate to meet this need. The recently proposed comprehensive Watershed Management Plan for the Yakima Basin relies on building major new water storage facilities, and $6.5 million in federal and state funding was secured in 2003 to study a huge new dam and reservoir. Yet local water users cannot pay for this $2 billion structure, and the national attitude toward water resource management is moving from a development paradigm to the recognition that water supplies have limits. Initiatives in the basin that are consistent with this latter approach include minimum instream flow targets, water use efficiency improvement programs, and making it easier to voluntarily transfer water rights. Future issues that have not yet been addressed will also affect water supply planning, but it is possible to set forth a recommended series of actions that can be taken now. The complex suite of water resource issues present in the Yakima Basin as of early 2004 should inform water resource management elsewhere in the West.\n\n</jats:p>"

A recent survey of 515 professional sales representatives located in Pittsburgh, PA area firms that were chosen based on relatively large size and established reputations in the area were asked to respond to a number of questions concerning sales training and related sales experience. Factor analysis results with industry type, insurance and financial type, as an example discovered four categories of data reduction: component 1 related to emotional intelligence (identifying personality types, presentation skills, controlling one's emotions, and adaptability to change) variables, component 2 was associated with experience (years of managerial experience and years of sales experience), component 3 for people skills (sales concepts and procedures and listening skills), and component 4 dealt with technical skills (writing skills and computer competencies). Not surprisingly, communication skills, negotiating skills, emotional intelligence, and presentation skills, and the need to differentiate personality types were found to be very important to the sales practitioners. Equally not surprising that they found their professional stressful and the relevance of college course in sales with somewhat mixed reviews.</jats:p>",

Self-interested client-executive actions (motivated by executive incentive pay) have been claimed to be at the core of a recent large public company failure and the associated demise of the company's global auditors (Byrne et al. 2002). However, we know relatively little about how client-employee compensation contracts affect the planning choices of auditors. Our main result is that audit-planning judgments are greater (i.e., audit risk is assessed higher and the level of evidence required to perform the audit is assessed higher) if the bonuses are based on financial performance measures rather than nonfinancial performance measures. We also find that audit-planning judgments are greater (i.e., audit risk is assessed higher, internal controls are assessed weaker, and more substantive evidence is required) if client-employee compensation comprises a fixed salary plus bonuses, based on either financial or nonfinancial performance measures, rather than comprises a fixed salary only; however, we find only partial support for the finding with respect to nonfinancial measures. An important implication of these findings is that audit firms may need to pay careful attention to how auditors are trained in strategic systems auditing approaches that rely more on understanding a client's nonfinancial performance measures and less on transaction-based testing.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The lack of foresight by municipalities and others in preserving corridors for utilities means that there are increasingly fewer opportunities to locate linear facilities in large urban centers such as the City of Toronto. In those corridors that do exist, there are competing land uses that make it difficult to accommodate any new use. Many of these land uses are directly related to the people living adjacent to and in the vicinity of the corridors. In 2003, the Ontario Energy Board approved new “Environmental Guidelines for the Location, Construction and Operation of Hydrocarbon Pipelines and Facilities in Ontario”. The Guidelines include specific new requirements for planning pipelines in urban areas. Among other things, these new requirements involve the identification of indirectly affected landowners and a more detailed analysis of public issues and how they were resolved. Through the use of a case study, this paper identifies the public issues that were encountered in planning the location of a NPS 36 (Nominal Pipe Size 914 mm or 36 inch diameter) natural gas pipeline through residential neighbourhoods in the City of Toronto and the Town of Markham. It also describes how the public involvement requirements contained in the Ontario Energy Board’s new guidelines were incorporated into the planning process. The case study begins with a rationale for the study area selected. A description of the public issues follows. The techniques used to address these issues and the success of the public involvement program that identified 180 directly affected and 3,200 indirectly affected landowners is documented. The study results illustrate that it is possible to plan a right-of-way through an urban corridor in such a manner as to satisfy the general public, be compatible with existing development, conform to the new Ontario Energy Board Guidelines and minimize the amount of remedial work required to mitigate the impacts occurring on and adjacent to the right-of-way.</jats:p>",

In this paper, we describe optimization approaches for airline schedule planning, demonstrating how optimization can facilitate the management of a diverse and finite set of expensive, highly constrained resources. We focus on the art and science of modeling and solving these problems, providing illustrative examples of the associated impacts and challenges, and highlighting effective techniques that might be applicable to problems arising in other industries. </jats:p>",

Commonly, a UVMS \nconsists of two sub-systems, a vehicle and a manipulator, having vastly different dynamic responses. The proposed algorithm considers the variability in dynamic bandwidth of the complex UVMS system and generates not only kinematically admissible but also dynamically feasible reference trajectories. Additionally, this motion planning algorithm exploits the inherent kinematic redundancy of the whole system and provides reference trajectories that accommodates other important criteria such as thruster/actuator faults and saturations, and also minimizes hydrodynamic drag. Effectiveness of the proposed unified motion planning algorithm has been verified by extensive computer simulation. The results are quite promising.</jats:p>",

Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are designed for this purpose and are gradually being deployed by many mid-to-large volume manufacturers. The advent of RMS has given rise to a challenging problem, namely, how to economically and efficiently reconfigure a manufacturing system and the reconfigurable hardware within it so that the system can meet new requirements. This paper presents a solution to this problem that models the reconfigurability of a RMS as a network of potential activities and configurations to which a shortest path graph-searching strategy is applied. The A* algorithm is employed to perform this search for the reconfiguration plan and reconfigured system that best satisfies the new performance goals. This search engine is implemented within an AI-based Computer-Aided Reconfiguration Planning (CARP) framework, which is designed to assist manufacturing engineers in making reconfiguration planning decisions. Two planning problems serve as examples to prove the effectiveness of the CARP framework.</jats:p>",

Extensive efforts continue to be made to develop strategies for a better management of the problem. Predictive models for stress corrosion crack growth were developed using lab testing data, limited inspection and excavation measurements since mid 70s and early 90s, respectively. In this paper, a systematic study of crack growth rates was conducted on the Imperial Oil Rainbow 24 NPS pipeline based on the two consecutive UltraScan Crack Detection (USCD) tool runs and field measurements. Findings of this study provide, perhaps, for the first time since the phenomenon was discovered, a direct measurement of crack growth rates for shallow cracks (in the category of &lt;12.5%wt). Future integrity of the pipeline was assessed and the integrity management strategies were refined using the determined crack growth rate and fracture mechanics based approach. In addition, the susceptibility of SCC was studied in detail using a decision tree approach for data mining. Some important correlations between SCC susceptibility and environmental and mechanical variables were identified and presented. Findings on SCC susceptibility are discussed in terms of environmental and loading parameters such as soil, drainage, topography, pressure, and CP along the pipeline.</jats:p>",

It provides a tool to teach site planning concepts on a small scale that are easily transferable to issues addressed when planning for construction of all sizes and types of protected-environment structures. In this case, the owner of Full Moon Farm must decide the placement of her high tunnels on a given farm site. Factors to consider include wind, snow, and ice loads as well as structural integrity, labor efficiency, and optimizing light levels. Ultimately, no one solution meets all recommended criteria, so the grower must prioritize the importance of various factors to come to a decision. This case study is intended for use in upper-level undergraduate horticulture courses, and although the principles are broadly applicable to site planning across geographic regions, it is most appropriate for climates above lat. 35°N. In particular, it may prove useful in courses such as greenhouse management and production courses for vegetables, cut flowers, and small fruits, where students assume the role of grower/farmer in the site planning process. This case study is supported by a website version with digital images, digital video, and maps that can be used both inside and outside of the classroom; all are downloadable from the website <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://www.hightunnels.org/planningcasestudy.htm\" ext-link-type=\"url\" xlink:type=\"simple\">http://www.hightunnels.org/planningcasestudy.htm</jats:ext-link>.

In the present study we tested whether weak coherence might be the result of executive dysfunction, by testing clinical groups known to show deficits on tests of executive control. Boys with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) were compared with age- and intelligence quotient (IQ)-matched boys with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and typically developing (TD) boys, on a drawing task requiring planning for the inclusion of a new element. Weak coherence was measured through analysis of drawing style. In line with the predictions made, the ASD group was more detail-focused in their drawings than were either ADHD or TD boys. The ASD and ADHD groups both showed planning impairments, which were more severe in the former group. Poor planning did not, however, predict detail-focus, and scores on the two aspects of the task were unrelated in the clinical groups. These findings indicate that weak coherence may indeed be a cognitive style specific to autism and unrelated to cognitive deficits in frontal functions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Housing marketisation provides an opportunity for households to choose their residences. However, not all households benefit equally from residential relocation. This paper uses a recent residential survey in Shanghai to examine different relocation modes and their implications for housing consumption. The findings suggest that better education, absence of work-unit affiliation, higher expectation for housing consumption, and the move from the outer to inner areas are more likely to be associated with active relocation through commodity housing purchase. Residential relocation in urban China has a stronger association with the household's position within the spectrum from state redistribution to market reward than with life cycles and consequent adjustment of housing demand which are the primary reasons for residential mobility in a mature market. Household income, the educational level, and previous housing space are determinants of changing housing consumption. Intraurban residential relocation gives a higher return to those who are better educated and who have been already in possession of larger living space, and to the move from outer to inner areas. Active relocation and workplace-housing allocation generate higher space returns to households than do other modes of relocation. Whereas pragmatic concerns for social stability plus strong tenancy rights help inner-city households gain compensation in residential relocation, urban redevelopment generates the lowest space return. Residential displacement is now becoming a contentious issue. As such, residential relocation is a process that differentiates urban space under market transition. </jats:p>",

This model applies object-oriented data models and rendering techniques to virtual organs, and enables both interactive VR simulation and detailed volume visualization of tissue of interest (e.g. coronary). Also, a physics-based framework interactively simulates estimated surgical fields which are used in preoperative discussion. Based on the proposed methods, a VR-based strategic planning system is developed. The system does not need high cost manual segmentation of patient dataset and efficiently supports planning of surgical approaches in cardiovascular surgery.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyzes the residential mobility rate in Beijing over the period 1980–2001 as revealed by retrospective residential histories collected by a questionnaire survey conducted in early 2001. The results show that there was a sharp increase in residential mobility in the early reform period; however, from the mid-1980s onwards the mobility rate has been oscillating, with a slightly downward trend. Adjusting the gross mobility rate observed by means of logit regression estimation shows that this downward trend is more than a statistical artefact. Structural forces are at work continually to restrain residential moves under the reform. The regression results also show that, although there are similarities between the effects of various life-course variables on residential mobility in Beijing and those in cities in market economies, substantial differences are also found. Age exhibits similar curvilinear effects but mobility peaks at a somewhat later age. Homeownership with partial property rights deters mobility by an even greater margin in Beijing than in cities in the West. Change in marital status is important, but does not automatically bring about a change in residence. Birth of a child, moreover, appears to carry minimal weight in residential change. In this sense, the thesis that residential mobility is a housing-adjustment process is less applicable to the case of Beijing than it is in cities in the West. </jats:p>",

The authors held human powered submarine design contests and races in Escondido, California in the summers of 2000, 2002 and 2004. These events were specifically designed to expose university engineering students to the types of decisions and processes an engineer in industry would face 5–10 years after receiving a bachelor’s degree in engineering. In building a submarine for this contest, students gained technical expertise in conceptual and detail design and manufacturing, experience in teamwork and time management, and exposure to gaining funding and controlling expenditures. At the contest, oral presentations simulate industrial final design reviews, and races simulate functional tests and demonstrations for customers. Lessons and examples drawn from planning and running HPS2000, HPS2002, and HPS2004 are included and may be useful to persons planning similar educational engineering contests, and to contestants in such events.</jats:p>",

Our system uses biplane angiograms coupled with an algorithm for generation of 3D vascular trees for patient data acquisition. Surface reconstruction and processing of this data is performed to provide novel decision aids to the interventionalist. The processed data can be loaded in a virtual environment to simulate guidance of the catheter through the patient&amp;apos;s vasculature. With our combination of techniques, a patient specific visualization and simulation environment can be prepared within the narrow time window available for this procedure.</jats:p>"

The proposed trajectory planning method aims to guide the ALV to achieve the goal that the targeted person will always appear in the image. It is found in this study that the goal can be achieved if three visual contact constraints in the visual field model are satisfied. The first constraint postulates that the target has appeared in the image. The second constraint asks that the vehicle head at the next position points straight towards to the target's current position. The third constraint sets bounds between the next position of the ALV and the current position of the target. A formula for the trajectory of the vehicle that satisfies the second visual contact constraint is derived. The steps for generating a speed and a turn angle of the ALV for real-time navigation are described as a trajectory-planning algorithm. Finally, the approach is tested on a real ALV and successful navigation sessions confirm the feasibility and the robustness of the approach.</jats:p>",

This approach provides us with important motion planning methodology for a variety of robotic systems including land-based mobile robots, space robots, and underwater robots, where the vehicles have much slower response as compared to the manipulators. The proposed method has been improvised for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Manipulator System (UVMS) which is a heterogeneous dynamic system having vehicle’s natural frequency much lower than that of the manipulator. This motion-planning algorithm not only considers the variability in dynamic bandwidth of such a complex system but also generates kinematically admissible as well as dynamically feasible reference trajectories. Additionally, the proposed algorithm exploits the inherent kinematic redundancy of the system and provides reference trajectories that accommodate several other important criteria such as thruster/actuator fault and saturation; it also minimizes hydrodynamic drag on the UVMS. Here, we have mainly compared the performance of two frequency-based decomposition approaches, namely: Partial Decomposition and Total Decomposition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified with extensive computer simulations and the results are found quite promising.</jats:p>",

The particular benefit(s) derived depend primarily on the extent and appropriateness of the maintenance and inspection programs carried out previously. AEA Technology has developed a practical methodology and associated software for RBM planning of power generating plant. In conjunction with our clients, we have conducted numerous studies over the past five years covering a wide range of equipment. This paper briefly describes the RBM planning methodology and software, and summarizes a series of Case Studies to demonstrate its generic applicability, practicability and benefits. The Case Studies address the following equipment: • A steam turbine. • Fired boilers. • Hydro turbines. • A heat recovery steam generator.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A common approach to the management of external corrosion in the pipeline industry is to perform an In-Line Inspection, followed by repairs of defects that fail a deterministic criterion, and then leave the line in service until a prescribed time interval has elapsed, at which point another reinspection is performed. However, many companies have found that as a result of the uncertainty associated with MFL defect sizing and corrosion growth rates, a deterministic repair and reinspection process may often result in unnecessary maintenance expenditures while occasionally failing to identify and address critical features. When the rare feature ‘slips through’ the deterministic process, companies often respond by adding conservatism to the process, leading to increased spending with little additional benefit. A better approach for evaluating corrosion defects is to view the process as an analysis of a set of stochastic variables instead of deterministic values. Through such an approach, the sensitivity of a defect’s failure probability can be more effectively evaluated, facilitating a decision process that is better able to find the ‘exceptions’ that are not addressed by a deterministic process. This paper outlines an approach to analyzing MFL data with stochastic variable using computer simulation, along with a process for continuously improving the characterization of each variable through a feedback loop. Alternative methods to Monte Carlo, such as Importance Sampling are briefly outlined to minimize the analysis time required without sacrificing simulation accuracy. Finally, acceptance criteria are required to interpret the calculated failure probability in order to inform maintenance decision making. This is presented in a risk-based context using a previously published risk management framework. Through this process, defect repair decisions and the evaluation of the benefit of MFL re-inspection can be better optimized. Examples are drawn from actual maintenance programs to illustrate this approach.</jats:p>",

The water resource such as Water Enim and Lamatang River support the capacity of the developing. Acording to the study in 1985 carried out by the BCEOM and Kampsax consultants, the lower Lematang region. Dangku Kiri, Dangku Kanan, and Modong with the total area of about 10.000 Ha has a highly potential to built rice field ith the technical irrigation. Based on the information, research of dependable flow of Lematang River to the irrigation requirement had been carried out by analyzing of all data collecting in those area  such as rainfall, climate, and discharge data. The result shows that the dependable flow of 20% probability of non exceedence is about 65.3 m3/sec. It is potential enough compare with the irrigation requirement of about 1.85 l/sec/ha or 18.5 m3/sec of total irrigation area. Technically, dependable flow of Lematang River is big enough but some constraints will appear especially in determining of free intake or weir because the river gradient is too low and the main  channel has been used by the people for navigation. To increase the accuracy of the research, an Automatic Water Level Recorder and one climatological station should be installed respectively in the alternative I location and in the irrigation area.</jats:p>"

The results of the responses to this survey were collated and presented to the Past Presidents of the CAG at a retreat held during the summer of 2003. These findings were then employed to develop a Strategic Plan for the CAG to guide its progress and development over the next five to ten years. A subsequent issue of this Journal will include a presentation of the CAG 2004 Strategic Plan, which was finalized and approved by the CAG Governing Board during the annual fall meeting in October 2003.</jats:p>"

A performance-based approach to planning focuses on the projected outcomes of potential investments and the degree to which these impacts support stated policies. Interest in performance-based planning has grown in response to changing demands on agencies’ transportation programs resulting from international trade and economic competition, deregulation and modal competition, environmental regulation, and the pluralistic nature of many transportation decision-making processes. Performance-based planning is systematic and analytic, building upon the following components: expressions of policy in terms of quantifiable objectives; explicit measures of system performance; analytic methods to predict the impacts of different types of investments on system performance; decision-support tools to assist in evaluating a range of investments throughout a transportation network; models for periodic system monitoring to track performance measures; and feedback mechanisms to assess performance trends and identify needed adjustments in investment priorities. </jats:p>",

Extending prior studies that have examined behavior in only a single area, this study experimentally examines how comprehensive control systems influence managers as they allocate their time among multiple areas of responsibility. The results show that managers do not plan increases in their working week in response to increased monitoring or to performance-based incentives, but rather they shift their time from areas that are not monitored or rewarded to areas that are. The results support Kaplan and Norton's assertion that the Balanced Scorecard can be used to influence the way managers allocate their attention between organizational objectives.</jats:p>",

As main reasons for that have been identified: many existing local sustainability indicator systems are designed to meet a variety of targets. Any specific requirements are neglected. Second, most local sustainability indicator systems are designed and applied outside the political and administrative structures and processes of a local community. Their integration into the local context until now has not received enough attention. Third, the differentiation of modern societies makes the implementation of integrated approaches difficult. As a reaction, in this paper a modular design for indicator systems, is suggested and outlined in its main features.</jats:p>"

In the paper, critical issues are addressed on the implementation of intelligent assembly modeling, analysis and design, planning and simulation using knowledge intensive P/T net models, e.g., knowledge modeling and acquisition, function-behavior-structure modeling, fuzzy relational database, case-based reasoning, and assembly design language, etc. The developed multi-agent intelligent environment, RAPID Assembly system, can process various types of knowledge in assembly design, process and task planning, and assembly system design and simulation so that intelligent design, planning and simulation can be implemented in a virtual environment. It assists designers and manufacturing engineers to design and evaluate the product and its assembly processes and assembly systems (e.g., assembly feasibility, sequences, trajectories, and execution strategies) without building physical prototypes. Design cases are provided to illustrate how the system works.</jats:p>",

Students who completed a corequisite research methods course in the year before the department added the careers course to the curriculum served as a comparison group. Analyses showed that students in the careers course increased their self-perceived knowledge of career options for psychology majors, confidence in their ability to make career decisions, and movement toward achievement of vocational identity. In Study 2, precourse versus postcourse comparisons demonstrated increases in actual career-related knowledge and in both career exploration and decidedness. Results suggest that such courses can facilitate career development among psychology majors. </jats:p>",

Used widely in business applications, it allows planners to anticipate problems, reevaluate assumptions, and reflect on consequences of those alternative futures. In this article, scenario planning is applied to public health, specifically to illustrate the four steps in scenario planning for public health using a health department’s desire to address chronic disease prevention and control. An unhealthy diet and physical inactivity are considered to be key risk factors. The scenarios are presented in table format and are for illustration purposes only. Many other plausible scenarios could be constructed. Scenario planning allows stake-holders to define a desired, shared vision of the future, but more important, they can better prepare public health professionals to be successful in a constantly changing environment. </jats:p>",

This paper considers the geographies of the shifting ideological relationships between the architectural space of the home and women, both those who designed and those who used it. The analysis centres around the spaces of the kitchen, and the work of two key individuals: the housing consultant Elizabeth Denby, and the Modern architect Jane Drew, and her publication of 1944, Kitchen planning. The paper argues that discourses surrounding the geographies of the kitchen can be seen as representative of wider societal shifts in the position of both middle- and working-class women at this time. The paper ends by considering what these discourses tell us about the changing nature of gendered spaces at this time. </jats:p>",

It is argued that, in relying on an independent regulator to supervise access to health care under the new 'foundation' hospitals regime in the English National Health Service (NHS), not only is the Labour government distancing itself clearly from old-style top-down planning, it also risks greater variability in the definition of fair access to health care. There are relevant historical parallels with the mixed economy of the pre-NHS era that policy-makers should make explicit. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Next to the quantitative reduction of land consumption, the control of the territorial setting of newly urbanised areas must be acknowledged as a key task of sustainable urban development. Therefore policies against urban sprawl require precise land-use data to inform politicians on the spatial patterns of urbanisation. This article presents an approach for analysing land-use change based on municipality data. For the first time a municipality data base on land-use for the whole territory of Germany has been adopted. The usage of municipality data allows a more sophisticated picture of the patterns of land consumption compared to traditional county-data approaches. The analysis focuses on the spatial concentration of land consumption as well as the distribution of newly urbanised areas among about 13 000 German municipalities.</jats:p>"

In selected cases, we resolved this by excluding part of the tumour from the prescription isodose volume. Most of these compromises or ‘suboptimal’ plans achieved growth control. Growth control could not be related to conformity indices or to various measures of the radiation dose received by the meningioma. Examining recurrences, 75% arose from dura outside the original treatment field. These findings are discussed in terms of dose prescription protocols and the use of conformity indices in planning. The importance of the dural origin of meningiomas is well established in surgical practice, as reflected by Simpson’s grades, but may be equally significant in radiosurgical practice.</jats:p>"

A sample of 101 IT professionals was used to look at the indirect effects of the planning culture on IT planning effectiveness through the empowerment of knowledge workers. Strong support was garnered for the three hypotheses of the study, namely: (1) empowered knowledge workers make a significant impact on the quality of planning outcomes; (2) planning cultures empower knowledge workers; hence, (3) improving the quality of planning through the motivational path of knowledge workers empowerment. Implications of the findings for organizational learning are discussed at the end.</jats:p>"

The challenge of this problem lies in the need to consider the hydrodynamic interaction as well as the underactuated and non-minimum phase natures of the AV system. The control task is decomposed into the off-line step of motion planning and the on-line step of feedback tracking. Optimal control techniques are used to compute a repertoire of time-scalable and concatenable motion primitives. The complete motion plan is obtained by concatenating time-scaled copies of the primitives. The computed optimal motion plans are regulated by a controller that consists of a cascade of linear quadratic regulator, input–output feedback linearization and sliding mode control. Time-varying linear quadratic controllers can also be time-scaled and concatenated. Therefore, they can be computed beforehand. The proposed strategy has been experimentally validated for both constrained longitudinal only maneuvers and unconstrained longitudinal/lateral maneuvers. </jats:p>",

Prominent among the recommendations in the MMSD report were the need for the mining industry to improve its performance in biodiversity assessment and management, and the need for all parties to commit to better models for decision-making processes in land use and access.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Mining is a temporary use of land, but history teaches us that the net effect of mining in a landscape is usually negative for biodiversity. There are benefits to human society in health, wealth and education, but society increasingly demands that environmental values be protected without compromising economic and social foundations. These expectations are captured in the concept of sustainable development.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Often, the most prospective areas for future mines will also be those with the greatest biodiversity value and with the greatest need for poverty alleviation. Many governments lack the capacity, will or resources to reconcile these conflicting needs equitably. Corruption in government and oppression of local populations have accompanied some mine developments.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Leading companies in the mining industry believe that these negative experiences are not inevitable, that better decisions on land use and access can be achieved and that sustainable benefits can be delivered through mineral development. One key to achieving these outcomes is the regional landscape-scale analysis of projects and conservation priorities, supported by fair, transparent and consistent decisionmaking processes.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Rio Tinto is a large diversified mining company which played a leading role in the actions leading to the commissioning of the MMSD project and participated fully in it.

Historically, researchers compared the length and complexity of the syntactic constructions produced by these children with those of children who do not stutter (CWNS) and generally found the CWS to be relatively deficient. More recently, some investigators have begun to address how the language and fluency of CWS are influenced in different communicative settings. This article describes several findings concerning the pragmatic competencies of CWS set against the traditional framework of pragmatic language development. Most studies have shown no significant differences between the CWS and CWNS groups, although some aspects of pragmatic language use have yielded an exacerbation of stuttering for CWS. These findings have suggested specific ways of incorporating a pragmatic focus in the treatment programming for CWS where the degree of difficulty of language use is increased gradually.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Complex new product development requires numerous decisions by many individuals and groups, which are often geographically and temporally distributed. There is a need to share and coordinate distributed resources and synchronize decisions, and recent advances in information technology (IT) pose an untapped potential for assisting in the capture, storage, retrieval and facilitated use of product development information. We exploit IT to address this problem through the proposed approach to Product Family Planning. By sharing assets such as components, processes and knowledge across a family of products, companies can efficiently develop differentiated products and increase the flexibility and responsiveness of their product realization process. In this paper we describe our recent efforts in realizing an information management infrastructure for product family planning and platform customization. In particular, we focus on three current research thrusts to identify product platform leveraging strategies to support future product family planning: (1) an evolutionary approach to product platforming, (2) a bottom-up approach to product platforming, and (3) industry-based platform case studies. Future research directions are also outlined.</jats:p>",

The new paradigm of environmental issues highlights the limits of such practices : bottom-up actions, in contrast with top-down regulation habits, make accurate geographical analysis even more needed.

The path planning is solved as a series of local obstacle avoidance problems which produce via points in the 3D Cartesian space as well as the normal vector to the obstacle surface at each via point. This vector is later utilized for trajectory generation. An intermediate orientation representation is used to guarantee continuity at the angular acceleration level for real-time simulation and control purposes. The proposed method is implemented in a real-time simulation environment for testing and final application. The real-time data generation allows hardware-in-the loop simulation, which is crucial in many aerospace applications.</jats:p>",

The model associates segregation with instabilities of spatially uniform mixed population states. These instabilities lead to a wide range of segregation forms including: (a) variable (weak) segregation where the population is everywhere mixed and the spatial variability is controlled by a ‘status-gap’ parameter, (b) strong segregation, where nearby neighbourhoods consists of pure (unmixed) population groups, and (c) intermediate forms involving enclaves of a pure population group in neighbourhoods of mixed population. The model associates tipping-point phenomena with the existence of an unstable mixed population state which introduces a threshold for population inversion.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Overgrazing and untimely grazing are common on rangelands in Iran often because of land tenure ambiguities. For the same reason a considerable portion of the rangelands has been converted into farmland for rainfed cereal production. As a result, these rangelands are experiencing land degradation under the increasing pressure to support a growing population of people and livestock. Land tenure reform is perceived as one approach to improving the use and condition of Iranian rangelands. Changes in land tenure involve very complex decision-making that should lead to sustainable use of the land and contribute to the sustainable livelihood of present and future generations. This paper describes a planning support system developed for rangeland allocation in Iran to support the tenure-reform process. The system is composed of three modules: land evaluation module, district planning module and local planning module.\nThe land evaluation module works in a GIS environment and uses the FAO methodology for land evaluation, with emphasis on biophysical characteristics of the land-use system. Socio-economic factors in terms of the effect of human intervention on the current status of the land have also been taken into account. The district planning module comprises three sub-modules: planning sub-module, grazing sub-module, and a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) sub-module. The planning sub-module is an optimisation model that examines the degree of realisation of various objectives of stakeholders and generates alternative solutions. For each alternative, the grazing capacity of the land is assessed (grazing sub-module). The MCE sub-module ranks the alternative solutions, taking into account their advantages and disadvantages. The outcome is a pattern of land use consistent with existing government policies and satisfying the needs and desires of the local population. The local planning module also comprises three sub-modules: land allocation sub-module, economically viable grazing enterprise sub-module, and a land improvement planning sub-module. The land allocation sub-module transforms the district land-use pattern into a local land-use plan. The economically viable grazing enterprise sub-module determines the appropriate size of the land holding for each household on each land-mapping unit. Finally, the land improvement planning sub-module provides information on the status and impact of the land improvement program.\nThis planning support system has been applied to the Chadegan sub-region in Iran to illustrate its potential as a decision-making tool. Three scenarios were defined at district level, in addition to the status quo: maximum benefit for farm households; minimum government subsidies; and maximum land cover, emphasizing environmental goals. Results suggest that maximum land cover is the preferred scenario with the highest income and carrying capacity, and lowest level of subsidisation. However, since it eliminates wheat production, this scenario it culturally less attractive.</jats:p>"

Although microlevel factors such as household characteristics begin to shape housing behavior in urban China as is the case in the West, macrolevel constraints and opportunities defined by not only housing stocks and housing markets but also local government behaviors continue to be crucial. By studying housing choice in Beijing, Chongqing, and Jiangyin, I find that local governments in different cities behave differently in reforming the housing system, which in turn create different housing stocks and housing markets and thus lead to different patterns of housing behavior. A housing stock dominated by public housing, a tight housing market, and a conservative local government all encourage households to choose public housing and rental, as is the case in Beijing, while a diverse housing stock with affordable housing prices, and an aggressive local government often encourage households to choose private housing and homeownership, indicated by the case of Jiangyin. </jats:p>",

Earlier work has been reported on process planning for boring of components with monotonic internal geometry made from bar stock. This paper addresses the more general problem of process planning of parts with non-monotonic internal feature list from arbitrary given initial geometry, i.e., from a casting or from a semi-finished stock. With the algorithms developed, we are able to achieve full automation of all aspects of the process plan, including operations sequencing, parameter selection, NC code generation, etc. Thus, it becomes possible to go from design to NC code in a fully automated fashion. In the present work we focus on a tightly defined part family, which results in very simple but robust automation algorithms. This is in contrast to much of the reported work on automated process planning, which generally targets broad part families, leading to complex algorithms that fall short of complete design-to-NC automation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For a prolonged period of time, the Chinese state had monopolised housing provision. Chinese people had virtually no choice of housing. Much has changed with the deepening of the market-oriented reform launched since 1979. A housing market, though not yet a full-fledged one, has been established. People now have greater freedom to choose their homes. More and more people buy houses from the market. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an inquiry into how housing decisions in China are made, what people's preferences for housing are, and what factors influence their housing choices. To this end, the authors study the joint choice of dwelling and neighbourhood by potential homebuyers in Beijing. Because the housing market in China is still in an embryonic state and highly regulated by the government, one may not be able to get information on actual housing choices to reveal housing preferences. This study thus adopts the stated preference modelling approach. Data were collected in 2001 in Beijing, capital of China. The study shows that, in general, neighbourhood variables are more important than dwelling variables in the choice of housing in Beijing. Associated with this is the importance attached to districts with a good reputation and the concern for dwelling and neighbourhood security. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author considers patterns of population growth and density occurring in Canadian metropolitan areas (CMAs) over the 25-year period 1971–96. Two different sets of data, population and household, are examined with the aid of distance-decay density gradients and enumeration of intrazonal change in census tracts defined as core area (census tracts immediately adjacent to the central business district), inner city, and suburban. Important differences are found when household data are used in lieu of population data. In the core and inner city, household change points towards an overall pattern of recentralization and, in the suburbs, to intensification of development—albeit muted. This contrasts with an accentuated trend to decentralization witnessed in the population-based analyses. The author concludes that centralization is an active force in most CMAs, although it is not as strong a force as decentralization. It is also suggested that there is great diversity between the twenty-two CMAs that make up the dataset. Most important is the demonstration that evidence based on population trends alone is not sufficient to gauge changing patterns of intrametropolitan population distribution. </jats:p>",

In obtaining multiple routes or multiroutes by GAs simultaneously, there is a problem of collisions or near‐misses occurring due to interference between the routes (closeness or intersecting of the routes) when similar routes are generated. The proposed scheme realizes a scheme for searching multiple flight routes without interference by incorporating a method for correcting their fitness on the basis of the neighborhood density for maintaining the variety and the degree of interference or the interference degree for obtaining routes that do not come close to or intersect one another. In addition, this paper proposes a priority candidate preserving strategy that preserves superior multiple individuals for each generation in order to improve the search performance. Computer simulation results confirm that the scheme proposed generates multiple flight routes without interference, indicating its efficacy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

They have now reached a maturity allowing their use in an industrial context. The first applications of detailed RBI where devoted to single components and lately applied in a more extensive way to a set of components, using generic approaches. As being the second part of a report on industrial application of RBI, this present paper focused on RBI for fixed steel offshore structures. The challenge here is the full implementation of the method to a whole set of offshore platforms. General questions arise, such as how to use detailed RBI planning that builds inspection plans of details to establish inspection campaigns for a given platform and, in a more general way, how to go from detailed RBI planning to inspection campaigns for a set of platforms. Also, several more technical issues have been raised during the studies, such as fatigue computations, push-over analyses, risk acceptance criteria and scheduling phases. This paper presents part of the experiences gained using and applying these RBI methods to a specific field of jackets.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, a novel planning method is proposed to solve initial velocities of the free sliding object for given initial and final configurations. Finding the desired initial velocities for free sliding objects is a key step for implementing impulse manipulation and multi-agent dynamic cooperative manipulation. The motion of free sliding objects on a plane is governed by friction forces and the initial state of the object; this motion can be modeled by a set of six first-order differential equations. In this paper, the planning problem is formulated as a free boundary value problem (FBVP). In order to solve the problem, the FBVP is first reduced to a standard two-point boundary value problem, then quasi-Newton based optimization procedures are utilized to solve the planning problem. The proposed method does not require qualitative motion characteristics; thus, it can be used for objects with general shape and arbitrary pressure distribution. Numerical and experimental results on objects with different geometries and pressure distributions are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed planner. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Tax benefits have been the key in making vacation homes affordable for many taxpayers. In some cases these benefits have been augmented by an inconsistency in allocation methods used to determine allowable expenses for vacation homes under Section 280A. The U.S. Tax Court created this inconsistency years ago with its decision in Bolton, 77 TC 104 (1981), where the Court approved an allocation method that was contrary to IRS guidance. Although most analyses since this decision have focused on how the Bolton decision permits a taxpayer to increase total deductions related to a rental property when the Section 280A limits apply, there is another aspect to the allocation controversy that has not received as much attention. Specifically, the possible loss of the personal deduction for residential interest when the property does not qualify as a second home may create unexpected tax consequences, where the best tax-planning advice may be to encourage the taxpayer to use the vacation home for more personal days.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This article provides a brief review of the basic Sec. 280A rules for vacation rental homes and closely examines the tax effects of conflicting statutory, administrative, and judicial guidance on the treatment of interest and taxes related to such a property. As demonstrated by three scenarios, the inconsistent treatments may provide an opportunity for owners of vacation homes to “game” the system for maximum tax benefit near the end of a tax year. As a consequence of Congress's failure to update Sec. 280A following the 1986 changes on interest deductions, such gaming of the system may be accomplished without confronting change of accounting method issues.</jats:p>",

Based on an exchange of countries? experiences and analyses of the challenges of the 21st century, policy-makers and experts, meeting in Paris in 1999 and 2000 under a supervision of OECD, noted a growing convergence of planning practice in both federal and centralized countries with the respect to the role of the private sector, the priorities for government, and the importance of a broad, multisectoral approach.

These, in combination with a need for better accountability and improved continuing medical education, have increased the demands on senior doctors, and made apparent the need for increased medical resource. There would seem to be four areas through which this is being addressed – increased production of doctors; changes in medical training; changes in medical practice, and retention of seniors in post. This paper examines some of the perceived advantages and potential disadvantages of these approaches. It concludes that if the health service is to have a viable long‐term future, its survival in the short term depends on maintaining within the service the skills of those seniors who have borne the brunt of recent change.</jats:p>",

Establishing the crossborder regions is one of prerequisites for more efficient cooperation. Many examples prove the whole spectrum of positive effects generated by such cooperations. Based on sound methodological foundations, crossborder spatial planning is the first step towards successful spatial integration and a prerequisites for other forms of cooperation, economic and political in particular. The territory of Serbia is characterized by a large number of border regions with different features and potentials. The Drina area, with its very specific physical social, economic and historic features and above all, with natural resources and potentials, asks for a creative methodology to enable adequate spatial integration of this crossborder region. The paper is elaborating the idea of forming a crossborder region as indispensable for the future, compared with sectorial planning up to date. The example of crossborder region \"Drina-Sava-Majevica\" offers positive initiatives in functional integrating communes alongside the river Drina.</jats:p>"

To compare the isodose distribution of three radiotherapy techniques for locally advanced maxillary sinus carcinoma and analyze the potential of three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy planning in order to determine the optimal technique for target dose delivery, and spare uninvolved healthy tissue structures. Methods. Computed tomography (CT) scans of fourteen patients with T3-T4, N0, M0 maxillary sinus carcinoma were acquired and transferred to 3D treatment planning system (3D-TPS). The target volume and uninvolved dose limiting structures were contoured on axial CT slices throughout the volume of interest combining three variants of treatment plans (techniques) for each patient: 1. A conventional two-dimensional (2D) treatment plan with classically shaped one anterior two lateral opposite fields and two types of 3D conformal radiotherapy plans were compared for each patient. 2. Three-dimensional standard (3D-S) plan one anterior + two lateral opposite coplanar fields, which outlines were shaped with multileaf collimator (MLC) according to geometric information based on 3D reconstruction of target volume and organs at risk as seen in the beam eye's view (BEV) projection. 3. Three-dimensional non-standard (3D-NS) plan: one anterior + two lateral noncoplanar fields, which outlines were shaped in the same manner as in 3D-S plans. The planning parameters for target volumes and the degree of neurooptic structures and parotid glands protection were evaluated for all three techniques. Comparison of plans and treatment techniques was assessed by isodose distribution, dose statistics and dose-volume histograms. Results. The most enhanced conformity of the dose delivered to the target volume was achieved with 3D-NS technique, and significant differences were found comparing 3D-NS vs. 2D (Dmax: p&lt;0,05 Daver: p&lt;0,01; Dmin: p&lt;0,05; V90: p&lt;0,05, and V95: p&lt;0,01), as well as 3D-NS vs. 3D-S technique (Dmin: p&lt;0,05; V90: p&lt;0,05, and V95: p&lt;0,01), while there were no differences between 2D vs. 3D-S technique. 3D-S conformal plans were significantly superior to 2D plans regarding the protection of parotid glands, and the additional improvement of dose conformity was achieved with 3D-NS technique. 3D-NS technique resulted in the decrease of Dmax for ipsilateral retina compared with 3D-S technique, while the level of Dmax for optic nerve was increased (within an acceptable range) with 3D-NS technique. Conclusion. In this study, 3D planning of radiotherapy for locally advanced maxillary sinus carcinoma with noncoplanar fields, which number did not exceed the number of fields for conventional arrangement enabled conformal delivering of the adequate dose to the target volume with the improved sparing of adjacent uninvolved healthy tissue structures.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Objective. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is usually effectively treated by adenotonsillectomy (T&amp;A). However, there may be a waiting list for T&amp;A, and the procedure is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications in children with OSA. Needed is a simple test that will facilitate logical prioritization of the T&amp;A surgical list and help to predict children who are at highest risk of postoperative complications. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a severity scoring system for overnight oximetry and to evaluate the score as a tool to prioritize the T&amp;A surgical list.</jats:p><jats:p>Methods. This study comprised 3 phases. In phase 1, a severity score was developed by review of preoperative overnight oximetry in children who had urgent T&amp;A in 1999–2000. In phase 2, the score was validated retrospectively in 155 children who had polysomnography (PSG) before T&amp;A in 1992–1998. In a phase 3, a 12-month prospective evaluation of a protocol based on the score was conducted.</jats:p><jats:p>Results. In phase 1, a 4-level severity score was developed on the basis of the number and the depth of desaturation events (normal to severely abnormal, categories 1–4). In phase 2, the McGill oximetry score correlated with severity of OSA by PSG criteria. In phase 3, a clinical management protocol was developed based on the score. Of 230 children tested, 179 (78%) had a normal/inconclusive oximetry (category 1) and went on to have PSG. Those with a positive oximetry (categories 2–4; 22%) had no additional sleep studies before T&amp;A. Timing of T&amp;A was based on oximetry score, leading to a significant reduction in waiting time for surgery for those with higher oximetry scores. Postoperative respiratory complications were more common with increasing oximetry score.</jats:p><jats:p>Conclusions. Overnight pulse oximetry can be used to estimate the severity of OSA, to shorten the diagnostic and treatment process for those with more severe disease, and to aid clinicians in prioritization of T&amp;A and planning perioperative care.</jats:p>",

Much has been written in the social and political sciences concerning this change, especially with regard to the formation of new institutions of governance. Less is known concerning the connections between state personnel and this institutional and territorial transformation. In this paper we seek to remedy this deficiency. Drawing on empirical evidence from the English regions, we suggest that devolution is shaped by, and also shapes, the actions and strategies of a variety of state personnel in the different territories. Developing the idea of the state as a ‘peopled organisation’, we thus emphasise the significance of state personnel in actively producing the United Kingdom's new territories and scales of governance. This allows for an examination of the ways in which state personnel, working within different territorial branches and scales of the state, are able to accommodate, revise, or resist broader political </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Machined powertrain components are a subset of machined parts that introduce unique and difficult problems to product design, process planning and manufacturing system design for the automotive industry. They are complex, high value-added components that must be produced at large volumes to stringent quality standards. Accordingly product development cycles are typically long. Integrated computer-aided approaches are thus desirable for reducing this time and helping manufacturing engineers design the best process and specify the optimal manufacturing system configuration. This paper presents a framework for integrating Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and Computer-Aided Manufacturing Systems Engineering (CAE-MS) for producing machined powertrain components. It describes the key components of this framework and in some cases details of the methods and technologies adopted for their realization. This solution is based upon a feature-centric philosophy. This stands in contrast to the product-variant approach that has been common practice in this industry.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Time-definite common carriers are third-party logistics providers that publish tariffs and provide door-to-door pickup and delivery services for small shippers. Their time-sensitive transport operations are critical outsourced activities for a successfully integrated supply chain. In a pure hub-and-spoke network, centers are points of pickup and delivery while hubs are points of consolidation. When the magnitude of demand is uncertain, the stochastic load-planning problem is to determine freight paths and design a balanced trailer network so that expected operating cost is minimum while integral and operational side constraints are met. Demands are assumed to be a finite discrete distribution. Both the first phase and the recourse are pure integer programs. As a result of study of necessary conditions, a heuristic solving algorithm was developed. As a representative example, a small hub-and-spoke network of the third largest carrier in Taiwan was selected for numerical experiments. Results showed a small fleet size with lower operating costs than with the conventionally used deterministic load plan. Stochastic planning is sensitive to the demand fluctuation, whereas deterministic planning is not. Also, the larger the deviation from estimated shipping demand, the higher the operating cost. Finally, if the carrier must pay a higher wage rate for standby drivers, the carrier must assign a larger feeder fleet to anticipate a surge in demand. </jats:p>",

The study area consisted of the entire region that includes all technical areas within the LANL and the towns of White Rock and Los Alamos, New Mexico. Evacuation planning is a critical component of overall security planning. The approach adopted presents a laboratory-like setup to evaluate a large range of evacuation scenarios including no evacuation. Five evacuation scenarios are considered in LANL evacuation planning. The scenarios, developed in consultation with the Emergency Management Office of LANL, include full or partial closures of various roads, limited access to some special facilities, and security delays at certain locations. Performance measures for evaluating an evacuation plan include the total time to achieve a complete evacuation, the time needed for a partial evacuation in which the population within certain areas is at risk, and the percentage of the population in affected zones as a function of time. </jats:p>",

In this paper the authors examine how a conservation movement in Huben Village of Yunlin County in Taiwan has successfully been organized to save the endangered bird species Fairy Pitta ( Pitta nuymphia) against gravel extraction activities that were backed by local clientele networks of politicians and business interests. The case illustrates how challenges of devolved governance can be addressed not necessarily by centralized authority but by connecting grassroots victims of environmental degradation with broader conservation movements supported by networks of civic organizations that transcend narrow geographical interests. </jats:p>",

Since availability of water is confined to the south-west monsoon period (rainy season, June–September), eastern India is mainly mono-cropped, dominated by rice but second crops can be planned based on the soil hydro-physical properties, mainly water retention and available water of the soil profile utilising residual soil moisture. Keeping the existing land use as a base and considering the potential and prospects of soil hydro-physical properties in different topographies, in this investigation, an alternative land-use plan was developed in different parts of the watershed and tested in its rainfed rice area. Since direct measurement of available water capacity or soil water constants over a large area is time-consuming, pedo-transfer functions were also developed to predict soil water constants using easily measured parameters (e.g. cation exchange capacity, organic carbon, oven-dry bulk density, soil texture, calcium carbonate, etc.) of arable land of the watershed. Results of implementation revealed that the new cropping system was practical for increasing production, productivity, profitability, and sustainability of the rainfed rice area of the eastern India.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Federal laboratories are often caught between the need to meet mission objectives and the mandate to act as national stewards for natural resources. Following the initiation of the Manhattan Project in 1943, restricted land use at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) retained many undisturbed areas that function as ecosystem sanctuaries for plants and animals throughout the 43 mi2 site. We developed a Quantitative Habitat Analysis (QHA) that enables both managers and scientists to better meet the goals of ecosystem management and sustainable development for LANL. QHA is a multi-faceted modeling, planning, and management tool with the goal of applying existing models in a new way. QHA provides an objective, standardized, and replicable system for management of wild areas by federal agencies. As part of the development of QHA, we reviewed 42 existing wildlife and habitat models, assessments, or evaluation methods and 12 computer programs. A pilot field study was conducted on 12 plots testing five different methods to determine the most suitable for data collection for the tool. Once methods were selected and models determined, a QHA application tool was created in ArcView to test the pilot data within the tool for user-friendly application. This year, 45 field sites were sampled. QHA currently comprises five main sub-models analyzed within a geographic information system using ArcView: 1) Ecological Land Classification (landscape level effects), 2) Rapid Ecological Assessment (general assessment)/U.S. National Vegetation Classification Element Occurrence (ecosystem “health”), 3) BEHAVE (wildfire and fuels monitoring), 4) Habitat Analysis and Modeling System (wildlife), and 5) ECORSK.6 (bio-contaminants). Key to this QHA tool was the use of “common currencies.” The common currencies consist of weighted scores that calculate a “grade” or means of comparison between different programs and scoring methods. Development and calibration of the QHA continues.</jats:p>",

The study subpopulations had socioeconomic conditions favorable to growth, and low mobility, with at least 20% of mothers following feeding recommendations and having access to breastfeeding support. The individual inclusion criteria were absence of health or environmental constraints on growth, adherence to MGRS feeding recommendations, absence of maternal smoking, single term birth, and absence of significant morbidity. In the longitudinal study, mothers and newborns were screened and enrolled at birth and visited at home 21 times: at weeks 1, 2, 4, and 6; monthly from 2 to 12 months; and every 2 months in their second year. In addition to the data collected on anthropometry and motor development, information was gathered on socioeconomic, demographic, and environmental characteristics, perinatal factors, morbidity, and feeding practices. The prescriptive approach taken is expected to provide a single international reference that represents the best description of physiological growth for all children under five years of age and to establish the breastfed infant as the normative model for growth and development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An evacuation model that explicitly accounts for observed household interactions is presented. A series of linear integer programs determines household decisions of where its members will meet and how to organize the meeting logistics in the event of an evacuation. In the first mathematical program, the household selects a meeting location. In the second, the household members without vehicles are assigned to drivers. This second formulation results in an activity chain for each driver. These chains are then loaded onto the network using a microassignment simulation procedure that captures the resulting traffic interactions taking place in the network. An example is presented to illustrate the methodology; a network serving three business, six residential, and five school zones is examined. An evacuation during business hours is simulated using the activity chains for 20,000 households. Comparison of clearance times with different network loading strategies reveals that a minimum of 150% of the original demand should be used for evacuation planning purposes if no special considerations or adjustments to the network model are made. Modifying the network to account for unusual parking circumstances that may arise when parents pick up their children at school under emergency conditions may allow for a reduction in the amount of demand required for evacuation planning. The exact multiplicative factor depends on the loading scenario employed by the planning agency and any additional special emergency considerations that may be taken into account. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Highway speed and travel times are generally the standard for evaluating highway network performance. Yet these data are often costly or difficult to obtain. As such, recent research has focused on exploiting new technologies (e.g., cell phones) as cost-effective sources of speed and travel time information. Consistent with this work, a new source of data and an acquisition approach that provides both vehicle speed and travel time measurements from ad hoc probe vehicles at modest cost are presented. In this system, probe vehicles collect Global Positioning System speed, heading, and position data and transmit them over amateur radio frequencies. Frequencies are monitored by personal computers, which are used to receive and process the probe data. System output consists of records containing traveler location, speed, and the time at which data were transmitted. Moreover, these data are managed and maintained as layers of points in a geographic information system and lend themselves to use in several applications. Contrasted with the system described, most traditional speed measurement systems (e.g., loop sensors) are restricted to collecting data at fixed points along major highways where sensors are installed. However, probe data facilitate regional analysis since acquiring information from probe vehicles does not depend on fixed observation points. Some of these applications and advantages of the data are discussed, and a detailed comparison of speed data retrieved from the presented probe system and data collected by traffic loop sensors is provided. The analysis demonstrates that the described probe vehicle system is an effective transportation data source. </jats:p>",

Indeed, in practice, such a system not only cultivates accurate and timely information which is available for all operations in a company, including those in global locations, but also fosters more effective decision making and the attainment of the competitive advantage. This study, therefore, examines the benefits of implementing an ERP system, in general, and SAP R/3, a type of ERP system in particular, in the headquarters of major corporations in the United States, as well as in the factories of these corporations located in Guadalajara, Mexico. More specifically, eight corporations which have adopted SAP R/3 and include AT&amp;T, Compaq, Eastman Kodak, Hershey Foods, Hewlett‐Packard, IBM, Intel, and Motorola are examined, and the benefits and merit of having the same SAP R/3 software system in their installations in Guadalajara, Mexico are explored.</jats:p>",

This study illustrated the importance of needs assessment in planning health promoting school initiatives by comparing the results of youth risk behaviours surveys conducted at two districts of Hong Kong, namely Tsuen Wan and North District. The findings indicated that the two districts should prioritize their resources in respect to their urgent needs. A higher proportion of students from Tsuen Wan participated in vigorous exercise regularly in comparison to students from North District. Students from North District consumed more vegetable per week and exhibited less depressive symptoms than students from Tsuen Wan. The availability of data on youth risk behaviours of the two districts would provide information for strategic planning and direct decision-making in youth health programmes. </jats:p>",

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2002 with healthcare staff trained under the Program. While interviewees noted achievements in the items? uptake during the Program, allied health involvement in case conferencing and care planning had been impeded by GPs? limited adoption of the items. Allied health professionals were broadly interested in participating in care planning and case conferencing with GPs. The General Practice Education, Support and Community Linkages Program supported implementation and appropriate use of the Enhanced Primary Care Medicare Benefits Schedule items. While allied health professionals are generally interested in participating in care planning and case conferencing with GPs, such activity requires ongoing systems support and relationship building. Ample scope remains for awareness raising, relationship building and joint activities across the sector. Future item usage will need to be supported by resources and continued relationship building.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The budget-allocation process in pavement management occurs at several levels of decision making. In normal practice, the central level is concerned with the allocation of the budget to regional agencies to improve the health of the overall road network, while the regions are responsible for the programming and scheduling of road maintenance in their respective networks. The information processed at different management levels differs, and information at one level may not be readily available to the other. As a result, the maintenance funds allocated by central management to regional highway agencies may not be best used. A budgetallocation procedure based on artificial-intelligence agents is presented; it takes into account information integration between the central and regional management levels by using multiagent systems. Agents are used to facilitate the interaction between decision makers at the two management levels and thus provide a means for vertical information integration. A hypothetical problem containing a two-level funds-allocation structure consisting of a central-level management and three regional highway agencies is investigated. Each regional agency has different road network profiles with different local-level objectives. A genetic algorithm is used as the optimization tool in the decision-making process carried out by each agent. The results are compared with conventional allocation approaches and a two-stage optimization approach. It is shown that, with better integration of information at the different management levels, the resulting budget-allocation strategy produces greater maintenance-cost savings for a given target level of pavement performance. </jats:p>",

Within this literature, the focus is usually on specific ADAS technologies and aspects of ADAS implementation. Broader pictures of ADAS implementation, in which the various ADASs, their possible consequences for transportation-system performance, and societal conditions for implementation are treated in an integrated way, are seldom presented. As such, the current value of these studies is highly limited with regard to public policymaking. In addition, full-scale implementation of ADAS is limited by uncertainties about its performance and driver acceptance. A flexible or adaptive policy is proposed that takes some actions right away and creates a framework for future actions that allow for adaptations over time as knowledge about the performance and acceptance of ADAS accumulates and critical events for ADAS implementation take place. The adaptive approach is illustrated in the context of ADAS for road-traffic efficiency. </jats:p>",

A sequence of multivariate statistical analyses, including multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, generated maps and figures that were then interpreted by project stakeholders. The results were immediately incorporated into an official plan, approved by the governor and state legislature, recommending how Hawaii’s tobacco settlement resources could be used to create sustainable changes in population health. The results also provide empirical support for the premise that both community and systems factors ought to be considered when planning comprehensive health improvement initiatives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A pavement-rehabilitation planning system enabled by a geographical information system (GIS) is described; it can perform multiyear projectlinked network pavement-rehabilitation analyses subject to funding availability, minimum performance requirements, and other constraints. The system first uses information on the current and historical project-level pavement-condition evaluation stored in the central database to forecast project performance ratings and distresses. It then determines appropriate rehabilitation methods and costs and, finally, calculates life-cycle costeffectiveness ratios for all projects in the pavement network. With this information, the program performs analyses to determine multiyear minimum funding required to meet prescribed pavement-performance requirements and constraints and to determine optimum pavementrehabilitation plans subject to funding availability and other requirements, such as balancing funding distribution or future pavement performance among state congressional districts or Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) districts. The system uses dynamic segmentation to create GIS maps, links them with the central database and network analysis results, and thus allows users to make changes to the rehabilitation plans directly on the GIS maps and have the changes reflected automatically in the database. Several examples using the actual data on historical pavement condition evaluations from GDOT are presented to illustrate the capabilities of the system. </jats:p>",

Two of 10 history variables were related: perceived poor own dental health and perceived poor mother's dental health.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Model validation involves the comparison of model forecasts with observed data that are not used in model development to identify model prediction capabilities. In this study, the historical forecasting method of validation is applied to the original version of the Sacramento, California, regional travel demand model (estimated with 1991 data) with observed data obtained in 2000 to test the accuracy of the model over a 9-year period. Two simulations were used to test the model's accuracy and its representation of induced travel. The results indicate that the model's functional forms and parameters overestimate vehicle miles traveled, hours traveled, and hours of delay (by 5.7%, 4.2%, and 17.1%, respectively) and that the model captures about half of estimated induced travel (i.e., elasticity of 0.14 versus 0.22). It appears that if the model were used for air quality analyses in this region, its overestimation of daily vehicle travel would provide a relatively generous margin of error with respect to meeting emissions budgets. However, in environmental impact statements for new highway projects, the model's upward bias would tend to overestimate no-build travel demand and congestion and, thus, the need for the projects. Compared with the no-build alternative, the magnitude of change for the highway alternative would have to be greater than the model error to be considered significantly different. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens, Greece, transit passengers will be mainly accommodated by public transportation modes. The large number of passengers expected to be carried, combined with the congested road network and limited parking spaces, will make it difficult for private vehicles to be used during the games; as such, use of mass transportation will be necessary. An extended public transportation network is being planned that consists of three lines of the Athens Metro, a suburban rail line, two tram lines, and 30 dedicated Olympic bus lines in addition to regular bus lines. Planning of the network is a complicated process with more than 30 Olympic bus lines connecting Olympic venues with Athens downtown, other venues, Metro stations, and park-and-ride areas. Metro lines will be operating 24 h/day, many hours near capacity. To assist in this effort, a decision support system was developed to help plan the Olympic public transportation network operations. The user-friendly system is supported by a graphical user interface and based on widely available software packages. Its capabilities include data storage, management, graphical analysis, analysis with the use of specialized algorithms, and extraction of proposed courses of action. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning at transit stations often involves an uneven field of stake-holders with varying degrees of interest in a station and its immediate area. Because a controlling influence among these stakeholders is usually absent, rail transit agencies often divide station area planning into its component parts and work with appropriate partners to develop plans and strategies for future investment. Although this approach is practical and expedient, it often ignores the integrated nature of a transit station, its surrounding land uses, and the larger transportation network. The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) district—a heavy rail mass transit system serving the Bay Area—has recently completed a series of planning studies meant to integrate station capacity, access, and land use development. The overriding goal of a comprehensive station plan (CSP) is to create a consensus for future investment by partner agencies, the private sector, and BART alike. This new approach has been undertaken in direct support of BART's strategic plan, adopted in 1999, which has advanced a range of new policies and programs that ultimately have led to the CSP process. An overview of the CSP process is based on BART's initial experience at its Pleasant Hill Station along with examples from Balboa Park and Union City. How the CSP process integrates the components of station capacity, access, and area development to create a well-balanced investment strategy is also considered. Finally, the guidance in BART's strategic plan and achieving the plan's goals are particularly emphasized. </jats:p>",

Production from the Njord field is strongly influenced by a complex pattern of segmented and linked extensional faults. The current interpretation of the well test data and production history is that the faults form barriers to fluid flow, reducing oil production, and limiting effective gas injection and pressure support. Drilling results demonstrate that geometrical uncertainties remain in the seismic interpretation. An additional problem is that currently available commercial reservoir modelling technology cannot easily handle a very complex fault pattern, making simulation grid construction difficult. Accurate well placement and production forecasting requires that fault geometries and properties are suitably represented in the reservoir simulation model. 3D visualization of depth-scaled volumes and depth-converted interpretations helped to decide how to best simplify the fault geometry for simulation, and compare automatically generated geological model components against seismic interpretations and data. The reservoir simulation model runs resulted in the identification of a number of well targets. 3D visualization techniques were then used to predict faults and structures that the proposed well trajectories may intersect.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p content-type=\"supplementary-material\">\n            <jats:bold>Supplementary material:</jats:bold>\n            The nineteen movies referred to in the article are available at\n            <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4784667\">https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4784667</jats:ext-link>\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper describes the mechanism used to gain insights into the state of the art of mathematics instruction in a large urban district in order to design meaningful professional development for the teachers in the district. Surveys of close to 2,000 elementary, middle school, and high school students were collected in order to assess the instructional practices used in mathematics classes across the district. Students were questioned about the frequency of use of various instructional practices that support the meaningful learning of mathematics. These included practices such as problem solving, use of calculators and computers, group work, homework, discussions, and projects, among others. Responses were analyzed and comparisons were drawn between elementary and middle school students' responses and between middle school and high school responses. Finally, fifth‐grade student responses were compared to those of their teachers. Student responses indicated that they had fewer inquiry‐based experiences, fewer student‐to‐student interactions, and fewer opportunities to defend their answers and justify their thinking as they moved from elementary to middle school to high school. In the elementary grades students reported an overemphasis on the use of memorization of facts and procedures and sparse use of calculators. Results were interpreted and specific directions for professional development, as reported in this paper, were drawn from these data. The paper illustrates how student surveys can inform the design of professional development experiences for the teachers in a district.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The journey to work has been extensively studied. The majority of travel, however, takes place outside that context. The concept of time use as applied to travel behavior has developed with the understanding that travel occurs in relation to the spatial separation of activities and according to the needs and constraints imposed on travelers by their time schedules, sociodemographic characteristics, and network characteristics. The statistical methodology used to elucidate the underlying motivations affecting travel to evening shopping activities, a largely unstudied area of travel behavior, is described. Methods of testing for selectivity bias and endogeneity are also described and applied. Corrective measures are taken and explained, including instrumental variables and system methods of regression. Travel time and activity duration are found to be endogenous and positively correlated. Travel time increases with greater vehicle ownership, duration of preceding work activity, transit use, and duration of free time preceding the trip. Travel time decreases for trips that start later in the evening and later in the week and with increased destination-node density. For teenagers aged 15 to 17, activity duration increases with number of passengers when preceded by longer shopping activities. Activity duration decreases with greater percentages of high-rent housing in the census tract, with household size, with number of workday trips, and for men. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At least two important transportation planning activities rely on planning-level crash prediction models. One is motivated by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, which requires departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations to consider safety explicitly in the transportation planning process. The second could arise from a need for state agencies to establish incentive programs to reduce injuries and save lives. Both applications require a forecast of safety for a future period. Planning-level crash prediction models for the Tucson, Arizona, metropolitan region are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of such models. Data were separated into fatal, injury, and property-damage crashes. To accommodate overdispersion in the data, negative binomial regression models were applied. To accommodate the simultaneity of fatality and injury crash outcomes, simultaneous estimation of the models was conducted. All models produce crash forecasts at the traffic analysis zone level. Statistically significant ( p-values &lt; 0.05) and theoretically meaningful variables for the fatal crash model included population density, persons 17 years old or younger as a percentage of the total population, and intersection density. Significant variables for the injury and property-damage crash models were population density, number of employees, intersections density, percentage of miles of principal arterial, percentage of miles of minor arterials, and percentage of miles of urban collectors. Among several conclusions it is suggested that planning-level safety models are feasible and may play a role in future planning activities. However, caution must be exercised with such models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's MOBILE emission rate model is used to evaluate carbon monoxide, hydrocarbon, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter impacts of major transportation projects. Using fleet characteristics, environmental conditions, and on-road operating conditions, MOBILE estimates fleet average emission rates. Coupling projected traffic volumes and physical roadway characteristics yields pollutant mass flux rates with which dispersion models predict downwind pollutant concentrations. Distance-flux relationships may also prove useful in pollutant exposure modeling to help quantify relative environmental risks of living or working near major roadways. Applying the MOBILE model requires the creation and execution of scenario-specific input files, which must be properly structured. Researchers developed the MOBILE-matrix model to facilitate more readily the use of MOBILE emission rates in transportation modeling. The matrix creates large emission rate lookup tables that can be applied to traffic in any facility or subregion. It performs all necessary model runs well before a future modeling need. The goal of this specific application is to integrate MOBILE-matrix capabilities into the multimodal transportation planning tool (MTPT) employed by the Georgia Department of Transportation so that it can be used to estimate emissions from rural road facilities throughout the state. Thousands of MOBILE6.2 runs were executed to generate database output files, which were post-processed to create MOBILE-matrix lookup tables for 159 Georgia counties. For each transportation link in the MTPT, emission rates are extracted from the lookup matrix by facility type, average speed, temperature, and so forth. The predicted emissions can then be used for a variety of transportation planning purposes. </jats:p>",

Yet in 1999 the city of Jeonju decided to introduce a light rail transit (LRT) system not only to improve its transit services but also to improve living conditions, expand business activities, and increase livability. The initial study was performed in 1999, and the preliminary engineering study was completed in 2001. The project is now into the final design leading up to construction. The system consists of a network of two independent lines 24.92 km long with 46 stations and is planned to operate mainly on the street median with a separate right-of-way. The project will be financed and operated by the public sector according to the Public Investment Inducement Act. The first line is scheduled to open in 2008 and the second line in 2010. Numerous issues and elements should be considered for successful project implementation because Korea has no experience in building an LRT system. Although the project seems to be going well, opposition from local organizations has been encountered. The history of the Jeonju LRT system is presented. The system features are described, including network alignment, projected ridership, and financing. Major elements considered and issues encountered during the planning process are also discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, FHWA, and California Department of Transportation have initiated a demonstration in California called Partnership for Integrated Planning. The purpose of this program is to obtain early involvement from local, state, and federal agency staff to help in planning for transportation infrastructure, urban growth, and resource protection together, rather than just to negotiate over permits for major infrastructure at the project stage. A report on this demonstration project is provided. The project applies a simple urban growth model based on a geographic information system to evaluate a transportation plan and projects in Merced County (population 211,000 in 2000). Interviews with agency participants show that, in general, resource agency personnel have limited involvement with transportation planning and transportation planners have limited knowledge of environmental planning; they therefore need to develop methods for identifying their concerns for 20-year planning purposes. Planning for resource protection for a whole county is quite different from arguing for maximum protection of resources at the project scale. The early steps in building the model and acquiring data sets are reviewed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) are the conduit through which billions of federal and state transportation dollars are funneled annually for regional transportation facilities. MPO transportation investments are guided by long-term regional transportation plans that are implemented through short-term transportation improvement plans. Because transportation investments shape land use patterns, decisions by MPOs have important implications for regional land use patterns and, by implication, social equity. For their part, MPO decisions are made by a board whose composition varies widely across the nation. They are not elected to serve on the MPO, however, and MPOs are not required by federal law to have balance in voting. Therefore, the potential exists for MPO decisions to be biased and favor certain investments beneficial to particular metropolitan areas' interests at the expense of others. This study reviews MPOs generally, discusses variation in their voting structures, and reports results from a statistical analysis on the pattern of transportation investments with respect to MPO voting structure. It was found that for each suburban MPO voting member, controlling for other factors, MPO investments are shifted 1% to 9% away from transit (and other modes) to highways. Implications for land use patterns and especially social equity are described. More research should be undertaken, however, to confirm whether and the extent to which such bias exists. </jats:p>",

These diseases have common risk factors that are amenable to primary and secondary prevention. The goal of the Chicago REACH 2010–Lawndale Health Promotion Project is to eliminate disparities related to CVD and diabetes experienced by African Americans and Latinos in two contiguous Chicago neighborhoods using a community-based prevention approach. This article shares findings from the Phase 1 participatory planning process and discusses the implications these findings and lessons learned may have for programs aiming to reduce health disparities in multiethnic communities. The triangulation of data sources from the planning phase enriched interpretation and led to more creative and feasible suggestions for programmatic interventions across the four levels of the ecological framework. Multisource data yielded useful information for program planning and a better understanding of the cultural differences and similarities between African Americans and Latinos. </jats:p>",

SRNA package was developed for 3D dose distribution calculation in proton therapy and dosimetry and it was based on the theory of multiple scattering. The compound nuclei decay was simulated by our own and the Russian MSDM models using ICRU 63 data. The developed package consists of two codes SRNA-2KG, which simulates proton transport in the combinatorial geometry and SRNA-VOX, which uses the voxelized geometry using the CT data and conversion of the Hounsfield?s data to tissue elemental composition. Transition probabilities for both codes are prepared by the SRNADAT code. The simulation of proton beam characterization by Multi-Layer Faraday Cup, spatial distribution of positron emitters obtained by SRNA-2KG code, and intercomparison of computational codes in radiation dosimetry, indicate the immediate application of the Monte Carlo techniques in clinical practice. In this paper, we briefly present the physical model implemented in SRNA pack age, the ISTAR proton dose planning software, as well as the results of the numerical experiments with proton beams to obtain 3D dose distribution in the eye and breast tumor.</jats:p>"
