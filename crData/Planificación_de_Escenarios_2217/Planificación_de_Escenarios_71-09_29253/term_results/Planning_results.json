      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops conceptual tools for the analysis of planning behaviour. These are, firstly, a model of planning systems as learning systems, and then three dimensions of planning behaviour, each described by defining a pair of dichotomous concepts at their far ends: ‘blueprint’ versus ‘process’ modes of planning; ‘rational-deductive’ decision-making versus ‘disjointed incrementalism’; ‘normative’ versus ‘functional’ planning. Each of these concepts is discussed in detail, and some indicators for the analysis of planning behaviour are suggested. Finally, a more complex model is constructed which combines the three dimensions. Elements of this model are firstly the level at which planning is conducted within a hierarchy of planning systems, and secondly, the ‘planning sub-structurel, that is the technology-image reflecting the nature of planning problems and available planning technologies. From this model one can derive a number of researchable hypotheses about planning behaviour. </jats:p>",

Application of this methodology provides guidelines for determining the optimal level of resources to be invested in the collection of information used for planning transport system changes. The rationale of investing resources in transport facilities and the philosophy of evaluating such investments are discussed. The context of the economics of acquiring information to support such analyses is pointed out. Application of the methodology developed to a realistic problem is described. The results of trade-offs between the reduction in social costs of transportation— the benefit, and the cost of information acquisition— the cost, are discussed. Thus, the role of a formal cost-benefit analysis of information acquisition in planning for transport system changes is pointed out. </jats:p>",

A two hundred item achievement measure and a twelve concept semantic differ ential attitude measure were administered to both groups. The results of a t-test analysis of group mean scores permitted two conclusions. First, adults who participate in program planning appear to have more positive attitudes about their educational experience than those who do not. Second, no evidence was found to support the notion that participation in program planning affects achievement. </jats:p>",

Although the concept of spatial demand has played a central role in location and spatial economics since its development by Lösch and his incorporation of it into his model of spatial competitive equilibrium, a comprehensive rigorous characterization of spatial demand does not presently exist. Accordingly, the contribution of this paper is a quite general formulation of spatial demand and a rigorous specification and evaluation of some of its most important properties. </jats:p><jats:p> Spatial demand is found to consist of two components: free spatial demand which corresponds to a situation in which the geographic market areas of suppliers do not interact, and competitive spatial demand which corresponds to a situation in which they do. This distinction allows the derivation of conditions for, among other things, the (1) existence of these two components, (2) continuity of the spatial demand function and its first derivative, and (3) convexity or concavity of the spatial demand function. Such properties of spatial demand are basic to an evaluation of the existence, stability, and general nature of spatial competitive equilibrium. </jats:p>",

Its approach is to draw upon related studies to derive expectations with regard to search patterns, and to test these through empirical analysis. This involves identifying and measuring distance, directional, and sectoral spatial biases, for which an algorithm is presented that employs a map transformation and standard ellipse analysis. </jats:p>",
