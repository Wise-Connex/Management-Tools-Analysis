Its applications had been initially restricted to construction and engineering. Growing sophistication in the use of the tool has extended its applicability to the area of new product planning. </jats:p><jats:p> The purpose of this article is to introduce to marketing managers and analysts the group of techniques called CPA and its application to new product planning. The process of new product planning as a function of marketing management is first described. The concept and the underlying logic of CPA and a hypothetical new product venture are presented to show the technique's rationale and capability. Extensions of CPA and its value in a new product venture conclude the discussion. </jats:p>",

For presentation convenience, the material is stated in terms of military planning, where this planning refers to the production and use of types of weapons that have already been developed. The situation can be conveniently phrased in terms of resource allocation with respect to some specified types of weapons that are to be used to attack some given targets. Consider all combinations of target and type of weapon. The problem is to distribute the total available resources (for production and use of weapons) among these combinations in such a manner that the value of the targets surviving the attack is minimized. A deterministic model of an exceedingly flexible nature is developed for representing situations of this nature. Despite the generality allowed, an elementary iterative method is obtained for solving the allocation of resources problem. These results are computer oriented and should be feasible for application even when the model is of an exceedingly complicated nature. </jats:p>",
