It is thus an ambitious and significant contribution to research on language generation in artificial intelligence, which has previously concentrated in the main on the problem of translation from an internal semantic representation into the target language. Dr. Appelt's approach, based on a possible-worlds semantics of an intensional logic of knowledge and action, enables him to develop a formal representation of the effects of illocutionary acts and the speaker's beliefs about the hearer's knowledge of the world. The theory is embodied and illustrated in a computer system, KAMP (Knowledge and Modalities Planner), described in the book.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Applying a relatively decentralised system of control which would keep state-owned enterprises (SOE) at arm's length from ministerial departments has been a stated policy for many governments around the world. However, the specific controls typically used for implementing this policy have seldom been successful. The purpose of this paper is to review and evaluate certain of these controls, drawing upon the British system of arm's length control of nationalised industries. In order to delimit the problem the paper cuts across the government-SOE relationship from the perspective of investment planning. Using primary information from the capital investment process in a particular nationalised industry, the paper searches for evidence on whether and in what ways existing controls have not been successful. </jats:p><jats:p> Three types of controls are investigated: (1) The economic and financial groundrules, which are supposed to simulate a competitive, business-style efficiency. These rules are often assumed to act as an “invisible hand,” limiting direct government control. (2) The direct investment review, in the framework of the wider public sector expenditure survey. In discussing the nature of this review the paper examines whether government approval of investment conforms to an incrementalist or “muddling through” model. It further considers the role for incremental methods in controlling SOE investment. (3) The attempt to use corporate planning as a control instrument. Evidence from internal control processes within the enterprise and in particular the review of investment by a Central Executive is used in order to evaluate the above controls. This serves to show the diffuse character of the planning process and the possibilities and limitations of using similar controls at the government level. Suggestions are put forward for strengthening these forms of control by modifying or reinforcing certain elements within the existing arm's length framework. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper would be useful for evaulating the difficulties involved in establishing some form of orderlines and formalisation in government-SOE relationships. It shows some of the weaknesses associated with certain “technocratic” rules and solutions to public policy problems in this environment. </jats:p>",

In this process, trajectories of welfare levels (composed of wage plus nonwage benefits), information flows, vacancy and unemployment levels are generated for different worker and job types, regional aggregates, and the system as a whole.

These applications are illustrated by seven tracing experiments undertaken at a landfill site in the Jurassic Great Oolite Limestone of the Cotswolds using fluorescent dye tracers. The tracers proved non-conservative, which limited their use in determination of hydraulic properties, but were still detectable over 5 months after injection. Background fluorescence due to organic materials in landfill leachate and chemical instability caused problems in analysis, but these could be overcome. Overall the tests were successful in identifying the sources and paths of leachate leakage in the landfill, permitting design of effective remedial measures, and in demonstrating the risks of leachate contamination at surface streams and springs in the vicinity.</jats:p>",

Significant spatial variations in plant product technological sophistication were identified on an urban-size basis, with factories located in smaller urban centres less likely to be of low-technology status. In terms of nonspatial factors it was the organisational characteristics of the companies, rather than the plants themselves, that were influential in determining product sophistication. The importance of the spatially dispersed nature of manufacturing by large, often foreign, firms was confirmed as having an important role in the pattern of plant product sophistication within the UK pharmaceutical industry. </jats:p>",

The starting point is the question of how to account for the changing fortunes of this type of region; they are interpreted as being in the final stage of their regional ‘life cycle’. By applying factor-analytical methods to differentiate the Austrian regional structure, it can be shown that there are distinctive differences in supply-side characteristics between regions. Centering on the analysis of old industrial districts, the findings confirm that these areas represent a special type of region; they can be described by a combination of variables which is common to them and not to other regions. The resulting combination of variables supports the hypothesis, based on aspects of the various regional growth theories, that the poor performance of old industrial areas stems from a lack of competitiveness and an inadequate flexibility in adjustment to change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Throughout one hundred years, Zionist ideology has dictated national settlement planning in Israel. In this highly dynamic society, political processes significantly affected the planning environment, and major planning goals were clearly derived from this reality, while being evaluated against social values. Negligence in the planning process was most critical in the formulation of conflicting long-range goals that impeded implementation. Goal conflict was especially harmful when economic planning was not as sound at a time when geopolitics, security, and defense goals were primarily pursued. Within the fundamental goals, incremental decisions—to construct new communities or extend existing ones—were also implemented. Antiplanning variables slowed down execution only to some extent, but their impact may increase in the future.</jats:p><jats:p>Analyzing the relationship between ideology and settlement implementation national planning concepts (through historical perspective), a subject that has received little attention in the past, contributed some analytical policy insights. Clearly, goal hierarchy or the domination of certain goals is sometimes required. However, in order to resolve conflicts, an effort should be made to decrease the differences in weights among goals. Thus, tension could be reduced to facilitate implementation. It is also possible to trade off one goal for another. Compromising among incompatible goals is a crucial matter to Israeli national settlement planning. There should be more balance in the allocation of resources economic objectives on one hand, and geopolitics, security, and defense goals the other. In addition, an attempt should be made to reduce the influence of antiplanning variables. Some of them, such as domestic or international political pressures, are more difficult to control; others are easier to influence. Specific attention should be devoted to achieving a higher professional level in planning, and more opportunity should be provided to experts to contribute input to decision-making processes.</jats:p>",
