      "abstract": "<jats:p> A class of environmental problems, termed 500-year problems, poses significant threats to the world's societies. In 500-year planning there is a need for a sound philosophical foundation to guide the development of appropriate methods which analyze problems that cover very long time periods and that involve large uncertainties. In this paper philosophical aspects of 500-year planning, related to determining whether present generations are meeting their obligations to future generations, are addressed. Topics discussed include the treatment of future populations (as identifiable individuals or as enumerable groups) and the appropriate base for 500-year planning (utilitarianism or social contract theory). Adopting Rawls's concepts of the original position and of the veil of ignorance, a social contract is developed that guarantees the possibility of existence for all potential individuals, and sets limits on the risks that current and future populations might endure as a result of their ancestors' abuse of the environment. The specifics of the contract represent rational criteria upon which to base 500-year planning activities. </jats:p>",

Patients are definitely being discharged more quickly, but the pri mary concern is that they would be discharged pre maturely. In either case increased posthospitalization support is required. This study reviewed the timeli ness of the request for the consultation with the dis charge planner, the timeliness of the process of relay ing the consultation to the discharge planner, and the timeliness of the response of the discharge planner to the consultation. The discharge planner was asked to see 35 of the 72 patients in this study during the first week of their hospitalizations. Of the 69 patients who were discharged, 33 were discharged either the same day of or the following day after the consultation request. Although several systems have been devised for early recognition of patients' needs for discharge planning, none would be necessary if physicians would identify appropriate patients early during their hospitalizations. </jats:p>",

In recent years, various approaches have also been developed to take into account dynamic aspects of spatial interaction models, by means of, for instance, optimal control theory, bifurcation theory, or catastrophe theory. The present paper deals with new directions in dynamic spatial interaction research. The focus is on a general dynamic interaction model analyzed in the framework of optimal control theory. The objective function used is a bicriterion utility model, to be maximized subject to a set of differential equations which bear some resemblance to those used by Wilson in a shopping-centre context. The link between the model presented and a catastrophe type of model is investigated. It is demonstrated that catastrophe behaviour may emerge as a particular case of this optimal control model. Finally, it is shown how external influences (for example, stochastic impacts of the Brownian motion type) affect the optimal trajectory. </jats:p>",

This paper is an attempt to compile the scattered information on urban land-policy in India, to describe the major instruments currently in practice, and to examine them critically in a comprehensive perspective. In this way, I assess their potential and the constraints they place, in relation to planned urban development, regulating land-supply, and smoothing the behavior of the urban land-market. It is found that, despite the great promises attached to the present instruments, most of them have so far demonstrated only limited success, mainly because of their conceptual limitations and their disjointed nature. I highlight the improvement possibilities of the instruments and point towards some innovative technique(s) of urban land-management, for future application. I conclude that it is necessary to have a comprehensive and integrated approach to the setting up of policy objectives and instruments, and to their coordination with national development policies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present a general theory of urban development, which we then compare with the developments in the urban system of the Netherlands, for the years 1970 to 1986. We propose that urban dynamics are started by and are continually influenced by fundamental changes in technology, social values, demography, and politics. Each factor will be more significant in one stage of urban development than in others, and therefore a four stage cycle is produced: stage 1, industrialisation occurs; stage 2, the service sector and transport facilities grow; stage 3, there is a greater appreciation of the environment; stage 4, the society tends to an ‘information society’. </jats:p><jats:p> It appears that the Dutch urban system is in stage 3 of these developments: deconcentration of population peaked in the early 1970s and has since declined (under the influence of economic and demographic changes). Dynamics slowed under poor economic conditions, but by the late 1980s, deconcentration increased with the economic recovery. The Dutch system is progressing towards stage 4, with possible revitalisation of large towns by means of new policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The significant contributions of demographic—economic modelling to the area of impact assessment are recognised, but it is argued that much greater attention must be focused on the demographic components of these models. In particular, distinctions between household types must be treated more adequately, and mechanisms for changes in household type must be articulated and refined. The inadequacy of the current state of demographic—economic models in this regard is demonstrated by a reconsideration of the early basic formulation of Madden and Batey, upon which much of the subsequent literature draws. The simple failure of this model to allocate new jobs to unemployed nonheads of households illustrates the need for increased focus on the demographic aspect of demo—economic models. </jats:p>",

In the clothing industry, capitalists have relied upon increasing rates of exploitation to maintain their high rates of profit, and there has been only limited technical change; in the textile industry, the technical composition of capital has risen, and its negative effects on profitability have been offset by changes in the turnover time and the rate of exploitation; the knitting industry lies between these two extremes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nonsurvey input—output models, especially those constructed by means of pool and quotient techniques, are suspect when applied to the case of cross-hauling. This is well known. But the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Forest Service, through its IMPLAN model, and the US Department of Commerce (USDC), through its RIMSII model, encourage the application of pool and quotient nonsurvey models in cases where cross-hauling is likely to occur. In a study of the timber economy of the West-central Idaho Highlands we show the error caused by ignoring cross-hauling in estimates of logger—sawmill trade. We argue that pool and quotient techniques, used in nonsurvey models such as IMPLAN and RIMSII, should not be applied to a single county situation, or to any aggregation of counties that is not, in some sense, a functional economic area. This applies in many cases to full state models. We close by noting that in many applications of pool and quotient nonsurvey input—output methods, technique may be substituting for thought. </jats:p>",
