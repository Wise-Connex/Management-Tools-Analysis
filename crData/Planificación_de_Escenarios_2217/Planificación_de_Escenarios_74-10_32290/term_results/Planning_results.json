Lynch's (1961) studies proposed a qualitative method. An alternative method, essentially quantitative, is proposed here: pedestrians surveyed are asked to locate on a paper some well-known landmarks (six in all). Distances between each pair of them are measured. The model allows (1) interpretation of the degree of agreement between mental maps, and (2) a study of the ‘mean’ map. Perception seems to make space more symmetrical. Distortions can be explained by two effects: differences in transportation modes, and a particular knowledge of the neighborhood. The mental map recovered through multidimensional scaling is compared with the topographic one. It does not have the metric topology. </jats:p>",

The special techniques required were developed and are described here. The theoretical framework within which local traffic effects can be treated at a strategic level is developed using marginal cost road pricing as an example, and the necessarily stringent pricing establishing the convergence, stability, and repeatability of the results is described for a practical algorithm which can readily be used in other transport planning program systems. The application of these techniques to analyse the comparative effects of different traffic restraint policies, and the variations on the techniques required to handle several groups of travellers who react differently to restraint measures, are the subject of companion papers to appear later in this journal. </jats:p>",

However, analyses of planning experience were then generally inhibited by a preoccupation with descriptions of the formal planning procedures rather than with any serious attempt to assess anything but the economic consequences of planning. (Andrew Shonfield's classic study of <jats:italic>Modern Capitalism</jats:italic> was a conspicuous exception to this criticism.) Attention was focused on plans as official documents rather than upon a set of planning practices that might be only remotely related to any formal statement of public policy. Planning was viewed too much from the forecasting end rather than the implementation end and the rationality of objectives became more of a preoccupation than the practical problems of translating them into reality. A normative model of efficient decision-making was all too often assumed to be readily transposable because of a wholly unrealistic notion of the ways in which organizations work.</jats:p>",

Since June of 1968, over 400 million barrels of crude and condensate and over 600 billion cubic feet of gas have been discovered. This paper is concerned with the Jay-Little Escambia paper is concerned with the Jay-Little Escambia Creek Field (Jay-LEC) which is by far the most significant discovery in the area with crude reserves estimated to be about 340 million barrels. Within four years of discovery, this field was unitized and producing over 90,000 BOPD. Within four days of the effective date of unitization, waterflood-pressure maintenance operations had begun. These achievements are notable examples of the benefits that can result through careful planning, vigorous investment commitment, and cooperation among all the interested parties in an important oil discovery.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Development of the Jay-LEC Field reflected an aggressive and competitive investment commitment. The second confirmation well was a three mile stepout. Sour crude production was initiated under stringent regulations within 6 months of discovery by relocating and modifying a used gas treating facility. Initial steps to construct a pipeline with capacity in excess of 100,000 BPD were taken when the field was producing less than 10,000 BOPD. The working producing less than 10,000 BOPD. The working interest owners committed to over 90,000 BOPD in treating capacity and sulfur recovery equipment within two years of discovery and entered into purchase contracts that committed over $10 million for waterflood facilities prior to agreement on unitization plans.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Additional recovery studies were planned to support specific field development needs.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Today, partly as a result of the actions taken by federal and local civil defense groups, it is rare to find an American community of some size that does not have some kind of emergency plans and preparations. On the other hand, it is the very rare community, indeed, that finds its planning anywhere near sufficient or adequate for a really major disaster. Domains often have not been clearly defined, tasks integrated, resources allocated and efficiently mobilized, and effective disaster activities performed. </jats:p><jats:p> In what follows we indicate some general weaknesses we have observed in a variety of situations. They do not indicate all the problems that should be considered by planners. However, they do highlight typical sources of difficulty. </jats:p><jats:p> 1. In many communities, disaster plans do not specifically assign an official or organization with the responsibility of assessing what the overall emergency is and what it means. Effective disaster preparations should provide for systematic reconnaissance and other procedures for obtaining a central strategic overview of the crisis. </jats:p><jats:p> 2. Arrangements for disseminating emergency information to all crisis relevant organizations, mass media sources, and the general public are frequently missing from disaster plans. Good planning provides for ways of obtaining accurate information and the transmission of it to all interested parties. </jats:p><jats:p> 3. Some disaster plans do not call for the establishment of some kind of command post at the disaster scene or point of greatest impact. This command post should be integrated with the emergency operating center (EOC) which should not be used for field operations, but have a more general policy making and overall control function. </jats:p><jats:p> 4. Much disaster planning does not adequately deal with the problems of interorganizational coordination at the time of a community emergency. But good plans clearly specify exactly what organizational representatives should be present at EOC's and what their specific duties should be before, during and after disaster impact. </jats:p><jats:p> 5. New emergency domains are often either inadequately specified or not covered at all in some disaster plans. Good disaster planning assures that all necessary domains, particularly new ones, are covered and that the plans clearly specify who is responsible for what. </jats:p><jats:p> 6. Certain emergency tasks tend to be ignored more often than others in disaster planning. Disaster plans should make certain that tasks are clearly thought through ahead of time and assigned to specific organizations, be they established, extending, expanding or emergent groups. </jats:p><jats:p> 7. There is a tendency, particularly in disaster-prone communities, to plan only for the more likely kinds of disasters. Effective disaster planning takes into account the full range of possible disasters in a locality even though it may concentrate on the more probable liklihood. </jats:p><jats:p> 8. Very few disaster plans take into account the transition from the emergency period to the recovery period and almost none deal with the inevitable movement back to normalcy. There is little excuse for the almost total absence of guidelines at all toward restoration of normalcy in overall community disaster planning. </jats:p><jats:p> 9. Disaster plans too often remain paper plans and are not rehearsed in whole or in part. Effective emergency planning requires realistic exercises of disaster plans, at both the organizational and community levels. </jats:p><jats:p> 10. There is a tendency to let emergency plans get out of date. Good disaster planning requires a specific revision of plans, preferably triggered by some relatively automatic system of review (e.g., by examination of the plans on specific dates such as before the local tornado, flood, or hurricane seasons, and exercises of such plans). </jats:p>",

By construction of a taxonomic tree, this paper demonstrates that the capacity expansion and the location—allocation solutions are just the simplest instances of a whole class of models. Formulation of these various possibilities is undertaken and it is shown that a fully integrated spatio—temporal plant-construction model can be derived, at least at the theoretical level. Although the derivations are in the form of deterministic programming models, the concluding section of the paper suggests possible ways in which these might be reformulated to allow for the fact that most planning takes place in an uncertain environment. </jats:p>",

Initially, 388 water-resources concepts from the human domain were collected, screened, and grouped to define 42 different factors. Then, from ratings of similarity-dissimilarity by 300 raters, a matrix was generated of mean distances between all 861 possible factor pairs; the matrix was analyzed by computer-based multidimensional scaling techniques to determine the underlying dimensional structure. Finally, using procedures that paralleled those for determining factor similarity-dissimilarity, a value reflecting social importance was developed for each of the 42 factors and for the 5 basic dimensions which emerged from the multidimensional analysis. These values were found to cover a wide range; however, values for the same factors and dimensions were found to be nearly identical among different sub-groups of people, even those with potentially divergent viewpoints, such as behavioral scientists and water-works professionals. </jats:p>",

The chosen framework views the task of floodplain management as a constrained optimization problem capable of solution by standard mathematical programming techniques. The framework is sufficiently flexible to permit incorporation of, in addition to floodplain zoning, such non-structural flood control measures as flood proofing, insurance, and flood warning systems. Further, the framework can be modeled so as to include political restraints and a broad range of socially desirable goals. In a larger regional context, the framework permits the internalization of the value of the externality commonly associated with development of floodplain lands.</jats:p>",

These are often a consequence of the planning system itself and the manner of its introduction to the organization. A new approach is described in this paper by which planning is introduced in stages. Each is a logical development of the previous one but each makes a reasonable demand on the staff and there is time to ensure that the data needed at each stage by the staff is available. Furthermore, the staff contribute to the development of the planning system which, at each stage in its evolution, is adapted to their needs. Having thus described the introduction and evolution of a planning system in an organization, a later paper will review how the technical function of a company can link into it.</jats:p>",

In both social psychological theory and population policy practice there is a growing skepticism about the efficacy of communication and persuasion as means for producing behavior change.
