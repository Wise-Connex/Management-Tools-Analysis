The authors suggest that a peer resource model of education empowers students with confidence in their own experience and growing expertise. Peer resource learning demonstrates the potential of collaborative initiatives while providing a model of the professional work environment. </jats:p>",

These offerings, viewed as the supply of skills, are compared to the demand—skills and techniques used by U.S. planning practitioners. The analysis explores the match between supply, current demand, and skills and techniques practitioners claim they intend to use in the future. Results of the analysis are linked with 1986 work by Contant and Forkenbrock. The quantitative curricular offerings of planning programs are found to be relatively unresponsive to current and future practitioner demand for skills. Directions for possible curriculum changes are suggested. </jats:p>",

The basic aspects of this crisis involve: a fragmented administrative framework; low level of public expenditure; a significant private sector; inadequate hospitals; skewed manpower; and, a low level of primary care. In 1983, the National Health System (ESY) was established, as an effort to improve the above situation. This article presents the context of the ESY and the situation of the health system prior to and after the establishment of the ESY. The conclusion drawn is that many of the goals of the ESY have not been achieved or only partly achieved, and that a number of the above serious problems still persist.</jats:p>",

These pressures are bringing into sharp focus the need to take radical approaches to the organization, planning and management of the health sector; and, in particular, in the planning and management of <jats:italic>health human resources.</jats:italic> Issues of effectiveness, efficiency and value for money are increasingly becoming the central issues for the 1990s and beyond. The article examines the development of the Turkish health system. Within a framework of health care reform proposals emerging from a major development project in the Ministry of Health itself, the text explores current initiatives and future needs in developing human resource planning if the health care reforms are to be successful in meeting the health needs of the population.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Three reforms intended to expand access to credit in underserved communities were included in the savings and loan bailout bill of 1989 (FIRREA): the Community Reinvestment Act was strengthened, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act reporting requirements were expanded, and the Federal Home Loan Banks were required to establish a subsidy program for affordable housing. This paper examines three political battles fought over the implementation of these reforms: the efforts of finance industry interests to pressure for legislative and regulatory rehef, which stimulated opposition from consumer advocates; the response of the regulatory agencies to their new mandate; and the extent to which FIRREA's priority goal—restoring safety and soundness—contributed to the credit crunch in the multifamily housing sector between 1990 and 1993. </jats:p>",

Health care reform has been described as a ‘global epidemic’ (Klein, 1993). All health care reforms consist of very complex policy choices, some of which are examined in this article. After an introductory exploration of ideological issues, the objectives of health care reformers are considered. Three major policy objectives of health care reform are examined: cost containment; efficiency; and, equity. Three types of reform which have been advocated are also considered: public planning; market regulation; and provider‐advocated reforms such as a ‘basic package’ with copayments and alternative means of finance. Finally, appropriate features of efficient health care reform are suggested, addressing explicit policy goals.</jats:p>",

In a larger context, the article goes on to explore methods to help young people claim a more central place in the life of their cities and begin to effect environmental change.

A central property of self-organizing systems is that they are not controllable—not by individuals, nor by economic, political, and planning institutions. The city, in this respect, is complex and untamable. Inability to recognize and accept this property is one of the reasons for the difficulties and problems of modernist town planning. The theory and model we present are built to describe the urban process as a historical one in which, given identical initial conditions, each simulation run is unique and never fully repeats itself. From the point of view of urban policy and planning, our heuristic model can guide decisionmakers by answering the following question: ‘given the initial conditions of an inflow of new immigrants (that is, from the ex-USSR), what possible urban scenarios can result, and what are their global structural properties?’. </jats:p>",

The rural health services have benefited from the policies of economic reform, but not in an optimal way, particularly in poor areas. This article uses a case study of a poor county—Donglan—to illustrate that the fiscal decentralization combined with the financial responsibility system have resulted in a weakening of financing and provision of rural health services in poor areas. The need for health facilities to generate revenue has had unfortunate consequences for the style of medical care, such as over‐prescription. In addition, the collapse of the cooperative medical system and the weakening of the three‐tier network of rural health care in Donglan have jeopardized preventive programs and threaten access to basic health care for the peasants, especially the poor. The study found evidence that preventive programs have deteriorated over the past years, the poor had financial difficulty in access to services, particularly hospital care, health facilities at township and village levels have been run down, and less training and supervision have been provided by upper‐level health facilities. The article concludes with recommendations for a strategy for rebuilding and strengthening the three‐tier network of rural health care, and for establishing a cooperative medical and health care scheme to ensure that the majority of peasants in Donglan can be guaranteed access to basic health services. Limited health resources will therefore be better used.</jats:p>",

This approach is automated and combines an economics package and Mobil’s in-house simulator, PEGASUS, within a simulated annealing optimization engine. A novel framing of the well placement and scheduling problem as a classic \"travelling salesman problem\" is required before optimization via simulated annealing can be applied practically. An example of a full field development using this technique shows that nonuniform well spacings are optimal (from an NPV standpoint) when the effects of well interference and variable reservoir properties are considered. Examples of optimizing field NPV with variable well costs also show that non-uniform wells spacings are optimal. Project NPV increases of 25 to 30 million dollars were shown using the optimal, non-uniform development versus reasonable, uniform developments. The ability of this technology to deduce these non-uniform well spacings opens up many potential applications that should materially impact the economic performance of field developments.</jats:p>",

One way of looking at form level is as a reflection of ego strength, and one can conclude that the level of ego strength and all of the implications regarding information-processing, meaning-making, and the capacity for logical and realistic thinking would, then, seem to be associated with benefiting from psychotherapy. This finding was extended to suggest that this Rorschach assessment of ego strength is related to the kind of psychotherapy a person might or should be offered; that is, whether it should be supportive or exploratory or short-term and problem-centered. Rorschach data can also be helpful in identifying whether treatment-disruptive transferential reactions or resistances exist. In light of the information which can be gleaned from the Rorschach, it seems reasonable to suggest that the Rorschach should be used routinely in the planning of psychotherapy. </jats:p>",

Instead of the time-consuming process of reading off the percentage depth doses from the overlapping isodose charts and adding them up for selected points, the cards are fed into the automatic tabulating machine, which makes the summation of data for all the points mentioned above and tabulates the results.

What is the actual role of marketing in a\nJapanese corporation? How well are the Japanese versed in the\ndevelopment and implementation of marketing strategy? Is there really a\ndifference between marketing practices used in the West and those\nimplemented in Japan? Addresses these questions.</jats:p>",

Given the variety of interventions in the professional's repertoire, a decision to implement any one of these must be based on a strong probability that the outcome will be constructive. This study reports on the relevance of using vocational interests and aptitude data in the guidance process. The immediate and longer-term aptness of the assessment results is examined through analysis of measured interests, aspirations, scholastic aptitudes and tertiary course entry of 335 female secondary students. Results indicated excellent concurrent and predictive validity for the interest data while also indicating the role played by aptitudes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is about the role of technology in the transformation of space, and the ways in which these changes are represented. These processes are explored principally through critical analysis of the work of Harvey and Lefebvre; more specifically, I contrast the place of technology as expressed through their varied emphases on the annihilation of space, and the production of space. The dramatic restructuring of space and time in recent decades, associated with new high-speed geographies of production, exchange, and consumption, has been theorized against the backdrop of a ‘shrinking world’, The popular conception of the world shrinking to a global village is generally seen as the product of technological advances in telecommunications, transportation, and ‘information’. For Harvey, these innovations arc seen as the means through which capital has freed itself from spatial constraints. By placing the ‘collapse of space’ jargon alongside Marx's phrase, the annihilation of space by time, these spatial metaphors serve Harvey as shorthand for the complexities of time-space compression; the shrinking world is seen as a midpoint between a regime of accumulation and a mode of representation. I argue that, although these metaphors help to theorize the relativity of space—as the global impinges on the local—they only do so by obfuscating the relative space of everyday life, and the increasingly technical means through which it is produced. Through an interpretation of Lefebvre's discussion of technology in The Production of Space, I suggest how the role of technology in the transformation of space is not limited to those globalizing processes through which the world has been made increasingly interconnected in space and time. So too, technology has been critical to the domination of conceived space over lived space as social relations are spatialized at the scale of experience. As a foundation for these arguments, the social relations of technology and technological change are theorized through the incorporation of ideas from the social studies of science and technology and from critical human geography. </jats:p>",

One of the research fields is to enable robots to autonomously avoid collisions with surrounding objects. This article presents an efficient method for planning collision‐free paths for an articulated robot that is surrounded by polyhedral objects. The algorithm plans a hypothetical Archimedes's spiral path from the initial position to the goal position. When a collision among the arms and obstacles is detected, the hypothetical path will be modified to avoid the collision. The algorithm applies geometric methods to determine the upper and lower bounds of the reachable area of the wrist and then determines a collision‐free path point on that reachable area. Because the equations, which represent the upper and lower bounds, are simple, the algorithm can rapidly determine a collision‐free path. Moreover, with minor modifications, this path planning algorithm can also be applied to other robots such as spherical, cylindrical, and Cartesian types of robots. ©<jats:italic>1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

Therein, an object is modeled by a few of its 2‐D perspective (standard) views, each with a corresponding viewing axis defined by a marker placed on the object. The operation of the active‐vision system is characterized by its off‐line planning and on‐line recognition phases. The primary objective of this article is to address two issues in regard to the former: optimal object pre‐marking and optimal camera placement. The optimal object pre‐marking problem is defined as the determination of the minimum number of markers, and their best locations on a given set of objects to yield maximum “distinctiveness” for the 2‐D standard‐views defined by these markers. The optimal camera‐placement problem targets minimization of camera movements in detecting the markers. Following a brief description of the proposed on‐line recognition process, the techniques developed for the off‐line planning stage are described in this article. For experimental verification purposes, a prototype of the proposed active‐vision system was also implemented and is described herein. ©<jats:italic>1995 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

The framework is developed through a systematic analysis of the various types of relationships between information technology and corporate reorganization, and the identification of the key elements and dimensions of corporate reorganizations. It allows for specific organizational changes to be understood within the overall context of corporate reorganization in the firm, and most of all, to be easily seen as in some way related to the use of corporate networks. Unlike previous studies in which the role of space and place has mostly been marginalized, in this inquiry geography is regarded as an integral part of the development of corporate networks and corporate reorganizations. By centrally focusing on the intersections between corporate networks, large firms, and geography, I conceptualize a wide range of phenomena that are observed in real organizations, and speculate on their implications for the future form of organizations and urban and regional development. </jats:p>",

Appropriate string representation for the problem is presented. Binary and decimal coding and three selection methods are compared. The method is developed on a transputer that is one of the parallel processors. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated using a typical expansion problem with four technologies and five intervals.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The constitutive role of the media in relation to society has, arguably, not received the attention it deserves from those interested in the spatial constitution of society, A case could be made, for example, that the most dramatic manifestation of the relation between the media and space—viz globalisation—has led to a failure to appreciate the multifaceted scales and dimensions of this relation. Thus, though sometimes sensitive to the local scale, notions of globalisation have seemingly indirectly caused the neglect of a more thoroughgoing examination of space and time within media theory. Rather than develop such a critique, however, I seek here to demonstrate the difficulties involved in such a reconsideration of media theory. Accordingly, in the paper I provide an analysis of the temporal bias in existing media theory—examining, in particular, Jhally's political-economic analysis of the television-advertising airtime market—and proceed to offer an alternative spatial analysis of television advertising, using a case study of the United Kingdom. The difficulty of integrating the two accounts serves to question the adequacy of existing media theory, thus demonstrating the importance of detailed theoretical and empirical work in helping to understand the increasingly significant role of the media in relation to society, space, and time. </jats:p>",

I identify an innovation which best typifies the particular combination of New Right thought underlying the reform, the introduction of grant-maintained (GM) schools. These form a major component of the recent diversification of educational provision. It is argued that the spatial unevenness of this diversification, represented by differential GM adoption, has replaced differences in local education authority policies and practices in forming the basis of spatial differentiation in the education service across England. It is argued that GM schools have produced political, educational, and social divisions. These have augmented the tendency for the diversification to lead to social stratification. Having analysed the restructured education system, I critically consider the degree to which it reflects a post-Fordist welfare state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of contemporary systems of consumption across the humanities and social sciences are frequently shadowed by a recurrent problem. Difficulties centre on the tendency to construct a set of general theories, pitched at high levels of abstraction, about the economic and cultural transformations which have been associated with recent shifts in the structure of demand. It is argued that such a synthetic use of the concept of consumption cannot grasp the specificities of particular market sectors and their attendant forms of cultural and spatial relations. In this paper I propose a more precise and grounded focus to study the formation of a particular regime of gendered commerce in one area of London during the 1980s. The study demonstrates the ways in which a distinctive grouping of media professionals and cultural entrepreneurs occupied a pivotal role in the transformations taking place in Soho during this period. Shifts in the material and symbolic structures of social space were central to this process of urban change, which drew on earlier representations of city life to claim cultural authority. It was this metropolitan regime which actively shaped the production of a series of identifiable masculine identities. Such personas were plural and diverse, rather than unified and monolithic. The product of different masculine communities in the area, they were linked by consumer culture, but differentiated by their access to heterosocial or homosocial space. </jats:p>",

I suggest that some such commentaries have identified interesting parallels without providing much original analysis of why the putative transitions have come about. I also note various trends in the British health sector, which cannot be explained solely by reference to changes in the production process. Then, events in the British health sector since 1979 are considered in terms of the extent to which they can be interpreted in terms of a putative transition from Fordism to post-Fordism. This is divided into two sections. In the first, measures taken between 1979 and the National Health Service (NHS) reforms are examined, and it is argued that numerous measures taken prior to the NHS reforms failed to resolve some of the perceived crises of the NHS. The NHS reforms implemented from 1991 are then discussed and a number of problems are identified with these reforms, which highlight the difficulties of implementing a neoliberal reform strategy in the context of the British NHS. In particular the political conditions have yet to be established which might facilitate the wider extension of such a strategy, though this does not rule out changes that might restrict the scope of the NHS. </jats:p>",

The contributions range from general theoretical reflections on regulation, governance, the politics of identity, and the welfare state to rich, detailed case studies of restructuring and reorientation in specific policy areas. Taken together these papers not only provide telling empirical material on recent dramatic changes in the British welfare state, but they also have important implications for a wide range of theoretical and methodological issues concerning the regulation approach. My own comments are also wide ranging but far less detailed. They focus on some key issues which arise in several of the papers and/or which pose more general questions regarding regulation-theoretic and state-theoretic analyses of contemporary Britain. Thus I first consider some methodological issues posed by the contributors' use of the regulation approach to contextualize and/or explain recent changes in the British welfare state. I then address some theoretical issues posed by their relative neglect of the distinctive political dynamic of the postwar British polity and/or the relevance of its distinctive crisis to the recent restructuring of the welfare state. This enables me to address some of the perverse effects of neoliberalism and the extent to which it represents a novel continuation of the crisis of Britain's ‘flawed’ Fordism rather than its resolution. I conclude with some general remarks on the regulation approach. </jats:p>",

Local explanations provide a wide-ranging and challenging analysis of the dynamics of watersheds situated within a complex social and historical context. In conjunction with the spread of ox-ploughing and population growth and redistribution, a range of ill-conceived and authoritarian ‘conservation’ and ‘development’ interventions by the colonial state are argued by local intellectuals to be the major causes of accelerated soil erosion. Particular attention is given to how government imposed the deforestation and intensive use of difficult top land soils, and then transformed that uneven heterogeneous landscape into a smooth bare land connected by contour ridges and paths so that water concentrates, erodes, and then leaves the desiccating land to silt the rivers. The existence of sophisticated ‘indigenous knowledge’ systems in Africa has now been widely accepted, but this case study suggests that their very depth, variability and complexity means that attempts to harness local ecological knowledge for the understanding of – or development action about – environmental change may be more problematic than is often assumed. Researchers, government and conservation and development organisations need to do much more than seek to ‘tap’ such knowledge. Real understandings and ‘sustainable development’ can only flow from new power relationships with rural people and their knowledge</jats:p>",

The philosophical base and values of occupational therapy are consistent with those embraced by the emerging health care paradigm. However, occupational therapy staff at Victoria Hospital, an acute care university-affiliated health care institution, identified obstacles to seizing the opportunities offered by this shift in health care. In reviewing the literature, it was discovered that these obstacles were not unique to one particular facility, but were in fact common issues faced by the profession. The strategic planning process described in this paper provided a framework for addressing the identified barriers and positioning occupational therapists to play a proactive role in the evolving health care paradigm. </jats:p>",

Subjects were 30 boys (ages 5–7 years), 15 with specific language impairments (SLI) and 15 with normally developing language. Children were asked to build four hierarchical structures: a block construction, a puzzle construction, a simple straw construction, and a complex straw construction. Children who failed to complete the complex straw construction were taught how to construct the model using a sequential strategy. The two groups tended to perform comparably on the block and complex straw construction, the easiest and hardest of the four constructions. The two groups performed least comparably on the puzzle, simple straw construction, and the training task. On the basis of these findings and recent work by Greenfield (1991), we concluded that it is time to reject the notion that a central hierarchical planning mechanism underlies language and non-language structures that contain hierarchical components. The possible exception is early in development before language and manual actions become more autonomous and modular in nature.</jats:p>",

This problem has been solved previously by mathematical sensitivity analysis (which finds a single nonoptimal solution). It is difficult to plan for economical and reliable expansion due to its discrete and combinatorial nature. Although another method that has efficiency for combinatorial problems is neurocomputing, this approach saves computational efforts but obtains poor solutions. The most desirable approach for this planning problem is one in which many good solutions are found in reasonable time, because planning experts will then be able to plan economical and reliable expansion according to these solutions.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper presents an approach for solving transmission expansion planning based on neurocomputing hybridized with a genetic algorithm.

One important genre of masculinist geographical narrative is adventure. I explore the masculinism of adventure through a detailed, contextual reading of one particular adventure story. The Young Fur Traders—a British Victorian boys' adventure story set in Canada, written by the Scottish writer Robert Michael Ballantyne. In the setting of The Young Fur Traders, Ballantyne mapped a form of masculinity known generally as Christian manliness. Literal journeys through the spaces of adventure constituted metaphorical journeys through adolescence, from white, middle-class boyhood to white, middle-class manhood. Settings—liminal, largely unknown but broadly realistic, male-dominated, primitive, simplified, and idealised spaces—were imprinted upon this masculinity. The settings of adventure stories arc cultural spaces in which hegemonic masculinity is mapped and, in some cases, unmapped. </jats:p>",

The current effort attempted to gain insight into how team members are able to anticipate and predict each other's needs, enabling coordinated task accomplishment. It did so by integrating the literature across three broad areas related to teamwork and testing two specific hypotheses of how teams function. Results indicated that planning is a critical skill necessary for teams to understand each other's informational requirements and to communicate in an efficient manner. Implications for training this crucial skill are discussed. </jats:p>",

In previous work we developed a heuristic procedure that modeled only road construction as 0–1 variables. We have expanded this past procedure to also consider land management decisions as 0–1 variables. This paper outlines the heuristic procedure developed for modeling both road building and land management decisions as integer variables in light of adjacency constraints. The heuristic procedure allows economic or physical objectives to be maximized or minimized. A wide variety of side constraints can be accommodated and these constraints can include both road construction and land management decision variables. These heuristic procedures have performed well on models tested thus far. </jats:p>",

Effective grasping requires a combination of sensing and planning capabilities: sensing to construct a well-adapted model of the situation and to guide the execution of the task, and planning to determine an appropriate grasping strategy and to generate safe, feasi ble manipulator motions. We propose an integrated approach that combines computer vision, path planning, and manipulator control in three complementary activities: the reconstruction of task-oriented models of the workspace, the determination of ap propriate grasping configurations from computed \"preshapes\" of the hand, and the automatic generation and execution of hand/arm motions using a hybrid geometric path planner and a hybrid control system. This article outlines the architec ture of our system, discusses the new models and techniques we have developed, and finishes with a brief description of work-in-progress on the implementation and some preliminary experimental results. </jats:p>",

We argue that the French school of regulationist literature, though able to provide a broad frame of reference for analysing contemporary shifts in economy and society, needs to be supplemented by an analysis which focuses on the racialised and gendered character of the welfare state. In the paper the ways in which the ‘universal’ welfare state has operated to exclude minorities and marginalised groups are charted, and we argue that in practice the Fordist mode of social regulation (MSR) operating in Britain generated a hierarchy of oppression. This hierarchy was constituted through the relations of class, race, and gender, and we show how these are currently being redefined as the British state seeks to mediate the crisis tendencies inherent in the Fordist MSR. </jats:p>",

We develop a model which demonstrates that holding a resource in common where there is competition among individuals leads to inefficient harvesting of the resource but cannot lead to the destruction of forests. The same model is used to demonstrate that climatic conditions, low wage rates, and increases in the number of people entitled to harvest the resource are more-likely candidates for variables explaining the destruction of the forest. Examples taken from the Sudan and from China provide evidence that communities alter their pattern of ownership and migration so that they do not exhaust the resource. The main conclusion of the paper is that the behavior of the owners of the resource is not the underlying cause of the destruction of the forest. </jats:p>",

The objective of this project was to evaluate the importance of surgeon experience with regard to the rates of post-operative complications and the rates of relapse and survival. The results of the 8 surgical specialists who integrate the permanent staff at the institute and who different varying degrees of experience with regard to time spent exercising their specialties were compared. The results obtained did not show a significant difference among the various surgeons, and this uniformity is explained by the fact that all the therapeutic planning was elaborated through consensus of the whole group, and this could have minimized the effect of experience of a surgeon responsible for the operation. The authors emphasize the importance of pre-operative evaluation for good results and propose that it is in the direction of complete mastery of preliminary work in the area that programs for the formation of new specialists should be directed.</jats:p>",
