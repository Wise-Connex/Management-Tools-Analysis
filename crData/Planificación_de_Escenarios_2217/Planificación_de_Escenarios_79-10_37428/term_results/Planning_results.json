The development of social area analysis is briefly described, from its roots in pre-war urban sociology into its modern form as a research method based on multivariate statistical techniques, notably principal components analysis and cluster analysis. A number of applications of this method in mainly British planning experience are then described, and the main strengths and weaknesses of social area analysis are considered in terms of the problems of interpreting the results, its accessibility for potential users and the utility of the method for typical planning research problems. A number of further applications are considered and the conclusion is drawn that social area analysis has limited but important uses for a wide variety of planning research exercises. </jats:p>",

Thus, it assumes that planning comprises the activities of a variety of cognitive “specialists.” Each specialist can suggest certain kinds of decisions for incorporation into the plan in progress. These include decisions about: (a) how to approach the planning problem; (b) what knowledge bears on the problem; (c) what kinds of actions to try to plan; (d) what specific actions to plan; and (e) how to allocate cognitive resources during planning. Within each of these categories, different specialists suggest decisions at different levels of abstraction. The activities of the various specialists are not coordinated in any systematic way. Instead, the specialists operate opportunistically, suggesting decisions whenever promising opportunities arise. The paper presents a detailed account of the model and illustrates its assumptions with a “thinking aloud” protocol. It also describes the performance of a computer simulation of the model. The paper contrasts the proposed model with successive refinement models and attempts to resolve apparent differences between the two points of view.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author makes the hypothesis that higher spatial equity does not always mean lower economic efficiency. An attempt is made to check this hypothesis by working out four alternative spatial organizations—described as egalitarian, centralistic, moderate, and moderately concentrated—and evaluating them from the viewpoint of spatial equity and economic efficiency. Spatial accessibility and costs are used as measures to represent spatial equity and economic efficiency. Under certain assumptions concerning concentration of settlement and investments, scale economies, and the transportation system, the centralistic alternative turns out to be not only cheaper but also more advantageous in respect of spatial accessibility than the egalitarian alternative. This means that under certain conditions and within certain limits the relation between concentration and spatial accessibility may be positive rather than negative. In other words, with these conditions and limits it is possible to obtain scale economies and to improve spatial accessibility simultaneously. Hence higher spatial equity may be accompanied by greater economic efficiency. </jats:p>",

The similarity of the output planning problem to the more familiar aggregate planning problem is noted and discussed.</jats:p>",

One of the most impressive characteristics of the visit was the impact that the social system has upon individuals in China. Consequently, China's human services structure is designed to cooperate in the building of a strong, socialist state. This article is an attempt to briefly discuss four significant social policy areas in the Peoples Republic of China. These policy areas include: marriage and family; family planning; child care, and health care. These particular social policy areas will have a major influence as to whether China will have the domestic resources in order to achieve its goal of the four modernizations (agriculture, industry, national defense and science and technology). For those of us who perceive ourselves as world citizens, China should be of special interest because it now cares for over one-fifth of the total world population. </jats:p>",

Cognitive conflict, value conflict, and interest conflict are common. Methods for resolving each of these three types of conflict have been developed. Resolution methods vary considerably by type of conflict, but most require explicit conflict definition and flexibility to choose freely from among available alternatives. Formal descriptions of the water resource planning process, which are based upon the rational‐analytic model of choice among alternatives in pursuit of stipulated objectives, are largely consistent with the use of most of these conflict resolution methods. The reality of federal water resource planning, which has been shaped as much or more by the distributive political process which it serves as by the rational‐analytic model, is not consistent with the use of most conflict resolution methods. Real objectives are hidden, the search for alternatives is sharply constrained by agency missions, and much flexibility is sacrificed to the necessity for strong early local commitment as a requirement for continued funding. When coupled with the normal tendency to avoid conflict for as long as possible, this results in foreclosure of most conflict resolution possibilities before conflicts are fully revealed.</jats:p>",

In three of the four districts over 60 % of the children were regular attenders, enjoying the benefit of less active caries than irregular attenders. However, in the remaining district, much of which consisted of depressed, inner city areas undergoing re‐development, only one third were regular attenders. Several local factors, such as availability and accessibility of services, probably influenced the numbers seeking regular care, but one of the most important appeared to be the level of provision in the salaried Community Dental Service. The implications of the findings for planning improvements in local services are discussed.</jats:p>",
