The main objective was to determine the effects of health care decentralization on changes in health financing. Taking into account feasibility, political and technical criteria, three Latin American countries were selected as study populations: Mexico, Nicaragua and Peru. The methodology had two main phases. In the first phase, the study referred to secondary sources of data and documents to obtain information about the following variables: type of decentralization implemented, source of finance, funds of financing, providers, final use of resources and mechanisms for resource allocation. In the second phase, the study referred to primary data collected in a survey of key personnel from the health sectors of each country. Taking into account the changes implemented in the three countries, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each country in financing and decentralization, a rule for decision‐making is proposed that attempts to identify the main financial changes implemented in each country and the basic indicators that can be used in future years to direct the planning, assessment, adjustment and correction of health financing and decentralization.

Managers are now beginning to appreciate the need to benchmark the strategically relevant processes in their value chain. Process benchmarking begins with exploratory qualitative research to determine the core processes to be benchmarked. Quantitative research then follows, using an audit methodology and involving the collection of the costs of core processes from benchmark partners on a standardised computer spreadsheet. Each partner receives the results of statistical analysis comparing the firm’s own cost structure to the average of the benchmark partners in each core process. Strategic planning decisions can then be made about how to generate greater customer value by eliminating excess capacity, outsourcing and modifying existing processes. This paper describes a process benchmarking partnership conducted across four Australian building societies to illustrate the strategic benefits of this research methodology for firms in the new millennium.</jats:p>",

Conventional marketing research is increasingly viewed as being too narrowly focused on tactical and operational issues. It is characterized by an overriding concern with data rather than analysed information and the research is often conducted in response to an apparent market threat or opportunity rather than on an ongoing basis. This paper attempts to highlight the role of the Internet for market intelligence purposes. It proposes and demonstrates the marketing intelligence process, techniques and procedures, as illustrated by a case study on Creative Technology.

Hospitals and doctors will need to prove they are safe—quality is no longer assumed. These were the predictions of a recent workshop of Nordic quality experts. The pressures to assess quality are increasing, and there are many assessment, certification, accreditation and measurement schemes in use. Which is best? What evidence is there that any have been effective? How should a hospital or region introduce such a scheme? There are many proponents for different schemes, and an increasing amount of experience to help answer these questions, but little research.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper provides an overview for non‐specialists of the different quality evaluation and indicator schemes for inspection and improvement. It draws on the experiences of quality specialists and leaders in each Nordic country who have applied the schemes in public hospitals and healthcare services.</jats:p><jats:p>How a scheme is introduced and used may be more important than which particular scheme is chosen. This is one conclusion of the Nordic workshop. Other conclusions are that there is a need for clinicians to be involved, a need to balance simplicity and low cost with scientific validity and credibility with clinicians, and a need for research into different schemes to discover their costs and benefits in healthcare.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes the many pitfalls that school technology planning processes can engender, and presents an improved model for planning for the use of technology in K-12 schools. There is a need for such a model because current school technology planning efforts are often devoid of context, and lead to poorly conceived arrangements of technology that are not supportive of learning goals. The new model is called “Planning for Technology” as opposed to the more common “technology planning” in order to emphasize the secondary nature of technology in relation to other considerations, such as curriculum and pedagogy. The model we present is described in the context of a case study conducted in an urban K-8 school that was attempting to make more productive use of their existing technology, and to more effectively plan for future technology. </jats:p>",

Less evident are the structural factors that underlie the increases and their implications for the future. This paper discusses these structural factors, puts them in the context of the healthcare marketplace, and proposes a way to address them using a collaborative arrangement among all stakeholders in a healthcare system, called <jats:italic>value‐based partnering</jats:italic>. To be successful, the effort must include not only final purchasers (such as employers or Medicare in the USA) but all stakeholders in a healthcare system. Each stakeholder must develop a value equation in terms that are meaningful to the others, and must identify opportunities for value‐enhancing partnerships. The paper also identifies some of the impediments to value‐based partnering and discusses ways to overcome them, including the need for senior management intervention within some stakeholder groups, and the importance of collaborative discussions among all stakeholders.

The survey was planned by a Ministry of Health and Social Services' working group, with technical support provided by a donor funded health programme. Together with complementary qualitative data, obtained through focus group discussions with the community, the survey generated information on the extent to which the referral system was being bypassed, the types of bypassing and related factors. These included reasons for non‐compliance with referral to the intermediate hospitals, perceived barriers to their utilization and community preparedness to use these hospitals after upgrading. The results were used to inform decisions about the classification of the three hospitals and identification of their catchment areas. The results were also shown to be useful for assessing the likely impact of different strategies for reducing bypassing. In Namibia these impacts were expected to be limited, due to the influence of distance and low population densities. Information on the extent and types of bypassing taking place across districts is essential for assessing opportunities to improve the functioning of a pyramidal referral system, which supports a cost‐effective primary health care strategy.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nLong-term prognoses point to the unabated growth of leisure and holiday travel. This situation presents an opportunity both to create new jobs and to overhaul our transport system. With the trend towards more frequent, shorter, spontaneous — but all the more intensive — breaks, the distinction between leisure and holiday travel is becoming blurred. Foreign travel — in pursuit of either the sun or snow — continues to be popular, but globalisation entails not only the opening up of new markets, but also the rediscovery of local identity, with the focus on intimacy, niches and group. An appropriate strategy to pursue in central Europe would therefore be “More Frequent Short-Break Travel in Place of Long-Stay Tourism”. Germany is on its way to becoming a boring country. And yet the popularity of active sports and events suggests that there is a strong desire to experience something which contrast with everyday life. Instead of promoting standardisation and copying others, spatial planning and transport policy should be more daring in the field of leisure travel. It should encourage distinctiveness, creative provincialisation and partnerships among contrasting locations.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

The research design was a non‐concurrent, prospective case control design. Quality of care was determined as the degree of compliance of health care workers with the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) standards of assessment, treatment and counselling of sick children and their caretakers. The interventions tested were (1) structured feedback of health worker performance data and (2) formal IMCI training and (3) team‐based quality improvement. Performance feedback had a significant effect on compliance. Performance feedback alone created a significant short‐term impact on health care worker compliance, which improved between 34% and 85% in areas of assessment of sick children (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.05). In addition, performance feedback was significantly cheaper than formal training ($108 per health worker versus $430 per worker for IMCI training). However, this impact was not universal over all areas of compliance following each feedback. Instead, performance feedback had the greatest effect in areas in which health care workers performed poorly, while areas in which compliance was high eventually saw declines. In settings such as Niger, which has the highest child mortality in the world according to UNICEF figures, low‐cost techniques for supporting health workers once they have been trained in clinical standards are sorely needed. Performance feedback shows promise as a technique for improving quality of care with clinical algorithms such as IMCI. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Discussion has been focused on structural factors (transport infrastructure, settlement structure, fuel tax, etc.) which in many cases are not implementable (punitively high petrol prices) and/or which are not capable of achieving the envisaged effects to the degree desired (functional mix). Today’s transport structures and the current state of development of transportation are the result of “sovereign decision-making” (e.g. in the preparatory land-use plans (zoning plans) of local authorities), and of the “decisions of individual citizens” (e.g. in choosing where to live and the mode of transport they use). Accordingly, planning concepts need to be augmented by an “individualised” component and geared more to those existing assets which will dominate in the long term.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nEconomic and social structural change over the last 30 years have had a decisive impact on the development and the structure of the poor population in Germany. Rising unemployment has been accompanied by growing poverty, which in the contribution is defined by reference to welfare recipiency rates. Apart from the unemployed, foreigners and children have also become special groups with a high risk of poverty, partly as a consequence of deep structural changes in the demographic make-up of Germany’s population. The main focus of the article is the description and analysis of spatial disparities in Germany in respect of poverty, especially the west-east and the north-south divide, as well as urban-rural differences and inner-city segregation. Important determinants of these disparities are the relative size of risk groups in the respective populations., but also policies (especially labour-market policies in eastern Germany) and behavioural differences. The observed disparity patterns are quite stable over time. The most dynamic development is taking place in eastern (formerly East) Germany, where over the 1990s the urban-rural disparity pattern has become more and more similar to that found in western Germany.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In its latest report it identifies the “The advertising‐free zone brought to you by (fill in the\nbrand)” phenomenon. Roper Starch predict “ad‐free zones will be popping up on the Internet soon, a reflection of consumers’ increasing antipathy towards advertising”. This paper examines the opportunities for effective online marketing that go beyond the now omnipresent banner advertisements, and provides guidelines for marketers as to how to harness the “new set of capabilities” through planning and evaluation.

It is plainly evident that the use of the Internet and the intranet as global communication tools has risen exponentially over the past two years. However, a question remains as to whether this information is collected and presented in a form – at a level of specificity and depth – that makes for better decision taking. Today there is talk of the analyst – in this case the market researcher – requiring the skills of the “bricoleur”. This refers to the need in today’s world of multi‐source imperfect data of being able to piece together different weights and hues of evidence. While we acknowledge evidence exists of good practice, we believe that more needs to be done to provide practical training on how to operate in this bricolage mode, if we are to keep on top of twenty‐first century marketing information. Argues that there are seven issues that need addressing in order to ensure that the information needs of management are being satisfied by the market researcher.</jats:p>",

This paper focuses on the topic of suburbanisation, taking Estonia as a case. To understand more neatly the processes at work, a conceptual distinction between the terms suburban growth, suburbanisation in a narrow (statistical) and wide (including mechanisms of population change) sense is proposed. As part of the wider definition, the following characteristics of suburbanisation in Western countries are brought out: the inner decentralisation of population within agglomerations for environmental reasons, the spread of low-density, detached housing together with blurring of borders between urban and rural areas, and the relation to people's life-course. These form a baseline for comparative research which reveals both similarities and differences in suburban population developments in Estonia. </jats:p>",

Although there is a growing body of research devoted to this issue little has been done to explore the impact of Internet technology, e‐mail users’ on‐line skills and experience, on their choice of the new survey medium. This study is based on a sample of 122 responses from UK marketing executives using e‐mail and mail questionnaire surveys respectively. The research instrument included measures of respondents’ extent of e‐mail use, their general knowledge of online communications and their time of using the Internet. Some significant impact of these factors has been identified. The empirical evidence supports the hypotheses that the use of e‐mail survey methods is positively connected with high technology awareness and extensive e‐mail use. The findings imply that proper survey planning and administration are important for Internet‐based marketing surveys and suggest the existence of certain user patterns among different Internet user populations.</jats:p>",

The different senses in which ‘institutions matter’ are explored and the need to contextualize the institutional turn, both at more macro and at more microlevels, is also emphasized. One way of undertaking this contextualization is through the ‘strategic – relational approach’ with its concern with both the structural and the strategic dimensions of a contextualized institutional analysis. As well as presenting the approach in general terms, the author also illustrates its relevance to the spatiotemporal dimensions of institutional analysis. Eight broad conclusions about the institutional turn are presented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This author offers a circumspect appraisal of the recent controversies surrounding an ‘institutional turn’ in economic geography and urban and regional studies. He contends that, although the prevailing institutionalist perspectives undoubtedly yield many welcome innovations and useful departures, they are also beset by certain conceptual difficulties. These include, first, a thin political economy most discernible in the failure to appreciate fully the crucial role of the state in shaping the urban – regional process, and a related weakness in examining the asymmetries of power which enframe the governance of space economies. Second, there is a danger of drifting towards a soft institutionalism: a tautological trap that could invite researchers and policymakers mistakenly to envisage the presence or otherwise of a regional ‘institutional thickness’ or a local ‘social capital’ as an adequate explanation of uneven economic development. It is then contended that one relatively mature but continually evolving institutionalist political – economic framework, the Regulation Approach, might help to redress these deficits and to illuminate further our understanding of urban – regional economic change. Recent contributions examining the shifting geographies of accumulation and the rescaling of regulation are viewed to be particularly germane in this regard. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Current and future wastewater treatment and disposal strategies of Istanbul city are presented. Istanbul is the largest city of Turkey and has a population of 10 million that may reach about 20 million in 2032. The city is divided into Asian and European sides by the Bosphorus Strait. The Sea of Marmara is an enclosed sea, connected to the Black Sea and Aegean Sea by the straits of Bosphorus and Dardanelles. Therefore, there is very strong and permanent stratification in the Sea of Marmara throughout the year, lower layers carrying Mediterranean and the upper layers carrying Black Sea water. This unique coastal structure of Istanbul necessitated a detailed study to determine the level of wastewater treatment and the location and depth of marine outfalls.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A comprehensive three-dimensional water quality modelling study concluded that tertiary treatment including nitrogen and phosphorus removal is required for the effluent discharges into the Marmara Sea. However, enhanced primary or even primary treatment has been found satisfactory for discharges into the lower layers of the Bosphorus and into the Black Sea. Provisions for upgrading to secondary treatment were recommended. The status of existing and planned wastewater treatment plants and sea outfalls of Istanbul city are also presented. Although the amount of treated wastewater was only 63 percent in 1998, a target of 95 percent treatment level by the end of 2000 has been adopted in implementation plans. All treatment plants are located at or close to the coast except Pasakoy WWTP which is in the catchment area of Omerli Reservoir, the major source of drinking water for Istanbul city. The Pasakoy WWTP has been designed to treat wastewaters collected from the catchment area of Omerli Reservoir to tertiary level before ultimate disposal. The implementation programme together with the cost estimates are given. Total investment on water, wastewater and stormwater projects up to year 2032 is estimated at about 10 billion US Dollars. The share of the wastewater projects in this total is increasing with time. The financial analysis concluded that investments for a Higher Demand Scenario can be realised by raising the water tariffs to 1.0 $/m3 for Phase 1 and 0.9 $/m3 for Phase 2.</jats:p>",

Analysis of the East Midlands in the 19th century highlights three important aspects of regional development. The first aspect is that causality was not unilinear. Industrialisation reinforced strong local specialisms and allegiances rather than generating the wider integrated regional economies and identities seen in other industrialising areas. The second aspect is the importance of scale. There was no preordained size for a region: coherent economic and cultural units in the East Midlands operated at a more localised level. The third aspect is the significance of temporal continuity, seen in the persistent centring of economy, social cohesion, and identity onto established urban centres, despite the coalescing forces unleashed by industrial and technological change.</jats:p>",

Meanwhile this method is applied to more than 100 WWTP. Specific technical and economic parameters were determined for the whole treatment plant and afterwards assigned to the different treatment steps. With these numbers differences between the examined plants and the respective benchmarks were visible. On the basis of the following cause analysis a schedule could be developed containing at first measures, which could be translated into action immediately. The less obvious reasons for differences between individual numbers required a deeper cause analysis. Because of external influences not all the plants can reach the benchmarks.</jats:p>",

It is an increasingly difficult task for managers to find an effective assortment due to uncertain consumer preferences and the exponential number of possible assortments. This paper presents an empirically based modeling framework for managers to assess the revenue and lost sales implication of alternative category assortments. Coupled with a local improvement heuristic, the modeling framework generates an alternative category assortment with higher revenue.</jats:p><jats:p>This framework, which consists of a category-purchase-incidence model and a brand-share model, is calibrated and validated using 60,000 shopping trips and purchase records. Specifically, the purchase-incidence model predicts the probability of an individual customer who purchases (and who does not purchase) from a given product category during a shopping trip. The no-purchase probability enables us to estimate lost sales due to assortment changes in the category. The brand-share model predicts which brand the customer chooses if a purchase incidence occurs in the category. Our brand-share model extends the classical Guadagni and Little model (1983) by utilizing three new brand-width measures that quantify the similarities among products of different brands within the same category.</jats:p><jats:p>We illustrate how our modeling framework is used to reconfigure the category assortment in eight food categories for five stores in our data set. This reconfiguration exercise shows that a reconfigured category assortment can have a profit improvement of up to 25.1% with 32 products replaced. We also demonstrate how our modeling framework can be used to gauge lost sales due to assortment changes. We find the level of lost sales could range from 0.9% to 10.2% for a period of 26 weeks.</jats:p>",

A review of the existing planning process of NREB revealed several areas of potential improvement. In the past, NREB did not use optimization and/or probabilistic methods in their planning. Their decision‐making on maintenance, generation and fuel allocation was being performed in a sequential and ‘fragmented’ fashion, ignoring the possibility of interaction between the generation, transmission, and fuel supply subsystems. The deterministic treatment of outages of generators, and the planning criterion of spreading demand shortfall uniformly across the regions, were other areas of potential improvement. An integrated model, using linear programming together with a heuristic, has been developed to perform joint decision‐making on fuel supply, maintenance, generation, and transmission. Monte Carlo simulation is used to incorporate the random outages of generators. The model has been prototyped using GAMS language together with a spreadsheet interface, and implemented for the NREB system. Substantial reduction in system costs is envisaged based on the results of a case study. The model is expected to aid the complex decision‐making process of NREB planning engineers in several important ways.</jats:p>",

The program simulates the treatment process using accurate three‐dimensional graphical models of the gantry, table, and that of an average patient. This allows the use of any mechanical movement concerning the radiotherapy unit. The simulation of the mechanical movements and their limitations are according to IEC standards and thus compatible with any radiotherapy machine. Graphical methods for collision detection between the models guarantee speed and accuracy. The module simulates the treatment setup with accuracy better than 2° for any tested case. When a collision takes place a warning message is displayed. In this paper a software tool is developed that can be used as a stand‐alone program or embedded in any treatment planning system. The visualization of the treatment fields prior to treatment permits the geometric feasibility of the plan, thus adding one more step toward the automation of the treatment process.</jats:p>",

It is argued that, although Amin and Thrift's original formulation of the concept of institutional thickness was comprehensive in scope, subsequent debate has focused around a somewhat restricted definition—essentially that of overt regionally based public, or quasi-public, institutions. The success of Motor Sport Valley in the absence of such infrastructure points to other sources of institutional strength and highlights the fact that all economic systems are constituted and mediated through a variety of types of institutional structure. The crucial issue when considering economic development, therefore, is not whether economically successful regions contain sources of institutional thickness, but rather the precise nature of the institutions in the area (and those influencing it from the outside) and their relationship with economic growth. </jats:p>",

We present a novel kinematic motion‐planning algorithm for character animation which addresses some of the outstanding problems. The problem domain for our algorithm is as follows: given a constrained environment with designated handholds and footholds, plan a motion through this space towards some desired goal. Our algorithm is based on a stochastic search procedure which is guided by a combination of geometric constraints, posture heuristics, and distance‐to‐goal metrics. The method provides a single framework for the use of multiple modes of locomotion in planning motions through these constrained, unstructured environments. We illustrate our results with demonstrations of a human character using walking, swinging, climbing, and crawling in order to navigate through various obstacle courses.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Pregnancy planning is becoming an important issue in preconception health promotion. Unfortunately, its definition and measurement remain imprecise. This article will develop an operational definition and identify essential components of the concept of pregnancy planning. Six steps from Walker and Avant’s concept analysis procedure were used. Data were collected through a literature review, interviews with key informants, and three focus groups. The concept analysis yielded a conceptual framework comprising three essential components: attitude, timing, and sexual behavior. Pregnancy planning is defined as the adoption of an attitude centered on conception, including sexual behaviors (proceptive or contraceptive) and timing. Moreover, pregnancy planning is not a clear-cut phenomenon with questions that can be answered simply with “yes” or “no”. Rather, it is a dynamic process that evolves according to contextual factors. From these results, an instrument evaluating the intensity of pregnancy planning can be developed for epidemiological research and promotional purposes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent debates on the regulation and governance of contemporary capitalism and its territorial form, there is an emerging consensus that successful economic development is contingent on a movement away from the nation-state and policy interventions at the national scale toward subnational institutional frameworks and supports. In effect, both an ‘institutional turn’ and a ‘scalar turn’ appear to be occurring, through which the heterogeneity of economic growth may be explored. The author scrutinises these claims by examining what is becoming known as ‘new regionalist’ orthodoxy in economic development. This orthodoxy is particularly powerful because its concerns for resolving economic and democratic deficit by harnessing the regional scale are supported by academics, politicians, and policymakers alike. Focusing on England's Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), a radical initiative in regional economic governance, the author argues for a need to rethink the nation-state and the processes through which its intervention is being scaled. RDAs have been given a remit to enhance economic and social development, but rather than their providing decentralised ‘partnerships for prosperity’, a number of contradictions and tensions are revealed. These indicate that England's own brand of new regionalism is heavily steered by political fiat and central government dictate. To inform new regionalist debates, the author consequently argues that a new (regional) scale of state power is emerging and RDAs are forming part of a political strategy aimed at rescaling, instead of resolving, an economic and democratic deficit. The author concludes by calling for a closer engagement in political – economic geography between state theory, crisis theory, and the scaling of state power and suggests a need to formulate a fourth-cut theory of crisis. </jats:p>",

It covered the appellate, general, and limited jurisdiction courts funded by state general funds. The study covered over 90 facilities in communities ranging in size from more than 750,000 to fewer than 100 residents. The largest courthouse serves 23 judges; the smallest serves 1. The state is responsible for housing the appellate and limited jurisdiction courts; county governments are responsible for general jurisdiction court facilities.

An intervention strategy designed to enhance the skills and roles of Health Centre staff, Village Health Volunteers (VHVs) and Traditional Birth Attendants (TBAs) was conducted. Over this timeframe, reported ANC access increased from 37 % to 47 %. Most women delivered their last child at home, usually assisted by a TBA. Few women practiced family planning, despite the fact that most reported that they did not want any further children. A range of reasons for not practicing family planning were found to be highly significant, including the lack of available services ( p&lt;0.01). The fear of side-effects decreased significantly ( p&lt;0.01), with the community education provided by the VHVs and TBAs, potentially being one contributing factor. The results of this study suggest that continual support of VHVs and TBAs will further improve the health of women in Cambodia. Asia Pac J Public Health 2001; 13(2): 74-78 </jats:p>",

In particular, we quantify the elasticity effects on these outputs. By unifying the treatment of emission and economic benefits, we have confirmed that those conclusions of the 1994 report of the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment relating to the effect of generated traffic on user benefits may be extended to the case of emissions. Specifically, we have shown both theoretically and numerically that, in congested conditions, elasticity effects may significantly undermine the emission benefits from new and expanded roads. With regard to both components of benefit we have drawn particular attention to the contribution of the off-peak period. For demand elasticities as low as −0.25 we also show that, compared with their evaluation under free use, the emission benefits derived from a road scheme may be significantly reduced, and user benefits moderately reduced, under a regime of congestion pricing. We finally address Foster's contention that the inclusion of induced traffic in road investment appraisal may improve the case for building and improving roads to a higher capacity. We discuss the theoretical conditions under which this may occur but suggest that these are unlikely to hold in practice. </jats:p>",

Three students—one receiving special education services and two who were at risk for more restrictive placements-participated in a school team-based assessment and intervention process. Assessments focused on students' strengths, interests, and support needs, along with possible social and biological causes of problem behavior. Schoolwide interventions, based on this expanded functional assessment approach, were implemented in teams composed of general educators, special educators, and school administrators. Results indicated that two of the three students increased or maintained high levels of general education participation and showed decreases in problem behavior. For a third student, poor implementation of the support plan was associated with increases in problem behavior and decreases in general education participation. Interrelations between operant function, support plan implementation fidelity, and student success are highlighted, along with a discussion of linking positive behavior supports and person-centered planning for students with and without disabilities. </jats:p>",

Practical motion planning involving multiple moving objects with complex geometries requires very fast collision detection. We present an approach to collision detection between moving robots for motion planning. It is based on a spherical hierarchy of detail for nonconvex and curved objects that need not be partitioned into convex ones. We present results that show the stability of the approach regarding the number of polygons used to model the scene. Numerical evidence of the algorithm's efficiency is also shown by several experiments, in which we obtain average intersection detection times of around 1 ms using eight processors for two closely moving robots involving 1900 polygons. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.</jats:p>",
