During the session, the main group (which includes trainers) breaks up into smaller groups to discuss the management of each case, then a spokesperson presents the management solutions back to the re-assembled larger group: further interaction and discussion then takes place. This article discusses six typical case scenarios from a recent workshop. The case scenario workshop is an exciting way to encourage discussion and interaction with all parties involved. </jats:p>",

Unitization is a paradigm that measures how actively people process stimuli by recording how many times they press a button to indicate that they have seen a significant or meaningful event. Trait dissociation was negatively correlated with participants' unitization of the acquaintance rape videotape, unitization was positively correlated with danger cue identification, and state dissociation was negatively correlated with dangerousness ratings.</jats:p>",

Both simulations cover a ten‐year period. The results of the control simulation (current climate) are compared to a climatological database. RCM and GCM representations of the climate are realistic, but the RCM shows more detailed results. Following this, a statistical analysis of the differences between current climate and double CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>scenario simulations is carried out considering both 2 m temperature and precipitation. The analysis shows a significant warming in seasonal averages and important differences in the 2 m temperature interannual variability. Especially important is the strong increase in interannual variability of precipitation found in winter and autumn. Relationships between anomalies of general circulation (500 hPa geopotential field) and surface temperature, precipitation and cloudiness are also analysed, showing an important effect of cloud cover anomalies over the 2 m temperature interannual variability.</jats:p>",
