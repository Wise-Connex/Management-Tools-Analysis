Planning has played a key role in tribes’ ability to exercise their legal sovereignty rights and the associated claims for control of land and resources, for the preservation of culture, and for the right as well as the means to exercise effective self-government. It begins with a history of federal-tribal relations to the 1930s, to provide some necessary context. Next, it examines the period from the New Deal to the present, the era of “Indian self-rule.” Then, to illuminate and probe the role of planning in the struggle for sovereignty, it relates (some of) the story of one reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, Oregon. </jats:p>",

Because youth are in many respects different from adults, the practice of youth participation needs special consideration. This article summarizes the findings from empirical studies of youth participation in terms of the impacts on the young participants and their communities, the capacity of youth to participate, and five lessons for effective practice. The literature review will help planners create meaningful opportunities for youth to have a voice in community and environmental affairs. </jats:p>",

A generation later, despite open housing laws, metropolitan communities remain highly segregated, not the least in New Jersey. A revitalization plan for Camden, where the Mount Laurel affordable housing cases were instigated, has given lip service to regionalizing the recovery effort, a challenge the Ford Foundation has picked up by supporting a number of related efforts aimed at achieving “regional equity.” Such efforts address the state court’s support for “sound planning,” but resistance to integration remains, leaving the outcome of concerted investments in social justice still very much in doubt. </jats:p>",

Each area of inquiry has much to offer the other, yet few links have been made between them. Typically, literature on place attachment focuses on individual feelings and experiences and has not placed these bonds in the larger, sociopolitical context in which planners operate. Conversely, the community planning literature emphasizes participation and empowerment, but overlooks emotional connections to place. Yet these attachments can motivate cooperative efforts to improve one’s community. Literature across disciplines is examined and synthesized to develop a framework for understanding the psychological dimensions of people’s interactions with community. An ecological model is then proposed that integrates multiple environmental domains and analysis levels. This model can accommodate place attachments and meaning as well as social and political aspects of community participation. </jats:p>",

The spread of the nation-state system constructed and legitimated the state as a dominant modern rational actor (Strang 1990; Meyer et al. 1997). Postwar efforts to bring about prosperity in the Third World propelled the state as the central locus of vision and action, and the state as such pursued progress on behalf of the nation and provided a blueprint for the nation ‘s future in national development plans. State planning, however, has been in decline in the last few decades.</jats:p>",

A major part of the book is devoted to planning under uncertainty, including decision theory, Markov decision processes, and information spaces, which are the 'configuration spaces' of all sensor-based planning problems. The last part of the book delves into planning under differential constraints that arise when automating the motions of virtually any mechanical system.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Victorian tenement manager Octavia Hill significantly influenced nineteenth-century British and U.S. housing reform. She provided clean tenements for London’s poor that generated a modest profit for her first investor, social philosopher John Ruskin. Hill’s success depended on regular personal contact with tenants and insistence on prompt rent payment. The migration of Hill’s system from British roots to American soil involved a network of settlement house workers in which Ruskin, the settlement movement’s originator, played a central role. American histories of housing reform often identify Lawrence Veiller’s Tenement House Exhibition of 1899 as a milestone, and American settlement house histories typically feature Jane Addams and Chicago’s Hull House. The purpose of this article is to highlight, and identify connections among, lesser known other settlement pioneers who fought for British and U.S. housing reform. The article describes Hill’s philosophy, documents how it reached the United States, and illustrates how Hill, Henrietta Barnett, and Vida Scudder significantly contributed to the production and dissemination of housing reform ideas. </jats:p>",

A paradox resulted. Strong judicial remedies were needed to break the political stalemate on issues of affordable housing, but voluntary compliance that could have avoided these stringent remedies became politically impossible for many municipalities because of the controversy over the courts’ role. A new approach to fair-share compliance, called “growth share,” has now been proposed, which seeks to break out of the paradox by giving deference to local governments on land use development issues so long as affordable housing opportunities are created simultaneously and in fair proportion to the actual growth experienced by each municipality. Potential strengths and weaknesses of this new approach are explored. </jats:p>",

To place previous work in context and extend work on heuristics for conditional planning, we provide a formal basis for distance estimates between belief states.  We give a definition for the distance between belief states that relies on aggregating underlying state distance measures.  We give several techniques to aggregate state distances and their associated properties.  Many existing heuristics exhibit a subset of the properties, but in order to provide a standardized comparison we present several generalizations of planning graph heuristics that are used in a single planner.  We compliment our belief state distance estimate framework by also investigating efficient planning graph data structures that incorporate BDDs to compute the most effective heuristics.\n\nWe developed two planners to serve as test-beds for our investigation.  The first, CAltAlt, is a conformant regression planner that uses A* search.  The second, POND, is a conditional progression planner that uses AO* search. We show the relative effectiveness of our heuristic techniques within these planners. We also compare the performance of these planners with several state of the art approaches in conditional planning. </jats:p>"

A set of Child-Friendly Indicators is applied as a tool for assessing and evaluating these three neighbourhoods. This paper focuses on diverse aspects pertaining to the child-friendly environment especially on the physical aspects. It will also share some of the recommendations to counter various issues in terms of planning for safe neighbourhoods in the future, as well as the recommendations to improve the developed Child-Friendly Indicators.</jats:p>"

Occupational therapists are not fully participating in transition services within secondary schools. One of the major obstacles to full participation identified in a previous research study by the authors of this article was that few occupational therapists were aware of appropriate evaluation options available for secondary transition planning. The authors in this article review the evaluation needs for secondary transition services in general, describe occupational therapy’s role in contributing to the Individualized Education Plan (IEP), and describe an evaluation method that gathers key information pertinent to the occupational therapy role. A case study is presented that illustrates how these assessment tools were applied to develop IEP goals in one student’s transition plan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Development is embedded in networks that extend across space and time. These networks—maintained, reworked, and given meaning through the practices of the actors who constitute them—bring together assemblages of institutions, knowledges, and commitments that make possible and shape the ways in which development is done through them. The authors explore the usefulness of concepts of network and assemblage for conceptualizing development, elaborating their ideas through two case studies. In the first they discuss colonial officers' experiences of living and working outside the United Kingdom, the ideas and practices that informed this mode of being, and their influence on the development work they did both in colonial and in postcolonial contexts. In the second they discuss the embeddedness of nongovernmental aid networks in religious, political, and other institutions, and the ways in which these institutions fashion the flows of such aid and the types of intervention linked to it. Though distinct, the two cases each show the ways in which social networks sustain particular intersections between institution, practice, and knowledge in informing development. They also suggest different methodological tactics for exploring these intersections. The nature of these tactics and their implications for producing knowledge about development networks are explored. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development of golf tourism requires the provision not only of one or more golf courses, but also of many other related infrastructures and facilities, obviously including hotels and other forms of property development. As a result, the process of the development of golf as a tourism product generates a profound impact on the location in which it takes place and can provoke conflicts and even imbalances where it is implanted. It is therefore essential to plan golf tourism regions carefully in order to make economic and social objectives compatible and thus contribute to the sustainability of the tourism sector, the product, the territory, the landscape and the local community. The issues examined in this paper include: the advisability of specific legislation for the implantation of golf, and of urban planning; the search for a correct balance between residential and hotel development on the one hand and golf course development on the other; the relative advantages and disadvantages of different types of property development, and its location both on and away from the coast; and the integration of golf courses in the landscape. Golf tourism development faces various challenges in its efforts to comply with the widespread objectives of overall sustainability, which include: economic profitability; long-term viability as a product; environmental integration and improvement; and cultural acceptability. This contribution aims to outline some steps to the achievement of these objectives. Firstly, the structure of golf tourism (from the perspective of its implications for planning) is briefly outlined to set the scene, including an evaluation of the different types of construction that are associated. The concept, objectives and process of tourism planning are outlined, followed by reference to aspects that are particularly applicable to the case of golf tourism. The problem facing planners is then defined. The instruments available and the initiatives and solutions most frequently applied in planning for golf tourism are examined and, finally, some recommendations are offered. </jats:p>",

Classical (model-free) reinforcement learning approaches omit such a model; standard sensorimotor models account for forward and backward functions of sensorimotor dependencies but do not provide a proper neural representation on which to realize planning. We propose a sensorimotor map to represent such an internal model. The map learns a state representation similar to self-organizing maps but is inherently coupled to sensor and motor signals. Motor activations modulate the lateral connection strengths and thereby induce anticipatory shifts of the activity peak on the sensorimotor map. This mechanism encodes a model of the change of stimuli depending on the current motor activities. The activation dynamics on the map are derived from neural field models. An additional dynamic process on the sensorimotor map (derived from dynamic programming) realizes planning and emits corresponding goal-directed motor sequences, for instance, to navigate through a maze. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change raises many concerns for urban water management because of the effects on all aspects of the hydrological cycle. Urban water infrastructure has traditionally been designed using historical observations and assuming stationary climatic conditions. The capability of this infrastructure, whether for storm-water drainage, or water supply, may be over- or under-designed for future climatic conditions. In particular, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events will have the most acute effect on storm-water drainage systems. Therefore, it is necessary to take future climatic conditions into consideration in engineering designs in order to enhance water infrastructure investment planning practices in a long time horizon. This paper provides the initial results of a study that is examining ways to enhance urban infrastructure investment planning practices against changes in hydrologic regimes for a changing climate. Design storms and intensity–duration–frequency curves that are used in the engineering design of storm-water drainage systems are developed under future climatic conditions by empirically adjusting the general circulation model output, and using the Gumbel distribution and the Chicago method. Simulations are then performed on an existing storm-water drainage system from NE Calgary to investigate the resiliency of the system under climate change.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning process for roadway construction involves a large amount of information on design, construction methods, quantities, unit costs, production rates, and site conditions. Therefore, it is very important to acquire, manage, and process the necessary information efficiently to produce a rigorous construction plan. The geographic information system (GIS) is a very effective tool for integrating and managing various types of information, including spatial and nonspatial data, required for roadway construction planning. This paper proposes a GIS-based system for improving roadway construction planning with its \"interactive space scheduling\" and \"operation level planning\" functions, which are supported by the integration of various data required for planning. The proposed system can assist construction planners in a unique way by integrating design and construction information and creating modularized design elements for space scheduling in real time using its interactive space scheduling function. In addition, operation level planning on earthwork can be conducted via the ability of the system to analyze haul routes in three dimensions and selecting the best equipment combination. It is expected that the proposed system could improve the efficiency of roadway construction planning.Key words: geographic information system (GIS), roadway construction planning, information integration, space scheduling. </jats:p>",

Planning and re‐planning of releases has an impact on time‐to‐market, customer satisfaction, and stability of the development process. This article presents an industrial case study of the release planning process improvement as performed at Trema Laboratories, Inc. The baseline situation is compared against the improvement gained from the introduction of a more systematic process defined by a decision support tool called ReleasePlanner, and an accompanying methodology. The new process was designed and implemented as part of a trial project performed at Trema. The article describes the main findings of this trial. The study shows that the process improvement introduced has added significant value to the overall business. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The paper argues that the 1990s was a watershed decade during which some taken‐for‐granted aspects of Australian urban character experienced significant change. It then examines the latest generation of strategic planning documents for these major metropolitan areas, all published between 2002 and 2005, and argues that there is a mismatch between the strategies’ consensus view of desirable future urban structure, based on <jats:italic>containment, consolidation and centres</jats:italic>, and the complex realities of the evolving urban structures. In particular, the current metropolitan strategies do not come to terms with the dispersed, suburbanised nature of much economic activity and employment and the environmental and social issues that flow from that, and they are unconvincing in their approaches to the emerging issues of housing affordability and new, finer‐grained patterns of suburban inequality and disadvantage. Overall, the paper contends that current metropolitan planning strategies suggest an inflexible, over‐neat vision for the future that is at odds with the picture of increasing geographical complexity that emerges from recent research on the changing internal structure of our major cities.</jats:p>",

The present study investigated how performing a task with another person affects action planning and control. Reaction times (RTs) and event-related potentials were measured while participants performed a go/no-go task alone and with another person. Three effects of acting together were observed. First, RTs were slowed when individuals had to respond to a stimulus referring to the other's action, suggesting that an action selection conflict occurred. Second, at frontal sites, a stimulus referring to the other's action elicited a similar electrophysiological response as a stimulus referring to one's own action. Finally, on no-go trials, P300 amplitude was significantly larger in a group setting, indicating that an action was suppressed. These findings provide evidence that individuals acting in a social context form shared action representations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents algorithms for automated design of multishot molds for manufacturing multimaterial or multicolor objects, and focuses on molding planning that determines a sequence of mold stages required to produce the desired object. By modeling a multimaterial object as an assembly of homogenous components, a geometric reasoning approach is proposed to generate feasible or practical mold stage sequences by combining the assembly planning approach and the two-plate mold design method. First, a graph-based assembly model, namely the attributed contact graph, is derived from the B-rep models of the constituent components of the gross object by detecting and representing all the contacts between mating components explicitly. Then, all feasible mold stage sequences, represented by an AND/OR graph, are generated by reasoning on geometric constraints due to the demoldability and connectedness requirements using an assembly-by-disassembly strategy. Depending on its demoldability, each component is to be made by one of the three basic molding strategies with varied mold stages and/or mold pieces. To narrow the choice, an optimal or practical molding plan is searched from the feasible molding plans according to some criteria such as the number of mold stages, the number of side cores, and flatness of the parting line. Finally, starting from the last mold stage, mold pieces for each mold stage of the selected molding plan are constructed recursively. The feasibility of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated through an implemented prototypical system, which has been tested successfully with various multi-material objects.</jats:p>",

In contrast to two‐arm non‐inferiority studies, these designs allow a direct proof of efficacy of a new treatment by comparison with placebo. As a further advantage, the test problem for establishing non‐inferiority can be formulated in such a way that rejection of the null hypothesis assures that a pre‐defined portion of the (unknown) effect the reference shows <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> placebo is preserved by the treatment under investigation. We present statistical methods for this study design and the situation of a binary outcome variable. Asymptotic test procedures are given and their actual type I error rates are calculated. Approximate sample size formulae are derived and their accuracy is discussed. Furthermore, the question of optimal allocation of the total sample size is considered. Power properties of the testing strategy including a pre‐test for assay sensitivity are presented. The derived methods are illustrated by application to a clinical trial in depression.

Functionally planned as a research facility for the VEB Zeiss, the central government in Berlin also intended the “tower” to symbolize architecturally the victory of socialism in Germany. Townsfolk, who identified collectively, professionally, and individually with the historic town, mobilized as best they could to save as much of their familiar inner city as possible. They could not prevent the construction of the skyscraper, but they did succeed in limiting some of the regime’s other urbanist plans. In the process, they experimented with a variety of oppositional forms that protestors later used in other cities. This article suggests that the existing urban environment symbolically presented an alternative to the socialist revolution and became a rallying point for opponents of the regime. </jats:p>",

Whereas computer-mediated communications now garner growing research attention, I have chosen to remember the influence of the older technology of broadcasting for its continued influence on myriad lives. In bringing this focus to bear on another major phenomenon, that of transnationalism, I have come to understand how religious broadcasting does not contribute in a straightforward, linear fashion to perpetuating transnational identities and communities, but is instead implicated in the assertion of the national in the face of transnational influences, while simultaneously enabling and challenging the transnational. I am aided in this understanding through an examination of religious broadcasting in multireligious, yet secular Singapore, and its impacts on a significant Muslim minority which is, nevertheless, recognised as deserving of special privileges. </jats:p>",

Within spatially diffuse communities, identities are fluid and overlapping, as are the obligations to multiple others—be that kin, ethnic group, or nation—in different localities. The author is concerned with the institutions through which these identities are formed and obligations are fulfilled. These include families, clans, hometown associations, and religious organisations, which link people ‘abroad’ to people ‘at home’. The author understands these spaces as a form of public sphere involving a ‘deterritorialised’ citizenship, which has been termed ‘embedded cosmopolitanism’. In this way, obligations are not legally defined but operate as part of the moral universe of those concerned. The case study is based upon recent fieldwork on Ghanaians in the United Kingdom and their connections to other Ghanaians outside Ghana and to those at home. The ways in which these complex networks of affiliation operate, as well as the ways in which the state seeks to ‘capture’ support from them, and how migrants selectively redefine both ethnic identities and family boundaries, are described. </jats:p>",

In particular, the transnational linkages maintained by migrants transcend the social scales at which they are often assumed to live, and the spaces in which their integration or assimilation is usually studied—the neighbourhood, the urban labour market, the national society. Studies of transnationalism have shown that immigrants maintain multistranded connections to their places of origin and that these continue to influence the lifeworlds both of migrants and of those they leave behind significantly. In this paper we suggest that these multistranded connections—incorporating social, cultural, and economic ties—can be usefully considered using Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the habitus as a heuristic framework for integrating the various dimensions of transmigrants' lives. Drawing on interviews in Canada and the Philippines, we demonstrate the ways in which economic, social, and cultural capital are accumulated, exchanged, converted, valued, and devalued in a transnational habitus. </jats:p>",

We tested an automated conservation science-based methodology and systematic approach to delineate conservation and restoration priority areas on the Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM). The methodology comprised: a) preparing and assembling existing spatial (GIS) information and tessellating the study area to 5-ha hexagon planning units; b) conducting a gap analysis to provide a basis for setting conservation targets that protect, or that through future restoration activities might enhance, under-represented biodiversity elements; and c) applying a simulated annealing procedure (i.e., mathematical algorithm) to find solutions that optimize the set biodiversity targets. The final output of our work is a map of conservation priority area that enables the more than 50 conservation partners in this landscape to coordinate various conservation, stewardship and restoration activities by focusing on those areas that have the highest conservation value.

Through an empirical evaluation of over 200 U.S. manufacturers, we document the existence of four strategic manufacturing planning groups. These groups vary with respect to the degrees of “rationality” and “adaptability” of planning. In addition, the strategic manufacturing planning history and level of planning maturity differs between these groups, providing evidence that the planning process changes and evolves over time from “non‐rational adaptive” mode towards a more “rational adaptive” approach. Firms between these polar extremes appear to take different paths in their movement toward a “rational adaptive” mode, with some “focusing on rationality” first and others “focusing on adaptability” first. We also show that irrespective of the firm's environment, a greater degree of “rational adaptivity” is correlated with better planning outcomes and business performance. As such, it represents a “best practice” approach to strategic manufacturing planning. Insights created by this work not only make an important contribution to the manufacturing strategy literature, but can also be used by senior manufacturing managers to facilitate their progress towards more effective planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

We achieve this through estimation of the numbers of migration transitions (Australia) or migration events (Britain) for common age–period–cohort (APC) spaces. We derive appropriate population stocks for computation of transition probabilities or occurrence-exposure rates. In the final section of the paper we present a series of migration-intensity calculations based on varying combinations of period–cohort, period–age, and age–period–cohort perspectives, to demonstrate the significance of the variations, and the errors that can arise without harmonisation. </jats:p>",

An analysis is made on effects of transactions on Generation Expansion Planning (GEP). Some of the metaheuristic techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), Evolutionary Strategy (ES), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Tabu Search (TS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and Hybrid Approach (HA) are applied to solve the Transactions-GEP problem with the support of AC-Optimal Power Flow (OPF) for the modified IEEE-30 bus test system with 6-years planning horizon. The original GEP problem is modified using the proposed methods  i) Virtual Mapping Procedure (VMP), and ii) Penalty Factor Approach (PFA), to improve the effectiveness of the Metaheuristic techniques. Further, Intelligent Initial Population Generation (IIPG) and 'Store and Retrieve approach' are introduced in the solution techniques to reduce the computational time. PFA is used to convert the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. The results of the metaheuristic techniques are compared and validated with that of Dynamic Programming (DP). The performances of each metaheuristic technique were compared in terms of their Success Rate (SR), Average Number of Generations (ANG), the error percentage and the mean execution time. The effects of various transactions on GEP are also analyzed.</jats:p>",

Peru has been undergoing a religious transformation similar to the rest of Latin America, with Evangelical and other non-Catholic faiths now well established in the rural highlands. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in the Provincias Altas of Cusco, Peru, I examine the histories and organizational expressions of development truths promoted by the Iglesia Surandina (the Catholic Church of the Southern Andes), and the Iglesia Evangélica Peruana (the Peruvian Evangelical Church). The ways that these epistemologies become negotiated and translated in two rural districts reinforces the importance of historical context in the formation of development epistemologies, but it also suggests that organizational structures and differences in transnational processes contribute to the acceptance of or challenge to different sets of knowledge regarding development. </jats:p>",

The median overlap of the contoured rectum with the PTV was 15 (1–56) %, and 11 (4–35) % for the bladder. Two of the 12 patients, both with large PTVs and large overlap of the contoured rectum and PTV, developed grade 3 rectal bleeding. The dose conformity was significantly improved with IMRT over CRT and 4FB (p ≤ 0.001 for both). IMRT also yielded an overall improvement in the rectal and bladder dose-volume distributions relative to CRT and 4FB. The volume of rectum that received the highest doses (&gt;66% of the prescription) was reduced by 22% (p &lt; 0.001) with IMRT relative to 4FB, and the bladder volume was reduced by 19% (p &lt; 0.001). This was at the expense of an increase in the volume of these organs receiving doses in the lowest range (&lt;33%).</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>These results indicate that IMRT can improve target coverage and reduce dose to critical structures in gynecologic patients receiving an external beam radiotherapy boost.

We argue that the traditional success–failure dichotomy approach used for analyzing return migration is inadequate and that it must be expanded to address better the institutional context of the transitional economy. Using an empirical study of Sichuan and Anhui provinces, we analyze the selectivity of return migrants and their reasons for return, focusing not only on how returnees compare with continuing migrants, but also on their decisionmaking. The analysis indicates that returnees are negatively selected among migrants and suggests that failure migrants are more prevalent than are typically portrayed in the literature. The results also highlight family demand as an important reason for return. These findings suggest that migrants' institutional and social inferiority in the city undermines their likelihood to succeed in the destination and reinforces their desire to return when family needs arise. Our analysis raises questions about the optimism of existing studies about the contribution of return migrants in China's countryside. </jats:p>",

The models provide a framework for evaluating climate-related variations and long-range predictability of regional electric power demand, hydropower production, and the benefits of potential electric power transfers between the PNW and CA. The period of analysis is 1917–2002. The study results show that hydropower production and regional electric power demands in the PNW and CA are out of phase seasonally but that hydropower productions in the PNW and CA have strongly covaried on an annual basis in recent decades. Winter electric power demand and spring and annual hydropower production in the PNW are related to both El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) through variations in winter climate. Summer power demand in CA is related primarily to variations in the PDO in spring. Hydropower production in CA, despite recent covariation with the PNW, is not strongly related to ENSO variability overall. Primarily because of strong variations in supply in the PNW, potential hydropower transfers between the PNW and CA in spring and summer are shown to be correlated to ENSO and PDO, and the conditional probability distributions of these transfers are therefore predictable with long lead times. Such electric power transfers are estimated to have potential average annual benefits of $136 and $79 million for CA and the PNW, respectively, at the year-2000 regional demand level. These benefits are on average 11%–27% larger during cold ENSO/PDO events and are 16%–30% lower during warm ENSO/PDO events. Power transfers from the PNW to CA and hydropower production in CA are comparable in magnitude, on average.</jats:p>",

This inequality in exposure is one possible explanation for the variations in pollution-related health outcomes such as lung cancer and other respiratory diseases. Previous environmental-justice studies that have focused upon air pollution have tended to be concerned with exposure to industrial and vehicle pollution and rely upon simple estimates of exposure, ignoring the complex interaction of emissions, topography, and meteorology that determine pollution levels in many urban areas. In this paper we use accurate and geographically detailed estimates of pollution calculated from an atmospheric dispersion model to examine issues of environmental justice related to air pollution sourced from domestic heating in Christchurch, New Zealand, a city with particularly high levels of particulate pollution during winter months. We consider whether there is a social gradient in exposure to air pollution in Christchurch by comparing estimates of particulate pollution for small areas across the city to a range of demographic and socioeconomic indicators including age, ethnicity, income, and deprivation. Furthermore, we examine whether there is a social gradient in exposure to extreme pollution episodes. We demonstrate that different social groups in the Christchurch population are exposed to different levels of both ambient air pollution and extreme air-pollution episodes. In particular, pollution is significantly higher among more disadvantaged communities. We also find evidence which suggests that the groups responsible for producing a large proportion of the pollution in Christchurch are not the same groups exposed to high levels of particulate air pollution. </jats:p>",

Given a set of flights that must be scheduled during some planning horizon, along with alternative surrogate trajectories for each flight, we developed a mixed-integer programming model to select a set of flight plans from among these alternatives, subject to flight safety, air-traffic control workload, and airline equity considerations. The present paper offers insights related to, and a detailed description of, implementing this APCDM model, including the development of a comprehensive cost model, a study for prescribing a set of appropriate parameter values for the overall model, and an investigation on incorporating a suitable set of valid inequalities in the model formulation. Computational results are presented based on several test cases derived from the Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS) data provided by the FAA. The results indicate that under plausible probabilistic trajectory error assumptions and with the incorporation of star subgraph convex hull-based valid inequalities, the model offers a viable tool that can be used by the FAA for both tactical and strategic applications. </jats:p>",

The project took place in Sheffield. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: The education discussions and the related booklet were perceived as acceptable in providing information about a sensitive issue. Peer educators felt that the training course prepared them well. Community advisors felt that they were treated as equal members of the research team. This project has served as a useful pilot study of the education programme that has now been extended to other areas of the UK. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Due to its inherent advantages such as reasoning in the format of heuristic rules based on human experience and less stringent requirement on environmental description, fuzzy logic is a promising tool for the robot motion planning in 3-dimensional dynamic environment. In general, in the Cartesian space, the variables used in characterizing the motion of a mobile robot, such as position, velocity, and force relative to other objects or coordinate frames, contain both the magnitude and the pointing information. In previous studies, the fuzzy reasoning on the pointing information was often developed based on the decomposition of the pointing vector followed by conventional fuzzy logic technique on individual vector components. Consequently, when multiple pointing variables are involved, the number of fuzzy variables that need to be considered simultaneously becomes large and the rule base may become very complex, which diminishes the advantages of the fuzzy reasoning approach. In this research, we tackle this issue by implementing a new fuzzy reasoning approach based on <jats:italic>vector-format fuzzy variables</jats:italic>. To achieve this, a set of new membership functions is defined for the vector-format fuzzy variables, followed by the establishment of a series of new vector-based fuzzification, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification procedures. By treating the multidimensional variables as unitary linguistic variables, the number of fuzzy variables in the fuzzy propositions and therefore the scale of the rule base can be reduced considerably. As an application example, the proposed new fuzzy reasoning approach for motion planning is applied to an Underwater Robotics Vehicle (URV) operating in an oceanic environment, where the pointing of the goal and the pointing vectors of the obstacles are treated as vector-type fuzzy variables, which leads to a compact and significantly simplified rule base. The motion planner can successfully guide the URV to move in the complicated dynamic environ-ment in a real-time fashion, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the new fuzzy logic approach.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>No reliable method of imaging prostate cancer currently exists. These prostate tissue-typing studies aim to improve the effectiveness of biopsy guidance and treatment monitoring by developing better imaging methods for identifying cancerous prostate tissue. Success will reduce the false-negative rate of biopsies and treatment side-effects. Ultrasonic (US) radio-frequency (rf) echo-signal data acquired during biopsy examinations were used to compute spectral parameters. These spectral parameters along with clinical parameters, e.g., PSA, were used to train a neural network classifier using biopsy results as the gold standard. Cancer-likelihood scores from a look-up table were used to generate tissue-type images (TTIs). The ROC-curve area for US neural-network-based classification was 0.844±0.018 vs 0.638±0.031 for B-mode-based classification, and the sensitivity of neural-network based classification was superior to that of B-mode-guided biopsies. These classification methods are being extended to include magnetic-resonance spectral (MRS) techniques that use the choline to citrate ratio-to-distinguish cancerous from noncancerous prostate tissue. 3D renderings of prostatectomy histology, US, and MR images show encouraging correlations, and combining MRS parameters with US spectral parameters appears to have potential to further improve prostate-cancer imaging.

After providing an overview of Tibetan migration to the USA, we discuss migrants' contradictory insertion into American racial bipolarism. On the one hand, Tibetans' racialized class positions place them at the lower end of a spectrum of moral deserving and worth. On the other hand, the discursive practices of the transnational Tibet Movement and the traveling of Tibetan Buddhist institutions to the USA ‘whitens’ Tibetans by making them seem particularly worthy and deserving of sponsorship. After exploring the production of Tibetan migrant subjectivities through white sponsorship, we examine how the successful articulation of Tibetan identities for a transnational political struggle is a double-edged sword which has unintended, and sometimes violent consequences. These play out in various ways, including intergenerational struggles over hip-hop and internalized racism. </jats:p>",

A crisis can be defined as a period of uncertainty where decisions must be made to prevent total breakdown. An alternate definition highlights the opportunity for change. From a corporate perspective, it is the response to crisis which heralds the future success or failure of the company involved. Successful companies rapidly admit responsibility, apologize to those harmed by the crisis and take bold steps to limit and repair damage. Companies that deny responsibility, allow damage to increase while they adopt evasive tactics, or who do not appear to care about the havoc caused, see both their popularity and their share prices plummet.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>Provides strategic insights and practical thinking that have influenced some of the world's leading organizations.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p><jats:italic>The briefing saves busy executives and researchers hours of reading time by selecting only the very best, most pertinent information and presenting it in a condensed and easy‐to‐digest format.</jats:italic></jats:p></jats:sec>",
