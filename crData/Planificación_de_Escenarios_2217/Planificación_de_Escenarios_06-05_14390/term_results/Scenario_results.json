      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary </jats:bold> Landscape scenario modelling is a useful aid to planning for biodiversity conservation. Vegetation condition modelling is increasingly being integrated into such analysis. Model complexity and model uncertainty are critical factors that must be addressed when tailoring vegetation condition modelling to individual applications. We describe three approaches that we have used to compare the effects of different landscape scenarios on vegetation condition. The first is a simple land‐use–condition approach where vegetation condition is determined solely by land use. The second is a land‐use–regeneration approach that introduces transition functions to model vegetation condition dynamics associated with land use change. The third is a threat–regeneration approach, which models vegetation condition dynamics based on the interaction between regeneration and a range of mapped threats. The three approaches represent a progression towards increased refinement and realism, but also increased complexity and data requirements. We examine the relative usefulness of the three approaches and conclude that there is no single ‘silver bullet’ solution but recommend judicious matching of approaches to applications within a collaborative and adaptive setting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The National Spherical Torus Experiment [Ono et al., Nucl. Fusion, 44, 452 (2004)] is targeting long pulse high performance, noninductive sustained operations at low aspect ratio, and the demonstration of nonsolenoidal startup and current rampup. The modeling of these plasmas provides a framework for experimental planning and identifies the tools to access these regimes. Simulations based on neutral beam injection (NBI)-heated plasmas are made to understand the impact of various modifications and identify the requirements for (1) high elongation and triangularity, (2) density control to optimize the current drive, (3) plasma rotation and/or feedback stabilization to operate above the no-wall β limit, and (4) electron Bernstein waves (EBW) for off-axis heating/current drive (H/CD). Integrated scenarios are constructed to provide the transport evolution and H/CD source modeling, supported by rf and stability analyses. Important factors include the energy confinement, Zeff, early heating/H mode, broadening of the NBI-driven current profile, and maintaining q(0) and qmin&amp;gt;1.0. Simulations show that noninductive sustained plasmas can be reached at IP=800 kA, BT=0.5 T, κ≈2.5, βN⩽5, β⩽15%, fNI=92%, and q(0)&amp;gt;1.0 with NBI H/CD, density control, and similar global energy confinement to experiments. The noninductive sustained high β plasmas can be reached at IP=1.0 MA, BT=0.35 T, κ≈2.5, βN⩽9, β⩽43%, fNI=100%, and q(0)&amp;gt;1.5 with NBI H/CD and 3.0 MW of EBW H/CD, density control, and 25% higher global energy confinement than experiments. A scenario for nonsolenoidal plasma current rampup is developed using high harmonic fast wave H/CD in the early low IP and low Te phase, followed by NBI H/CD to continue the current ramp, reaching a maximum of 480 kA after 3.4 s.</jats:p>",
