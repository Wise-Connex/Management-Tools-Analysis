To provide some planning information and to determine the educational opportunities preferred, a questionnaire survey was carried out with 75 retired persons. They were asked to select those adult education courses in which they would like to participate. The courses were either instrumental (basic or skill mastery) or expressive (enjoyment or new experiences) in nature. It was found that a greater interest than could be expected by chance was reported toward instrumental courses. </jats:p>",
