Moreover, in the urban context, there is only a short history of work on which to draw. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper describes current research which is seeking to develop a policy classification framework for strategic land-use policies. Some potential criteria for classification are identified and methodology for developing a typology from documentary evidence is explained. In addition, the work involves a notation for policy classification, by means of which comparative urban policy study can be carried out. The paper concludes with a brief examination of findings which have emerged following the application of the approach to six British Structure Plans, together with a discussion of the potential of the classification concept. </jats:p>",

There will always be situations where other local priorities must take precedence, particularly in urban areas. Noise attenuation measures will continue to be important and a crucial part of the HUD noise policy. Lacking any specific legislative authority on general land use issues, the Federal role can only be to encourage local governments to consider noise in their land use planning process and to provide information.</jats:p>",

The paper then discusses the nature of loan capital in house property and the characteristics of housing to let as an investment. Particular emphasis is placed upon the way in which the form taken by the late nineteenth-century housing market was itself structured by the nature of the wider economy, of which it formed a part. </jats:p>",

Although based on the techniques of mathematical programming, the model does not purport to indicate a single optimum allocation of health and social services resources, but rather to calculate the resource consequences of possible alternative courses of action.

The criteria are linked by a common spatial-interaction model. This model is based on the hypothesis that the number of hospital patients generated in a residential zone i is proportional to the relative morbidity of i, and to the availability of resources in treatment zone j, but is in inverse proportion to the accessibility costs of getting from i to j. The resource-allocation criteria are based on objectives on which there is broad agreement among planners and other actors in a health-care system. These objectives are concerned with allocations that conform to notions of equity, efficiency, and two definitions of accessibility. The allocation criteria give mainly aggregate-level information, and are designed with the long-term regional planning of health-care services in mind. The paper starts by defining the criteria, and describes how they are intended to be employed in a planning context. The allocation rules are then formally derived and linked together mathematically. They are then applied to a region, London, England, which is known to have very complex health-care planning problems. As a result of this application, two of the criteria—equity and efficiency—are selected for further analysis. A new model is built and applied that specifically enables the user to trade off one of these criteria against the other. </jats:p>",

First the theory is briefly reviewed and then two case studies are presented. It is argued that it is not sufficient to have a good decision model at every level of the decision hierarchy. The different models should be carefully integrated. The potential problems resulting from a lack of integration are discussed. These problems are then illustrated in two case studies in order to be able to focus on actual managerial issues. It is shown how different decision levels supported by decision models were integrated in these two applications. Two important features are the crucial role of crossfunctional managerial committees in the integration process and the introduction of slack to avoid disaggregation problems.</jats:p><jats:p>We do not claim to be exhaustive in presenting the problems related to integration nor do we claim that the solutions to the cases are the best possible ones.

A number of hypotheses including measures of store size, proximity of competition, and the type of residential area in which the shop is located are examined by means of bivariate and multiple correlation in relation to price variations, and in general the results are consistent for different baskets at a single time period: shops which are expensive for one combination of products tend to be expensive for most product combinations. However, there is little consistency of results between the two time periods, and this must create problems for price-motivated consumers: an inexpensive shop at one time period may not necessarily be inexpensive at a subsequent time period even for the same products. Even so, there is some temporal consistency in that the size of shop generally has a direct relationship with variations in prices, smaller shops being the more expensive. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Substantial interest has been focused on techniques that determine the amount and timing of work center capacity to satisfy the master production schedule. Although several techniques have been developed for preparing work center capacity plans, very little analysis of the operational features and the application of these techniques has been reported. Four techniques, capacity planning using overall factors (CPOF), capacity bills, resource profiles, and capacity requirements planning (CRP), vary substantially in their complexity and the level of detail required to plan work center capacities. All four procedures require the use of the master production schedule to develop a capacity plan, but some have much more demanding data requirements. Important differences are the means by which capacity requirements are estimated by the techniques and the manner in which the bill of material, manufacturing lead time and inventory status information are incorporated into the capacity plan. The purpose of this paper is to describe the operational features of the four capacity planning techniques, the underlying data base requirements, and some key managerial issues in choosing among these techniques.</jats:p>",
