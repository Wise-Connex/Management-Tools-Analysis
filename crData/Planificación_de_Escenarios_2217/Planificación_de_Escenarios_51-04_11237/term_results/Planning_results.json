It includes a general formula that covers all types of tagging plan from which are derived the formulae for the Peterson and Schnabel types. Methods of estimating precision are summarized and some simple approximate formulae are presented which should be useful in the planning of tagging experiments.Part II is concerned with population estimates based on catch-effort data. Earlier results are summarized with some simplification of the derivations and some slight extensions.Part III discusses briefly some possibilities when both tagging data and catch-effort records are available.Part IV presents the results of some experimental sampling, using beads of different colours to represent tagged and untagged fish. </jats:p>",
