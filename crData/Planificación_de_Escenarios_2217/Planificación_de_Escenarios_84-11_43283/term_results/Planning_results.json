A comparison of U.S. and Japanese earthquake disaster planning processes shows a major contrast in approach. The U.S. approach is based on legislation that loosely defines issues, but has no clear management structure. Japanese planning established a clear relationship between research, planning, and operations, and is strongly administered by central government which provides methodologies and assistance to lower governmental levels. However, neither the U.S. nor Japan procedures have yet been tested by a major event. The U.S. approach relies extensively on improvisation, and limited experience shows that this may be relatively effective: Japanese planning may be too fragile in relying too much on centralized management and communications. </jats:p>",

Trade-offs between outputs can be computed with the same linear programming model of the forest used to prepare land-management alternatives. By systematically varying the objective for one of the outputs of an alternative, the resulting trade-off with the output measured by the objective function of the linear program is determined. Trade-offs cannot be reliably computed from the differences between land-management alternatives. Trade-offs may be overstated when inputs such as land are manipulated instead of outputs. A similar overstatement of trade-offs may occur when a sufficiently wide range of management regimes is not provided to the model. Since a trade-off analysis is only as good as the fundamental production relationships on which it is based, misleading trade-offs can result for alternatives producing a mix of outputs outside the range of historical experience and supporting data.</jats:p>",

They indicate the extent to which current county planning practice is directed towards economic regeneration and the degree to which monitoring activities are still regarded as evolving despite the long time interval that has elapsed in many cases since the initial submission of the County structure plans. They show that there is a strong relationship between attitudes towards data collection, information handling and data dissemination. Authorities that favour 'hard' information handling strategies tend also to adopt a restricted approach to data collection, employing regular reporting procedures, and regard lack of relevant information as the most serious operational problem, whereas authorities that favour 'soft' documentary information handling strategies tend to favour comprehensive information gathering strategies, use ad hoc reporting procedures and regard information retrieval and lack of communication channels as the most serious operational problem. </jats:p>",

It has been observed that severe traffic conditions can exist on one freeway, while traffic on a parallel freeway may be moving almost at the speed limit. It is important to examine the possible causes of this phenomenon to avoid wasteful investments. The major objectives of this paper are, first, to examine the theoretical conditions under which the phenomenon can occur; second, to verify those conditions empirically; and, third, to suggest policies that will reduce the volume of traffic on the congested freeway by increasing the utilization of the other freeway. It is concluded that access and egress costs arising from travel on roads connecting the two main freeways have an important effect on the utilization of the freeways. </jats:p>",

It focuses on a village-level measure of actual availability of sources rather than respondent perceptions of availability. Individuallevel and village-level data collected as part of the second Thailand Contraceptive Prevalence Survey are used to test three hypotheses about the effects of actual availability: that (a) availability of family planning outlets increases the likelihood of contraceptive use; (b) it enhances the effect of a desire for no more children on the likelihood of use; and (c) it weakens the positive relationship between education and the likelihood of use.</jats:p>",

Revisits tended to occur in three-month intervals. In the first six months, the probability of making the first revisit was .70; the probability of a second revisit was .45. Adolescents whose visit patterns deviated from the routine clinic protocols were more likely to be inconsistent contraceptive users.

The goals were to raise the age at marriage, lengthen the birth interval, and limit the number of births per family to two in the cities and three in the countryside. A birth-quota and pregnancy-authorization system was instituted. The campaign was greatly facilitated by the nationwide network of free community-based contraceptive and abortion services and generous incentives. By the early 1980s the contraceptive prevalence rate rose to 70 percent, and the total fertility rate fell to about 2.5 children per woman of reproductive age. The year 1979 saw the introduction of the one-child campaign. By 1982 first births accounted for 47 percent of total births, and 42 percent of the one-child families had pledged to have no more children. The successful implementation of the one-child campaign will, however, lead to a rapid aging of the population. The percentage of the population older than 64 years of age will increase rapidly, from 5 percent in 1982 to 7.3-7.7 percent in 2000 and to 23-27 percent in 2050. With such a high aged-dependency ratio, caring for the aged will entail heavy fiscal outlay in the twenty-first century.</jats:p>",

Some of the difficult‐and potentially costly‐management decisions involve establishing staffing levels and food production rates to meet this changing demand.</jats:p><jats:p>The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate two heuristic aggregate planning models in three types of health care food production systems to determine if the models were more effective in cost reduction than the management decisions which were made. The Search Decision Rule (SDR) and Management Coefficients Model (MCM) were selected based upon previous testing in industrial applications. In each of three different hospital food systems‐conventional, cook‐chill, and minimal cooking‐the aggregate plan decision rules (from the models) were compared with the hospital's master labor schedule over a one year test period. Cost of implementing the decision rules and the existing master labor schedule was determined using an objective cost function derived from cost records in each foodservice system.</jats:p><jats:p>The SDR model performed statistically better than the MCM and the existing master labor schedule provided by management. SDR model performance depended upon the technology in which it was applied, providing the greatest savings in the conventional foodservice technology. Potential annual dollar savings between the hospital's existing master labor schedule and the SDR for each foodservice system varied from $74,329 to $182,487.</jats:p><jats:p>Implementation of the SDR model could help the foodservice administrator be more effective in scheduling expensive labor resources by determining in advance decision rules that will simultaneously meet production demand and significantly reduce cost. The major resistances to implementation are expected to be lack of model understanding and the resistance to trusting a computerized model where the potential for some food shortage will still exist, even though it exists now with manual scheduling systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Five influential paradigms established by Beckmann, Lowry, Wilson, Mills, and McFadden are unified by developing a long-run economic general equilibrium model of urban land-use based on probabilistic discrete choice theory. The model takes into account the interdependence of export-oriented and service employment with population. Households' choices of employment type, employment location, type and location of housing, shopping destination, and choice of travel routes in the journey to work and journey to shop are determined simultaneously by means of stochastic utility maximization. Firms' choices of building type and location and landowners' choices of land-use type and density are determined by means of stochastic profit maximization. Travel occurs on a congestible link—node network. The model determines the wage rate for each employment type in each zone, the price of floor space for each building type in each zone, the price of land in each zone, the price of the locally traded composite commodity in each zone, and the peak and off-peak congested travel-cost and travel-time for each link of the network. The quantity of land which remains undeveloped is also determined. I formulate a nonlinear mathematical programming problem which is equivalent to the general equilibrium problem. Using this formulation, I prove the existence and uniqueness of the general equilibrium in all the prices and physical allocations. </jats:p>",
