      "abstract": "<jats:p> For thirty years planners and critics of planning alike have confronted inadequacies in the traditional model of comprehensive rational planning. Despite this intellectual acknowledgement of the need for a different paradigm, the underlying characteristics of rationality still pervade planning education and practice. This paper argues that the more insidious features derive from the broader institutional context and deeper historical roots of the field. Consequently, practitioners cannot incorporate alternative forms of knowledge in planning unless they both become conscious of how they have accepted classic rational assumptions and are willing to adopt a new concept of planning. The essay briefly reviews several promising approaches to planning that cope with the implications of the rational paradigm and/or substitute other models. However, academics cannot expect practicing planners to adopt alternative approaches unless they demonstrate them effectively. To do so, they need to develop new teaching approaches in planning schools and to alter their own behavior so as to encourage new roles rather than simply reinforcing existing ones. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The mid‐1970s marked the end of the longest period of uninterrupted economic growth in history, and initiated in Europe — and other parts of the world — a period of economic stagnation and instability. Along with the prosperity explosion of the past, the pattern of health problems has changed and is still changing. Moreover, the demand for health care has kept on rising, without much improvement of health status in general. Thus, there is a critical need to rethink policies, and to ensure that future changes occur within the limits of shrinking resources and the allotted time‐span. In particular, the change in priorities envisaged by the Health for All 2000 (HFA 2000) strategies will need to take place against the background of an ageing population, social instability, and continuing development of new lifestyles and persistent economic scarcity. It is by analysing that background, that this article seeks to make recommendations as to how health planning and management might successfully cope with the policy reorientation of the HFA 2000 strategy.</jats:p><jats:p>The structure of this article is as follows. Firstly, the changes taking place in planning conditions will be reviewed, and form the basis of a framework for subsequent analysis of the ‘planning environment’. Following this framework, some of the conflicts likely to be faced in planning and management will be discussed, many of which are the consequence of economic stringency and instability. Also the requirements for an improvement of the effectiveness and efficiency of planning will be identified. Finally, a limited number of approaches to planning will be considered, for their appropriateness to the present‐day economic circumstances.</jats:p><jats:p>The point of view elucidated throughout is that there is no single solution which is ‘best’ under all circumstances. The conclusion, rather, is that the selection of a particular theory or method of planning and management should depend both on the objectives of the decision maker and on the determinants of the planning environment. General prescriptions should not be made. At the same time, some elements have to be stressed in all types of planning, namely: the orientation towards outcomes or outputs or problems; the attention to long‐term strategic thinking; and, the application of more efficient, flexible and less bureaucratic approaches.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the widespread use of one-way streets as a traffic engineering response to urban traffic congestion, very little is known about the impacts such streets have on residential neighborhoods. The social costs of automotive hegemony have generally been ignored in the face of the easily demonstrable traffic movement advantages of one-ways. As part of the Denver Planning Office's study of how to mitigate negative impacts of one-ways in neighborhoods, a survey of residents on one-way arterials and adjacent two-way locals was conducted. Face-to-face interviews were conducted with 232 residents. Residents on one-ways were found to be older and less family-oriented than their two-way street neighbors. One-way street residents were significantly more bothered by traffic (noise, volume, danger), less satisfied with their block (cleanliness, peacefulness, air quality), and therefore made more life-style adjustments (less use of front of house, rearranging use of rooms, installing buffers). Consequently, more one-way street residents wanted a traffic change on their block. On a number of measures (e.g., economic conditions, neighboring, stability) no differences were found. These mixed results are read as confirmation that one-way arterials do have some of the suspected negative impacts but also that many people accommodate and resign themselves to the situation. </jats:p>",

This article discusses three aspects of same‐day surgery programs: key management issues; analysis of competitiveness; and, the growth potential of same‐day surgery.</jats:p><jats:p>Today's managers of same‐day surgery programs are most concerned with issues related to their customers, be they physicians, insurers, or patients. Indeed, program managers identify market research, program development, and patient, physician, and facility management as areas critical to success.</jats:p><jats:p>An exploratory survey carried out of ten same‐day centers indicates that programs must excel in two areas to succeed. First, they must develop efficient and appropriate operations. Second, they must communicate aspects of these operations to different customers, realizing that each customer type is interested in different aspects of the program. This article provides a framework for the analysis of customer interests. It also suggests that surgery centers satisfy customer preferences rather better than do hospital outpatient programs.</jats:p><jats:p>Same‐day surgery will increase. Uncertainty lies in how quickly and in what form such activities in hospitals and centers will develop. Countries will likely experience different growth patterns, according to the relative power of factors affecting both the supply and demand of same‐day surgery.</jats:p>",

A classification system to assist the process of understanding the nature of objectives is put foward, and a theory of objective sets to assist the development of rational planning and review procedures is developed. The classification system and the theory have general applicability as well as specific value in facilitating and integrating marketing planning at strategic, tactical and operational levels.</jats:p>",

In this paper, the dynamics of multiregional populations are analyzed when occasional perturbations resulting from changes in social and economic conditions exist. A perturbation theory for population models is introduced and the increasing effect of changes in demographic rates in determining the spatial component of the multiregional population growth is shown. Critical situations in which perturbations produce drastic changes are outlined. A numerical experiment is discussed: an oversimplified model of the Italian population is given and it is shown how the theory can be applied to focus the short-run and the long-run effects of changes in demographic rates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> If investment activities are restricted by binding budget constraints, it may be even more important to find a good time schedule for investments rather than to determine the optimal investment program for a future time period. The problem of scheduling investments for interstate road and railway investments can be formulated as a mixed-integer programming model. But this model is so large, that it is hopeless to try to solve problems of practical relevance. For this reason two ways of simplifying the problem are discussed. The first method focuses on modelling of budget feasibilities over time, and the second method stresses the interdependencies of network improvements. As these interdependencies are predominantly affected by the interrelationships between network structure and travel flow pattern, it is important to model travel demand for competing transportation modes in a sufficiently precise way. An algorithm for combined two-mode modal choice and travel assignment is presented which generates the changes in travel demand affected by a change in the network structure in an efficient way. A test network is used to illustrate the computations and the efficiency of the methods presented. </jats:p>",

Yet these investments at best have had only marginal impacts on the activities of the production and service sectors even though there are many priority development activities which could benefit from inputs from Nigerian researchers. At the national level efforts to direct or even co‐ordinate the planning and budgeting of research have been seriously hampered by frequent changes in organizational responsibilities and by repeated budget cuts. Historically, the activities of the federal research institutes have been poorly tuned to the interests and capabilities of the potential users of their research products. Neither these institutes nor the universities with research activities are in a position to develop products or processes which can compete with imported technologies that are saturating the economy. However, the research institutes, and to a lesser extent the universities, should make greater contributions in applying science to improved use of the nation's natural resource endowments, although significant changes in research management at the project level are needed if this objective is to be realized. The Government should provide incentives to the multinational companies operating in Nigeria to develop joint programmes with the research institutes and universities as one mechanism for diffusing the administrative and technical capabilities of the companies. Meanwhile, selected public sector enterprises should be encouraged to expand technological innovation efforts which could be directly applied to their production activities.</jats:p>",

Demand for items is stochastic and occurs in the last season of the planning horizon. Demand estimates are revised in each period. We exploit the problem's two-level hierarchical structure, which is characterized by families and items. Production changeover costs from one family to another are high, compared to other costs. However, changeover costs between items in the same family are negligible. We first formulate this problem as a difficult-to-solve stochastic mixed integer programming problem. Then, exploiting the problem's hierarchical structure, we formulate a deterministic, mixed integer programming problem and solve it by means of an algorithm that provides an approximate solution. A lower bound is obtained by applying generalized linear programming to the approximate problem. We illustrate the procedure using the disguised data of a consumer electronics company. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a practical setting. </jats:p>",

A common denominator of many of these changes lies in relative shifts towards grade 3A service centres in the production of services.

Following the lead of the United States, Europe, and Japan, Korea's energy policy in the mid-1970s was based on reducing oil imports by substituting other fuels, installing more efficient oil conversion processes, or doing without. Due in part to the urgency of the situation and in part to a lack of accumulated analytical capability, it was difficult to analyze in depth which alternatives were best, how much they would cost, or to what extent it was in Korea's best interests to bear large economic costs to reduce oil imports. Rather, Korean policymakers implemented a broad-based oil consumption reduction program to mitigate their immediate oil import problem. </jats:p>",

The Chairman is Mr J H Voorburg of the Netherlands and other experts in odours include Dr M Hangartner (QD, Dr J Hartung (D), Dr A Eikun (No) and Mr V C Nielsen (UK). Mr H M Scheltinga (NL) and A M Bruce (UK) are also members of the group. The sub-group is hoping to complete its tasks quickly, the main ones being (a) To develop proposals for a harmonised and standardised odour measurement technique (b) To exchange information about research on odour measurement and control. On (a) good progress has been made in collecting information on the existing guidelines in different countries for sampling and transportation of samples for odour measurement, for dilution techniques and for panel selection etc. The question of acceptable levels of odour intensity is net being considered. All these matters will be discussed at this joint Workshop and it is hoped that clear recommendations will emerge from the experts so that a formal report can be presented for discussion at the COST 681 4th Symposium to be held in Rome in October 1985. In regard to objective (b), one of the major tasks of the sub-group has been to compile an inventory of organisations and scientists in Europe who are actively involved in research on the measurement and/or"
