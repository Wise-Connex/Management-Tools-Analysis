      "abstract": "<jats:p> Collaborative planning is often mentioned as one of the most appropriate planning theories in relation to the network society owing to its focus on creating fair and inclusive institutional settings for deliberations among public and private stakeholders. Even though this theoretical framework discusses potential outcomes, the actual democratic effects of collaborative planning processes are notably overlooked in the literature. The central question raised in this article is: how can we assess the democratic effects of collaborative planning processes? The article presents a tentative evaluative framework for assessing the different stages ( input, process and outcome) of collaborative planning processes deriving criteria from democratic theory, as well as from theories on collaborative planning, which can be deployed for empirical studies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two perceptions of `risk' tend to dominate leading conceptualizations of this term. The first perspective is largely held by government and the scientific community. Risk, in this view, is something that can be measured, observed, mapped and generally controlled. Under this perspective, planning is often perceived as playing a central scientific role in the achievement of this `management' task. The second perspective is a poststructuralist one where risk is a constructed concept. This article explores this perspective from the position that risk is a fear of the repressed, undecidable and unknown that haunts social reality, for it may spring up at any time to create adversity and misfortune. In this view, risk is inherently an ideological spectre responding to a lack of knowledge, uncertainty and/or inherent unknowability, which in turn induces society to crave and then seek to generate further constructs of certainty, even if these are mere fantasies and illusions that purport to control and overcome the unknown. In contrast to the scientific realist perspective of `manageable' risk, this article argues that planning often produces just such an ideological response. Further, it argues that a desire for certainty to offset the haunting of this risky future, no matter how illusionary, underlies and empowers planning's very ontological purpose. It concludes by proposing an alternative ontology for planning, which actively engages with change and the unexpected. </jats:p>",

This article provides an overview of capabilities-based planning and a more specific focus on the aims, objectives, and components of the DHS CBP model. The article also summarizes what scholars have previously suggested are fundamental elements for successful emergency and disaster planning focusing specifically on Quarantelli’s 10 research-based principles. The article evaluates the effectiveness of the DHS CBP model in helping local governments incorporate these fundamental elements into their planning efforts and concludes with an overall assessment of the DHS CBP model as a framework for local planning success.</jats:p>"

I will argue that the lack of a proper conceptualization of intermediate-scale entities such as interpersonal networks, organizations or social movements in network governance hampers the introduction of post-liberal concepts of democracy into network governance. In the second part of the article I introduce DeLanda's theory of social complexity, which is a development of DeuleuzoGuattarian Assemblage Theory. I propose it as an ontological foundation for network governance research. Assemblage theory connects to concepts of minor and major politics. In the third part of the article I present a concept of `minor governance' in order to revisit democratic network governance. </jats:p>",

This article explores the intersection between environmental planning processes and political practices by analysing the Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE) campaign to curtail the further development of Stansted Airport in the south-east of England. Highlighting a paradox of political engagement, the article builds upon recent poststructuralist theory to develop a novel grammar of concepts and logics with which to explore the dynamics of political campaigning. This grammar develops Ernesto Laclau's recent approach to populism by elaborating a spectrum of political forms of engagement, along which concrete manifestations can be located. We then characterize the logic of the SSE campaign surrounding New Labour's consultation exercise for the 2003 Air Transport White Paper, before problematizing strategies and tactics in the light of the available options. We conclude by sketching out the possibility of a dialectical connection between localism and populism, in which particular demands can be inscribed into a more universal rhetoric and strategy for change. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this abstract we present the results of the verification of the XVMC based treatment planning system “PrecisePLAN” (release 2.50; Elekta). We investigated a 6 MV photon beam from an Elekta Synergy linear accelerator in a homogeneous water phantom. Measurements of profiles, percentage depth dose curves (pdds) and relative output factors (ROFs) for square fields of sides 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 and 30 cm were compared to calculations performed with PrecisePLAN and simulations with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc. Following recommendations from the literature we investigated the deviations between measurements and calculations of the profiles and pdds in four regions and checked for the criterion of acceptability (given in parenthesis): the inner region (3 %, 2 % at the central axis), the penumbra (2 mm distance to agreement), the outer region (3 %) and the build up region (2 mm). The mean deviation +/− 1.5 times the standard deviation should lie within the confidence interval of the thresholds quoted above. For the ROFs we found very good agreement with the measurement. The deviations are lower than two and one percent for PrecisePLAN and BEAMnrc, respectively, for the investigated field sizes. Also most of the profiles and pdds fulfill the criteria of acceptability given above, but for the large field sizes some of the profiles and pdds fall outside the threshold values. The overall agreement between measurements and calculations, especially for the clinically relevant situations in modern conformal/IMRT techniques, is clinically acceptable.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At Cross Cancer Institute, we are investigating a novel MRI‐linac system consisting of a bi‐planar 0.2 T permanent magnet coupled with a 6 MV Linac. The system can freely revolve axially around the patient to deliver dose from any desired angle. For such a system, the radiation treatment planning procedure is expected to rely on the MR images only, i.e. MRI Simulation. Replacing the current CT/CT+MRI‐based RTP procedure with MRI Simulation will eliminate the need for the planning CT scanning sessions (no additional x‐ray exposure) and consequently the image fusion between MRI and planning CT. In this work, we propose a comprehensive MRI‐based RTP procedure for an MRI‐Linac system. Specifically, the method consists of a) data acquisition, b) analysis and correction of image artifacts caused by the scanner‐related and patient‐induced distortions, c) segmentation of organ structures relevant to dosimetric calculations (e.g. soft tissue, bone, air), d) conversion of MR images into CT‐like images by assigning bulk electron density values to organ contours defined at step c), e) dose calculations in external magnetic field, and f) plan evaluation. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine the linac‐MRI scanner's magnetic field induced effects on the dose deposited patterns using patient data. Specifically, we investigated the dosimetric differences between the corresponding MRI‐based RT plans simulated at zero and 0.2 T. We found that the maximum percent differences for brain studies were within 4%. Most of these differences occurred at the inferior field edge and superficially at beam exits.</jats:p>",

Previous fixture design systems rarely consider the assembly tool feasibility. Current methods of assembly tool feasibility analysis mainly depend on simulation-based or user-interactive approaches, which rely on users’ judgment. This paper presents a new approach to tool feasibility analysis for fixture assembly planning. The fixture workspace around a tool is represented by a newly defined global accessibility sphere with depth of a truncated half-line. The assembly tools are modeled as five articulated parts to fully describe the tool characteristics. Tool feasibility analysis is executed to verify assembly tools’ feasibility applied on a fastener. In particular, both tool motion and tool placement constraints during tool applications are integrated into the tool geometric reasoning. The example demonstrates the fast computing speed and intuitive simulation of several assembly tools applied in fixture assembly.</jats:p>",

Strategic planning in the airport environment summarises the basic operational tasks, goals, objectives, strategies and tactics based on the vision and mission statements previously developed by the airport organisation.

However, solving a POMDP is often intractable except for small problems due to their complexity. Here, we focus on online approaches that alleviate the computational complexity by computing good local policies at each decision step during the execution. Online algorithms generally consist of a lookahead search to find the best action to execute at each time step in an environment. Our objectives here are to survey the various existing online POMDP methods, analyze their properties and discuss their advantages and disadvantages; and to thoroughly evaluate these online approaches in different environments under various metrics (return, error bound reduction, lower bound improvement). Our experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art online heuristic search methods can handle large POMDP domains efficiently.</jats:p>"

In addition to the ontology, we have developed a Network Markup Language (NML) based on the ontology that can be used to describe real life networks. We have also developed network patterns that capture the most common and best practices in network design and represented them in the proposed NML. Finally, we have developed a Web-based tool that uses the NO, NML and network patterns to quickly generate network plans for given situations. The practical contribution of this article is that it ties ontologies to the practice of network planning and network patterns, including decisions such as network device selection.</p>",

The changing operating environment, the complexity of businesses, the interaction and interconnectivity of public and private sector organisations, and the introduction of legislation mandating the conduct of exercises has changed the scope and adequacy of exercises, with increased focus on the ‘correct’ way of developing and conducting them. However, while appropriate exercise management courses have been conducted in the public sector, these have not been readily available to the private sector. Organisations unable to access these resources have had to rely on external providers or the expertise of internal staff. As a result, the types and relevance of exercises vary greatly. This paper argues that, rather than simply writing a scenario and conducting the exercise, what is actually required is a logical process to identify the organisation’s objectives and the reasons for conducting the exercise. These aims and objectives provide a clear focus for the exercise and a relevant scenario to support their achievement.</jats:p>"

This process requires a continuous effort, including periodic identification, analyses and assessments of the critical stages along the risk circle, thus considering prevention, intervention and recovery. To cope effectively and efficiently with disasters demands a clear strategy, involving all stakeholders and risk scenarios. This paper outlines the importance of an integral risk management process and public–private partnership and — taking Switzerland as an example — describes the process of developing and establishing a widely supported vision and strategy to cope with risks due to natural hazards. The paper also elaborates some ideas on how to expand the strategy to other risks and stakeholders. The Swiss approach involves public and private sector representatives, assembled in an extra-parliamentary commission as a national platform to cope with natural hazards. This multi-stakeholder strategy development process has resulted in an action plan for implementing the strategy. Major progress has been achieved, with all stakeholders committing to a commonly established risk concept, to allocate substantial resources for the improvement of the risk dialogue and, finally, to accept a periodic audit to evaluate the status and success of the strategy.</jats:p>"

Subsequently, this paper considers what corporeal comfort as an affective sensibility is and can do to theorisations of the sedentary body. The sensibility of corporeal comfort induced through the relationality between bodies and proximate objects is explored to trace through some of the affectual circulations that flow through the sedentary body. With this in mind, forms of subjectivity engendered through the fragility of comfort are at once both active and performed, and folded through the inactive susceptibilities that are beyond activity. Drawing on such an immanent materialism enables us to take more seriously these susceptibilities of the sedentary body and the new moments and spatialities that emerge. </jats:p>",

The robots environment is represented by a 3D geometric entity called Bump-Surface, which is embedded in a 4D Euclidean space. The multi-motion planning problem (MMPP) is resolved by simultaneously finding the paths for the set of robots represented by monoparametric smooth<jats:italic>C</jats:italic><jats:sup>2</jats:sup>curves onto the Bump-Surface, such that their inverse images onto the initial 2D workspace satisfy the optimization motion-planning criteria and constraints. The MMPP is expressed as an optimization problem, which is solved on the Bump-Surface using a genetic algorithm. The performance of the proposed approach is tested through a considerable number of simulated 2D dynamic environments with car-like robots.</jats:p>",

Concentrations of genipin, gelatin and sulfuric acid were varied to determine the optimal gel sensitivity for optical computed tomography (CT). Photon beams (4 MV x‐rays, 1×1, 2×2, 3×3 cm) irradiated a 10 cm diameter cylinder of gel. Using a cone beam optical CT scanner at λ = 590 nm, zero diffusion was observed by recording sequential 3D scans separated by 18 hours. Additional evidence was provided by sequential transmission photographs of a cuvette containing a sample that had been exposed to a 0.8 mm diameter, 1 mW, 594 nm, He‐Ne laser beam and photobleached. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Radiochromic bleaching is a fast process, complete within seconds of termination of irradiation. Dose sensitivity increases with cross‐ linking density and sulfuric acid concentration. The initial optical density limits dose sensitivity, requiring approximately 30 Gy for 10 cm diameter samples to have reasonable contrast. More sensitive but darker gels require smaller samples. A comparison of profiles through 3D reconstructed dose distribution showed identical profiles for a time interval of 18 hours. Visually the sample maintained this image for six months when stored at 4C in a dark refrigerator. Transmission photographs of the laser beam image recorded by photobleaching remained constant when stored a 23 C in the dark for ten months. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Radiochromic genipin gelatin gels form a permanent and stable image when protected from bright visible light. This result is a new, non‐toxic material for 3D dosimetry.</jats:p>",

As a consequence, the university was closed for five days, while the buildings were checked for structural/electrical damage caused by hailstones and flooding. This paper provides a case study on the emergency management strategy employed by the university in response to damage caused to campus facilities and consequent disruption to academic activities. It focuses on the immediate response, with particular emphasis on organisational arrangements and communications. While the response strategy was largely effective, several gaps in procedures were identified, including broadcast communications to the campus community, controlling access to ‘closed’ buildings and managing the impact of the campus closure on new students in residential halls.</jats:p>"

It is very desirable that plans should be prepared beforehand to provide relief after this war on an adequate scale and on a basis which will promote international recovery. . . .

Principally, this is addressed through the introduction of the staffing threshold model, an original framework developed by the authors that provides managers with a structured methodology to help organisations manage worker absenteeism. Indeed, as organisations have had time to reflect on the macro impacts of a pandemic outbreak, the area that tends to garner much attention is the human resources department. Because this work is completely new, and there are no precedents from which to extrapolate (only recently, in fact, have business continuity professionals even started to recognise the importance of incorporating the human element into their planning efforts), there are no case studies against which to measure the methodology. Nonetheless, the authors feel that the introduction of a systematised method of managing worker absenteeism can make a valuable contribution to the field.</jats:p>"

There is no one answer, and the best model depends on each organisation’s unique requirements. This fact is key to any organisation’s risk management strategy. With the increased focus on both business continuity and operational risk, it is best for organisations to put in place an integrated framework that provides the foundation for managing risk.</jats:p>"

This article disentangles the different strands woven into Allied planning for 'postwar relief' in the early 1940s. The rhetorical planners – great and good people such as Leonard Woolf and veterans of relief work – feared that the humanitarian aftermath of the second world war would be even worse than that of the first. The political planners had to reconcile many conflicting forces: the need to keep allied governments in exile happy, the British blockade, the interests of the Russians, and the concerns of the United States Congress. The new instrument they produced, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, struggled to establish itself under the weak leadership of Governor Herbert Lehman. In practice, therefore, military planning mattered most. Allied armies discovered, in Italy in 1943-44, the necessity in modern warfare of feeding, fumigating and rehousing civilians and, in the process, developed expertise in new medical technologies such as DDT, nutrition, and penicillin, which prevented the expected epidemics. But the reluctance of the military to 'do welfare' or to engage in rehabilitation also became apparent. The main achievement of the long planning process was in creating the dominant mental construct of postwar relief, that of the 'displaced person', on which the hierarchy of assessment of refugees' needs was based, and new institutional mechanisms of doubtful effectiveness. Planning, some contemporaries concluded, did not in itself guarantee success. </jats:p>",

The cell, the access and the core network planning problems have all been considered as well as a more global approach (when more than one subproblems are considered simultaneously). Both planning and expansion algorithms are also included in this review. The goal of this paper is to present and classify the different research works that have been done so that it can be used as a starting point for future research on topological design of UMTS networks.

Of particular interest are the influences of age, size, industry branch and location on company migration behaviour. In addition, the central spatial distribution of business formations and closures is observed. In a first step, the interrelations are described for the observed business demographic results. Then, the individual effects are tested and quantified with a logit-loglinear model. The model selected makes it possible to explore and quantify the interaction effects between the variables on business demographic behaviour. The results prove that all four factors influence the demographic behaviour of companies. The comparison between the influence of age and size show that age is the predominant variable on migration behaviour whereas the size of a business has a noticeable effect on the exit rate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the politics of agricultural biosecurity in the UK, following the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease. Biosecurity politics epitomise the ‘risk politics’ of animal disease, which acts antipolitically by focusing on problem-solving mechanisms and shutting down spaces for debate and dissent. By following biosecurity through three sites, various inconsistencies of this politics are described. On farms, biosecurity is seen as a routine and regulated practice that is more novel discursively than it is materially. In parliamentary and policy discourse, biosecurity is caught between a prescriptive regulatory logic tied to on-farm practices and a more open rhetorical construction which links it to a wider range of affairs of state (such as security, the national border, the public interest). At the science–policy interface, biosecurity politics enacts divisions not only between the roles of science and politics, but also between types of science. An event-based appreciation of risk and contingency highlights the need to unlock the problem-making potential inherent in these various inconsistencies and connections, a role which should be undertaken by social scientists working with others. The aim of this problem making should be a better constructed biosecurity through good biosecurity science. </jats:p>",

We pitch discourses of biological immanence and emergence against forms of social science thinking which tend to trace overarching logics or seemingly unstoppable forces in matters of power and politics. While acknowledging the import of both literatures, our aim is to engage with the fraught empirical practicalities of making biomatters secure in order to bring to the fore the ways in which life matters are patterned by any number of processes and the ways in which these patterns are always conditional on sociomaterial contingencies. </jats:p>",

This paper uses the PUA of Shanghai as a case study to investigate the impact of global forces on the urban expansion of the city, and the link between urban growth and sustainable development in this mega‐urban context. Shanghai has grown impressively during the past two decades in terms of economic and physical transformation. Much of this transformation has rested on the unbridled exploitation of land and other environmental resources in its peri‐urban area. This is characterised by the designation of development zones and the concentration of manufacturing FDI, resulting in dispersed growth and environmental degradation. The disruption of the physical environment, combined with the concentration of the urban poor in these areas (in particular ‘temporary migrants’), has turned the PUA into a potential crisis point threatening the social and economic development of the city.</jats:p>",

By monitoring new sources of nondiagnostic health information (911 calls, ER triage logs, pharmaceutical sales), syndromic surveillance produces new ‘territories of intelligibility’. But the implemention of syndromic systems—and the opening up of these new territories—poses a problem of interpretation. What is significant in nondiagnostic data flows? In fact, the development of a national syndromic system in the United States attracted criticism from local public health experts, who complained about the costs of ‘false positive’ or insignificant detections. This exposes a disjuncture between two interpretative frameworks, two styles of governing biosecurity: public health (a responsibility for maximal population health) and preparedness (a concern for disaster-scale events). At stake are new norms and forms of securing life. </jats:p>",

Although several methods have been proposed for selecting surrogates, no clear set of species attributes have been described that allow for the efficient<jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic>selection of surrogate groups. We used a database of 1449 species in two regions of the United States to (1) examine the consistency in the performance of simple taxonomic‐based surrogates of biodiversity and (2) test five hypotheses proposed to explain surrogate performance. First, we compared the ability of sites selected to protect members of seven surrogate groups to protect non‐surrogate species in the north‐western United States and in the Middle‐Atlantic region of the eastern United States. Then, in a separate analysis, we tested whether surrogate performance could be explained by (1) taxonomic diversity; (2) nested species distributions; (3) hotspots of biodiversity; (4) species range sizes; (5) environmental diversity. Our first analysis revealed little consistency in the performance of surrogates in the two different study regions. For example, butterflies provided protection for 76% of all other species in the north‐western United States but only 56% of all other species in the eastern United States. Our second analysis revealed only weak associations between species characteristics and surrogate performance. Furthermore, these associations proved inadequate for selecting successful surrogates across study regions. Overall, our results suggest that in lieu of searching for optimal surrogate groups, research efforts will be better spent by developing alternative methods for assessing conservation value in areas where data on species distributions are limited.</jats:p>",

The paper argues that debates over biosecurity can be conceptualised as arguments over the ability to regulate flows of disease and the constructions of space they adopt. Data from parliamentary inquiries and interviews are used to show how attempts to institutionalise forms of biosecurity emerge from a delicate balance of prescribed and negotiated spaces configured by a host of social, natural, and material agents. The interaction between these spaces provides a way of regulating the flows of disease and purifying agricultural space. This balance is resisted by farmers, whose practical knowledges of the constant struggle of managing the contingencies of agriculture lead them to suggest that only uniform versions of space can effectively regulate flows of disease. The author concludes by discussing the importance of recognising these differences for future biosecurity and animal health policy. </jats:p>",

The survey also indicates that businesses lack the formal rules and processes to evaluate and distribute emergency information received from government. The paper recommends that government agencies allocate resources to broaden their existing information outreach to the business sector, increasing both the ‘volume’ as well as the ‘quality’ of information, emphasising content that is specific, actionable and relevant to activities before, during and after a crisis. It also calls for the government to promote additional research to define information needs within the private sector; to identify and share best practice regarding existing information programmes; and to fund and support information- sharing programmes on a state-wide, regional and major metropolitan area basis. Finally, the paper recommends that businesses should improve their internal capabilities to evaluate and distribute security and preparedness information received from government.</jats:p>"

This paper explores these debates in the context of disabled people's engagement in urban policy processes, as an arena in which participative imperatives have become manifest under the UK's New Labour government. Drawing on a case study of a Single Regeneration Budget partnership, I argue that there are significant limits to disabled people's engagement in urban policy, ranging from their perceived legitimacy and constitution as a ‘relevant public’, through to the processes of partnership in which managerialist objectives clash with participative agendas. The paper therefore raises issues about the rationale for participation and the extent to which notions of deliberative democracy are equipped to deal with issues of ‘difference’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The context of biosecurity has been theorised through attention to borders, boundaries, and expert processes of categorisation. This emergent literature represents biosecurity governance as brittle, unreflexive, and unresponsive. In contrast, biosecurity practices in New Zealand produce a complexity of semipermeable boundaries of control that are beginning to incorporate flexibility and sensitivity to the spatiotemporal geographies of indeterminate entities, and to changing and competing human values. Gorse ( Ulex spp), a woody, perennial shrub, was imported to New Zealand during the early stages of European settlement, and has been the subject of shifting biosecurity-related management practices for close to 150 years. Classified as a ‘pest plant’, gorse is currently subject to the biosecurity rationalities of internal pest management. Cost–benefit analysis and the ‘infestation-curve model’ are drawn on in the placement of gorse in a hierarchy of control categories within regional pest management strategies. This classification and control is negotiated between institutional and public values and rationalities within a formalised consultation process, and through the diffuse impact of public opinion. Gorse also plays an active role in the decision-making process, as its extensive distribution informs the allocation of control responses, and through its controversial role as a ‘nurse plant’ for native species. This paper therefore presents a challenge to emergent critical social scientific approaches to biosecurity, suggesting that we can learn something from the socionatural subtlety of policy making and implementation practices in New Zealand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The EGSnrc Monte Carlo code was evaluated for its ability to calculate the relative response of a variety of ion chambers to Co‐60 beams as a means of justifying the use of this code in future investigations of cavity theory. EGSnrc calculations were compared to measurements with four separate ion chambers, which were each configured with several wall materials (ranging from plastic to lead) and cavity sizes (or cavity air pressures). The experimental results included measurements by Nilsson et al. in 1992, and experiments by Whyte, Attix et al. and Cormack and Johns in the mid‐to‐late 1950's designed to evaluate Spencer‐Attix cavity theory. Experiments by Whyte involved measurements of the response per unit mass as a function of cavity air pressure for a large cylindrical chamber, whereas the other experiments consisted of measurements of the response per unit mass (or ionization current) as a function of the distance between the front and back wall (cavity height) of a plane‐parallel chamber. EGSnrc calculations, which could account for the change in response associated with changes in wall material in most cases, were generally within 1–3% of experimental values, even for experimental data that required calculations of unreported wall corrections determined using experimental techniques. The ability of EGSnrc to accurately model these experiments, which showed variations up to 300%, confirms its suitability for detailed Monte Carlo studies of cavity theory.</jats:p>",

I argue the affective labour of both nurses and hotel housekeepers is mobilized to perform unquantifiable but essential life-management and that they function as a frontline of the barrier in thwarting the mobility of SARS as an infectious disease. Thus, nurses and hotel housekeepers are precarious gatekeepers, in vulnerable positions as they perform tasks of biosecurity as they monitor borders of transmission. </jats:p>",

Indeed, many employees, stressed and anxious about their personal and family needs, may wish to leave their workplace as soon as possible and stay home until conditions return to ‘normal’. It is therefore imperative to understand how an organisation’s response to crisis events can reassure employees that their safety and wellbeing will be protected. The Organizational Safety Net research project was developed to investigate models to enhance preparedness and response capabilities in high-threat urban areas. Respondents identified the following attributes as essential in maintaining a strong workforce: communication with family and loved ones; communication within the organisation as to what is happening; what plans exist to deal with the crisis event; pre-disaster preparedness and training; the competence and availability of senior leadership; the empowerment and training of mid-level decision makers; and clear, comprehensive approaches that can ensure that large complex organisations have comprehensive, coordinated and flexible systems that create safe environments. These attributes contribute to the creation of an atmosphere of perceived safety and are critical elements in the development of an organisational safety net.</jats:p>"

Forty‐seven dogs that underwent surgical resection of a total of 55 soft tissue masses had surgical hemoclips placed at the time of surgery and orthogonal radiographs made immediately postoperatively. Radiation treatment field simulation was done and field areas measured. Additional determinations included number of hemoclips outside of the radiation treatment field based on a margin around the incision alone, hemoclip distance from the incision, and association between incision length and greatest distance of hemoclips from the incision. There was a significant difference in radiation treatment field size using information regarding the location of hemoclips in conjunction with the surgical scar compared with the surgical scar alone for truncal (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.0003) vs. extremity tumors (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>=0.087). In simulating radiation treatment fields hemoclips were located outside of field setup 1 for the majority of tumors (79%) resected from the trunk but only in a minority of tumors (10.7%) resected from extremity sites. The findings from this study suggest that surgical hemoclips have potential utility in simulation of radiation treatment fields in the postoperative setting.</jats:p>",

Using a laser optical CT scanner at λ = 594 nm, diffusion rate measurements were performed on half‐irradiated (6 MV x‐rays) cuvette gel samples made with and without surfactant, respectively. A cylindrical 1 L gel volume was irradiated with a 12 MeV electron beam (Varian Clinac 2100C) to a dose of 30 Gy and scanned with cone‐ beam optical CT at λ ∼ 590 nm (Vista™, Modus Medical Devices Inc.). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The most radiation sensitive gel formulation was found to be: 1 mM LCV, 4 mM Triton X‐100, 30 mM trichloroacetic acid and 4% gelatin. The diffusion rates of a LCV gel without and with surfactant present were about 2 and 20 times lower than the Fricke xylenol‐orange gel system, respectively. Comparison of the central axis gel attenuation coefficients normalized at depth of maximum dose (d<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>) with TG21‐corrected ion chamber data, were in agreement, thus, indicating energy and dose‐rate independence. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Radiochromic LCV micelle gels show minimal diffusion effects and a dose response that is linear, energy and dose‐rate independent.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>A nonholonomic system subjected to external noise from the environment, or internal noise in its own actuators, will evolve in a stochastic manner described by an ensemble of trajectories. This ensemble of trajectories is equivalent to the solution of a Fokker–Planck equation that typically evolves on a Lie group. If the most likely state of such a system is to be estimated, and plans for subsequent motions from the current state are to be made so as to move the system to a desired state with high probability, then modeling how the probability density of the system evolves is critical. Methods for solving Fokker-Planck equations that evolve on Lie groups then become important. Such equations can be solved using the operational properties of group Fourier transforms in which irreducible unitary representation (IUR) matrices play a critical role. Therefore, we develop a simple approach for the numerical approximation of all the IUR matrices for two of the groups of most interest in robotics: the rotation group in three-dimensional space,<jats:italic>SO</jats:italic>(3), and the Euclidean motion group of the plane,<jats:italic>SE</jats:italic>(2). This approach uses the exponential mapping from the Lie algebras of these groups, and takes advantage of the sparse nature of the Lie algebra representation matrices. Other techniques for density estimation on groups are also explored. The computed densities are applied in the context of probabilistic path planning for kinematic cart in the plane and flexible needle steering in three-dimensional space. In these examples the injection of artificial noise into the computational models (rather than noise in the actual physical systems) serves as a tool to search the configuration spaces and plan paths. Finally, we illustrate how density estimation problems arise in the characterization of physical noise in orientational sensors such as gyroscopes.</jats:p>",

It is based on a field study that focuses on the experiences of women residents—that is, rural migrants known for their dependency on neighborhood spaces—and their grown-up daughters who were raised in the city. The neighborhood context—namely, the social and physical isolation of the site, the limited access to urban institutions, and the growing risk of crime—has a negative impact on women's lives, restraining but not determining women's agency. Women's struggle for agency in this context is contingent on other factors, including whether they live in ethnic clusters and whether their husbands are working, as well as urban experience and individual biography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We propose a novel method that combines the simulation results of a model‐based prediction tool with the knowledge contained in measurement data. This mixture of the<jats:italic>a priori information</jats:italic>and<jats:italic>the posteriori knowledge</jats:italic>aims at enhancing the prediction results by increasing their precision and quality. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is trained to learn the mapping between the distributions of the measurement data and the simulation data. To make the complexity of the MLP tractable, we propose the utilization of independent component analysis (ICA). The ICA transformation makes the variables at the input of the MLP statistically independent so that it can perform its learning and generalization on individual one‐dimensional distributions. Other contributions consist of the application of the<jats:italic>k</jats:italic>‐means clustering algorithm on the incoming data and the use of the training data<jats:italic>world model</jats:italic>to enhance the generalization capability of the MLP. The world model consists of the aggregation of all the available data in the learning space. The proposed method is applied to a third generation mobile network to enhance the predictions of uplink and downlink base station loads. After a training performed on a given network configuration, mechanical antenna tilts are modified and we show that the results obtained by the supervised predictions are much closer to measurements than simulation results for cases that have not been encountered before.

This paper argues that Canada's public health legal framework is a critical part of Canada's practice of ‘biosecurity’ through which an unpredictable and continually emergent ‘new reality’, is mobilized to justify an ongoing state of emergency. Norms about state power and human rights are suspended in the interest of global capitalism and at the expense of those most vulnerable to the short-term and long-term effects of infectious disease. </jats:p>",

To measure these effects, a hierarchical information integration experiment was conducted in the Netherlands. Representatives of office-keeping organisations in selected city regions were questioned about the attractiveness of hypothetical ITS-based accessibility profiles of office locations. A general preference model was estimated to test the hypothesis that the introduction of ITS-based transport concepts will significantly influence the preferences of office-keeping organisations regarding office locations. It appears that all the included ITS attributes have a significant impact on the accessibility preferences of office-keeping organisations in urban regions. Moreover, location preferences change slightly after the introduction of the three ITS-related transport concepts. </jats:p>",

Length of stay, impediments to both education and discharge, and medical equipment needed at the time of discharge were extracted from hospital records. Caregivers of children with new tracheostomies needed a median of 14 days (range 5–110 days) to successfully complete a tracheostomy education program. Discharge occurred a median of 6.5 days (range 0–71 days) after education was completed. Common impediments to completing the education program included social issues (e.g., lack of sibling childcare), inter‐current illness of the patient and/or language barriers. Impediments to discharge included patient's inter‐current illnesses, social issues (e.g., lack of running water) and unavailability of home nursing. Our cohort of patients had a total median length of stay (LOS) of 46 days. At discharge, 55% of children required two or more medical devices (in addition to their tracheostomy) and 61% had some level of dependency on positive pressure ventilation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Pediatric patients with a new tracheostomy undergo lengthy initial hospitalizations and have complex educational and discharge needs. Multiple factors (both medical and social) can impede the child's transition to the outpatient setting.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We develop a consumer response model to evaluate and plan pricing and promotions in durable-good markets. We discuss its implementation in the U.S. automotive industry, which “spends” about $45 billion each year in price promotions. The approach is based on a random effects multinomial nested logit model of product (e.g., a vehicle model, such as Hyundai Tucson), and transaction-type choice. Transaction types include combinations of acquisition types (e.g., purchase versus lease) and pricing instruments (cash rebates, reduced APR financing, lease payment discounts). We estimate the model using hierarchical Bayes methods to capture response heterogeneity at the local market level. We find key characteristics unique to durable-good markets. First, consumers are heterogeneous in both their brand and transaction-type preferences. Second, consumers differ in their overall price sensitivity as well as in their relative sensitivity to alternative pricing instruments (e.g., cash discounts, reduced monthly payments). Third, the most effective pricing programs tend to be those in which automakers offer consumers a menu of options to choose from (e.g., a choice among a cash discount, reduced interest rate financing, or a lease payment discount). We illustrate the model through an empirical application to a sample of data drawn from J.D. Power transaction records in the entry SUV segment and discuss examples of actual implementations.</jats:p>",

A recent investigation of x‐ray profiles (Tonkopi <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>, Med. Phys <jats:bold>32</jats:bold> (9), 2005) showed very good agreement between measurement and EGSnrc calculations but to achieve this level of agreement the beam linac spot size, energy and angular divergence had to be treated as variables. In this project we carried out measurements and MC calculations for an electron accelerator for which the initial beam parameters are well known. Two sets of investigations were carried out. In the first we measured electron scatter distributions for a range of scattering foils and electron energies of 13 and 20 MeV. The profiles were parameterised and compared to EGSnrc Monte Carlo calculations. It was found that generally the EGSnrc calculations gave agreement with the measurements within 1.5 %. In the second investigation, which is on‐going, in‐air profiles were obtained for photon beams produced using different targets (from beryllium to lead). Measured angular distributions were obtained using ion chambers with different build‐up caps (low and high‐Z) and the sensitivity of the data to small changes in geometry (e.g., moving the x‐ray target) was investigated. The photon energy fluence was calculated using EGSnrc and preliminary indications are that the measured and calculated distributions agree to better than 5 %.

MR angiographic roadmap imaging requires high signal‐to‐noise (SNR), good vascular‐to‐background contrast and short acquisition time. These requirements not only qualify the appropriate roadmaps for therapy, but also guide in the optimization of their acquisition parameters. We hypothesize that among the well established MR angiographic techniques, low‐resolution phase‐contrast (PC) images would prove satisfactory for vascular roadmap imaging. To verify this, four potential MR angiography techniques, specifically, time‐of‐flight, contrast‐enhanced, phase‐contrast and black‐blood angiography, were explored for roadmap imaging using a canine model on a 3 T MR scanner. PC angiography was specifically performed to evaluate impact of key parameters on the SNR efficiency and vascular‐to‐background contrast efficiency in order to optimize the sequence for therapeutic use. Data were collected from five canines. Phase‐contrast angiography was found to be most suitable for generating vascular roadmap for MR‐guided endovascular therapy. It was also found that small acquisition matrix and large FOV produced satisfactory roadmap images provided that the size of the vessel of interest was more than a few times the in‐plane pixel dimension. Also, reducing the phase encoding steps had minimal effect on vessel oriented parallel to the phase encode direction.</jats:p>",

Although this is an issue frequently treated by US researchers, it has traditionally received much less attention in Europe. The deregulation that took place mainly during the 1980s may have contributed to an increase in the importance of this phenomenon. Therefore, our aim in this paper is to assess the effect of deregulation on the availability of banking services, especially in low-income municipalities in Spain. Our results show that, although the level of service is lower in low-income towns, the differences in the level of service between the high-income and low-income towns have decreased in the last decade. Interestingly, we provide evidence on the ability of the different types of financial intermediaries to avoid financial exclusion. Our results show that the Savings Banks appear as the main contributors to financial inclusion. </jats:p>",

In cooperation with the management, we implemented and tested a new segmentation, targeting, and positioning tool, which provides managers with information on their target markets, customer preferences, competitors' strengths, and customer segments. It allows for the simultaneous visualization of these data on a single map and facilitates timely and accurate decision making. In particular, we report on the design and the implementation of a new pricing scheme, “Formel 10,” which became the most successful new tariff introduction in this competitive market. tele.ring's managers were very much impressed with our tool's ability to represent the market on a single map and with its capacity to allow for intuitive interpretation. In addition, the tool enhanced internal communication between its users and different stakeholders during the new tariff development process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past thirty years, recreation communities in many parts of the globe have gone through cycles of diversification and integration into complex recreation regions. As resort communities mature, they face increasing pressures on scarce recreational resources, demands for economic diversification, and changing attitudes toward tourism on the part of local residents. A variety of land-use management practices and economic development initiatives has emerged in resort towns in response to resource congestion and other growth issues. In this paper we explore alternative growth strategies through a simulation of housing decisions by primary actors in resort land markets. We use a multiagent system to model the dynamics of growth regimes, assess the influence of recreational and town amenities, and evaluate the effect of alternative growth processes on long-term development patterns. Our case study area is Steamboat Springs and surrounding parts of Routt County, a four-season recreational region in northwestern Colorado. </jats:p>",

First we compared the results from our cases with Martinsons' earlier work (2004). One case seemed to fit most of the characteristics of a private venture (PV) whereas the other case, also a PV, had a very low degree of fit. We used the process model to offer further insights and features such as its predictive power. Second, and as predicted, we also observed the differential role of top management support in the two Chinese companies. But thirdly, and somewhat surprisingly, we found that cultural issues were only of limited importance. Finally, the ability of the project team to deal with unexpected events was seen as critical in ensuring the stability of a project. In contrast, project drift is shown to lead to a degree of chaos. We offer some suggestions as to how stakeholders can improve their chances of implementing ERP systems more successfully.</jats:p>",

In the opening phase of a project, the project team makes decisions about the relative priority of project time, cost, and performance objectives, oftentimes without complete information about customer and stakeholder requirements. Existing project management curriculum assists in developing skills to decide among these priorities in the abstract through paradigms such as the time–cost–performance triangle, with limited attention to the improvement of skills required to develop solutions to these trade‐offs, particularly in uncertain and ambiguous project environments. Further, there is often an underlying bias in project teams toward consideration of the project task and project deliverables and reduced attention to time and cost objectives. This study demonstrates the benefits of a balanced approach to setting project time, cost, and performance objectives using a goal‐based simulation exercise entitled “The Bridge to Project Leadership.” Results for 124 project teams illustrate the tendency to ignore this balanced approach, resulting in reduced project performance, even among experienced project managers.</jats:p>",

To better meet the test requirements for such heterogeneous SoCs, leading tester companies have recently introduced port-scalable testers, which can simultaneously drive groups of channels at different data rates. However, the number of tester channels available for scan testing is limited; therefore, a higher shift frequency can increase the test time for a core if the resulting test access architecture reduces the bit-width used to access it. We present a scalable test planning technique that exploits port scalability of testers to reduce SoC test time. We compare the proposed heuristic optimization method to two baseline methods based on prior works that use a single scan data rate for all embedded cores. We also propose a power-aware test planning technique to effectively utilize port-scalable testers under constraints of test power consumption. Experimental results are presented for power-aware test scheduling to illustrate the impact of power constraints on overall test time.</jats:p>",

Also, lung functionality is not homogeneously distributed over all the volume: single‐photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) allows spatial characterization of perfusion, open the way to the design of treatments plans that could preferentially avoid highly‐functional lung. In this study, three cases of lung cancer were retrospectively used to assess the capacity of an anatomy‐based aperture inverse planning system to realize dose escalation while limiting dose to perfused lung. Plans were generated for four‐beam non‐coplanar configurations, mixing 6 and 23 MV photon beams. All dose calculations were performed using Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> superposition/convolution algorithm. An increasing dose was prescribed to a subvolume of the initial planning target volume. Levels of escalation achieved for the three cases studied were 81 Gy, 111 Gy and 66 Gy to the subvolume. Escalation was limited in two cases by the dose to the esophagus and in the other case by the presence of overdosages near beam entry ports. Calculation of dose‐volume parameters for OARs shows that they respect clinical thresholds. Plans generated by the system are less complex than plans generated in beamlet‐based IMRT, because of the use of few, large segments. The approach used in this study allows important dose escalation, potentially improving treatment outcome.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study is to determine the inter‐relationship among arc range, Multi‐Leaf Collimator (MLC) leaf positions and angular dose rate optimizations for IMAT delivery of a concave target. A concave planning target volume (PTV) with central cylindrical organ at risk (OAR) was used in dissecting the inter‐relationships. Plans with full and limited arc range were generated using leaf position optimization (LPO) alone, angular dose rate optimization (ADRO) alone or LPO followed by ADRO. Two initial IMAT arcs were conformal avoidance arcs created with 5° angular increments where MLC leaf positions were determined from the beams eye view to irradiate the PTV but avoid the OAR. The objective function value (evaluating dose to PTV and OAR), a conformity index, dose homogeneity index, mean dose to OAR and normal tissues were computed and used to evaluate the treatment plans. Dose rate variations and MLC leaf movements as a function of gantry angle were examined in this approach. The results demonstrate that LPO followed by ADRO provided the lowest objective function values, best conformity and dose homogeneity indices, and third in mean dose to OAR and normal tissues for the complete arc range. Future work will address different strategies for simultaneously optimizing both the MLC leaf positions and the variable angular dose rate for IMAT delivery and compare single and multiple arc plans.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To perform full 3D heterogeneous dose calculations for total body irradiation (TBI) cases and compare different treatment planning softwares (TPS). <jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> A retrospective study was performed on 7 patients. Dose distributions obtained with <jats:italic>Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> v.7.9u (Philips Medical Systems)</jats:italic> were compared with the ones calculated using our actual TBI planning system <jats:italic>Theraplan Plus</jats:italic> (TPP) by <jats:italic>MDS Nordion/Nucletron</jats:italic>. Two different <jats:italic>Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic> models were studied: standard beam commissioning (<jats:italic>std_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic>) and TBI commissioning (<jats:italic>TBI_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic>). For the later case, commissioning was adapted for the special TBI conditions (extended SSD of 190cm, large field, acrylic beam spoiler, and out of field dose (OFD)). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Significant differences are found between the <jats:italic>TPP</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>std_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TBI_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic> dose distributions. For the relative mid‐line doses, differences up to 12% were observed. Systematic overestimations of 5% were found in patients extremities between <jats:italic>TPP</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TBI_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic>. Average dose underestimation of 3% was observed between <jats:italic>std_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>TBI_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic>. Differences in patient extremities are attributed to the OFD contribution which is not correctly computed in <jats:italic>TPP</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>std_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic>. Dose comparison outside the patient's mid‐line showed greater differences (up to 20%) between models. Accurate 3D heterogeneous dose calculations with <jats:italic>TBI_Pinnacle<jats:sup>3</jats:sup></jats:italic> model show major differences (homogeneous versus heterogeneous) in high and low density regions. Dose overestimation of 5% was observed in bony regions and dose underestimation of 5% to 10% was observed in lung regions. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Those results are of major interest since they show a strong dependence of the dose calculation outcome on both TPS and commissioning used, potentially leading to significant dose misevaluation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Material requirement planning (MRP) has evolved from a simplistic representation in the 1980s to today's manufacturing resource planning (MRPII) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in order to meet changing business demands. The persisting momentous drive for lowest costs and highest quality dictates that MRP is deployed in an optimal manner. Multi-objective linear programming (MOLP), which is used simultaneously to optimize decisions through trade-offs between two or more conflicting objectives, has not been reported in MRP-related literature. As an extension of work reported by Yenisey [1], where optimization of material flow in MRP had been presented, a fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (f-MOLP) model is used where two objectives, namely minimization of total cost and minimization of total time of MRP, are targeted. The objective is to find the optimum production rate for each end-product at each period in accordance with the objectives and related constraints. The proposed f-MOLP is solved for two sets of conditions consisting of symmetric and asymmetric cases. The corresponding results show that the proposed models can help manufacturers make better decisions when facing uncertainty about objective functions as well as the constraints set. Degrees of satisfaction demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach in the context of MRP. </jats:p>",

The results reveal that the students with disabilities have more difficulties in using the learning-to-learn strategies as they read, study, and write expository texts, although neither group is judged to be highly proficient. The implications point to a renewed emphasis on preparing content-area teachers to teach the literacy and learning strategies that support the development of learners who know how to read to learn and how to write to learn. </jats:p>",
