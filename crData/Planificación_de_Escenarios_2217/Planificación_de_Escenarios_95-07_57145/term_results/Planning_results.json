      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the relationship between culture, planning, and urban form m the context of Confucian Asia. Three distinct paths of influence are explored. First, urban form is itself an important expression or manifestation of culture. Second, culture has an indirect influence on urban form through its direct influence on the practice of planning. Third, urban form in turn influences culture by shaping, literally and figuratively, the context in which that culture is sustained. From this perspective, urban form provides valuable clues to what is being said at the level of culture. Planners do not act in a vacuum, but are part and parcel of the cultural environment in which they operate. These ideas are explored in the context of planning in East Asia, with special emphasis on the influences of Confucian culture. Our analysis calls into question the appropriateness of Western planning methods in a Confucian urban context. </jats:p>",

In the field of land use planning this integration remains in its infancy. The article suggests a general, modular approach for the incorporation of GIS technology into land use planning course work, using a combination of GIS, database, and spreadsheet software. Numerous specific examples are provided, including major applicauons in data collection, preliminary analysis, plan formulation, and plan evaluation. </jats:p>",

Much of the postmodernist critique of modernism is valid, particularly its rejection of the scientistic tenet of modernism—the claim that science is the only source of valid knowledge-and the foundationalism and absolutism which flow from this. However, postmodernists show a dangerous inclination to reject the humanistic tenet of modernism—the valuing of the equal and autonomous individual in both political and moral realms-along with the core idea that progress comes via rational argument. Full-blown postmodernism<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> is also fatally flawed by an inconsistent retention of the very foundationalism and absolute dualism which it purports to reject. The uncritical adoption of postmodernist assumptions could impair our ability to legitimate public planning. An alternative nonmodernist approachneopragmatism—offers a coherent and reasonable basis for justifying planning. </jats:p>",

It was adopted in Canada and Australia, where it conformed to the early design of standards to control the hospital environment. In the past decade, these accreditation systems have been forced to change in response to the decline in the role of the hospital in health care delivery; the demands of governments and the public for greater information about quality of health care. They have also responded to pressure for greater knowledge of clinical effectiveness by introducing indicators of clinical performance. Within the past 5 years, accreditation has been adopted in a number of other countries where governments have extended their role into assuring the quality of health care. Accreditation, originally perceived as a vehicle to enable organizational development, is increasingly an agent of government regulation.</jats:p>",

The indicators are developed with the assistance of the various medical colleges (professional associations of specialists). Sixteen such bodies are now in the program, with 150 draft indicators covering 90 areas of hospital practice. The development of a set of indicators passes through a number of stages to ensure their validity, and a process is in place to assess their reliability, reproducibility and responsiveness. The qualitative information available indicates a willingness on the part of health care facilities to address the indicators, and alter the process of care. It is anticipated that the quantitative information being collected in aggregate form will subsequently demonstrate an improvement in the outcome of care. Hospital specific information currently remains confidential to the ACHS and the particular health care facility. The public release of such information and the value of doing so remains undetermined.</jats:p>",

Low-density residential development of this type has been a concern of land use planners over the same period, with loss of prime agricultural land, costs of service provision, landscape impacts, and overreliance on transport by private automobiles being the main issues. Focusing on Sydney's perimetropolitan region, this paper presents data on exurban growth rates and intraurban migration for the decade 1981 to 1991 and also sketches sociodemographic features of exurban settlers. While the types of people populating exurbia are similar to their US counterparts, rates of exurban growth are much lower. The second part of the paper suggests reasons for this contrast. Although a number of factors regarded as driving exurban growth in the US also operate in Australia, they are argued to have less impact. Other factors relevant in the US do not appear to be significant in Australia The differing spatial structure of Australian and US cities, along with the apparently greater strength of regional planning in Australia, are argued to account for the differences. </jats:p>",

There are opportunities in at least two areas in the generation of more sophisticated theories about spatial problems: through techniques such as data mining, pattern recognition, and neural network models; and through the application of methods which were previously too difficult to test and utilise. It is the latter challenge which is primarily addressed in this paper. The authors introduce an important problem of network optimisation and discuss the methods by which the problem may be solved. They show how existing solution procedures are hampered by the computational complexity of the problem, and how these barriers can be pushed back by the application of parallal computing technology. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstraction is one of the most promising approaches to improve the    performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by    dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most    hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present    examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by    dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more    general view of abstraction involving the change of representation    language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a    related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete    change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to    abstract.  However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation    language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe    admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain    model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan    Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which    abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete    cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in    mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed    reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.</jats:p>"

Contrary to expectations, migration from villages and towns in the 1980s and 1990s reduced total fertility rates in African cities by about one birth, from an estimated average of 5·55 in the absence of migration to 4·59. New arrivals experience much lower fertility in their first few years in cities than long term residents of similar age and parity. This results from the initial unmarried status of most migrants, high levels of spousal separation among new arrivals who are married, dramatic increases in use of modern methods of contraception after 2 years in cities, and continuation of traditionally long durations of postpartum abstinence. Accomodation of additional migrants thus appears consistent with efforts to reduce fertility in cities. Moreover, prospects for increased contraceptive prevalencein Africa may depend heavily on changes in population distribution that influence the demand for children, specifically movement to cities.</jats:p>",

However, the technical efforts in planning these subsystems can be combined by considering the minimization of system costs and the maximization of utilization rate of environmental assimilative capacity. But the system uncertainties should be further addressed in the modelling framework as the variations of environmental factors become significant. The grey systems theory is found to be an effective tool to modify the deterministic models. Therefore, a grey nonlinear programming model is developed in this paper to support such an uncertainty analysis. The case study of the Guishuic wastewater treatment and disposal project in Taiwan is used as a numerical demonstration.</jats:p>",

The cooperative public/private venture which created the Robinson Forest and Cyprus‐Amax Wildlife Management Areas is presented as an example of how a regional perspective encourages a symbiotic relationship among these Functions. Wildlife management areas, as either an interim or final land use. are shown to incorporate development concepts which benefit the general public, the coal industry, and the environment. Examining the regional pattern or wildlife management areas and refuges confirms the appropriateness of the subject site for this use. It is suggested that the pattern of mined lands can be studied to identify other sites with potential to provide linkages between wildlife habitat areas and encourage reclamation of such sites to the “fish and wildlife” postmining land use. Such reclamation strategies should be pursued within a long‐term planning framework. More research is needed to recreate specific habitat types on drastically disturbed land and planning is needed to assure that sensitive habitats or species arc located away from zones likely to undergo future development. Use of geographic information systems to integrate existing environmental information could make such studies more effective.</jats:p>",

An analysis of these variations shows that those authorities which experienced the greatest rise in unit costs also had the greatest reduction in service volumes. Unit cost containment has been greatest where there was grant reduction and a declining local tax base, while volume declined most where there was rate-capping. The rising variation in unit costs has been responsible for the widening gap between standard spending assessments and what local authorities have wanted to spend on personal social services. If these increased variations reflect widening efficiency standards, then reversing this trend will require that social services department managements have both the motivation and capacity to implement unit cost monitoring and control.</jats:p>",

It is postulated that variations across space in industrial rents reflect spatial variations not only in productivity-enhancing firm amenities, but also in utility-bearing worker amenities and local institutional constraints on the supply of industrial space or land. To test for such influences, alternative empirical models employing 1990 industrial (production space) rents in Greater Los Angeles are estimated. Although firm amenities induce the strongest price effect, worker amenities and zoning constraints do play an important role in industrial pricing. </jats:p>",

In the latter case, the use of fuzzy models is an interesting alternative, accommodating expert planner's qualitative judgments about future loads and allowing us to use ‘typical’ load diagrams in new areas.

Many heuristic and optimization‐oriented systems that have been implemented for this type of problem have failed in part due to a poor graphical user interface. This work proposes an approach that can be applied to improve the design of user interfaces for this type of system and make its implementation easier. The approach is based on tools that were adapted from the FW/SM system for Structured Modeling and commercially available tools, such as Powerbuilder and CPLEX. Two systems that were implemented using this approach, in two different firms, are presented. These systems run on standard PCs under MS Windows, follow the Windows applications design guidelines, and interact with relational database management systems.</jats:p>",

A key element of the planning approach is identification of those system components whose improvement from their current state of availability would have the greatest impact on increasing overall system availability. The approach includes: a) conducting a reliability centered life extension (RCLEX) planning analysis utilizing a failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), availability modeling, and component aging in order to determine priorities for critical system components; b) identifying and assessing alternative methods for improving critical system components and analyzing their effectiveness using life‐cycle cost methods; and c) preparing an integrated Comprehensive Life Extension Plan (CLEP), showing projects, schedules, and budgets.</jats:p>",

Motion was analysed three‐dimensionally in great detail prior to and after kinaesthetic training using a triangular stencil, and 1 day later. The experiment was conceptualized to assess three aspects of motor behaviour: (i) motor planning, operationalized as specification of content parameters of the movement as a whole; (ii) motor programming, the specification of spatiotemporal parameters of movement segments; and (iii) the ability to make use of task‐relevant information provided by the training. Patients with ideational apraxia showed signs of impaired motor planning: they had difficulty in selecting the body parts to be moved, and movement concept and configurational aspects were deficient. The kinaesthetic sensorimotor training given seemed not adequate to reduce behavioural deficits. Kinematic peculiarities of patients with ideomotor apraxia can be understood as deficits in programming movement elements. Submovements were more segmented, showed irregularities as well as additional, not‐requested elements. Their impairments could be reduced by task‐specific sensorimotor training. Patients suffering from visuoconstructive apraxia after right brain damage might have difficulties in making use of new sensorimotor information relevant for spatial‐motor aspects, as suggested by training‐induced behavioural impairment with a severely constructional apraxic patient.</jats:p>",

Of primary interest to managers and users of MRP is the benefits that can be derived from using the MRP technology. While the literature abounds with MRP implementation studies, there is a dearth of research that examines the determinants of specific MRP benefits. Knowledge of the determinants would enable MRP managers and users to concentrate on key areas to achieve benefits that match their company goals.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper identifies the organisational, implementational, and technological variables that affect specific MRP benefits as reported by Singapore manufacturing companies in the most extensive MRP survey ever conducted in Singapore. Using Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE), an advanced statistical modeling technique that increases the model fit by approximating the optimal transformations for the dependent and independent variables, the regression models developed reveal more accurate relationships compared to those in previous MRP studies.</jats:p><jats:p>Our findings offer several novel and valuable insights into the MRP benefit‐determinant relationship. The major finding is that determinant variables such as data accuracy, people support, degree of integration, and company size affect benefits in a nonlinear fashion. Data accuracy was found to be critical in affecting operational efficiency, customer service, and interdepartmental coordination benefits. Another finding suggests that when people support and data accuracy degenerate to a critical level, users might still derive increased benefits by resorting to secondary sources to accomplish their work. Users should strive for a high degree of integration to achieve full operational efficiency and coordination benefits. Partial integration does not appear to provide significant improvements. We also found that increasing company size has a positive, followed by a negative impact on operational efficiency. Lastly, our findings suggest that the pattern of technical complaints can be an indicator of system usage and interdepartmental coordination. Our findings have important implications for managers and users of MRP.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Empirical and theoretical analyses based on observed patterns of incidence of AIDS and tuberculosis, on rates of poverty, and on statistics describing a ‘Markov infection’ driven by the ‘commuting field’ around Manhattan, strongly suggest that urban and suburban epicenters within a twenty-four-county metropolitan region, covering eighteen million people and more than 7600 square miles, may be significantly and increasingly linked to outlying affluent areas through a process driven by fundamental social, geographic, and economic structures. AIDS and TB rates outside the epicenter of New York City are found to display similar patterns of spread in space and time, and have been strongly coupled to rates of infection within it for some time, a circumstance which will continue and may intensify as ‘heterosexual AIDS’ becomes more predominant and as multiple drug-resistant forms of TB evolve within disintegrating inner city minority communities. The work reported here, involving a relatively large area and a high population, strongly contradicts the findings of a recent National Research Council report on the social impact of AIDS, which, based on a severely constrained scale of analysis, concluded that the concentration of disease within marginalized urban communities implies many geographical areas and strata of the population are and will remain untouched by the AIDS epidemic. The hyperconcentration of infection in urban epicenters is not containment, but rather a principal force behind further spread. This work, in part a technology transfer from community ecology of ideas on refugia and reservoirs, adds significantly to a growing body of evidence which strongly implies that wide-spread urban reform is an essential, but largely unrecognized, component for any realistic national programs to control AIDS, multiple-drug-resistant TB, and other infectious diseases. </jats:p>",
