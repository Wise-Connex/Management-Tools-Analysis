This paper describes new developments within the public service of Canada to improve the quality of human resource planning and to ensure its complete integration into the corporate planning system.</jats:p><jats:p>Planning for human resources must start at the top when the major objectives of the organization are set. These objectives establish the framework within which the strategic plan and the operational plans must fit. The author describes the factors which contribute to the complexity of developing and administering human resource planning in the public service and the principal elements of the Policy and Expenditure Management System (PEMS). Then, a new system is described which is proposed to be introduced in the federal public service in 1985. Its purpose is the integration of human resource planning, including career planning, training and development, hiring and action to redress under‐representation, with operational and strategic planning. Its tools include attrition forecasting, environmental scanning, models of the organization under varying circumstances, occupational analysis and job definition, and it must be supported by data bases of considerable quality.</jats:p><jats:p>In the Canadian public service it has become evident that the roles of the manager and personnel specialist must change if human resource planning is to work. Managers must be trained and able to foresee the human resource implications of their strategic and operational plans. The specialist must be able to provide information and analytical support needed to turn implications into valid, realistic long‐ and short‐term plans for the achievement of corporate goals through development and appointment of appropriate resources. Human resource plans must emanate from the basic objective of the organization set by the Chief Executive Officer and the executive team; they will succeed in direct proportion to the level of commitment and support awarded to them by Chief Executive Officers and the extent to which managers are held accountable for them.</jats:p>",

This can only be done under the guidance of crucial policy-decisions on the accessibility targets desired, cost limits, and criteria for the distribution of (access) benefits such as the degree of social/spatial equity.

A survey of the literature from both nations indicates that participatory programs have a mixed record of accomplishments, according to the local political culture and structures, the attitudes of public officials and political leaders, and the aims and skills of the participants. At its best, citizen participation has provided certain benefits to local planning systems, but it has displayed such limitations that it must continue to take place within a framework of responsive and accountable representation. </jats:p>",

Therefore, it is surprising to find, after all this emphasis on the identification and satisfaction of customer needs and the necessity for planning and strategy, that few organizations have found a way to link future planning with marketing planning and strategy. Futuristics is the science or art of anticipating and planning for the future. In most firms, strategy is still developed for less than a threeyear period. There are only a small number of companies that have been able to link planning with the development of strategy in a time frame of more than five years. These firms have come to realize that: Business decisions have grown more complex as a result of a changing marketing environment, The only way to ensure profitability and survival is to provide an organizational structure that can develop long‐range planning.</jats:p>",

Plans emphasize current products and strategic business units (SBUs) and sort them into three categories: “grow,” “hold,” and “harvest.” The firm attempts to gain market share in the “grow” products or SBUs, and attempts to maintain market share for those labeled “hold.” Yet, for the products or SBUs under the harvest category, the firm gives up market share to gain cash to finance the “grow” businesses.

This state of affairs seriously affected the teaching of the Business Policy course within the Department of Business Studies: lack of local contextual information on how general managers play their roles as architects of company strategies, organization builders and leaders, robbed the teaching of Business Policy of its fundamental background. It was the purpose of this survey to start the ball rolling by way of establishing meaningful relations between industry and the department of Business Studies, so as to facilitate the exchange of ideas and viewpoints. Such relations will, hopefully, develop the atmosphere of trust which will be crucial in enabling scholars to develop management cases, based on the Zimbabwean socio-politico-economic environments. These cases will be used by students in the University and by others who run executive development programmes all over Zimbabwe.

To date, 20 classes of landform association are used to map, at 1:250,000, shore types for about one-third of the Arctic islands. Applications can include the rating of sensitivity to oil spills, logistics planning for monitoring and emergency measures, site selection and habitat assessment, etc. Examples of shore classes and evaluations are given.</jats:p>",

It has also found applications in product management, corporate strategy and more recently in attempting to develop a range of customer opportunities. It is possible that, in all the applications except the last‐named, the control of the portfolio rests principally with the “portfolio manager”. In the case of customers, recent work in demonstrating the interactive nature of supplier/customer relationships, particularly in industrial markets, may mean that the portfolio concept has to be modified if it is to find application there. The challenge to marketing management is the planned deployment of resources between different customer opportunities and the adoption of a portfolio approach implies that a company is seeking a balance of customers in an attempt to achieve its objectives, both in the short and longer term. It is the question of how this should be achieved to which this article is addressed, firstly, by tracing the development and application of portfolio theory, secondly by applying it to the industrial market using a three‐dimensional approach to identifying customer groups and, finally, by presenting the data obtained from an empirical study of a supplier and a range of customers in the telecommunications industry, demonstrating that the supplier should adopt an interaction approach to the selection of target customer opportunities.</jats:p>",

These processes have led to the loss of the authority of the divine referential, of the authenticity of the object, and of our sense of historicity. To recover the power of meaning (beyond mere instrumentality, nostalgic sentimentality, and power emblems), the communicative relations between spatial structure and human life-praxis must be investigated critically. Only then will architecture and urban space contribute their hermencutic power to the retrieval of the human potential to appropriate the world, The powers of architecture consist in (a) its ability to influence the spatiotemporal articulation of life-praxis and thus to condition one's fundamental relations to the world and to oneself, and (b) its ability to communicate to us about this world and ourselves, In a period of retrenchment and loss of nerve, the relative functional indifference of architecture can become an opening through which one may glimpse more humanizing relations with others and with nature, More specifically, the powers of architecture can be deployed to implant counterpractices resisting depowerment in the societal context, As part of economic praxis, architecture and urban structure can make possible and can communicate self-determined multiple uses and the life-values involved in them; as part of politics, architecture can encourage direct communication and local action and negotiation; as part of culture, architectural and urban space can open paths to reconstruct and reexperience the fundamental qualities of nature and the societal other, and it can allow us to reappropriate the world by enabling us to open up a horizon for new values and corresponding new forms of praxis; and finally, against the city conceived as an abstract network of instrumentalized powers, architecture could pose the open and articulated city, in which proximity with relatedness safeguards what cities historically have contributed to life-praxis and in which space is a liberative significant component. </jats:p>",

Many programming approaches have been proposed to improve material requirements planning procedures. However, most of them appear to be too complex for large manufacturing problems.

Several simple heuristics for integrated requirements planning systems are suggested. Several heuristics are offered to balance the load in the systems and several procedures presented to adjust the planned requirements so that the system will execute more smoothly. An industrial example supports the adequacy of the general concepts provided in this research. Results are presented which demonstrate the adequacy of these heuristics, and illustrate the ease of implementing the procedures into any MRP system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most work in urban modelling to date has proceeded under the tacit assumption that there are mechanisms of urban process, either deterministic or nondeterministic, which can be approximately described in models. An alternative hypothesis is suggested proposing that urban process as such cannot be objectively specified, although urban system behaviour may appear deterministic or nondeterministic according to the frame of representation chosen by the modeller. Besides explaining the paradox of the relative predictive success of certain simple deterministic models in the face of more sophisticated theories stressing the impossibility of deterministic evolution, this hypothesis also throws light on the reason why physical analogies may work in the field of urban studies. This latter point is elaborated by means of an illustration involving the ‘Brussels paradigm’ of bifurcation. It is suggested that predictive ability and success of analogical transfer both depend on the presence in a model of a ‘logical prior’, a formal element which, being nonempirical, maintains its validity, not only in repeated applications across time and space, but also in transfers from one substantive field to another. </jats:p>",

Second, I critically appraise the problématique of marxist work on gentrification, emphasising its lack of attention to the interrelationships of employment restructuring and changes in the reproduction of labour power. From this, I argue that gentrification is a ‘chaotic concept’ and that the processes and elements it comprises need to be thought through again. I begin tills task by attempting to disaggregate the concept with empirical reference to North American metropolitan inner cities, I hypothesise that the upsurge of renovation activity by and for moderate-income households and those with so-called alternative life-styles is produced by the interaction of changes in production and reproduction. Further research is needed in this area. Finally, I explore the possibility that such ‘marginal gentrifiers' and those they now displace may have similar needs that could be met by different kinds of neighbourhood revitalisation. </jats:p>",

Further, the subjects receiving the written DA generated more strategic alternatives than those receiving the written DIS or E.

In this study, regional development policies in Israel arc examined, and a new approach to such activity is proposed—a synthesis between the centralized top-down system and the complementary system of participation from below.

A spatially expanded model is specified to examine areal variations in the use of the US Food Stamp Program. The regionally varying response of Program participation to conditions of economic need and the presence of minorities appears to reflect different degrees of urbanism among sections of the country. Regional variations in the response of Program participation to benefit levels appear to be a result of different intergovernmental arrangements between the federal government and state welfare agencies. The often-made assumption of spatial stability in the influence of welfare determinants is not justified, given the regional complexities within which the welfare system operates in the United States of America. </jats:p>",

A benefit tax/transfer scheme is designed to reconcile environmental and regional policy goals, to meet environmental targets, and at the same time to maintain the differential levels of financial assistance allocated to the dissimilar types of regions. Since the goals and instruments of environmental and regional policy are overlapping to an ever-greater extent, such problems (and perhaps such solutions) should be seriously considered in order to avoid inconsistencies between closely related environmental and regional policies. </jats:p>",

The present databank contains data based on grids and polygonal data. The system is being applied, but not restricted, to the Dutch 1971 Census data and the 1978 land use data. It allows the mapping of grid variables against a topographic background. Areas of interest can be investigated in detail by zooming in on a window drawn on the graphics screen by the user.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the authors are concerned with the application of conjoint measurement models to predict consumer choice of shopping centres. First, conjoint measurement models are discussed in the context of the development of spatial shopping-models. Next, the conceptual framework underlying the model and conjoint measurement are discussed. The second part of the paper describes an application of the methodology. Conjoint measurement is used to estimate consumer utility functions and a multivariate logit model as an approximation of the unit multivariate normal distribution is used to predict the probability that a consumer will choose a particular shopping centre. The results indicate that the methodology offers a potentially valuable approach to the modelling of spatial shopping-behaviour. </jats:p>",

Various formulations of the transportation model in linear programming are used to evaluate the scheme by the Manchester Education Authority for linking primary schools to particular secondary schools. A second analysis adopts similar methods to evaluate recent proposals by the Authority to reduce both the number and the size of secondary schools in the city. It is found that many of the distance inefficiencies present in the Authority's allocation system occur because its mechanisms top-up the intakes of suburban schools at the expense of school intakes in the inner city. </jats:p>",

The allocation of level of development for each site along the Mediterranean coastline was checked in relation to resource sensitivity. The plan includes regulations for the protection of natural and manmade resources, for maximum visitor capacity, for beach services and accommodation, for the location of offshore structures and for development at river mouths,</jats:p>",

In particular, the importance of equality of electorates among constituencies relative to other criteria employed in the redistricting procedure has been raised. The court findings emphasised the subjectivity inherent at all stages of the redistricting process at present. We describe procedures, combining data analysis and mapping, whereby such subjectivity can be restricted to the later stages, so allowing the final decisions to be made in a fully informed context. Such procedures raise issues relating to public contributions to the various stages of the redistricting process, and a speculative final section to the paper extends the ideas that we outline. </jats:p>",
