      "abstract": "<jats:title>Summary</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A resurvey of a rural district in Thailand, of about 70,000 population, was conducted after a family-planning program had been in operation for eight months in order to ascertain indications of effectiveness of the program. Both the “before” and “after” surveys employed a 25 percent simple random, though non-overlapping, sample of married women 20–44 years of age whose husbands were living. The only difference in design and execution was the inclusion in the resurvey of questions about the action program. Barring one or two exceptions, the characteristics of the two population samples were so similar that differences in knowledge, attitudes, and practices could be regarded as effects of the program.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The action program not only made itself widely known in the district, it also evoked a highly favorable appraisal, to such an extent that nine of every ten women thought the program should be extended over the entire kingdom. Motivation to engage in family planning increased perceptibly. A substantial proportion (23 percent) of the women who formerly disapproved of the practice changed their attitudes to approval, mainly because they had become convinced of the harmlessness and the utility of fertility control. Less than 3 percent of the former approvers had become negative.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The proportion of women who claimed some kind of knowledge about contraceptive methods more than doubled during the eight months of the program's operation. More impressive, however, was the change in actual use of methods, which rose from 1 to 21 percent of the eligible women (women who were not pregnant, subfecund, or sterilized). Another 16 percent, in the resurvey, planned to begin use of contraceptives in the near future, in most instances after a current pregnancy. The frequency of acceptance of family planning practice exceeded the expected frequency among women who were approaching or had attained the “ideal” number of children (4.0 children). High-parity women 40 or more years of age seldom accepted clinical assistance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is commonplace that population growth looms large in the\n      complex of problems associated with economic and social development.\n      This is true in Pakis¬tan as elsewhere and the Third Five Year Plan has\n      faced_up squarely to (his issue. This article will review the population\n      policy contained in the Plan and its support¬ing documents. Our analysis\n      is sometimes critical but never unsympathetic. The planners in Pakistan\n      have recognized the importance of population control and the present\n      Plan devotes considerable resources to this goal. For this they deserve\n      only praise. However, critical analysis of the Family Planning Scheme by\n      interest¬ed but objective observers may still serve a useful purpose.\n      The Plan's basic statement on population deserves to be quoted to start\n      our analysis: The size of population, estimated at 112 million for 1965,\n      is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of about 2.6 per cent\n      during the Perspective Plan (1965-1985). With the planned improvement in\n      health facilities and nutri¬tional standards, the mortality rate is\n      likely to decline fairly rapidly. Unless it is checked by a fall in the\n      fertility rate, the population growth rate could easily be pushed beyond\n      3 per cent per annum. If this happens, population will double itself by\n      1985. Such an increase would defeat any attempts to raise per capita\n      incomes by a significant amount. One of the basic assump¬tions of the\n      present projections is that the rate of growth of population will\n      decline after 1975 owing to a decrease in the fertility rate. In other\n      words, it is assumed that declining fertility will more than offset\n      declining mortal¬ity. The population in 1985 is thus projected at 187\n      million. A vigorous and broadly based programme of family planning is,\n      therefore, an intergral part of the strategy for the Perspective Plan\n      [44, p. 24].</jats:p>"

Based on this experience, the Central Family Planning Institute has initiated a large-scale communication action research project in Meerut district in North India where the impact of direct mailing on specific groups is being studied further.

In a recent study, such a situation was examined and solved using the method of “composite noise rating,” developed some years ago for application to the aircraft- and airport-noise problems. By this technique, the various parameters relating to the source, the transmission path, and the exposed community are combined to produce contours of equal subjective exposure around the source area. By correlating these contours with different levels of community reaction, we may then differentiate between land areas which will or will not be suited to future development.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The C.E.G.B. operates 230 power stations of various ages and output capacities representing a total capital investment of some £2400 million. The steam conditions, sizes of generating units, and complexity of the installed plant reflect the stage of technical development at the time of their construction. These factors influence the cost of production at individual stations as also do the nature and cost of fuel. </jats:p><jats:p> The economic level of maintenance at each station is thus dependent upon a number of factors and must generally be established locally. This places an obligation on the maintenance engineer to collect and consider economic, in addition to technical, data. Also, service experience must be fed back to the design engineer so that future plant designs may be improved. Unless a simple and effective control system is employed paper work can become an intolerable burden. </jats:p><jats:p> Power station maintenance can be broadly divided between: </jats:p><jats:p> (1) work which can only be carried out while a generating unit is shut down; (2) work which can be carried out with the main plant on load. </jats:p><jats:p> The first category has received the greatest attention, since the cost of keeping a modern generator out of service can be substantial. Planning of this work is based on Critical Path Analysis techniques which are now well known and widely practised. </jats:p><jats:p> However, the day-to-day maintenance of a large variety of auxiliary plant also presents a heavy planning burden upon the maintenance department. The basic minimum requirements for the effective local control of this work have been examined, while the most economic methods of: </jats:p><jats:p> (a) co-ordinating maintenance in a number of stations in the best national interest, and (b) ensuring that service experience is fed back to design engineers </jats:p><jats:p> are also receiving attention. </jats:p>",
