In so doing, he investigates tensions between the government's overall economic policy and its land-use planning policy, particularly that involving development of large-format stores. The influence of interest groups, through processes of research and lobbying of government departments, is traced. The author then discusses the extent to which seemingly incompatible positions have been resolved in interdepartmental discussion, involving typical âBritish compromisesâ. One result of this process appears to be the formulation of ambiguous and unclear policies, which may have to be modified again in the near future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As exurban development spreads throughout fire-prone areas of the western United States, the threat of wildfire to life and property grows. To address this threat, wildfire mitigation, such as mechanical thinning, often takes place in areas close to exurban development. This study demonstrates the utility of spatially explicit dynamic models to understand better where the wildlandâurban interface is, how it might change in the future, and how this might affect which land would be prioritized for mechanical thinning. Specifically, a model (WHAMED) is presented that forecasts the prioritized locations for future mechanical thinning as a function of projected exurban development in the montane zone of Boulder County, CO. To predict exurban development, WHAMED uses a cellular automata model with rules derived from statistical models of historical exurban development. The study tests two general sets of criteria for prioritizing mechanical thinning, that of the Community Protection Zone and the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003. The study shows that under any forecast of exurban development, and under either set of criteria, prioritized land for mechanical thinning is set to expand primarily on US Forest Service land. Methodologically, the study illustrates the importance of making variability transparent and of providing multiple methods of model validation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent pursuit of regional planning agendas in England has coincided with a strong push from the government towards an evidence-based, information-intensive approach to policymaking, with the increased use of statistical indicators to inform and evaluate emerging regional policies. In this paper we aim to examine the monitoring arrangements, and the way indicators are used, in the development and monitoring of key regional strategies (Regional Planning Guidance, Regional Economic Strategies). The idea is to examine indicator usage and monitoring arrangements from a politicalâmanagerial perspective through an exploration of the realm of rationalâtechnocratic activities of monitoring within the institutional environment of Regional Planning Bodies and Regional Development Agencies. Following a review of academic literature, we explore the regional intelligence management and the monitoring arrangements of the two key regional strategies in each of the English regions. The analysis is based on documentary and web-based reviews as well as in-depth interviews conducted with key regional actors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The network metaphor in the analysis of urban and territorial cases has a long tradition, especially in transportation or land-use planning and economic geography. More recently, urban design has brought its contribution by means of the âspace syntaxâ methodology. All these approaches-though under different terms like âaccessibilityâ, âproximityâ, âintegrationâ âconnectivityâ, âcostâ, or âeffortâ-focus on the idea that some places (or streets) are more important than others because they are more central. The study of centrality in complex systems, however, originated in other scientific areas, namely in structural sociology, well before its use in urban studies; moreover, as a structural property of the system, centrality has never been extensively investigated metrically in geographic networks as it has been topologically in a wide range of other relational networks such as social, biological, or technological ones. After a previous work on some structural properties of the primal graph representation of urban street networks, in this paper we provide an in-depth investigation of centrality in the primal approach as compared with the dual one. We introduce multiple centrality assessment (MCA), a methodology for geographic network analysis, which is defined and implemented on four 1-square-mile urban street systems. MCA provides a different perspective from space syntax in that: (1) it is based on primal, rather than dual, street graphs; (2) it works within a metric, rather than topological, framework; (3) it investigates a plurality of peer centrality indices rather than a single index. We show that, in the MCA primal approach, much more than in the dual approach, some centrality indices nicely capture the âskeletonâ of the urban structure that impacts so much on spatial cognition and collective behaviours. Moreover, the distributions of centrality in self-organized cities are different from those in planned cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the major challenges to providing full-rate digital subscriber line (xDSL) access to residential customers in rural or remote locations is the use of existing copper infrastructure. First, copper is not particularly good for moving high frequencies over extended distances. Second, much of the existing copper in the United States is of diminished quality. Third, digital loop carriers, bridge taps, load coils, and ambient interference negatively impact data transmission. Because of these problems, the geographic reach of xDSL services is limited. To combat this limitation, providers are installing remote digital subscriber line access multiplexers (RDSLAMs). RDSLAMs seek to maximise the amount of demand covered for a peripheral neighborhood and aggregate this data traffic onto a fiber optic connection for transport back to the central office (CO) for switching. Although this is more feasible than constructing a new CO, acquiring the rights of way and installing fiber is expensive. The purpose of this paper is to examine the complexities associated with locating RDSLAMs in a competitive telecommunications market through the use of an integer programming modelâthe remote access hierarchical assignment problemâand a geographic information system. Pertinent policy and technology related issues in residential broadband deployment and their impacts on high-speed services such as xDSL are highlighted. </jats:p>",

The model has been reformulated on the basis of the individual SLA modle and it is intended to make the notions of macroacquisition and planning acquisition operational. It has two linguistic factors (input and output) and two sociolinguistic factors (language identity and language marketability) that can be managed or manipulated in status planning. The two sociolinguistic factors, language identity and marketability, appear to have played the most significant roles in language spread, variation, and attitudes in status planning, at least in China. This model also serves as the basis to make a theoretical distinction between interference and borrowing, a distinction that helps to sort out the consequences of language contact and provides indexes of language shift under status planning conditions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade there has been an upsurge in governmental interest in evidence-based policy, coupled with an emphasis on a utilitarian view of research. This emphasis on research for the benefit of policy has contributed to the highly selective nature of the construction of knowledge on urban environments, with those areas that have not been regarded as a policy problem failing to attract investment in research. Strategic waste planning has been a striking example of such policy areas. The first part of this paper provides an overview of the disjuncture between policy and evidence and argues that the lack of research has contributed to the underdevelopment of intellectual capital in this field. This overview sets the context for the second and third parts of the paper which draw on a case study of recent attempts to improve the evidence base for urban waste policy at the regional level. The author examines the interface between the technical and the social dimensions of knowledge production and knowledge transfer as experienced in the work of the Regional Technical Advisory Body (RTAB) in the North West of England. By drawing on five basic tenets of technical rationality, the author provides a critical analysis of how the NWRTAB's adoption of a predominantly technical â rational approach affected the dynamics of knowledge â policy interplay. It is argued that technical rationality proved to be inadequate in satisfying some of the rhetorical expectations that are often associated with it, and which help perpetuate its continuing popularity among professionals and policymakers. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The political and spatial dimensions of US metropolitan areas are eminently interconnected through a recurring cycle of fragmentation and sprawl. In this paper we demonstrate the cycle at work by refining a land-use model developed in a previous paper and applying it to a national dataset of metropolitan counties. The recursive simultaneous-equations model is structured around five-year intervals, and enables us to observe how the political landscape (urban development patterns) at time t â 5 affects spatial outcomes (municipal fragmentation) at time t. The results suggest that regulatory failure may bear as much fault for urban sprawl as the more commonly cited market failures, and that it may therefore be worthwhile to shift the focus of the sprawl/antisprawl debate from its physical to its political dimensions. Future research should focus on identifying the systematic nature of sprawl and, as an extension, the various policy levers that may be used to mitigate its negative consequences. The paper improves on previous research in four key ways: by describing the underlying theory in greater detail; by rounding out the recursive relationship; by enriching the set of interdependent variables; and by expanding the geographic scope of the model. Its primary contribution is to deepen the pool of empirical evidence linking political structure to patterns of growth and change in US metropolitan regions. </jats:p>",

It is opening the way to a wide range of applications, collectively referred to as location-based services (LBS), that are primarily aimed at individual users. However, if deployed to retrieve aggregated data in cities, LBS could become a powerful tool for urban analysis. In this paper we aim to review and introduce the potential of this technology to the urban planning community. In addition, we present the âMobile Landscapes' project: an application in the metropolitan area of Milan, Italy, based on the geographical mapping of cell phone usage at different times of the day. The results enable a graphic representation of the intensity of urban activities and their evolution through space and time. Finally, a number of future applications are discussed and their potential for urban studies and planning is assessed. </jats:p>",

Clinical outsourcing enables tertiary health centers to meet the expectations of service timeliness and provides good opportunities to collaborate with other health care providers. However, outsourcing may result in dependence and loss of control for the tertiary health centers. Other parties involved in clinical outsourcing such as local partners, patients, and payers may also encounter potential risks as well as enjoy benefits in an outsourcing arrangement.

In this paper a comprehensive methodology for analysing accessibility impacts and accessibility benefits, which is based on location-based and utility-based accessibility measures within an integrated land-use-transport interaction modelling framework, is described and applied in a case study. The case study examines the accessibility benefits and related user benefits of intensive mixed-use strategies aimed at increasing the density and diversity of activities around railway stations for the Randstad area of the Netherlands for the 1996â2030 period. A heavy concentration of activities near railway stations is shown to result in decreasing marginal returns for public-transport users and disbenefits for car users. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In this paper we present pddl+, a planning domain description language for modelling mixed discrete-continuous planning domains. We describe the syntax and modelling style of pddl+, showing that the language makes convenient the modelling of complex time-dependent effects. We provide a formal semantics for pddl+ by mapping planning instances into constructs of hybrid automata. Using the syntax of HAs as our semantic model we construct a semantic mapping to labelled transition systems to complete the formal interpretation of pddl+ planning instances. An advantage of building a mapping from pddl+ to HA theory is that it forms a bridge between the Planning and Real Time Systems research communities. One consequence is that we can expect to make use of some of the theoretical properties of HAs. For example, for a restricted class of HAs the Reachability problem (which is equivalent to Plan Existence) is decidable. pddl+ provides an alternative to the continuous durative action model of pddl2.1, adding a more flexible and robust model of time-dependent behaviour.</jats:p>"

It took place between 2001 and 2002, and consisted of a crossâsectional survey designed to compare the quality of health care on offer at a newly created health centre with that provided by the district hospital's outpatient department. The hypothesis to be tested was that the health centre offered better quality of care. A comprehensive quality of care evaluation framework was designed. The concept of <jats:italic>patient enablement</jats:italic> was incorporated into the study's assessment of health care delivery outcomes. The results did not provide conclusive evidence that the care offered at the health centre was better than the care on offer at the hospital OPD. The reasons for these unexpected findings are discussed in depth. They are related to the limited understanding amongst local health workers of the organisational changes introduced by the District Health Executive (DHE), together with a (European) cultural bias in the quality of care model under test. An important lesson of this study is that the notion of <jats:italic>enablement</jats:italic>, notwithstanding the need to put into context the tools used to measure it, was considered by the DHE as relevant in the organisation and evaluation of health care.

Many works have been the results of hybriddesignsâthe syntheses between European and Siamese artistic styles, either in painting, sculpture, costume,music, literature, performing art, cuisine, or architecture. One of the best known examples is the Chakri MahaPrasat.

Population and industrial growth leading to an immense increase in the number and intricacy of sources of water pollution, climate change, and shifts in weather patterns towards extremes are just some of the factors that are making the option to reuse water more attractive throughout the world, and necessary for some regions. While there are numerous obstacles to be overcome in planning water reuse schemes, the costs of treatment and distribution are two of the most important factors that need to be considered at the planning level. An additional factor, the selection of end users, also can have significant impact. New decision support software for integrated water reuse, called WTRNet, has been developed, which incorporates these three factors in determining the least-cost design alternatives. A brief overview of existing tools relevant to water reuse is presented, followed by a thorough description of key software features. An application of the WTRNet software on a case study involving a small number of potential industrial users of reclaimed water is presented, which demonstrates the importance of utilizing formal optimisation in determining the most promising design alternatives.</jats:p>",

Despite widespread belief that West Bengal has been a pioneer in democratic decentralization in India, this paper argues that the dominance of one political party and its hierarchical structure has thwarted the scope for effective bottom-up metropolitan planning in Kolkata. It questions the unchallenged dominance of partisan political actors in public decision making at the local level, and suggests a greater role for non-partisan and locally based civil society organizations. The case also demonstrates that these processes call for expertise in communicative people-centred practices and for shrewd strategic actors who understand the power dynamics of the wider political context. It highlights the need for policy makers to focus on the design of institutional mechanisms that allow for a more bottom-up approach to metropolitan planning through which to address common problems and define shared objectives. </jats:p>",

A conflict between the two trends often surfaces in the form of hypercorrection, that is, incorrect substitution of the retroflexed initials for the corresponding dental initials (<jats:italic>zâ, câ, sâ</jats:italic>). Labov (1973) observed a trend toward a similar kind of phonetic hypercorrection in New York City English, mainly among the upwardly-aspiring lower middle class. Though this group is also especially susceptible to the use of hypercorrect forms in Taiwan, people in all walks of life with all levels of education have been observed to use hypercorrect forms. This demonstrates, first, that the textbook forms of the retroflexed vs. dental initials are learned imperfectly by a wide spectrum of speakers of Taiwan Mandarin; second, that the retroflexed initials retain a certain cachet in marking speech as more prestigious and authoritative; and third, that retroflexion, hypercorrect or otherwise, has for many people taken on the function of simply marking formal discourse, in addition to its use for disambiguation, highlighting, and stylistic effect.</jats:p>",

It therefore provides an interesting window on the development of planning in goalâdirected behavior. This study investigated 2âyearâoldsâ and 3âyearâoldsâ hand use in picking up and subsequently using a tool for displacing a targetâobject towards a specified goal location. The children had to use a stick (Experiment 1; N = 41 in total) or a cane (hooked stick) that was lying in varying starting orientations (Experiment 2; N = 32 in total). Age differences were found in the way goalârelated information in combination with toolârelated information influenced the choice of which hand to use in different phases of the task. A view on action planning is developed as a dynamic actionâselection process for which actions to take. This process integrates factors that are internal to the child's action system (e.g. motor preferences and dexterity) with external (i.e. sensory) sources of information.</jats:p>",

Specifically, the case examines the approach of the owners and managers of the businesses to planning for the Web sites, gathering the expertise required for their effective implementation, what features they put on the Web sites, how they measured success, and how they promoted the Web sites. Many of the businesses faced similar problems to small businesses in general when setting up and maintaining their Web sites. Some of these problems could have been overcome with more effective planning, but overall the majority of the businesses seemed to build capacity by trial and error. While taking longer, it appeared that the owners and managers had a more sophisticated knowledge of Web sites and their use than when they commenced. However, there still seemed to be a need for further knowledge in how to measure the success of the Web site and how to balance the booking of rooms across manual booking, online booking through the Web site, or online booking through third party operators.

We first determine the optimal variety, product location, and inventory decisions under static substitution, and show that the optimal assortment consists of products equally spaced out such that there is no substitution among them regardless of the distribution of consumer preferences. The optimal solution can be such that some customers prefer not to buy any product in the assortment, and such that the most popular product is not offered. We then obtain bounds on profit when customers dynamically substitute, using the static substitution for the lower bound, and a retailer-controlled substitution for the upper bound. We thus define two heuristics to solve the problem under dynamic substitution and numerically evaluate their performance. This analysis shows the value of modeling dynamic substitution and identifies conditions in which the static substitution solution serves as a good approximation. </jats:p>",

Therefore, great attention is focused on the development of geologically complicated oilfields. The Vankorskoye project that has major priority for Rosneft is a striking example of such fields.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>To increase efficiency of oilfields development within Rosneft Oil Company a unified design system including all stages of development â from development prospects to development monitoring â has been created. Within the system a multidiscipline workgroup has been created for designing Vankorskoye oilfield development, which is able to react actively on new information and to adapt flexibly design solutions to the new conditions. Main results of this group are design solutions considering the application of new technologies and increasing sufficiently the development efficiency.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>New technologies of field prospecting and modeling are widely applied in development of the Vankorskoye oilfield that allows designing field development and decreasing risks. An application of spectrum-velocity forecasting technology at the stage of seismic data interpretation allows defining exactly reservoir properties with a small number of exploration wells. Techniques of geo-stochastic modeling reflecting heterogeneity of reservoir properties are used in geological model building.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>New technologies allowing increasing oil recovery, optimizing oil production rates and decreasing field development costs are used in project design. Use of gas reinjection provides decrease of environmental damage, maintenance of reservoir pressure and increase of oil recovery. Modern techniques of well construction and operation (horizontal wells with long horizontal length and intelligent completions) significantly increase field development effectiveness.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The article below describes base elements of the Vankorskoye oilfield design system, as well as the work results and prospective of sharing experience for other Company's field development.</jats:p>",

Despite the fact that the computer-controlled agents in such games often possess abilities far in advance of the limits imposed on human participants, competent players are capable of easily beating their artificial opponents, suggesting that approaches based on the analysis and imitation of human play may produce superior agents, in terms of both performance and believability.In this article, we describe our work in imitating the observed goal-oriented behaviors of a human player, based on concepts from data analysis and reinforcement learning. Since even the most intelligent artificial agent will be quickly identified as such if it is observed to move in a robotic manner, we also seek to incorporate mechanisms that will result in believably human-like motion. We then present some illustrative examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model. Finally, we discuss future work in this field.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Queer geographers have been surprisingly slow to engage with the global turn that has existed for some time in queer studies outside the discipline. This is beginning to change but the range of sites addressed is limited largely to Euro-American ones. This paper considers the ways in which queer geographers might contribute to already-existing debates over the relationship between the âWestâ and the ânon-Westâ in global queer studies. The paper departs from Larry Knopp and Michael Brown's âQueer diffusionsâ, a paper that appeared in a special issue of Society and Space (2003, 21 461â477). Though they limit themselves to the national scale of the United States, their argument that we should destigmatize places and identities cast as âbackwardâ has obvious relevance at the global scale. Its consistencies and inconsistencies with various strands of argument within the global queer-studies literature reveal that geographers might also learn from the spatial nuance developed in these debates. Specifically, this literature review concludes that we must also destigmatize those places and identities that are cast as âforwardâ if queer globalization is to truly be decentered. </jats:p>",

Planning and scheduling approach for a continuous and dynamic decision process where decisions have to be made before all data are available is proposed. As an inspiration we have a real world problem originating from a complex pharmaceutical enterprise. The approach is based on a hierarchically structured moving horizon framework. On each level optimization models are proposed to provide support for the relevant decisions. The levels differ regarding the time scope, aggregation, update rate and availability of data at the time applied. The framework receives input data piece by piece and has to make decisions with only a partial knowledge of the required input. Solution procedures have been developed and the optimization models have been validated and tested with data from the real world problem. The solution procedures were able to obtain good solutions within acceptable computational times. It is believed that multiscale dynamic online procedures are more suitable than traditional offline procedures for many specific types of planning and scheduling problems found in the process industry and should be explored further.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Haptic devices for computers and video-game consoles aim to reproduce touch and to engage the user with âforce feedbackâ. Although physical touch is often associated with proximity and intimacy, technologies of touch can reproduce such sensations over a distance, allowing intricate and detailed operations to be conducted through a network such as the Internet. The âvirtual handshakeâ between Boston and London in 2002 is given as an example. This paper is therefore a critical investigation into some technologies of touch, leading to observations about the sociospatial framework in which this technological touching takes place. Haptic devices have now become routinely included with video-game consoles, and have started to be used in computer-aided design and manufacture, medical simulation, and even the cybersex industry. The implications of these new technologies are enormous, as they remould the humanâcomputer interface from being primarily audiovisual to being more truly multisensory, and thereby enhance the sense of âpresenceâ or immersion. But the main thrust of this paper is the development of ideas of presence over a large distance, and how this is enhanced by the sense of touch. By using the results of empirical research, including interviews with key figures in haptics research and engineering and personal experience of some of the haptic technologies available, I build up a picture of how âpresenceâ, âcopresenceâ, and âimmersionâ, themselves paradoxically intangible properties, are guiding the design, marketing, and application of haptic devices, and the engendering and engineering of a set of feelings of interacting with virtual objects, across a range of distances. </jats:p>",

In the first part of the paper I outline an expansion of the more-than-rational or less-than-rational into three modalities: affect, feeling, and emotion. From this basis I question an assumption in the literature on affect that the emergence and movement of affect enable the multiplication of forms of life because they takes place âin excessâ. In the second part of the paper I exemplify an alternative, more melancholy account through a description of the emergence of hope and hopefulness in two cases in which recorded music is used by individuals to âfeel betterâ. Emergent from disruptions in various forms of diminishment, hopefulness moves bodies into contact with an âoutsideâ. Becoming and being hopeful raise a set of issues for a theory of affect because of, rather than despite, the sense of tragedy that is intimate with how hope heralds the affective and emotive as always ânot-yet becomeâ. The conclusion, therefore, draws the two parts of the paper together by reflecting on the implications of thinking from hope for both a theory of affect and an affective cultural politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>By design, the range of beam directions in conventional radiosurgery are constrained to an isocentric array. However, the recent introduction of robotic radiosurgery dramatically increases the flexibility of targeting, and as a consequence, beams need be neither coplanar nor isocentric. Such a nonisocentric design permits a large number of distinct beam directions to be used in one single treatment. These major technical differences provide an opportunity to improve upon the wellâestablished principles for treatment planning used with GammaKnife or LINAC radiosurgery. With this objective in mind, our group has developed over the past decade an inverse planning tool for robotic radiosurgery. This system first computes a set of beam directions, and then during an optimization step, weights each individual beam. Optimization begins with a feasibility query, the answer to which is derived through linear programming. This approach offers the advantage of completeness and avoids local optima. Final beam selection is based on heuristics. In this report we present and evaluate a new strategy for utilizing the advantages of linear programming to improve beam selection. Starting from an initial solution, a heuristically determined set of beams is added to the optimization problem, while beams with zero weight are removed. This process is repeated to sample a set of beams much larger compared with typical optimization. Experimental results indicate that the planning approach efficiently finds acceptable plans and that resampling can further improve its efficiency.</jats:p>",

Constraints to utilization at the service level are identified based on service observations and the perspectives of providers. Service statistics, clinic observations, and focus group discussions were used to compare utilization patterns and to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the different models of provision. Findings show that FP provision is still fragmented and âtechno-patriarchalâ in Jordan. Strengthening coordination mechanisms between the service sectors and addressing men are important strategies to increase FP utilization that are transferable to other countries of the Middle East and the developing world. </jats:p>",

Using a system dynamics approach and relying on the concept of <jats:italic>viability loops</jats:italic>, the paper aims to illustrate a practical implementation of sustainable development with an urban water system as an example. It argues that planning for sustainable development should be âprocessâbasedâ â rather than âfixedâgoalâ â oriented. Unlike the traditional approaches of strategy making to set fixed goals related to either supplyâside and/or demandâside management, it is argued that triggering a social learning process with full involvement of all stakeholders and planners in the process would be the most suitable strategy for sustainable development. To this end, backcasting is recommended as a suitable tool and the process of model building is regarded as a means of learning rather than forecasting.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>âBaan Mankongâ program is presently the governmentâs major policy in urban poor housingdevelopment in Thailand, undertaken by Community Organization Development Institute (CODI). The mainstrategy of the program is to upgrade living conditions, secure tenure as well as community capacitybuilding through communitiesâ self-proposed projects and people participation process. This paper isderived from the experience in the development practice of a case study on Bang Bua canal in Bangkok,where on both sides of the waterfront are presently illegally occupied by a group of neighborhoods. Thesecommunities have invaded into public land and settled their housing trespassing into the canal. Theprevious attempts by the local authority to evict the waterfront urban poor communities, for being thecause of water pollutions and other associated environmental problems, had led to a long conflict in urbandevelopment.&#x0D;\nTo achieve the goals of sustainable community development, it is vital that not only the coreproblems of urban poor housing such as the lack of secure tenure and development funding are systematicallysolved, but also to evoke residentsâ participation and people awareness on environment related issues.The Bang Boa community development scheme under the âBaan ManKongâ program is expected to highlightinitial guidelines and strategies for urban poor settlementsâ redevelopment of other waterfront area ofBangkok. This paper will discuss how the process of community capacity building and empowerment havebeen undertaken and will be initiated, particularly in establishing various networks as a significantdevelopment strategy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the central issues in the theory of speech community is whether speech community is a naturally-existing entity or a research construct without any restricted empirical basis. The issue is attacked here by way of a language survey. The survey was on language-choice behavior in public places, conducted in the city of Nanjing in 2002. The survey results show: (a) Nanjing residentsâ verbal behavior exhibits a specific order of social convention and the urban population thus makes up an effective body of social communication. (b) The ordered behavior reflects a community-wide evaluative system that governs linguistic heterogeneity. (c) The thinning-out of the regularity among the individualsâ behaviors is typically found both in the spatial and the temporal marginals of the urban population. The study supports the hypothesis that a speech community is a naturally-existing entity. An attitudinal-behavioral and impactal unity is the core of such existence. With the approach taken here, a speech community can be discovered with certain well-defined empirical procedures. The wider significance invoked is that the organizational system of speakers is an important linguistic system alongside the other linguistic systems.</jats:p>",

Within this context, the author explores what it might mean to develop an interdisciplinary understanding of technical change. Questioning conventional accounts, he develops a sociotechnical perspective on competing energy knowledges and contexts of design, development, and consumption. It is argued that energy research and policy-making for the built environment is underpinned by a common understanding of technical change, which fails to take account of the contextual nature of energy-related choice. Describing cultural, organisational, and commercial factors shaping technological innovation, the author explores how more-or-less energy-efficient choices influencing urban development are made in response to changing opportunities and practices which sometimes favor energy efficiency, sometimes not. The author draws upon sociological accounts of technical change and illustrates both a sociotechnical perspective on energy and buildings and a key role for sociologists in the field of architecture, energy, and environmental studies. </jats:p>",

This fundamental network structure and the large size of such systems makes the complex network approach an attractive model for growth dynamics modeling. In this paper the authors propose the use of complex networks for geographical modeling and demonstrate how such an application can be combined with a cellular model to produce output that is consistent with large-scale regularities such as power laws and fractality. Complex networks can provide a stringent framework for growth dynamic modeling where concepts from, for example, spatial interaction models and multiplicative growth models, can be combined with the flexible representation of land and behaviour found in cellular automata and agent-based models. In addition, there exists a large body of theory for the analysis of complex networks that have direct applications in urban geographic problems. The intended use of such models is twofold: (1) to address the problem of how the empirically observed hierarchical structure of settlements can be explained as a stationary property of a stochastic evolutionary process rather than as equilibrium points in a dynamic process, and, (2) to improve the predictive quality of applied urban modeling. </jats:p>",

Concepts and concomitant interpretations of place as a âsituatedâ and contemplative experience have to date received much cultural geographical attention. In increasingly mobile societies, however, I argue that mobility should be central to the ways in which we conceptualise and understand the character and meanings of different spaces and places. Although geographical exploration has begun concerning the politics and power relations of the mobile subject, little attention has yet been paid to the experiences and spatialities generative of the body-subject in mobility. Whilst acknowledging the importance of representations in directing action, I strategically emphasise and explore the notion that we create meaning and belong in a place according to how we are in a place. Drawing upon ethnographic work with racing and touring cyclists in the United Kingdom and France, I consider how the conjoining of the person and bike and the resulting embodied rhythms and kinaesthetic sensations of the movement of cycling are constitutive of the character and meanings of particular places. Ultimately, in this paper I point to an understanding of the kinaesthetic and sensuous experiences of the hybrid subjectâobject (in this instance âthe cyclistâ) as fundamental in rethinking how people live, feel, and ultimately create meaningful spatial relations. </jats:p>",

Focusing on the linguistic practice of a group of <jats:italic>waiqi</jats:italic> professionals in Beijing, this study compares their speech with that of professionals working for state-owned enterprises. Both groups are natives of Beijing. Based on quantitative analysis of three Beijing Mandarin features and a tone feature revealing an influence from non-Mainland Mandarin varieties, the study shows that the <jats:italic>waiqi</jats:italic> group overwhelmingly used the non-local features much more frequently than the state professionals. It is argued that the <jats:italic>waiqi</jats:italic> professionalsâ speech cannot be described simply as speaking a more standard variety of Putonghua. They are constructing a cosmopolitan Mandarin style through selectively combining features from both regional and global sources. This non-local style of Mandarin does not strictly conform to the standard of Putonghua. Explanations for the differential practice of the two groups are sought through differences in the linguistic markets in which they participate. This study demonstrates that the traditional territorially-based approach to sociolinguistic variation on a localâstandard dimension is inadequate in examining practices that employ linguistic resources from both local and supra-local sources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Theoretical treatments of new industry formation within the inner city emphasise the significance of agglomeration economies, social relations, institutional factors, and representational (semiotic) features of the landscape. The author contributes to a larger understanding of generative processes of industrial innovation in the urban core by demonstrating through theoretical synthesis and case studies, the critical roles played by âmaterialâ (or physical) space and form. First, Soja's idea of the âindustry-shaping power of spatialityâ in the new economic spaces of the post-Fordist metropolis is interpreted as the boundedness of inner-city space, the intimacy of urban landscapes, and the integrity of urban form. Second, the cogency of Helbrecht's injunction regarding the complementarity of abstractive and âconcreteâ dimensions of urban space in knowledge-based industry clusters is demonstrated by case-study references situated in London, Vancouver, and Singapore. Third, the author draws on Markus's incisive analysis of principal building types (and âdurable taxonomies' of building function and social meaning) to link historic and contemporary industrialisation processes, including the comingling of production, housing, and consumption. The nexus of theoretical integration lies in the articulation of three-dimensional industrial landscapes comprised of physical space and form as well as symbolic constructs. </jats:p>",

In this article we focus on the planning of community intervention trials in which <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> communities (for example, medical practices, worksites, or villages) are to be randomly allocated to each of an intervention and a control group, and fixed cohorts of <jats:italic>m</jats:italic> individuals enrolled in each community prior to randomization. Formulas to determine <jats:italic>k</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>m</jats:italic> may be obtained by adjusting standard sample size formulas to account for the intracluster correlation coefficient <jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic>. In the presence of individualâlevel attrition however, observed cohort sizes are likely to vary. We show that conventional approaches of accounting for potential attrition, such as dividing standard sample size formulas by the anticipated followâup rate <jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic> or using the average anticipated cohort size <jats:italic>m</jats:italic><jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic>, may, respectively, overestimate or underestimate the required sample size when cluster followâup rates are highly variable, and <jats:italic>m</jats:italic> or <jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic> are large. We present new sample size estimation formulas for the comparison of two means or two proportions, which appropriately account for variation among cluster followâup rates. These formulas are derived by specifying a model for the binary missingness indicators under the populationâaveraged approach, assuming an exchangeable intracluster correlation coefficient, denoted by <jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic>. To aid in the planning of future trials, we recommend that estimates for <jats:italic>Ï</jats:italic> be reported in published community intervention trials.

Our approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner. We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning problems with large plan length.</jats:p>",

This study investigates the functional distribution of Putonghua and Cantonese as spoken by immigrant residents in Guangdong Province. Results from questionnaire surveys in Guangzhou and Shenzhen reveal different patterns of Putonghua-dialect bilingualism in the two cities. For immigrants in Guangzhou, Putonghua and the local dialect (Cantonese) have comparable strength and functions, whereas in Shenzhen, Putonghua serves as the dominant language. To account for the differences between Guangzhou and Shenzhen, we argue that demographic structure is an important factor regulating the standard-dialect relationship in the urban communities of China. We propose that social network features correlate with the respective instrumental and integrative values of the languages or dialects in contact. This research provides insights into the dynamic interaction between the standard language and dialects in multilingual societies that are experiencing profound social changes.</jats:p>",

Based on research in a gentrified neighbourhood of Bristol, England, I argue that for gentrifier households with children the need to reproduce (institutional) cultural capital in the education market can conflict with the desire to display (objectified) cultural capital via the gentrification aesthetic in the inner-urban neighbourhood. In the trade-off between aesthetics and education, education wins, resulting in a much more conventional suburban, exurban housing/neighbourhood career for onward-moving gentrifiers. I conclude by suggesting a more diffuse, provincial form of gentrification in which the different strands of cultural capital can conflict in urban space (rather than the smooth reproduction of cultural capital assumed by the idea of a gentrification habitus). It confirms that the intergenerational reproduction of an (urban) new middle class is likely to be confined to large metropolitan areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Xining, the capital of Qinghai province, is an especially valuable location for observing the spread and influence of Standard Chinese, or <jats:italic>Putonghua</jats:italic>, for at least two reasons. First, the dialectâs history of contact with non-Sinitic languages, mostly Tibetan and Mongolic languages, created an older linguistic stratum that differs markedly from other Mandarin dialects, indeed with most all Chinese dialects, in clearly identifiable ways, so that comparisons between Standard Chinese and variations within the Xining dialect reflect unambiguous cases of standard <jats:italic>cum</jats:italic> dialect language contact. Second, the demographic history of the region, including large-scale migrations of Chinese-speaking people from other provinces, created a socio-cultural context in which the promotion of Standard Chinese would likely find fertile ground. \n</jats:p>\n                    <jats:p>\n\tThis paper will show that the combination of these two factors has created a situation in which the old Xining dialect is rapidly disappearing. In its place is not Standard Chinese, per se, but an <jats:italic>interdialect</jats:italic>, a compromise variety stripped of the most obvious dialect features but clearly distinct from Standard Chinese. The differences will be shown to exist in the phonology, lexicon and syntax of the dialect and that the more highly educated members of the community are leading the changes toward the New Xining dialect. While Standard Chinese is shown to have been a powerful force in the creation the New Xining dialect, it has not completely replaced the local dialect.</jats:p>",

A mission-adaptable hybrid route-planning algorithm based on flight roadmap is proposed, which combines existing global and local methods (Dijkstra algorithm, SAS and D*) into a two-level framework. The environment information and constraints for UAV are integrated into the procedure of building flight roadmap and searching for routes. The route-planning algorithm utilizes domain-specific knowledge and operates in real time with near-optimal solution quality, which is important to uncertain and adversarial environment. Other planners do not provide all of the functionality, namely real-time planning and replanning, near-optimal solution quality, and the ability to model complex 3D constraints. </jats:p>",

The (u)-variation in the Town Speech of Lishui is a change-in-progress toward Putonghua and is unevenly distributed in the phonological and the lexical systems and across age cohorts. As a change-in-progress, it redistributes high-back vowels and glides in some word classes. While no Putonghua phonemes have been imported, the changes have been going through a series of approximations toward the phonological system of Putonghua. Consequently, the changes are transforming the Town Speech of Lishui into a localized Putonghua, or more precisely, a Putonghua-like dialect. It is an intermediate variety closer to the original local dialect than to Putonghua on a scale with Putonghua on one extreme and the dialect on the other.</jats:p>",

His core concern is with changes in advertising practice in creative advertising agencies. He explores how creativity is manifest as âpeer regardâ, and shows how there has been a shift of power between creative and media-buying functions as a result of the demise of the commission system in the last twenty-five years. A changing governance of advertising practice, that involves both formal regulation and economic governance in and across firms, is highlighted. It is argued that creativity is better seen as an effect rather than as a cause of particular advertising practices. The author concludes that the âcreative governanceâ of the UK advertising industry has favoured a close-knit and colocated community of firms. A future change in this form of governance could change this pattern. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I critique the notion of âthe creative class' and the fuzzy causal logic about its relationship to urban growth. I argue that in the creative class, occupations that exhibit distinctive spatial and political proclivities are bunched together, purely on the basis of educational attainment, and with little demonstrable relationship to creativity. I use a case study of artists, one element of the purported creative class, to probe this phenomenon, demonstrating that the formation, location, urban impact, and politics of this occupation are much more complex and distinctive than has been suggested previously. The spatial distribution of artists is a function of semiautonomous personal migration decisions, local nurturing of artists in dedicated spaces and organizations, and the locus of artist-employing firms. Artists have very high rates of self-employment, boosting regional growth by providing import-substituting consumption activities for residents and through direct export of their work. Their contribution to attracting high-tech activity is ambiguousâcausality may work in the opposite direction. Artists play multiple roles in an urban economyâsome progressive, some problematic. I argue that artists as a group make important, positive contributions to the diversity and vitality of cities, and their agendas cannot be conflated with neoliberal urban political regimes. I show the potential for artists as a political force to lead in social and urban transformation and the implausibility of their common cause with other members of Florida's âcreative classâ, such as scientists, engineers, managers, and lawyers. </jats:p>",

I emphasise how scale, as an issue in environmental governance, is not merely an independent variable causing specific outcomes; rather, it is negotiable, allowing actors to adopt different strategies in order to pursue their varying agendas. I show how a local struggle can be represented as a global struggle: a case study concerning the domestic use of natural gas in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, and how this metamorphosed into a struggle about what was the appropriate geographical scale at which the environmental and climatic consequences of a natural gas project should be assessed, is described. By framing climate change as a global issue, local actors were able to portray the natural gas project as environmentally friendly. I argue that the realisation of this natural gas project should be seen in light of how strategies over scaleâwhich were developed in the debateâfitted with climate discourses institutionalised in national policy and politics. </jats:p>",

The focus is primarily on antecedent influences on owner-managers such as education and prior experience. Data are drawn from a survey of the owner-managers of small metalworking firms in Sheffield, UK. Around half the sample of owner-managers possess a business plan. Antecedent influences on owner-managers showing a significant association with the possession of a business plan include an above average level of education, previous work experience in a large firm immediately before setting up their firm and running firms in sectors outside their previous experience. Not surprisingly, possession of a business plan showed a positive association with those owner-managers with a growth orientation. It is concluded that owner-manager characteristics can be important in explaining the presence/absence of a business plan within the small firm. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I explore embodiment and spatiality by discussing the example of a conflict between competing representations of landscapes and the female body in the two volumes of the comic books La FrontiÃ¨re Invisible. This piece of fiction deals specifically and explicitly with a reassessment of the gaze in the production of knowledge by examining maps as tools of power, control, and colonisation. However, despite an apparent desire to reject reactionary political approaches, the authors seem to associate the naturalised (female) body with (naturalised) geopolitical scenarios by fetishising the body through complex discursive transcodings between women and nature. In contrast to this, in this paper I suggest considering the body as a site and space of resistance to (political) imposition. Drawing on both feminist geography and critical geopolitics, I suggest an alternative way of considering the consequences of embodied geographies for cartography by examining the links between naturalised bodies and naturalised political boundaries. The main argument is that the body, by posing an uncontrollable, unpredictable threat to regular ways of producing cartographic knowledge, entails the possibility of a counterstrategic reinscription of spatial discourses and the creation of an alternative, more ethical cartography. This ethical cartography is rooted in embodied recalcitrance to imposed inscriptions associated with hegemonic positions. </jats:p>",

By categorizing SMEs according to their annual revenues, total number of employees, and number of family members employed within the firm, significant differences were found between larger and smaller firms. Consistent with extant literature, the findings reveal that most family members join the firm for altruistic reasons. Issues related to family relationships were rated as significantly more important in firms in which more family members were employed within the firm. Moreover, for firms with less than US$1m in revenues, a high priority is placed on selecting a successor who possesses strong sales and marketing skills. The findings show that regardless of their size, it is important for family-owned businesses to develop a formal plan for succession, communicate the identity of the successor, and provide training/mentoring to the incumbent CEO. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This descriptive, exploratory, retrospective survey, carried out at a family planning service, aimed to identify nursing phenomena during nursing visits according to the ICNP, Beta version 2. Data were collected based on 52 records of nursing visits, realized from October 2001 to December 2002. To conduct the cross-mapping process, all identified nursing phenomena were joined, organized and compared according to the ICNP's terms. Of the 51 identified nursing phenomena/diagnoses, 46 (90.2%) showed exact and partial concordance. The identified nursing phenomena can be used to assist nurses to provide care for clients in family planning services. The ICNP showed to be a comprehensive program, although some terms need to be reviewed and others enhanced. However, considering that it is an international classification applicable to several countries, the mapping process and cross-references were very satisfactory.</jats:p>",

In this paper I explore Speakers' Corner as a discursive space, seeking to find a way through its polarised representations as a free space of serious and important deliberation and as a degraded trivial public sphere. I do so through the concept of the comedic public, which loosely draws upon Bakhtin's work on the carnival but also differs in significant ways. At the same time I argue that Speakers' Corner should not just be read or evaluated in terms of the public speech generated; the Corner is also a place in which communities form and strangers interact with others in counternormative ways. I argue that these social dimensions, often neglected, constitute an important aspect of the Corner's practice; they are also dimensions generated and incited by the Corner's discursive qualities. To illustrate this further I consider the expression of emotion, engagement in combative debate, and heckling as junctures through which social interactions arise. Finally, I suggest the social dimension to the Corner might productively be understood through the concept of the commons. </jats:p>",

They discuss whether institutional change has had a beneficial or adverse effect, and whether any of the current structures provides a more effective framework for policy development and implementation. The results suggest that, although the sites share a broadly common set of objectives, there are differences in devolved responsibilities and in the extent to which various policy options are within the control of the bodies charged with transport policy delivery. The existence of several tiers of government, coupled with the many interactions required between these public sector bodies and the predominantly private sector public transport operators, appears to create extra transactional barriers and impedes the implementation of the most effective measures for cutting congestion. There is, however, a compelling argument for the presence of an overarching tier of government to organise travel over a spatial scale compatible with that of major commuter patterns. The extent to which such arrangements currently appear to work is a function of the range of powers and the funding levels afforded to the coordinating organisation.</jats:p>",

A conceptual framework from evolutionary economics is applied, and emphasis is placed on situating the social and spatial characteristics of production, innovation, and knowledge creation within the selection environment or context created by Tanzania's economic liberalization process. Specifically, the cognitive, innovative, and organizational competencies and capabilities of furniture makers are detailed and their emergence is explained in relation to the markets, institutions, and spatial structures concomitant with neoliberal reform. The findings demonstrate how liberalization has, in effect, selected for less creative, smaller scale, and largely informal manufacturers while discouraging the development of more innovative, larger scale, and/or formal firms. In a broad sense, the results of the study raise questions about whether or not structural adjustment policies are contributing to the development of viable, globally oriented, and indigenously owned manufacturing firms in African cities like Mwanza. </jats:p>",

Although there are many algorithms for automatically solving resource allocation problems, it is often the case that human judgment is also required. Also, while there are software user interfaces to support decision-making for specific resource allocation problems, most of them serve more as organizational charts than as decision-support systems, and most of them become increasingly difficult to use as the size of the resource allocation problem increases. This paper discusses the design and rationale for RAPS and gives several examples of how RAPS can be adapted to a specific resource allocation problems. </jats:p>",

The circulation of Hours is found both to increase economic activity and to preserve local skills which might have been lost if the currency system had not been in place. He concludes, however, that the Hours model should not be adopted as policy without modifications, because the design suffers from poor incentive structures which depress circulation and limit the positive effects of the currency on LED. </jats:p>",

Phase I of the study looked at the state of end of life in various hospitals, and phase II implemented a nurse-facilitated intervention designed to improve advance care planning, patient-physician communication, and the dying process. The observational phase found poor quality of care at the end of life and the intervention failed to improve the targeted outcomes. The negative findings brought public attention to the need to improve care for the dying and spawned a wealth of additional research on decision-making at the end of life. In the decade since SUPPORT, researchers have defined the attributes of a âgood death,â addressed the role of advance directives in advance care planning, and studied the use of surrogate decision-making at the end of life. This rekindled the discussion on advance care planning and challenged health care providers to design more flexible approaches to end of life care. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since the Nobi Earthquake of 1891, seismology, engineering seismology, earthquake engineering, structural engineering and sciences which are related to the phenomena of earthquakes were developed in Japan. Especially pure sciences and engineering made great advances individually. However, actual earthquake damage has not yet ceased to exist, and this damage leads the loss of a great number of human lives. Undeveloped areas and not so important buildings have always suffered these disasters. From worldwise point of view, there is a more serious problem, sometimes more than 10,000 people are killed by an earthquake. The importance of these sciences and engineering is centered in such problems, but at their present stage of development they can not solve these serious problems. Primarily because there are many problems regarding the economical conditions.  Seismic microzoning has its purpose in the solution of the serious problems mentioned above. The results of seismic microzoning should cover whole areas and structures, for saving money in construction and to minimize the danger posed to human life. Also seismic microzoning works are related to the disaster prevention programs of various areas.  Investigations into seismic microzoning are mainly related to the field of engineering seismology and its applications are in earthquake engineering, but fundamental investigations and applications can not be separated, they are closely related. Thus difficult points still exist, because only a few investigators have interests in the applications of seismic microzoning work. In this paper the author tries to explain the theoretical background and the technique of application of seismic microzoning which developed mainly in Japan. But these theoretical and technical results are not yet completed, and the facts interpreted from the strong motion seismograms and other results of field observations will correct these conclusions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The food industry has always been a major generator of economic activity in the Greater Toronto Area. However, recently the innovative and creative elements of the industry have changed. Since the mid-1990s, the fastest growing segment within the industry has been small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The specialty, ethnic, and organic SMEs (hereinafter referred to as the âcreative-foodâ industry) appear to be particularly innovative as they respond to consumer demand for local, fresh, ethnic, and fusion cuisine. On the basis of sixty-five interviews with food producers, processors, restaurateurs, food media, non-government organizations, government, and private sector agencies, it is suggested that this creative-food sector is thriving despite existing public policies that bias toward large-scale, industrialized agri-food firms in the region. As such, a disconnect currently exists between, on the one hand, the traditional agrifood paradigm that the government regulatory environment is promoting and, on the other hand, the locally consumer-driven food cluster that is emerging. Public policies of multiculturalism and education have done more to facilitate the unprecedented growth of this creative subcomponent of the food sector than have explicit public food-policy initiatives. However, there is still room for policy initiatives that advance the development of this dynamic sector, especially in the area of supportive infrastructure, access to health-based ethnically appropriate food, food education, and fair labour standards. Contrary to a widely held view, the creative-food industry is not just about promoting exclusive foods for the pleasure of urban elite. Rather, it offers an opportunity for a more socially inclusive and sustainable urban development model. The findings also have implications for multilevel governance in cluster formation and policy, future research on food, as well as for theories on innovation, urban creativity, and governance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Systematic conservation planning is widely considered the most effective approach for designing protected area and other ecological networks. However, many conservation practitioners still ignore these methods and we suggest that five perceived limitations of this process are affecting its uptake. These perceptions are that (1) systematic conservation planning software is difficult to use, (2) the process requires extensive biodiversity distribution data, (3) setting targets for representing conservation features is not possible, (4) the advantages of systematic conservation planning do not outweigh the costs, and (5) the resulting plans often identify unsuitable areas. Here we review these perceived limitations and argue they are all misplaced, although we recognize difficulties in the target setting process. We then illustrate the value of systematic conservation planning to practitioners using a case study that describes a low-cost exercise from Maputaland, South Africa. This preliminary conservation assessment measured the effectiveness of the existing reserve system and identified a number of candidate areas that could be the focus of community- or privately-run ecotourism or game ranching ventures. Our results also emphasize both the importance of producing planning outputs that are specifically targeted for stakeholders, and the role of systematic conservation planning in providing a framework for integrating different provincial, national and transnational conservation initiatives.</jats:p>",

The Communist Partyâled government had been implementing a homeâgrown programme of decentralized planning since 1996 until it lost power to the Congress Partyâled conservative coalition in 2001. In the context of the accelerated structural adjustment and liberalization of the national government, the new government amended its predecessor's programme with a reduced role for the state bureaucratic and political actors in mobilizing people for planning and implementing projects at the local level. Based on a comparative analysis, the authors argue that the new programme has so far not been successful as regards enabling marginalized groups such as the indigenous communities to resist exclusion and move out of their states of deprivation. The study also shows that the withdrawal of the state from the social and economic sectors has adversely affected these groups.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

In this paper we contribute to the onâgoing discussion of the issue with two aspects. (1) Theoretical consideration of the water cycle on land reveals the importance of correct identification of independent and dependent terms in the water budget with respect to changing vegetation cover for understanding possible scenarios of water cycle change under anthropogenic impact. An important controlling influence of the vegetation cover is imposed on the outgoing fluxes of atmospheric moisture <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>â</jats:italic></jats:sup> from land to the ocean, which is maximized in deserts and minimized in forested areas, while the dependencies for runoff and precipitation are the reverse. (2) Physical mechanisms allowing for efficient water retention and minimization of <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>â</jats:italic></jats:sup> in forest ecosystems are investigated. Atmospheric water vapor is in aerostatic equilibrium when the temperature lapse rate is less than <jats:italic>G</jats:italic> = 1.9 K km<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup> and out of aerostatic equilibrium when <jats:italic>G</jats:italic> &gt; 1.9 K km<jats:sup>â1</jats:sup>. In the former case there are no vertical upward fluxes of the evaporated water. It is shown that the temperature profiles developed under the closed canopies of natural forests keep water vapor in aerostatic equilibrium preventing soil moisture loss to <jats:italic>A</jats:italic><jats:sup><jats:italic>â</jats:italic></jats:sup>, in contrast to the situation in open ecosystems like grasslands. The analyzed evidence allows one to conclude that an intensive water cycle on land can be restored after recovery of natural, selfâsustained closed canopy ecosystems on continentâwide areas.</jats:p>",

We argue that the cross-sectoral transfer of skills occurs differently depending on national contexts, such as the social legitimacy and strength of preexisting industries, the socioeconomic status of entrepreneurs or pioneer firms in an emerging industry, and the sociocultural cohesiveness between the preexisting and emerging industries. Each country draws on a different set of creative resources, which results in a unique trajectory. Whereas Japan's video-game industry emerged out of corporate sponsorships in arcades, toys, and consumer electronics industries and drew skills from the comic book and animated-film sectors, the video-game industry in the United States evolved from arcades and personal computers. In the United Kingdom the video-game industry developed bottom-up, through a process of skills formation in the youth culture of âbedroom coders' that nurtured self-taught programmers in their teens throughout the country. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Ecological restoration is an expanding area of science and practice for environmental management, but in urban environments in particular its challenge to traditional approaches can be limited because it is seen primarily as a scientific or practical endeavour rather than a social one. In general, the restoration literature, especially on the scientific and practitioner side, suffers from the âdeficit modelâ of public understanding and from a lack of fit between the expectations of restoration and policy workers and those of their local publics. Hence, the irony is that, although restorationists may be seen as radical in scientific and policy terms because of their challenge to the tradition of the âhard engineeringâ of rivers, they are not radical in social science terms because they fail to challenge the tradition of technocratic environmental management of the public and its deficit model. We illustrate this through two examples of urban river restoration in Englandâthe Alt and the Brentâand we conclude by suggesting how such problems might be addressed through more emphasis on and integration of social science within research and practical agendas for urban restoration projects. </jats:p>",

The issue is often complicated by the fact that there is a lack of a set of commonly recognized criteria with which to define regional Putonghua varieties vis-Ã -vis the regional dialects. Against this background, I have in this paper first argued for taking Putonghua education and use at, after and beyond school as the bench mark for defining regional Putonghua varieties either as true linguistic entities or as conceptual entities. Then, I have examined how question words and interrogative particles in the Chengdu dialect find their way into the Putonghua spoken in that region, attributing the lexical interference to two main factors. The first is the salient linguistic connection between Putonghua and the Chengdu dialect, which is a major southwestern branch of Mandarin, and the second is more sociolinguistically related, being associated with the speakerâs education and need for using Putonghua at work against a rapidly developing regional economy.</jats:p>",

Although these models have been generated from anecdotal reports and observations of planning in operational settings, a systematic comparison of doctrinal and applied planning processes has never been documented. This paper describes the work done to empirically compare the planning process, as applied during a Brigade (Bde) level exercise, to the doctrinal Canadian Forces (CF) Operations Planning Process (OPP). Observers followed and documented all of the planning functions performed by the Plans Cell using the CFOPP as a reference. Results suggest that: the applied OPP, conducted at Brigade level, is a hybrid and abbreviated version of doctrinal OPP; planning is somewhat opportunistic and involves intuitive decision making by both the Commander and Staff; the OPP, as applied in an operational setting, is a command-driven process, and, intuitive decision making at individual (lower) function level by Staff member could lead to more efficient planning. These results have implications for doctrine, training, OPP process refinement and planning tool design. </jats:p>",

A comparison of post-campaign findings among family planning clients suggests that the intervention as a whole had a positive effect on client participation, specifically the number of clients who prepared questions to ask the service provider prior to a family planning visit in the past year. Multivariate analyses showed that the âSmart Cardâ intervention and elements of the âSahabatâ (Friend) mass media campaign were positively associated with clients' preparation of questions and question asking behavior during family planning consultations, indicating that a combined community education and mass-media approach can improve client communication with providers and improve the quality of family planning counseling. </jats:p>",

The planning task required 36 dyads, working under low or high time-pressure conditions, to combine information and to produce a written plan.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The inherent limitation of most solid freeform fabrication (SFF) is deposition in the form of layers. The set-up rather than the geometry and the material composition of the part becomes more important in the process planning. For a functionally graded material (FGM), the desired composition variation is of infinitesimal order; however, the finite size of the deposition head and the molten pool allows for a quantized volume addition. Such artificial imposition of the process for the desired geometric morphology and the functional gradience of materials limit the accuracy of the part. The frequent variation in the material composition is yet another issue associated with the fabrication of FGMs. The suitability of a field can be attributed to the desired material distribution of a part. Different features of the field are identified and used as the input for process planning. The mathematical morphing of the material gradience allows a smooth variation of the material composition across the geometry of the part during deposition. The paper describes a framework for FGM representation using maxel, process planning, and implementation of the fabrication of geometries, and the control of the material composition. The experimental results for the suggested approach are described. </jats:p>",

An essential part of dimensional management is the full integration of the measurement activity into the production process. This paper describes the use of aggregate product modelling (APM) as a vehicle for integrating dimensional management into complex product design and assembly. The motivation for this is to improve process flow and reduce process integration risk at major assembly levels. Based on the analysis of an aerospace assembly application, the link between the measurement strategy and the final measurement uncertainty of the finished product has been demonstrated clearly. Error propagation models were developed to quantify the contribution of different error sources to the overall uncertainty of a specific assembly process. The analysis could be applied to the whole design, assembly, and measurement process in a closed loop fashion, clearly illustrating the use of dimensional management in practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Results are presented comparing Monte Carlo (MC) calculations for dynamic IMRT treatments of tumors in the sinus region with Eclipse treatment planning system dose calculations, and ion chamber measurements. The EGS4nrc MC code, BEAMnrc, was commissioned to simulate a Varian 21Ex Linac for both open and IMRT fields. The accuracy of the simulation for IMRT plans was evaluated using a head phantom by comparing MC, Eclipse, TLD results, and ion chamber in solid water phantom measurements. The MC code was then used to simulate dose distributions for five patients who were treated using dynamic IMRT for tumors in the sinus region. The results were compared with absolute and relative dose distributions calculated using Eclipse (pencil beam, modified-Batho inhomogeneity correction). Absolute dose differences were also compared with ion chamber results. Comparison of the doses calculated on the head phantom using MC, compared with Eclipse, ion chamber, and TLD measurements showed differences of â3.9%, â1.4%, and â2.0%, respectively (MC is colder). Relative dose distributions for the patient plans calculated using MC agreed well with those calculated using Eclipse with respect to targets and critical organs, indicating the modified-Batho correction is adequate. Average agreement for mean absolute target doses between MC and Eclipse was â3.0 Â± 2.3% (1 s.d.). Agreement between ion chamber and Eclipse for these patients was â2.2 Â± 1.9%, compared with 0.2 Â± 2.0% for all head and neck IMRT patients. When Eclipse doses were corrected based on ion chamber results, agreement between MC and Eclipse was â0.7 Â± 2.0%, indicating a small systematic uncertainty in the doses calculated using the treatment planning system for this subset of patients. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The US Navy is funding the development of advanced automation systems to plan and execute unmanned vehicles missions, pushing towards a higher level of autonomy for automated planning systems. With effective systems, the human could play a role of mission manager and automation systems could perform mission planning and execution tasks with limited human involvement. Evaluations of the automation systems currently under development are identifying critical conflicts between human operator expectations and automated planning results. This paper presents a model of this human-automation interaction system and summarizes the resulting system design effort. This model provides a theory explaining the source of conflict between human and automation, and predicts that an ecological approach to display design would reduce that conflict. Based on that prediction, the paper describes initial results of an ecological approach to system analysis and design, intended to improve human-automation interaction for these types of advanced automation systems. </jats:p>",

In addition, the student should be able to reflect on their learning and plan their own development. This article reports on the staff evaluation of the use of a reflective portfolio facilitating the production of highly individualised personal development plans within an existing tutor system. A number of significant issues are highlighted; tutor systems adopting this approach must maintain flexibility for managing student crises when they arise, the difference between appraisal and assessment needs clear definition for both students and tutors, training in basic mentoring skills should be provided for all tutors, tutors should be aware of the difficulties many students experience with reflection and also be alert to the over reflective learner.</jats:p>",

In Experiment 1, three groups of field air traffic controllers (experts, intermediates, novices) were asked to perceive situations that were manipulated by complexity. In Experiment 2, protocol analysis of controllers' situation awareness was performed to extract cognitive strategies as a function of expertise. Then delayed-recall task and interviews on air traffic control plans for the recalled situations were also executed. Results showed that expert controllers concentrate only on several critical features and have their own strategies to reduce mental workloads. </jats:p>",
