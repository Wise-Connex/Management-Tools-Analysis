Liberal reformers do not have the political strength to compel the regimes toward real power sharing agreements. If pacts do become a political imperative, they will have to include the Islamists - the only Arab oppositional groups with the strength to extract real political compromise from the regimes. However, Arab pacts are unlikely to be formed any time soon. Extensive patronage systems and a loyal coercive apparatus keep Arab leaders firmly in control; they do not yet need to share power.\n\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Summary. </jats:bold> This article challenges received thinking relating to the interpretation of Bronze Age finds from the seabed in the waters of north‐western Europe, especially the North Sea and Channel area. Metal objects recovered from the sea are traditionally presumed to be the result of shipwrecks. As such, their interpretation as casual, if unfortunate loss is unquestioned. However, abandoning the shipwreck scenario as a remnant of the ‘sacred <jats:italic>vs </jats:italic>profane’ heuristic, it is suggested that offshore finds could provide insight into deliberate Bronze Age maritime practice, rather than misadventure. Certain patterning in the data of offshore finds, including affinities with hoards on <jats:italic>terra firma</jats:italic>, urges another interpretive framework – that of considering the sea as a place for deposition. This appeared to be the case particularly in regions which experienced an intensity of maritime interaction, such as the Channel area during the later Bronze Age. From this it is hypothesized that rather than being considered <jats:italic>outside</jats:italic> the Bronze Age social realm, the sea, especially in the MBA to earlier LBA in the Channel area, was incorporated into Bronze Age cosmology in similar ways to other zones in the landscape.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Commanders face many challenges in their efforts to control the battlefield. Friction (i.e., sources of delay) in the commander's control system, coupled with the dynamics of the battlefield, requires commanders to act before threatening battlefield events occur. Effective control of the battlefield thus requires accurate predictions. This paper describes the results of a preliminary study concerned with the effect of FeedForward (FF) on the accuracy of predictions in dynamic battle situations. FF, given in the form of expert advice prior to simulated battle, did not reliably improve predictions. Exploratory analyses, however, indicate that FF guided attention to a subset of the task variables important for accurate prediction. Furthermore, FF produced quicker and more decisive victories than practice alone. In conjunction with the positive performance trend for the FF group, these findings indicate that FF facilitates strategy development and may lead to higher levels of Dynamic Decision Making (DDM) performance over time. </jats:p>",

Although additional research is needed, these results likely indicate that SBT is an effective method for training parachute use and emergency procedure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Introduction of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a continuing threat to the pig production sector in the European Union. A scenario tree model was developed to obtain more insight into the main risk factors determining the probability of CSFV introduction (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub>). As this model contains many uncertain input parameters, sensitivity analysis was used to indicate which of these parameters influence model results most. Group screening combined with the statistical techniques of design of experiments and meta‐modeling was applied to detect the most important uncertain input parameters among a total of 257 parameters. The response variable chosen was the annual <jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub> into the Netherlands. Only 128 scenario calculations were needed to specify the final meta‐model. A consecutive one‐at‐a‐time sensitivity analysis was performed with the main effects of this meta‐model to explore their impact on the ranking of risk factors contributing most to the annual <jats:italic>P</jats:italic><jats:sub>CSFV</jats:sub>. The results indicated that model outcome is most sensitive to the uncertain input parameters concerning the expected number of classical swine fever epidemics in Germany, Belgium, and the United Kingdom and the probability that CSFV survives in an empty livestock truck traveling over a distance of 0–900 km.</jats:p>",
