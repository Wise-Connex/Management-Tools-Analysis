Proponents claim that it will lead to increased walking and decreased driving. This literature review examines general transportation behavior and trends and the feasibility of the neo-traditional concept to evaluate these claims. Neo-traditional developments will reduce driving significantly only if they provide levels of access that are comparable with existing suburban access. This will require that people live in neo-traditional developments, that a wide range of activities is within walking distance, and that people choose not to drive. The greatest effects can be expected for shopping trips in areas where there are few available shopping centers and for other nonwork trips that can be accomplished on foot in neo-traditional developments. By providing street networks based on a grid, neo-traditional developments may reduce congestion on main streets and may reduce automobile travel times. </jats:p>",

The topics covered are two methods of computer analysis for designing dynamic-kill requirements, the design process, determining the pumping spread, and the pitfalls that a designer faces in planning a dynamic kill.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The dynamic kill of a blowout involves pumping fluid through a conduit (a relief well, snubbing string, or drillstem) to stop the blowout and kill the well. Fig. 1 shows a typical scenario for a relief well. While dynamic kills are sometimes accomplished by pumping down a conduit that is in or snubbed into the well, this application is limited because the bore of the conduit restricts the pumping rate. In a dynamic kill, the blowout well is overcome by the combination of increased hydrostatic and frictional pressures in the wellbore. A common misconception is that the friction component is the major factor. Field results and computer models that account for two-phase flow show that the blowout well can be killed more readily by introducing a high-density fluid into the wellbore instead of pumping at high rates to generate frictional-pressure losses. Therefore, the most cost-effective dynamic-kill solution will generally involve pumping dense mud rather than water or other low-density fluids.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The kill fluid and pumping design must account for many factors, including leakoff, formation fracturing, and reservoir parameters. Many times, these values contain uncertainties that must be dealt with in the analysis. However, the single most important factor is the increase in hydrostatic pressure during the initial kill operations. This occurs as the kill fluid mixes with the blowout effluent and increases hydrostatic pressure in the wellbore. The only exception is the underground blowout. In some underground blowouts a reactive material that generates high frictional pressures can be used to generate a \"friction\" kill instead of a hydrostatic kill. This is true under only a very limited number of underground blowout conditions.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

These planners    cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which    different actions are performed in different circumstances.  In this    paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and    construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a    partial-order contingency planner.  Cassandra uses explicit    decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide    which plan branch to follow.  The decision-steps in a plan result in    subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way    as any other subgoals.  Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of    gathering information from the process of making decisions.  The    explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent    approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid    base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making    procedures.</jats:p>"

An important component of the enhanced plan is a new system to forecast winds and sea stales generated by tropical cyclones (TC) built around known uncertainties in forecasts of cyclones and well proven numerical models of the TC surface wind field and (he spectral wave field. The forecast system provides specification of time histories of the winds and waves at the site for the nominally predicted track as well as the probabilities of exceedance of critical evacuation Thresholds of wind speed and sea slate. The ERP and forecast system were operated throughout the 1995 typhoon season and evaluated at the Yacheng development, which was seriously threatened by 15 tropical cyclones between June and November. The response to these threats in terms of interruption of operations, partial or total evacuation of offshore personnel and average downtime is describe and compared to previous experiencewhich used more conventional forecast services evaluation has shown [he new system to provide significant benefit in terms of safety, efficiency and cost savings.

Faced with such uncertainties offshore operators in areas affected by cyclones (e.g. South China Sea, Gulf of Mexico, NW Australia) typically base response decisions on the predict entry of a tropical cyclone into a large watch circle, without regard to knowledge of quantifiable factors such as the uncertainty and confidence in the predicted track of a particular system, and the surface wind speed and wave height history to be expected at the offshore work site for the specific event, Such a strategy could lead tounnecessary false alarms resulting in risks to life and equipment caused by the evacuation and shutdown process, and costly downtime. Conversely, simple distance-to-site weighted decisions fail to account for the sometimes significant winds and seas generated by large but distant storms or storms with anomalous circulations, such as typhoon-northeast monsoon hybrid events in the South China Sea. This paper describes the development, implementation and performance of an enhanced emergency response plan (ERP) of Arco China Inc. (ACI), whose operations were greatly expanded in 1995 in terms of construction and drilling activities and the number of offshore personnel. The update of the ERP was considered necessary because past experience raised serious concerns that previous practices might entail considerable risk when they lead to unnecessary evacuations of large numbers of offshore personnel.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

I use data from the 1991 Indonesia Demographic and Health Survey to assess the extent of difference among the eventual fertility outcomes of users supplied with similar commodities through varying sources. When the “modern” methods of pill, IUD, and injection are grouped together, the fertility of users supplied with these commodities differs markedly according to their source of supply. I find little evidence for self-selecting of users into supply channels.

This paper proposes an operational way of integrating both risk and attitude toward risk into tactical forest planning. Two sources of risk are considered in the proposed planning method: timber price and level of tree growth. A scenario approach is used to generate a distribution of possible outcomes for alternative forest plans. Each outcome is described by a priority index, which is computed from a priority function. The priority function is estimated by Saaty's eigenvalue technique on the basis of pairwise comparisons between the decision criteria selected by the decision-maker. Estimation of attitude toward risk is based on comparison of the importance given to the worst, the expected, and the best outcomes. The optimum plan is sought with a heuristic algorithm. In optimization, different outcomes are converted to priority indices and weighted in a manner that reflects the attitude of the decision-maker toward risk. The case study indicated that level of risk affects the choice of forest plan. In a situation involving risk, the optimum plan may be different for a risk-avoiding, a risk-neutral, and a risk-seeking decision-maker. For. Sci. 42(2):198-205.</jats:p>",

It has thus become imperative for major seaports to manage their container operations both effec tively and efficiently. We have designed and developed an interactive computer simula tion model to support the logistics planning of container operations. Logistics planning of container operations deals with the assign ment and coordination of port equipments such as quay cranes, prime movers, and yard cranes in the transportation of containers between the ship's bay and the container storage yards. This model provides estimates for port performance indicators such as berth occupancy, ship outputs, and ship turnaround time for various operating strategies in the logistics planning of container operations. The main objective of port management is to reduce the ship turnaround time by optimally utilizing the port resources. Reduced turn around time encourages trade and improves the competitiveness of the port to provide efficient and effective services at low cost. </jats:p>",

Of the estimated 1.6 billion barrels of oil in place in the SOZ, approximately 450 million barrels have been produced since the early 1900s. The SS-1 (Sub Scalez One) is the most significant oil producing sand within the interval referred to at Elk Hills as the SOZ. Gravity drainage and low reservoir pressure in the SS-1 sand have led to a low reservoir decline rate and long productive well lives. This is especially true along the southern flank of the anticlinal structure which comprises the primary trap for oil and gas in the SS-1 sand. Realizing this, recent planning for the SOZ has focused on accelerating recovery and increasing recoverable reserves.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The SS-1 sand at Elk Hills has reservoir characteristics similar to other reservoirs that have been exploited successfully by horizontal well technology.

Proposes a four‐stage research framework that addresses issues in: planning the manufacturing system; planning for an appropriate infrastructure; planning for new relationships with the external environment; and justifying investment in AMT. Assesses the strengths and weaknesses of selected contributions in each stage, and identifies gaps in knowledge where research is needed. The framework devised should help tomorrow’s research build on the past and increase the research’s acceptance by industry, since it draws on both research‐ and practitioner‐based literature along with findings of the field study.</jats:p>",

In a prospective cohort study, the investigator collects information on the expo sure status of the cohort members at the time the study begins, and identifies new cases of disease (or deaths) from that time forward.

The recent recession and resulting state budget shortfalls have forced the state government to recognize that comprehensive planning needs to address economic issues. State guidelines recommend that detailed analyses of regional and local economies be completed as an integral part of all planning initiatives. In response to recommendations advanced in the recent growth management legislation, this study focuses on the geography of economic change in metropolitan regions. This analysis suggests that recent geographic trends in Florida's economic growth are strongly constrained by nodehinterland spillovers and the placement of the state's transportation network. Comprehensive planning efforts must, therefore, consider existing and potential regional economic linkages imposed by directional biases in the transportation network.</jats:p>",

This analysis assumes that VTS services can be offered at various levels with correspondingly changing costs. Secondly, we perform resource allocation analysis; that is, for a given budget and given criterion (e.g. maximize the total benefit), select the optimal zones in which the VTS services should be offered.

It is argued that the definition of local policy, of what the policy process means in particular instances, derives from the complex of economic, social, and political conditions found within and beyond a given locality. In Cardiff, the interaction of broad processes of restructuring with specific local forms has historically diluted Cardiff City Council's function in local economic policy. In turn the recent experience of strategy making has been predicated upon a more wide-ranging and deeper involvement in associated service provision, and the construction of legitimacy around enhanced City Council activity. In particular ways this questions the interrelationship of strategy making and service provision promulgated in notions of strategic enabling. </jats:p>",

The complex ground conditions comprise thick peat and glacial deposits, overlying much faulted and steeply dipping Coal Measures strata. Previous under- ground workings, high groundwater levels and associated sub- surface reservoirs of water are also present. In order to mine and export the coal off-site, extensive infrastructure works were necessary including impounding embankments for lagoons, public road diversions, an overland conveyor with a tunnel and major river crossing, coal screening and crushing plant and a rapid loading bunker with associated railway sidings.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>A lengthy planning history included a public inquiry and a high court heating before coal production commenced in August 1991. Imposed planning constraints required modifica- tions to the development, additional construction works and restoration measures. The combination of the site location, infrastructure requirements and planning constraints gave rise to the need for a wide range of ancillary civil engineering works; this was one of the most extensive programmes in connection with an opencast project in the UK. These engineering works in turn required a substantial geotechnical input. This paper presents a general account of the extensive ground investiga- tions and construction works carried out at Plenmeller, and briefly discusses some geotechnical aspects of the site operations and the construction works.</jats:p>",

Apart from housing shortages, the government's migration control, through the restriction on urban-household registration, is a main contributor to the separation. Based on the microdata of the 1987 National Population Survey, we find that the variation in spousal-residence separations among Chinese young couples in the mid-1980s is well explained by personal and household factors within a multivariate model. The separations were aggravated by migrations for the reasons of employment or education. Although marriage migrations reduced the number of separations, those who had been married for a short period of time (particularly newlyweds) were more prone to be separated. It is ironic that the higher a person's level of education, the greater the tendency for them to suffer the pain of spousal-residence separation. Household status could also be a very important factor: the lower the household status of a married individual, the more likely that he (or she) would be separated from their spouse. </jats:p>",

We evaluated parents' attitudes regarding the following questions: What was the parents' understanding of their children's health care issues, and what was the parental perception of the professionals' understanding of their children and of themselves? Who should be the principal decision makers for the children? What was the parents' knowledge about advance directives? Did parents want to participate in a process of advance planning to assist with critical life decision making for their children?</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Methods. We surveyed all parents attending a conference sponsored by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health for parents of children with special needs. The questionnaire was provided to all parents attending the conference. An announcement was made at the conference requesting parental participation. The 76 respondents constitute a convenience sample of parents of children with special needs sufficient for this preliminary stage of investigation.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Results. Of 177 parents attending the conference, 76 (43%) completed the questionnaire. Eighty-eight percent of the participants strongly agreed that they understood their children's conditions. Twenty-one percent stated that they had sufficient understanding of their children's future medical needs, and 21% thought that they had a sufficient understanding of their children's developmental potential. Ninety-nine percent of parents strongly agreed that physicians should share information with parents no matter how serious or potentially upsetting. Ninety-four percent of those parents who thought that their children's physicians understood their own needs also thought that the physicians understood their children's needs. In contrast, only half (55%) of those parents who thought the physicians did not understand their needs thought the physicians understood their children's needs. Ninety-two percent of parents who thought that the physicians understood their needs agreed that the physicians would make the best decisions in crises versus 60% of those who did not think the physicians understood their needs. Seventy-four percent stated that they would consider written guidelines for their children that dealt with critical life situations. All parents who thought their children's conditions were not understood wanted written guidelines. Of those parents who had thought their children would not survive (15 parents), 94% wanted written guidelines. All seven parents who had been told their children would not survive wanted written guidelines.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Conclusions. Parents in this study were generally satisfied with care being provided to their children. Nevertheless, the results clearly suggest goals that could lead to improved capacity for parents and providers to make critical life decisions for and with children. First, physicians must understand the needs of parents to be able to make decisions that would be in the children's best interests. Second, parents should participate fully in critical life decisions for their children and should use written guidelines to assist with the process of these critical life decisions. Our findings strongly support the development of a longitudinal process, initiated early after the onset or discovery of illness and maintained longitudinally throughout the course of a child's illness, to help parents and providers work together in this vital area of health care to children.</jats:p>",

In particular, we assess the extent to which Japanese R&amp;D in the United States is consistent with a model of global localization. The analysis is based upon data collected by a mailed questionnaire survey and through interviews with the directors of Japanese R&amp;D laboratories. In its basic form, global localization is a manufacturing strategy that seeks to promote the emergence of an integrated manufacturing complex and attendant technology-development capability within North America and other major markets. In the case of Japanese automobile firms, close ties are observed between R&amp;D and production facilities in the United States. In computers, electronics, and other industries, however, the principal linkage of R&amp;D laboratories in the United States is to R&amp;D laboratories in Japan. Divisional R&amp;D laboratories in Japan remain the anchor for emerging international technology-development networks. </jats:p>",

When the appropriate circumstances occur such that one of these designs can be implemented, the cost is generally considerably decreased, yet expo sure is still measured before the disease is diagnosed.</jats:p>",

With information seen by many in government and industry as the gold of the future, it is not surprising that it is common in the West to see it as essential that those countries adopt regulations that will encourage its relatively unfettered flow. In fact, in the key areas of data protection and intellectual property we can see strong indications of Western influence. But this is occurring in different ways. In the case of data protection, US influence has been brought to bear through intermediaries, particularly the European Community. In the case of intellectual property, the United States has acted more directly. In both cases, though, the United States is promoting what it sees as its own values despite their being in important ways at odds with those not simply of Central and Eastern Europe but of Europe more generally. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A prominent theme of recent agrifoods research has been the interpretation of current restructuring in terms of a collapse of the postwar food regime, and its incomplete replacement by one based around transnationally organised capital and regulatory structures. In this paper I argue that, for empirical research into concrete instances of agrifood restructuring, the food-regimes perspective is usefully augmented by conceptualising regulation as a contestable social practice—what Clark (1992) dubs as ‘real’ regulation. Evidence from the Australian and US dairy industries is used to illustrate this argument. In these sectors, producer cooperatives have successfully realigned their strategies in light of new conditions for capital accumulation, mitigating against the direct entry of transnational capital. This finding underlines the importance of specific regulatory contexts in determining outcomes of restructuring, and points to complex relationships between national and transnational capital in the agrifood system. </jats:p>",

Using a unique national survey of nearly 2000 smaller businesses, we identify regional differences in enterprise growth rates, market specialisation, innovation rates and research and development intensity, occupational structures, and labour-market problems. We also reveal differences in the frequency of use of government advisory agencies, and in the rating by firms in different regions of key competitive advantages and constraints on growth. These differences do not however conform to simple traditional stereotypes suggested by images of a declining North and a growing South. The implications of these findings both for understanding recent regional economic development in Britain and for policies such as those of local Training and Enterprise Councils are considered. </jats:p>",

Over the past two decades, three R&amp;D-intensive sectors (telecommunications equipment, electronic instruments, and computing-equipment manufacturing) have experienced a progressive territorial distribution, that has made them less reliant on the metropolitan concentration of the capital for their outsourcing and research arrangements. In this article we explore the relationship between R&amp;D intensity, territorial distribution, subcontracting, and establishment performance in the R&amp;D-intensive electronics industries. The export performance of these industries is considered first, along with its relationship with employment characteristics and territorial location. An analysis of the territorial distribution, and its relationship with establishment downsizing and subcontracting, provides insights on the significance of lower costs and higher R&amp;D intensity for small-scale operations. Statistical analyses of R&amp;D intensity and performance variables that include labour skills, plant size, production costs, fixed capital assets, and profitability, with establishment-level survey data, provide important insights on the effects of subcontracting and any spatial differences resulting thereof.</jats:p>",

METHODS: Seven issues that arose in the development of a decision analysis of alternative strategies for cystic fibrosis carrier screening are discussed. Each of these issues required a choice in technique. RESULTS: The presentations of these analyses frequently mask underlying assumptions and methodological choices. Often there is no best choice. In the case of genetic screening in the reproductive setting, these underlying issues often touch on deeply felt human values. CONCLUSIONS: Space limitations for published papers often preclude explaining such choices in detail; yet these decisions determine the way the results should be interpreted. Those who develop these analyses need to make sure that the implications of important assumptions are understood by the clinicians who will use them. At the same time, clinicians need to enhance their understanding of what these models truly mean and how they address underlying clinical, ethical, and economic issues. </jats:p>",
