For a given set of assumptions the model determines magnitude and timing of investments in primary and secondary wells, surface-handling facilities and pipelines, and fixes production rates each time period to maximize present worth profit over a planning horizon. Engineering profit over a planning horizon. Engineering requirements, economic factors plus physical and regulatory limitations are simultaneously taken into account. The model</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>generates better plans than conventional procedures, helps systematize and document basic planning data for later reference or updating, and provides a unique common ground which provides a unique common ground which promotes understanding and communication promotes understanding and communication between engineers, planners and top management.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Introduction</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In all business enterprises, some form of planning takes place, although the quantity and planning takes place, although the quantity and quality may vary widely depending upon the nature of the business and the attitude and level of sophistication of the management. Since the petroleum industry has long been a leader in petroleum industry has long been a leader in applying latest technology to improve operations it is no surprise that petroleum companies have been among the first to begin applying modern computer-based management methods to their critical planning problems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The greatest advantage to be gained from applying the computer in a planning situation is to provide a mechanism by which data and assumptions can be easily and quickly converted into meaningful planning guidelines. With an efficient and flexible system, it is possible to feed in new data as soon as it becomes available to keep planning current.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>From a technical standpoint, the oil business gives rise to some of the most difficult analytical planning problems encountered in business. As a result, progress toward development of improved computerized planning systems for the petroleum industry has come slowly. However, recent mathematical developments combined with the ability of modern day computers to process enormous quantities of data at fantastic speeds now makes it possible to consider all significant interactions in a complex oil system in generating the kind of information required by enlightened petroleum managements to make better decisions.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Of course, the core of these planning problems is economic evaluation for problems is economic evaluation for decision-making.</jats:p>",

In fact, of course, populations concentrate in fewer centres than in warmer regions: more than half the population of the Yukon Territory lives within 30 km of Whitehorse, and more than half Alaska's is associated with Fairbanks and Anchorage. The apparent ruggedness is offset by slow regenerative processes in areas disturbed by man. The presence of the impermeable permafrost layer over much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic prevents the dispersal of man's waste products and facilitates pollution of water and land. The air itself over centres of population is often exceptionally vulnerable to pollution.</jats:p>",

The model consists of a computer program written in Fortran IV language and is program written in Fortran IV language and is useful to top management as a decision making tool. Economics of various storage alternatives can be investigated and the relationship between model parameter sensitivity and alternative storage decisions can be established. A hypothetical transmission pipeline is analyzed and the effects of gas storage in depleted gas fields, aquifers, chambers created by nuclear explosions, and LNG systems are considered. The model is useful in that one can discern the real effect of each storage alternative on the whole system, and the relationship between storage, life index, and the prepayment problem.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The utility of natural gas storage facilities located close to the market area is well known. The natural gas industry uses such storage for a variety of reasons which include:</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>the ability to level out cyclic fluctuations in the demand for gas caused by temperature variations; achievement of high load factor operation; improved service to both jurisdictional and industrial customers; and the maintenance of market share with respect to competition from other energy sources.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>When considering the investment of capital in storage facilities, the management of a natural gas transmission system has to investigate the complex interrelationships and resulting economic consequences of various aspects of the problem. These considerations include: (1) the problem. These considerations include:</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>the choice of the best storage combination from the alternatives available, the function of storage in the maintenance of life index, the effect of contracts negotiated with suppliers of natural gas on the company prepayment position, and the appropriate level to be position, and the appropriate level to be maintained in developing company-owned gas reserves.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Management Science can be defined as the application of the scientific method to bring about measurable improvement in human social systems.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",
