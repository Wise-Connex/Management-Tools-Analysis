A suitable description of Situation&amp;Location and its whole set of variables can be a powerful means to trade-off among user requirements, application constraints, and underlying network conditions. We propose a Multi Agent System able to capture the concept of Situation&amp;Location and perform the task highlighted above. We follow a general-purpose approach with the aim of guaranteeing the highest versatility is possible. The main strength of our proposed system is its \"adaptability\" that can be achieved without the use of either new terminals or novel technologies. The only requirement is the introduction of a middleware functionality into already existing terminals and into some network servers.</jats:p>"

An organic geochemical investigation concludes that the two oils are of low to medium maturity, and that these oils represent alternative organic facies of Upper Jurassic age. The organic facies that sourced the investigated oils are believed to be hypersaline and carbonate-type source rocks, which were most likely deposited in locally developed, secluded lagoonal settings with elevated salinity and low clastic influx. The alternative source rocks inferred by the two atypical oils may add new concepts to petroleum exploration on the margins of the Mesozoic Central Graben and Viking Graben in the North Sea.</jats:p>",
