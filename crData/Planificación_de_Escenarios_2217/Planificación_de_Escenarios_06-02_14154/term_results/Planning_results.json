The article fits together a large literature on the subject of the interrelationship between diversity and place and explores how diversity could be enabled within the context of the city-planning profession. It argues that the linkage between city planning—defined in its traditional sense as a profession concerned with the design of cities—and place diversity is understudied. Four distinct though interrelated theoretical bases for diversity are discussed: place vitality, economic health, social equity, and sustainability. The article argues that the promotion of place diversity requires focused effort on the part of planners, and that design-based strategies are an appropriate part of that effort. </jats:p>",

Local officials turned to the experts for aid. These men approached the problem as one whose solution might be identified through the application of scientific techniques. Through their efforts, they transformed transportation planning from a broad, multidisciplinary exercise into a narrow, technical one, and introduced principles and procedures that continue to guide practitioners. Their development of a science based on traffic data and premised on the desirability of facilitating high-speed automobile movement also served to blind later professionals to the often-negative consequences of their own planning prescriptions. </jats:p>",

Lagos-the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa-exemplifies many of these challenges but has tended to be viewed within a narrow analytical frame. In this essay, 'exceptionalist' perspectives on the African city are eschewed in favour of an analysis which frames the experience of Lagos within a wider geopolitical arena of economic instability, petro-capitalist development and regional internecine strife. An historical perspective is developed in order to reveal how structural factors operating through both the colonial and post-colonial periods have militated against any effective resolution to the city's worsening infrastructure crisis. It is concluded that a workable conception of the public realm must form an integral element in any tentative steps towards more progressive approaches to urban policy-making in the post-Abacha era and the return to civilian rule. </jats:p>",

The authors test the efficacy of land-use planning and plan implementation in Florida by measuring the degree to which wetland development over a ten-year period conforms to the original design of adopted comprehensive plans. First, they spatially identify concentrated areas of wetland alteration permits and compare these locations with the adopted future land-use maps for county and city jurisdictions in the southern portion of the state. Second, they examine the major factors influencing nonconforming development patterns across the study area. Results indicate a well-defined spatial pattern of nonconforming wetland development and isolate specific socioeconomic, demographic, and geographic variables impacting these deviations from the original spatial intent of local plans. </jats:p>",

Five elements are considered: decisionmakers, choice opportunities, problems, solutions, and locations. Decisionmakers, problems, and solutions meet in an unpredictable way, are thrown into garbage cans as choice opportunities in certain locations, and something happens. In contrast to most traditional spatial simulation techniques, in which space is global and static, I consider in this simulation locations of facilities as dynamically floating on the stream of opportunities, interacting with other elements. The simulation results imply that the relationship between problems and choice opportunities dominates the outcome of the evolution, whereas the effects of the spatial structure as well as the structures of decision and solution are insignificant. The model may provide useful insights into how urban dynamics evolve. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Between 1960 and 2000, Providence, Rhode Island, transformed its downtown through physical redevelopment. This article examines the proposals and implementation of seven major downtown plans issued for Providence during this period. Each plan proposed significant physical changes like the redevelopment of city blocks, the relocation of railroads, or the construction of open space. Despite Providence's successful redevelopment reputation, the study found that Providence's downtown plan implementation was both incomplete and incremental. Only four of the seven plans issued experienced any implementation during the study period, and of those four plans, only one had more than half of its recommendations implemented. Incremental implementation occurred when unimplemented plan ideas were proposed by later plans and subsequently realized. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The algorithmic design of an architectural configuration depends on one's ability to compare the merit of different solutions quantitatively, in order to decide which design is superior. We propose a merit function that accounts for the amount of view from a given unit and its accessibility to other units. The amount of view is measured as the size of the spatial region visible from the center of the unit, and accessibility is quantified as the proximity of the unit to all other units in the configuration. We show how to compute the merit of a given configuration of units efficiently and to use this in an algorithm that generates configurations by greedily adding and removing units with the aim of maximizing the merit of the resulting configuration, either in a planar or a spatial setting. We demonstrate that this method reproduces familiar architectural designs (such as streets, plazas, and skylines) and sheds light on the forces that drive their creation. </jats:p>",

It integrates literatures from public health, criminology, and planning to identify, qualify, and evaluate the link between safety and security considerations and physical activity. It then proceeds to place safety and security concerns within a spatial context and to examine design and policy interventions that can help create environments more amenable to walking. </jats:p>",

The gating of sections of cities provides a notable example, setting fear of crime against rights of movement and access. Johannesburg, South Africa, reveals just such challenges. In this paper the authors review the recent history of policy formulation by city officials on ‘security access restriction’ in Johannesburg. They note the diverse and shifting views and behaviour of various actors and the difficulties faced by policymakers. They highlight how policy has emerged in a profoundly controversial and contested terrain, showing how Johannesburg, at least, has attempted to manage the conflicts. However, the policy environment remains unstable, and existing policy may be only a partial and temporary resolution to a deep contradiction. </jats:p>",

In the planning literature there is a debate about the criterion of conformance (that is, whether spatial development is according to plan) as opposed to performance (that is, whether the plan has shown the way to better decisionmaking), which is, in fact, different from performance measurement. In this paper both criteria are applied to measure the success of Dutch national concentration policies in the “Fourth Memorandum on Spatial Planning—Plus”. The author shows that the urban containment policies conform well to the plan but perform badly in terms of improving current decisionmaking on the stagnation of housing production in the Netherlands. Moreover, the present stagnation of housing production is planned stagnation. With this result, the author shows that conformance and performance are independent criteria for measuring planning success, and that plans (as set out in the “Fourth Memorandum on Spatial Planning—Plus”) with high conformance may still perform badly on the performance criterion. </jats:p>",

To assess the influence of municipal zoning and subdivision regulations on residential stormwater production, high-resolution aerial photography and property tax data for over 38000 single-family residential parcels were used to measure the impervious cover and modeled runoff associated with a typical two-year storm. The results of the analysis suggest that stormwater runoff volumes could be significantly reduced with only modest changes to municipal land-development regulations and with no reduction in the size of the residential structure. Following the presentation of the methodology and findings, the paper concludes with a discussion of targeted revisions to zoning and subdivision regulations that, if implemented, could reduce the runoff volume from new residential parcels in Madison by over 30%. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Why consumers shop via the Internet, is a frequently asked question. As yet, the impact of spatial variables on e-shopping has received little attention. In this paper we report our investigation of the spatial distribution of Internet users and online buyers in the Netherlands for the time period 1996–2001 and the impact of spatial variables (residential environment and shop accessibility) on e-shopping. Two hypotheses are tested empirically. The first is that e-shopping is a predominantly urban phenomenon, because new technology usually starts in centres of innovation (innovation-diffusion hypothesis). The second is that people are more likely to adopt e-shopping when their accessibility to shops is relatively low (efficiency hypothesis). Our findings indicate that Internet use and online buying are still largely urban phenomena in the Netherlands, but that there is a trend towards diffusion to the weakly urbanised and rural areas. Not only the innovation diffusion hypothesis, but also the efficiency hypothesis is confirmed by our findings. People living in a (very) strongly urbanised area have a higher likelihood of buying online, but people with a low shop accessibility buy more often online. The analysis also shows that the support for the two hypotheses depends on the type of product. Airline tickets are still mainly bought in very strongly urbanised areas, whereas compact discs, videos, DVDs, and clothing are bought relatively more often in weakly urbanised areas. In conclusion, geography seems to matter for e-shopping. </jats:p>",

We examine intrametropolitan and intermetropolitan variations in job accessibility by commuting mode as an indicator of auto-oriented urban structure, selecting Boston, Los Angeles, and Tokyo as study areas. Although in both US and Japanese metropolitan areas, job accessibility is significantly lower for public transit users than for auto users, job accessibility for public transit users in the US cases is strikingly lower than in Tokyo. The international comparison provides a clear picture of the significant disadvantage in accessing job opportunities encountered by US workers who are unable to use private vehicles. The empirical results uncover an important dimension of urban structure that deserves much attention from planners and policymakers. </jats:p>",

The study investigates the application of multispectral remote sensing from the Landsat ETM+ and IKONOS satellite sensors for the mapping of UEQ in urban Hong Kong at a detailed level, using the measurable, image-based parameters of temperature and biomass, and examines the relationship between these and air quality in selected study districts. Multiple-criteria queries on these two parameters show that spatial variations in UEQ are closely related to natural topographic factors and urban morphology. The amount of biomass, as opposed to total area of vegetation, is also shown to be an important factor in the spatial variation of UEQ. The data permit visualisation of the relationship between the human and natural factors involved in UEQ and generate recommendations for future planning and urban-renewal projects. </jats:p>",

She could not be evacuated because a plane had never landed at the South Pole in midwinter. So, using materials at hand, the team biopsied the mass, stained the cells, and transmitted pictures to specialists in the United States. The images showed breast cancer. Chemotherapeutic drugs and other supplies were airdropped to the station. When weather improved sufficiently to allow an evacuation, the doctor returned home to definitive medical care. Fortunately, the cancer had been controlled, and she made a full recovery.</jats:p>",

The extent of the drilling problems is reflected in the 2003 average fluid losses, which were more than 2000 barrels per well.

The object is therefore to examine the driving forces, mechanisms, and patterns of meaning behind the increase in international long-distance work mobility. The author will draw on a case study which involves two Danish examples of ‘knowledge organisations’. He argues that it is necessary to rethink central concepts of travel, tourism, and working life, in order to understand and describe this kind of international mobility in these organisations. The boundary between work and tourism is not distinct and there is a very complex connection between travel, work, tourism, and play. He shows that actually, there is a strong ‘material’ impact from supposedly ‘immaterial’ organisations and this ‘materiality’ is particularly linked to the extension of forms of mobility. This has implications for understanding the possibilities of replacing physical work mobility with virtual mobility as a tool in order to ensure a more ‘sustainable transport system’ in the future. </jats:p>",

This process continues to increase with internal (rural exodus) and international migration, urbanization and exogamous marriages, leading to a changing language demography, where language shift and language learning are constant and ongoing processes. A cursory look at what people have always done and do with language(s) and an epistemological approach to their language repertoire(s) suggest that individuals and communities are very active agents, whose language practices show an incredible capacity and resourcefulness in empowering themselves where and when it matters most. And yet, the concept of “linguistic identity” tries to cast a mold around individuals and speech-communities, as if they are to belong to a given language or identity to the exclusion of (an) other(s). This paper explores the concept of “linguistic identity” and asks whether it is possible to argue that we actually have one identity, whether language is intricately tied to identity or whether language itself has an identity. It concludes with some considerations about language management.</jats:p>",

The paper describes the planning; modeling and results of the 24 inch drilling performance achieved in the longest extended reach well drilled to date in the Ringhorne Development, Offshore Norway.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Ringhorne wells usually kick-off below the 26 inch conductor in 17-1/2 inch hole building angle from vertical to 65 degrees where 13-3/8 inch surface casing is typically set. This is not the case for the development with extended well targets where it came necessary to upsize the casing program with 18-5/8 inch surface casing. This requires a 24 inch deviated hole to be drilled from approximately 300 meters measured depth (mMD) to 70 degrees by 1000 mMD with casing point at approximately 1600 mMD to enable drilling to the reservoir targets at 1700 – 2000 meters true vertical depth (mTVD).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The first 24 inch section was drilled using a 17-1/2\" polycrystalline diamond (PDC) bit, rotary steerable system (RSS) and PDC hole-opener. Severe vibration problems were experienced while drilling through the Utsira sands near the base of the section causing a rotary steerable tool failure. This led to loss of angle and slightly earlier casing point than planned. The next 24 inch section was drilled using a two-run strategy including a 17-1/2 inch RSS to total depth (TD) before picking up a 24 inch hole-opener in a separate run. The first hole-opener run twisted off above the bottomhole-assembly (BHA) while drilling the massive Utsira sandstone and three subsequent hole opening runs were pulled due to poor performance resulting in a tapered casing string to be set.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Because of the poor BHA performance and the associated drilling problems, the operator and the service company conducted an extensive analysis of offset drilling performance followed by a thorough modeling study to ensure success in drilling the long reach 25/8 C-12 (C-12) well from the platform. Due to the complexity of the well, no deviation from the well path could be tolerated and the casing shoe had to reach the planned depth. Time and depth based data, formation information and vibration measurements from the offset wells were evaluated using analytical software. These results were used to analyze various BHA's for stability.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This investigation led to the development of a stable BHA configuration and selection of optimum bit properties, recommendation for parameter combinations and response plans for the formations encountered. A plan was developed that focused on drilling practices and parameter adjustments according to the formation. The result was a significant reduction of vibration that enabled the rig crew to successfully drill the 24 inch section following the well path and run the 18-5/8 inch casing to planned TD without incident.</jats:p>",

However, the relevance of contemporary planning theory is limited by its origins within the intellectual traditions and experiences of the West. If we are to engage effectively with the multiple rationalities that are shaping the cities of the world-cities that are increasingly centred in the global South-then we must bring Western intellectual tradition into a critical relationship with the epistemologies, rationalities and value-based traditions of the non-Occidental world. This paper argues that post-colonial literature and theory may provide some of the intellectual resources needed to sustain such an engagement, as post-colonial thought directs attention to the hybrid intellectual formations and practices that emerge in the on-going interaction between colonised and coloniser. By using Johannesburg as the prism through which to look at cities and at planning, this paper provides some thoughts on how to construct an 'other way' of thinking that is situated both within and outside dominant representations. </jats:p>",

Most stated objectives for conservation, such as to maximize biodiversity outcomes, are too vague to be useful within a decision‐making framework. One way to clarify the issue is to define objectives in terms of the risk of extinction for multiple species. Although the assessment of extinction risk for single species is common, few researchers have formulated an objective function that combines the extinction risks of multiple species. We sought to translate the broad goal of maximizing the viability of species into explicit objectives for use in a decision‐theoretic approach to conservation planning. We formulated several objective functions based on extinction risk across many species and illustrated the differences between these objectives with simple examples. Each objective function was the mathematical representation of an approach to conservation and emphasized different levels of threat. Our objectives included minimizing the joint probability of one or more extinctions, minimizing the expected number of extinctions, and minimizing the increase in risk of extinction from the best‐case scenario. With objective functions based on joint probabilities of extinction across species, any correlations in extinction probabilities had to be known or the resultant decisions were potentially misleading. Additive objectives, such as the expected number of extinctions, did not produce the same anomalies. We demonstrated that the choice of objective function is central to the decision‐making process because alternative objective functions can lead to a different ranking of management options. Therefore, decision makers need to think carefully in selecting and defining their conservation goals.</jats:italic></jats:p>",

As only a limited number of audits will be conducted, it is important to establish how to maximise the return on the invested efforts and resources. The aim is thus, to develop a ranking of industries based on their potential for savings from DSM interventions. It considers the following criteria: 1. Electricity consumption and potential DSM savings from retrofits at existing plants; 2. Electricity consumption and potential DSM savings for new plants; 3. Potential DSM interventions by industry; 4. The costs of a suite of DSM interventions by industry; and 5. The technical ease with which DSM may be implemented by industry. The potential for DSM savings for different industrial sectors is evaluated based on these criteria, using aggregated values sourced from local and international studies. DSM measures are applied to the various ‘end uses’ of electricity within each industry. From these we suggest a shortlist of 10 industries to target for energy audits and data gathering. We consider both industry and mining, and refer to the group collectively as industry. The data gathered in the energy audits will be used to refine estimates of the potential for DSM savings in each sector. Data loggers will be installed to measure electricity consumption and demand profiles (kW load as a function of time), which will be used to estimate the impact of DSM interventions on national demand for energy and power. This can provide valuable input to power system planning and analysis in the future.</jats:p>"

There has been much opposition to the project for a variety of reasons including a seismic risk in the area where the power plant was to be sited. Given Turkey's desire to diversify its energy sources, nuclear power was expected to remain on the agenda. </jats:p>",

It examines how a functional multilingual, democratic, ecological language policy in the European Parliament may ensure equal participation in, and benefit from, democratic processes for both majority and minority language communities. How multilingualism is managed and language policy is formed will be crucial in creating the identity of a future European Union, which the author discusses through a reinterpretation of what the EU might stand for; summarised in the notions of an English Union, an Elite Union, an Equal Union or an Esperanto Union. Language policy issues are especially important with regard to education, as multilingual education could be viewed as a democratic tool safeguarding active citizen participation in an intergovernmental forum such as the EU. Based on a three-language model it is possible to sustain a secure ethnic identity or identities via teaching through the mother tongue(s), as well as by acquiring at least one lingua franca and additional languages through carefully planned and well-organised multilingual education. The article concludes, in the long term, that the optimal language policy alternative would be one employing a planned language (such as Esperanto) as <jats:italic>lingua franca</jats:italic>, as a relay language and as an internal working language for the EU institutions.</jats:p>",

In this paper we focus on planning in temporal domains with exogenous events that happen at known times, imposing the constraint that certain actions in the plan must be executed during some predefined time windows. When actions have durations, handling such temporal constraints adds an extra difficulty to planning. We propose an approach to planning in these domains which integrates constraint-based temporal reasoning into a graph-based planning framework using local search. Our techniques are implemented in a planner that took part in the 4th International Planning Competition (IPC-4). A statistical analysis of the results of IPC-4 demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in terms of both CPU-time and plan quality. Additional experiments show the good performance of the temporal reasoning techniques integrated into our planner. </jats:p>"

The study was undertaken as part of a strategy of encouraging schools to build on existing experience while at the same time ensuring consistency with new national guidelines for the implementation of PDP across the whole sector. The aim of the research was to understand the models already available for supporting and developing PDP, and the views of different stakeholders about the place of PDP in the curriculum. The research was designed to engage with teacher beliefs in order to provide models of practice that could inform innovation. The study was based on interviews with staff and data were analysed on the basis of clusters of features to create models of different practices and approaches. Three ideal types of PDP emerged: professional, employment and academic. Each of the modes was associated with particular disciplinary domains, although none of them existed in pure form. The data suggest that pedagogic identities based on introjection and strong boundary maintenance displayed greater tension in relation to PDP than those areas already constructed on projection. UK moves towards PDP are part of an international trend. The great advantage of case study data, however, is that they allow insight into the dynamics of implementation at the local level and in this case the potential of generic initiatives based on projection to destabilise aspects of academic identity. New initiatives are more likely to succeed if they engage positively with teacher beliefs rather than being posed in contra‐distinction to them; the first step, however, is to understand and theorise them.</jats:p>",

This suggests that the stability of the agricultural system is precarious, and that when it is disrupted (as it was with the arrival of the foot and mouth virus) the consequences may be large scale and catastrophic.

An example might be a planetary rover exploring a largely unknown planet. It is argued that existing algorithms for decision‐theoretic planning are based on a logically incorrect theory of rational decision making. Plans cannot be evaluated directly in terms of their expected values, because plans can be of different scopes, and they can interact with other previously adopted plans. Furthermore, in the real world, the search for optimal plans is completely intractable. An alternative theory of rational decision making is proposed, called “locally global planning.”</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The urban disturbances in Bradford, Oldham, and Burnley in 2001 served to underline the contested meanings of black and minority ethnic residential segregation in Britain. Official reports into the disturbances highlighted the depth of ethnic divisions in these northern cities, where, it was contended, British Asian and white people are living “a series of parallel lives”. Central to this assertion is the claim that people of South Asian origin, particularly British Muslims, are failing to be active citizens by withdrawing from interactions with wider British society. This paper examines the discourses surrounding charges of British Muslim isolationism and self-segregation, which have been closely linked to the persistence of inner-city ethnic clustering. The arguments draw on in-depth research with people of Pakistani/Kashmiri and Bangladeshi origin in Bradford and connect to debates about Britishness, whiteness. and the Western portrayal of British Muslims as Other. The findings give voice to British Muslims, enabling us to examine critically the processes involved in the racialisation of space and to challenge the view that British Muslims wish to live separately from others and disengage from British society. </jats:p>",

Although not a new phenomenon, the conditions of globalisation have facilitated the movement of a record number of people; individuals who are crossing international borders for work, leisure, safety, and security. Among these groups of people, tourists and labour migrants account for the largest groups traveling worldwide. Although abundant scholarly research is available on the transnational voyages of both groups, in this paper I seek to juxtapose a subset of these two types of movement—backpackers and seasonal workers—to investigate how these mobilities are determined, articulated, and shape various identities of the actors involved. Moreover, by referring to material, juridical, and spatial conditions that facilitate the mobility of these two groups, I will examine who is benefiting from these manifold movements and whether these mobilities represent new patterns of corporeal mobility and/or if they reify old relationships between the North and the South. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Current UK policy views the encouragement of enterprise by black and minority ethnic (BME) communities as a key strategy of both its social inclusion and its competitiveness agenda. However, the evidence suggests that the take-up of business support by these groups is very limited, and recent research has argued for the need for more culturally sensitive provision and a better understanding of the diverse needs of different BME groups. This paper reports on a study of first-generation and second-generation Vietnamese businesses in London, designed to explore traditional cultural influences on business practice. The results suggest that, as with many other ethnic groups, attitudes towards the family, trust, and language have a key impact on the start-up and operation of the businesses. However, this study suggests that the ways in which these three factors impinge on business practice vary between the older first generation (the original ‘boat people‘), the UK-educated second generation, and younger more recent immigrants, and is also mediated by sectoral influences, the pressures of the marketplace, and the degree of family involvement in the business. In particular second-generation and recent immigrants were less likely to adopt traditional collectivist approaches to the running of their business compared with the first generation, but their business practice was still often influenced by strong family loyalties. The author argues that theories of ethnic minority enterprise that advocate a mixed-embeddedness approach need to incorporate an historical dimension. The findings emphasize the need for enterprise-support policy to take account not only of intercultural differences, but also the intracultural differences that exist within different ethnic minority groups. The author makes a number of suggestions as to how policy and practice should be adapted accordingly. </jats:p>",

In this paper I raise parallels between the rise of the doctrine of air power in the US during World War 2 and the concerns about national security following the attacks on September 11, 2001. The visual and spatial logics of air power generate a ‘cosmic view’ that unifies and fixes targets from the air.

Through ethnographic observations the author tests how the continuous flow of vehicles, commodities, money, and people are sustained and made accountable. The fieldwork demonstrates that, despite its transitory character, the petrol station offers a wide spectrum of ‘duration of stay’. The station was used while being-on-the-way as well as providing a possibility to disembark from automobility, that is, being-off-the-way. However, the most important finding is that the station tends to mobility, from the production and recognition of fluency, the constant negotiation and articulation work of situations, to continuous maintenance and repair of movement. Accomplishing a flow of people, vehicles, money, and commodities is a complex and delicate task requiring subtle negotiation between staff and visitors as well as among visitors themselves. A negotiation supported and hampered by available materialities of the place. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) are used for assessing and planning diets of individuals and groups. Assessing individual intakes is complicated by the fact that neither the individual's usual nutrient intake nor their individual requirement is known. However, the degree of confidence that intakes are adequate or excessive can be estimated. Assessing diets of groups requires information on the group's usual nutrient intake distribution, which can be obtained by statistically adjusting 1 d intake distributions to remove within-person variability. For most nutrients with an Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), the group prevalence of inadequate intakes can be approximated by the percent whose usual intakes are less than the EAR. However, the prevalence of inadequacy cannot be determined for nutrients with an Adequate Intake (AI). The goals of planning are a low risk (for individuals) or low prevalence (for groups) of inadequate or excessive nutrient intakes. For individuals, these goals are met by planning intakes that meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or AI, are below the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), and fall within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs). For groups, planning involves estimating a \"target\" usual intake distribution with an acceptably low prevalence less than the EAR and greater than the UL, planning menus to achieve the target distribution, and assessing the results.Key words: nutrition assessment, dietary planning, nutrient adequacy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the way in which the (British) Asian diaspora creates a territory of belonging and a cultural nationalism within the British landscape. New, British Asian cultures of Englishness are figured through the experience of mobility from ‘other’ landscapes to England. The expression of new hybrids of cultural nationalism based on cultures of Englishness and landscape are presented in the tangible forms of Asian women's drawings of ‘landscapes of belonging’ and their material cultures at home. The Englishness that is expressed through these cultures is examined as a mobile culture that has shifted in meaning and form through the various migrations of the diaspora from sites of colonial governance. The acknowledgement of mobility reveals how new cultural nationalisms rely on souvenirs and sacred objects, contributing to a new moral aesthetics of home and thus creating an inclusive culture of Englishness. The home incorporates a new space where the Englishness of Victoriana and textures of Indianess or Africaness are sites of memorial to mobility itself. The British Asian diaspora creates spatially transferable, mobile cultures of nationalism, expressed through material registers of English landscape aesthetics. The English landscape itself is examined as refractive of lived landscapes abroad and explored through the diasporic lens. Englishness in this paper is based on a ‘territory of culture’, unfixed from any singular national identity, land, or discrete national culture, but located in the cultures of desire of belonging to England. </jats:p>",

In this paper I argue that the configuration of these mobile social relations can be understood through a model of interpersonal surveillance that, unlike hierarchical state structures of surveillance, constitutes a decentralised social relation between individuals. This shift may be characterised in the writings of Foucault as a move from the panopticon model of surveillance that mediates the relation between the state and the individual to his later writings on technologies of the self, which emphasise interaction between individuals as a source of self-discipline. Like the panopticon, this second form of surveillance also constitutes a power/knowledge regime that produces certain ways of seeing and certain objects of the ‘surveilling’ gaze. Drawing on empirical material from research on round-the-world travel websites, in this paper I outline the way metaphors of surveillance such as ‘watching’ and ‘following’ configure the mobile social relations that occur between travellers and their on-line audience. </jats:p>",

The small-firm sector is dominated by the self-employed and an important classification is the large numbers of ‘own-account self-employed‘. It is unclear to what extent these people should be classified as true ‘business owners‘. Using face-to-face interviews, the authors explore the motivations for becoming self-employed and the growth aspirations of self-employed people. Based on the outcomes, suggestions are made about how fiscal policy might be targeted to improve neutrality and promote business growth. </jats:p>",

The discussion is based on qualitative research including twenty-six weekend observations of the curfew enforcement, interviews with security of color subcontracted by mall management to enforce the curfew, and media analysis of public relations efforts concerning disturbances and lawsuits involving security guards and youth of color at the mall. I argue that MOA security measures are closely linked with public relations (PR) and that a central function of PR as a support for security is to veil the racial dynamics motivating management policies at the mall. Key illustrations of the PR–security links and aims are seen in the campaign to ‘sell’ the curfew, which displaced issues of racial and generational inequalities onto moralizing discourses of property, safety, and family values, and in the deployment of security of color to accomplish friendly exclusions and managed inclusions of youth. </jats:p>",

Reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMS) are designed for this purpose and are gradually being deployed by many mid-to-large volume manufacturers. The advent of RMS has given rise to a challenging problem, namely, how to economically and efficiently reconfigure a manufacturing system and the reconfigurable hardware within it so that the system can meet new requirements. This paper presents a solution to this problem that models the reconfigurability of a RMS as a network of potential activities and configurations to which a shortest path graph-searching strategy is applied. Two approaches using the A* algorithm and a genetic algorithm are employed to perform this search for the reconfiguration plan and reconfigured system that best satisfies the new performance goals. This search engine is implemented within an AI-based computer-aided reconfiguration planning (CARP) framework, which is designed to assist manufacturing engineers in making reconfiguration planning decisions. Two planning problems serve as examples to prove the effectiveness of the CARP framework.</jats:p>",

Most grid‐based path planners use discrete state transitions that artificially constrain an agent's motion to a small set of possible headings (e.g., 0, \nπ/4, π/2, etc.). As a result, even “optimal” grid‐based planners produce unnatural, suboptimal paths. Our approach uses linear interpolation during planning to calculate accurate path cost estimates for arbitrary positions within each grid cell and produce paths with a range of continuous headings. Consequently, it is particularly well suited to planning low‐cost trajectories for mobile robots. In this paper, we introduce a version of the algorithm for uniform resolution grids and a version for nonuniform resolution grids. Together, these approaches address two of the most significant shortcomings of grid‐based path planning: the quality of the paths produced and the memory and computational requirements of planning over grids. We demonstrate our approaches on a number of example planning problems, compare them to related algorithms, and present several implementations on real robotic systems.</jats:p>",

Business planning and programme selection practices ignored childcare, rendering it a solely private matter, invisible to public scrutiny. Yet this childcare barrier became both a cause and a consequence of business failure. Participants' experiences of combining trading and childcare varied by gender. All mothers and one father had complex strategies for synchronising trading and childcare responsibilities. However, these strategies soon collapsed, contributing to business closure. Most fathers relied on the childrens' mother to organise and conduct continuous care, but this was dependent on fathers becoming breadwinners through profitable trading which was not achieved. There is growing policy recognition of the importance of the childcare barrier to paid work for lower income families and for self-employed women in the United Kingdom. However, despite recent initiatives, severe constraints remain for working-class parents to start and manage a business. Several implications for policy are discussed. </jats:p>",

Instead, there is a plethora of frameworks that categorise the overall policies and the programmes in terms of: the service they deliver (for example, ‘hard’ or ‘soft’ programmes); the target group (for example, women, ethnic groups, older or younger people); or by the outcome they wish to achieve (for example, the development of export capability). </jats:p><jats:p> Although they are useful from an operational perspective, that is, from the perspective of a policymaker faced with the task of allocating scarce resources, these approaches do little to address a critical aspect of business development that is especially evident in small firms: the interrelatedness of the firm and its owner. After reviewing the available frameworks, and discussing the problems of operationalising them, the author presents a new framework and demonstrates its use by applying it to the case of New Zealand. This framework is based on two dimensions: the development potential of the firm and the development potential of the individual—an approach that has hitherto not been used, despite the recognition of the interrelatedness of the firm and the individual, especially in countries where there are large numbers of micro enterprises. The framework contributes to the ongoing debate on the design of effective developmental programmes by enabling policymakers to focus on the key issues—developmental potential—rather than simply on the individual's membership of a specific target group. </jats:p>",

The findings illustrate that the control of narrow political interests distorts local priorities and projects, and many civil society groups remain ineffective in the face of local initiatives.

It accounts for the uncertainty of the relative part placements in the assembled state and allows planning for all assembly instances. Our framework is more general than existing approaches in terms of the part model, the tolerance specification model, and the type of motions used in the assembly sequences. We describe efficient algorithms for computing the sensitivity of part positioning to variations in part geometries, and for incorporating these computations into the geometric core of existing assembly planners for nominal parts. We show that the cost of accounting for toleranced parts in planning is a multiplicative factor which is a polynomial of low degree in the number of tolerance parameters. Our implementation and experiments on five assembly models show that tolerancing significantly reduces the volume of the space of valid motions for assembly sequence planning, and that for translational motions this reduction depends linearly on the size of the tolerance intervals. We conclude that geometric computation for assembly planning with tolerance parts is time efficient and practical. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last century, the city and rural surroundings in the canton Cuenca in Ecuador have been physically constructed in a social setting where an elite group of architects, policymakers, and wealthy citizens have made decisions on architecture, urban design, and land use. They introduced international avant-garde influences in urban residential architecture and considered vernacular architecture appropriate in the countryside. However, massive transnational migration of lower-class and middle-class residents and subsequent architectural opulence have transformed both the city and rural villages in the canton, and have affected the elite's monopoly over the production of the built environment. Many established architects criticize the new ostentatious architecture from a professional and ethical point of view, but on the other hand younger architects see new professional opportunities. Whereas the professional debate focuses on opulent architecture in rural areas and on the preservation of the historical inner city, there is no public debate on the changing cityscape, because it is regarded as an issue too sensitive to discuss openly. In this paper I analyze the professional debate and describe how new sociocultural differentiations in Cuenca change the professional stance as well as the social status of architects. </jats:p>",

We use a new method to calibrate the model using annual data on GDP per worker and the total real return on equities, from 1950 to 2002, from which we infer the stochastic characteristics of lifetime labor income and the return to lifetime savings in the US, UK, France and Japan. We obtain a range of optimal, steady-state values of the social security tax and the rate of lifetime savings. When the relative rate of risk aversion is assumed to be 2.5, the computed optimal tax varies from 5% in the United States to 22% in Japan.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the Second World War, Australian governments have adopted various approaches to governing nonmetropolitan Australia. The authors profile three distinct approaches to governance characterised as (1) state-centred regionalism; (2) new localism; and (3) new forms of multifaceted regionalism. Although recent policy initiatives have been justified by the argument that the region is the most suitable scale for planning and development in nonmetropolitan Australia, in practice the institutional landscape is a hybrid of overlapping local, regional, and national scales of action. The authors compare this new, multifaceted, regionalism with the so-called ‘new regionalism’ currently being promoted in Western Europe and North America. It is argued that new regionalism differs in quite important ways from the regionalism currently being fostered in Australia. In Australia, the centrality of sustainability principles, and the attempt to foster interdependence amongst stakeholders from the state, market, and civil society, have produced a layer of networked governance that is different from that overseas. It is argued that there is a triple bottom-line ‘promise’ in the Australian approach which differs from the Western Europe/North American model, and which has the potential to deliver enhanced economic, social, and environmental outcomes. </jats:p>",

We argue that, to understand the mobilities of fat in a city context, metaphors of urban metabolism become important. The relationships between different flows are contingent and the mobilities of fat in bodies (as individuals), cities (as a collective site of action), and sewers (as infrastructure), we argue, highlight a multiplicity of urban metabolisms, each with different interconnectivities and forms of instability. In the paper we show how, in North America, in response to the rising numbers of ‘obese bodies’ there has been the mobilisation of the concept of ‘fat cities’, involving renewed debate about the relationship between bodies and the city, provoked largely by the innovative representations of Men's Fitness magazine. However, we shift focus to highlight the problems of fat in infrastructure, focusing specifically on the experience in US cities of sewer blockages that reveal quite different sets of processes within which fat is embedded. Strategies of intervention at the level of the body, the city collective, and the sewer involve prevention, removal, and acceptance, each revealing a multiplicity of metabolisms as well as the partial interconnections between them. </jats:p>",

The basic boundaries in the house are expressions of social classifications which regulate human behaviour, and boundaries are a useful focus when considering the meaning and cultural variation of house design. In the present study, data on spatial boundaries (house plans) are interpreted in the light of the Japanese emphasis on the inside—outside classification, which not only forms a physical demarcation in and around the house but also creates and reinforces psychological boundaries in human relationships. The social boundaries which define and maintain this classification are also evident in phenomenological accounts of Japanese people resident in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

A notable finding is that both planning styles are positively associated with electronic shopping, but due to different types of benefits that are sought.

Flight delays and schedule disruptions also cause passenger delays and disruptions. A more robust plan can reduce the occurrence and impact of these delays, thereby reducing costs.

An algorithmic solution approach is presented. Computational results obtained using data from a major U.S. airline show that our approach can reduce delay propagation significantly, thus improving on-time performance and reducing the numbers of passengers disrupted. </jats:p><jats:p> Our second area of research considers passengers who miss their flight legs due to insufficient connection time.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The English conversation school ( eikaiwa) industry in Japan has grown significantly over the past twenty-five years. In this paper I perform a semiological analysis on a set of eikaiwa promotional materials gathered in Tokyo and Kanagawa during the period 1998–2002. This analysis relies on a framework of social modalities (Rose, 2001 Visual Methodologies Sage, London) within which a set of gendered Occidentalized longings ( akogare) is discussed. Career development, establishment of relationships with white males, and the potentials for foreign travel and study are highlighted by these eikaiwa promotions. These factors are presented as radical gender alterities that work against the social modalities encountered in Japan. These modalities include a set of rigid life-course expectations and a mode of social regulation that strongly directs women's professional and personal development. While English-language learning and use contain potentials for epistemological challenge to ideologies of gender, the eikaiwa visually emphasize the development of new selfhood ( atarashii jibun). In these promotions key signification is performed by white-male and Japanese-female pairings. According to Kelsky (2001 Women on the Verge Duke University Press, Durham, NC), the white male is represented as an agent of personal transformation and liberation associated with the development of new selfhood. The white male embodies an Occidentalist fantasy that is associated with personal freedom, career development, and individuation. Simultaneously, the promotions articulate with the valorization of female agency in the broader Japanese cultural sphere, and with what Kelsky (1999, page 238) terms “emergent erotic discourses of new selfhood”. Where women are featured, in contrast to Western promotional materials, their purpose is to appeal to other women. This is accomplished by presenting famous women in professionally iconic settings. When they do appear, Japanese males are infantalized and marginalized. The eikaiwa are therefore marketed as wonderlands, rich with radical gender alterities, within which the akogare of female students can be realized. </jats:p>",

Although rationalization and planning were viewed as potentially international in scope by the League's Economic Section, their treatment in Britain and Australia tended towards the provincial, with the rhetoric surrounding them progressively being tailored to suit local and imperial concerns and commitments. The defences of planning often relied on sentimental appeals to British character and traditions, although these same appeals were later used to undermine its rhetorical status.</jats:p>",

I argue that to understand regionalist mobilisation it is equally important to consider the lived, everyday spaces of the region, spaces within which such regionalist politics are born. In this paper, I focus on the Veneto region in the Italian North East: one of the wealthiest productive areas in Europe but also the site of some of the most reactionary regionalist and localist rhetorics. I explore the links between the transformations in the Veneto's production landscapes over the past decades and the emergence of new political discourses, arguing that it is only through an understanding of the new geographies of production and consumption that structure the Veneto space—a space that is increasingly deterritorialised and decentred, suspended between its rural past and an unaccomplished urbanisation—that we can begin to understand fully the region's increasingly exclusionary identity politics, and the ways in which the globalised Veneto città diffusa that has made its fortunes on the global market and on global migrants is increasingly reacting against both and finding refuge in hyperlocalised myths of belonging. </jats:p>",

The findings are still seen as trustworthy as the experiences expressed by the participating women in data are to be seen as a contribution to an emerging understanding of the meaning of the phenomenon from a life world perspective. The findings make clear that the institutional world easily and without much resistance from the patients transgresses the boarder of their life worlds. This awakes a need to reconsider how a caring perspective can be established in practice.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A national minimum wage (NMW) was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1999 as part of New Labour's active labour-market approach. The level has been uprated on several occasions since then. Most research suggests that the NMW has benefited low-paid workers while having little adverse impact on employment levels. This paper explores the regional impact of the NMW on the small business sector, using data from the Federation of Small Businesses' biennial survey, the largest business survey in the United Kingdom. Overall, just over 21% of businesses with employees uprated employees and just under 10% of employees have benefited from pay uprates. The impact has varied across industries, with the greatest effects in the hotels and catering sector. In general, affected businesses have anticipated that they would be able to absorb the costs, although in some cases at the expense of a slight decline in profitability. The impact of the NMW also varies across the regions, having the least impact in London and the South East and the greatest impact in the ‘north‘. In the northern regions, businesses are less able to absorb the increased costs and more likely to respond by increasing prices. This has potential implications for the competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises in these regions, which is more likely to be based around price and cost advantages than their counterparts in the south. The Low Pay Commission therefore should give greater attention to the geographical impacts of the NMW in its evaluation and when proposing future increases in the rate. </jats:p>",

In this work, we report our comprehensive quality assurance (QA) procedure for commissioning this TPS. First, the accuracy of stereotaxy established with a body frame was checked to ensure accurate determination of a target position within the planning system. Second, the CT‐to‐electron density conversion curve used in the TPS was fitted to our site‐specific measurement data to ensure the accuracy of dose calculation and measurement verification in a QA phantom. Using the QA phantom, the radiological path lengths were verified against known geometrical depths to ensure the accuracy of the ray‐tracing algorithm. We also checked inter‐ and intraleaf leakage/transmission for adequate jaw settings. Measurements for dose verification were performed in various head/neck and prostate IMRT treatment plans using the patient‐specific optimized fluence maps. Both ion chamber and film were used for point dose and isodose distribution verifications. To ensure that adjacent organs at risk receive dose within the expectation, we used the Monte Carlo method to calculate dose distributions and dose‐volume histograms (DVHs) for these organs at risk. The dosimetric accuracy satisfied the published acceptability criteria. The Monte Carlo calculations confirmed the measured dose distributions for target volumes. For organs located on the beam boundary or outside the beam, some differences in the DVHs were noticed. However, the plans calculated by both methods met our clinical criteria. We conclude that the accuracy of the XKnife™ RT2 treatment‐planning system is adequate for the clinical implementation of stereotactic IMRT.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS numbers: 87.53.Xd, 87.53.Ly, 87.53.Wz</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper proposes an assembly planning approach using a multi-objective genetic algorithm (GA). The influence of tolerance and clearance on product assemblability in different assembly sequences is considered and used as a constraint in assembly planning. For a more comprehensive search for feasible non-dominated solutions, this paper proposes a multi-objective genetic algorithm that establishes different fitness functions through a fuzzy weight distribution algorithm. It also considers the experience of the decision maker. The results of the case study are given to verify the proposed approach. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The twin Mars Exploration Rovers (MER) delivered an unprecedented array of image sensors to the Mars surface. These cameras were essential for operations, science, and public engagement. The Multimission Image Processing Laboratory (MIPL) at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was responsible for the first‐order processing of all of the images returned by these cameras. This processing included reconstruction of the original images, systematic and ad hoc generation of a wide variety of products derived from those images, and delivery of the data to a variety of customers, within tight time constraints. A combination of automated and manual processes was developed to meet these requirements, with significant inheritance from prior missions. This paper describes the image products generated by MIPL for MER and the processes used to produce and deliver them.</jats:p>",
