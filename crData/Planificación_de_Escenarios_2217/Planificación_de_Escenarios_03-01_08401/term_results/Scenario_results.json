      "abstract": "<jats:p>Mere collection of failure information and accident records do not effectively relay the knowledge associated with the case to the reader. We propose to collect data in a structured manner so the message is better transferred to the information receiver. We further developed a scheme that records the essence of each failure case in a sequence of predefined phrases displayed to the recorder in a hierarchy of phrases. We call the sequence the “scenario” of the event. Arranging the phrases in descending steps and supplementing it with an illustration and a key knowledge sentence composes the visual summary of the case. A glance at the visual summary and reading the scenario steps generate a good image of the case in the receiver’s mind. Among the predefined hierarchical phrases, we call those that express the cause of the event, failure cause phrases. Recording high level failure cause phrases from the hierarchy forces the event recorder to evaluate the root cause of the failure. To the top and second level (in the phrase hierarchy) failure cause phrases, we assigned 5-space vector components to characterize each phrase in terms of “knowledge”, “carefulness”, “judgment”, “organization”, and “nature”. This vector characterization of the failure cause phrases with the scenario allows us to further characterize each failure case as a linear combination of the predefined phrases. Once each failure case has its vector characterization, we can evaluate its similarity with other cases. Also, if we find the characterization of an individual, group, or organization in the same 5-space, we can warn about failure cases with similar characteristics that are likely to happen. The method is powerful in predicting failures so they can be avoided before happening.</jats:p>",

It is shown that the metallic ground state of two-dimensional conductors, considered as a limiting case of three-dimensional quantum waveguides, is due to their multimode nature. As the thickness of the waveguide is decreased, e.g., with the aid of a “pressing” potential, the electron system undergoes a sequence of continuous quantum phase transitions involving a discrete change in the number of extended modes. The closing of the last current-carrying mode is interpreted as a phase transition of the electron system from the metallic to an insulator state. The results agree qualitatively with the observed “anomalies” of the resistance of various two-dimensional electron and hole systems.</jats:p>",

The hangs data were plotted on a substratum map to confirm that many, but not all, were naturally occurring, high relief substrata. The data were also coupled with the occurrence of juvenile cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) to assess the degree of association between juvenile gadoids and high relief substrata. The average minimal distance from a fish occurrence to a hang ranged from 8.1 to 12.0 km (4.4–6.5 nautical miles), well within the reported daily range of movement for these fish. A similar pattern was detected for the sea raven (Hemitripterus americanus), a predator of juvenile gadoids, confirming the location of these microhabitat foodwebs. On average, closing an area 3.7 km (2 nautical miles) around a hang will enclose 17–30% of the populations of these juvenile fish; a wider buffer (18–28 km; 10–15 nautical miles) will close a linearly increasing portion of the populations. Additionally, closing areas surrounding the hangs, particularly regions of high hang density, will help to minimize losses of or damage to fishing gear. We propose a win–win scenario by establishing or evaluating closed areas in regions with high concentrations of known hangs. This approach is widely applicable for many marine ecosystems and may help to achieve simultaneous conservation and resource management goals, whereby one can both protect pre-recruit fish and enhance the effectiveness of a fishery.</jats:p>",

It is expected that the government will take quick actions to improve infrastructure and remove legal and regulatory barriers to facilitate the growth of e-tailing.

Although most commonly described at diagnosis, prognosis may be defined at any time during the course of the disease and for any endpoint including response to therapy, failure of treatment, survival, or preservation of function, and so forth. To facilitate the accurate portrayal of the future, the prognosis should be defined within a specific setting, referred to as a ‘management scenario’. In the concept of a management scenario, the prognosis is defined using systematically considered prognostic factors, interventions and the outcome of interest. A deliberate and careful determination of prognosis is essential to clinical decision making and patient care.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Disruption of a terrorist attack depends on having information facilitating the identification and location of those involved in supporting, planning, and carrying out the attack. Such information arises from myriad sources, such as human or instrument surveillance by intelligence or law enforcement agencies, a variety of documents concerning transactions, and tips from a wide range of occasional observers. Given the enormous amount of information available, a method is needed to cull and analyze only that which is relevant to the task, confirm its validity, and eliminate the rest. The risk‐based methodology for scenario tracking, intelligence gathering, and analysis for countering terrorism builds on the premise that in planning, supporting, and carrying out a terrorist plot, those involved will conduct a series of related activities for which there may be some observables and other acquirable evidence. Those activities taken together constitute a <jats:italic>threat scenario</jats:italic>. Information consistent with a realistic threat scenario may be useful in thwarting an impending attack. Information not consistent with any such scenario is irrelevant. Thus, the methodology requires a comprehensive set of realistic threat scenarios that would form a systemic process for collecting and analyzing information. It also requires a process for judging the validity and usefulness of such information. The key questions for intelligence gathering and analysis are: how to produce a comprehensive set of threat scenarios, how to winnow that set to a subset of most likely scenarios, what supplementary intelligence is worth pursuing, how to judge the relevance of available information, and how to validate and analyze the information. The methodology presented in this paper can serve as a vehicle with which to enable the intelligence community to better: (a) assess the intent and capabilities of terrorist groups, (b) develop and compare terrorist scenarios from different sources and aggregate the set that should guide decisions on intelligence collection, (c) assess the possible distributions of responsibility for intelligence gathering and analysis across various homeland security agencies at the federal, state, and local levels, and (d) establish effective collection priorities to meet the demands of counterterrorism. Some of the critical issues addressed in this paper include: (1) how to create a reasonably complete set of scenarios and filter it down to a more manageable set to establish intelligence collection priorities, (2) how to integrate the wide variety of intelligence sources associated with monitoring for terrorism and analytically account for the corresponding disparities in information reliability, and (3) how to incorporate these new methodologies into existing information management efforts related to protecting our nation's critical infrastructures. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this transition, single autonomously reproducing cells became parts of larger reproducing entities that eventually constituted a new unit of selection. The first step in the evolutionary transition to multicellularity likely was the evolution of simple, undifferentiated cell clusters. However, what the selective advantage of such cell clusters may have been remains unclear. Here, we argue that in populations of unicellular organisms with cooperative behavior, clustering may be beneficial by reducing interactions with noncooperative individuals. In support of this hypothesis, we present a set of computer simulations showing that clustering can evolve as a biological, heritable trait for cells that cooperate in the use of external energy resources. Following the evolution of simple cell clusters, further benefits could have arisen from the exchange of resources between cells of a cluster.</jats:p>",

Different strategies for initiating therapy were compared by calculating the expected HAART administration rate and 1-year cumulative AIDS incidence in three different population settings, varying in the stage of HIV-1 infection at the time of presentation. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p> Among 695 HIV-1-infected cohort participants, the 1-year AIDS incidence density (ID) ranged from 3.2 per 100 person-years for CD4 cell counts 600–700 cells/mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>, to 31.9 per 100 person-years for CD4 cell counts 100–200 cells/mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> and 77.9 per 100 person-years for CD4 cell counts below 100 cells/mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. Upon initiation of HAART, the ID in the lowest CD4 strata declined to 13.3 and 16.3 per 100 person-years, respectively. Extrapolated to developing countries, supply of HAART to patients presenting with HIV-1 infection below 200 CD4 cells/mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> is expected to give an administration rate of 67%, while the AIDS incidence will drop from over 30% to almost 10%. </jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p> Introduction of HAART in populations with advanced HIV-1 infection can accomplish a threefold reduction of the AIDS incidence when HAART is administered to patients with CD4 cell counts below 200 cells/mm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>.
