Attention has been paid to the landscape treatment within legislative grounds, and correspondingly in planning practice. Few assumptions have been made, upon the lack of methodological and integrated approach to the landscape protection and management. Strategic plans (spatial and town master plans), sectoral plans and policies (for soil, forestry etc) have been reviewed in attempt to verify the stated assumptions. The problems of landscape and open green space protection and maintenance have been brought up. In reference to the EU recommendations, legislation and instruments have been investigated regarding the entrenchment of the landscape concept and landscape planning into the spatial, environmental and related sectoral planning. Prior to the landscape concept implementation is the survey and establishment of regional landscape diversification so as to differentiate regional approaches to landscape planning.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the actual Swiss cantonal planning practice every 10 years in general, there is a review of the guiding plan. The plan?s evaluation typically takes place shortly before the revision process. In the interstitial time, the guiding plan?s effectiveness can only be anticipated. In the review, a survey of both, the desired and unwanted spatial effects are often absent. As a result, a thorough analysis of the effects and the direction of the spatial development cannot be accomplished. A spatial plan that is geared to the principle of sustainability needs the outputs of such an analysis. Development assessments are required to verify the plans? effects, well-defined goals to assist in rectifying deviations, key indicators to identify efficiency potentials, and precautionary measures to allow for an adaptable and responsive planning methodology. The instruments, which might assist in the cantonal guiding plan objectives implementation, do exist. Such instruments are monitoring, controlling and benchmarking (with the support of indicators). These tools can assist in ensuring the plan?s overall value and the effectiveness and appropriateness of the ensuing development. By using these tools and a sound planning methodology, unsustainable spatial development can be tracked early and rectified with appropriated measures. The control as this system?s central instrument is presented here and its application opportunities in the cantonal guiding planning are discussed. In order to achieve a sustainable spatial development and a more dynamic guiding planning, the application of control and benchmarking is crucial.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Preventing unintended pregnancy among HIV-positive women through family planning (FP) services is one of the four cornerstones of a comprehensive program for prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). Reducing unintended pregnancies among HIV-positive women would yield a reduction in infections among infants and a reduction in the number of children potentially orphaned when parents die of AIDS-related illnesses. It also reduces HIV-positive women's vulnerability to morbidity and mortality related to pregnancy and lactation. In addition, family planning for both HIV-positive and -negative women safeguards their health by enabling them to space births. This brief focuses on findings from Horizons studies on the extent to which voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) and PMTCT programs address family planning. In Kenya and Zambia, the Horizons Program collaborated with NARESA and the MTCT Working Group, respectively, and UNICEF to document the acceptability, operational barriers, costs, and impact of pilot PMTCT services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>General practice has been the subject of extensive reforms over the 1990s in Australia as elsewhere. Reforms have attempted to improve quality and contain the overall cost of health care, and have often been seen as reducing the autonomy of medical professionals. This paper examines the impact of financial constraints and incentives introduced during the 1990s on Australian GPs' perceptions of autonomy. An existing seven component definition of autonomy and six themes that emerged from reviewing publications were used to construct focus group questions. A total of 25 GPs participated in four focus groups. Those who participated believe that their financial autonomy has been diminished by policy changes and  consumer expectations. They also perceive that their ability to control clinical decisions, which they regard as the most important aspect of professional autonomy, has been reduced along with financial autonomy. Organized medicine in Australia sees financial accountability and  clinical decision making as polar opposites, and has continued to argue that fee‐for‐service payment is the only appropriate method of remuneration, despite increasing evidence that this does not guarantee clinical autonomy. Major changes to the financing of general practice in Australia are required to address the concerns of GPs, governments and patients. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The capacity of society to understand and successfully adapt to new situations is highly related to the levels of training and education of its individual members. The education system, therefore, is one of the main foundations of any society's future. Over the last decade, Spain and the Valencia region, in particular, have experienced precipitous drops in fertility that will inevitably reduce school enrolments. In this paper we quantify the magnitude of the reductions and, after some analysis, lay out the potential consequences for the regional education system, and for society as a whole. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<JATS1:p>Strategy—and the planning that created it—has too often failed to deliver its promised results. The reasons for this failure are many and varied, but include an over-reliance on the next big thing in strategic methodology, a failure to recognize and deal with the total change that strategy requires in an organization, and an inability to deal with uncertainty. Wilson argues that strategy is a subtle and demanding art, far more than it is a science or a methodology.</JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>• To succeed in dealing with complex, interacting forces inside and outside the organization, strategy must: • Deal with the totality of the organization in the context of its total environment (not just one function or one facet of the organization) • Learn to harness the power of opposites (the sometimes conflicting objectives of the organization, e.g., the long term and short term; vision and execution; economic constraints and social responsibility) • Deal constructively with pervasive uncertainty in its future • Develop a strategic vision • Create a culture that fosters a strategic mindset throughout the organization.</JATS1:p>\n          <JATS1:p>Without constant change and adaptation, a strategy will fail. Continuing success depends, therefore, upon constant learning from customers, competitors, changes in our environment, and our own mistakes.</JATS1:p>"

Written for the nonexpert, leaders in religious settings will find Cahalan's guidance clear and invaluable. Presenting evaluation as a form of collaborative inquiry, Cahalan show how leaders can use evaluation design to develop effective project plans and prepare case statements for donors or grant proposals for foundations. She introduces project planning and evaluation as mission-related practices and invites leaders to consider how their tradition's particular mission and beliefs influence the way they plan and evaluate. Cahalan concludes the book by making explicit her own theological presuppositions—that the virtues of discernment, stewardship, and prudence are essential for good project planning and evaluation</p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Although Uganda has been widely recognized for lowering HIV incidence, the number of orphaned children is still rising. By the end of 2001, there were 880,000 children under age 15 living in Uganda who had lost one or both parents to HIV/AIDS and many more vulnerable children whose parents are alive but living with HIV infection. Few programs exist to help families before a parent’s death, and there is little research on the effectiveness of existing programs for AIDS-affected children. In 1999, Makerere University and Horizons initiated a study in two largely rural districts of Uganda with small urban and peri-urban populations to assess the outcomes of two programs being implemented by the Ugandan office of Plan: succession planning (SP) and orphan support (OS). SP reaches HIV-positive parents, their children, and standby guardians while the family is still in a position to plan for the children’s future. OS serves only orphaned children and their guardians. This brief describes the effects of the SP program on the actions taken by HIV-positive parents and standby guardians to plan and provide for the future of their children. A subsequent publication will examine the effects of the OS program.</jats:p>"

The data come from a health information system of a non‐governmental organization with a decade of experience in health services delivery in Samburu District, Kenya. The differential referral patterns from two communities are examined in some detail to shed more light on the meaning of a ‘referral rate’ in this context. First, referral rates over time for two clinics are calculated and compared. These quantitative data, obtained from monthly reports from 1989 to 1997, are interpreted in the light of qualitative data obtained from interviews with community health workers, nurses and members of the communities. The main differences in referral between these ostensibly similar communities are for malaria, trauma and anaemia. Social, environmental and specific health services factors are used to explain these differences. We demonstrate that basic information from health information systems, which tell us little on their own because referral in this context is a rare event, can be combined with local knowledge from the community to provide evidence for health managers to set priorities for public health and clinical interventions.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Improving the quality of clinical care in developing country settings is a difficult task, both in public sector settings where supervision is infrequent and in private sector settings where supervision and certification are non‐existent. This study tested a low‐cost method, self‐assessment, for improving the quality of care that providers offer in a peri‐urban area in Mali. The study was a cross‐sectional, case–control study on the impact of self‐assessment on compliance with the quality of care standards. The two indicators of interest were the compliance with fever care standards and the compliance with structural quality standards. Both standards were derived from the Ministry of Health of Mali's standards for health care delivery. The study examined 36 providers, 12 of whom were part of the intervention and 24 of whom were part of the control group over a 3 month period from May to July 2001. Overall, the research team found a significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of overall compliance (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.001) and in terms of assessment of fever (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> &lt; 0.005). The total costs for the intervention for 36 providers was less than US$250, which translated to approximately $6 per provider. The data appear to suggest that self‐assessment, when used in a regular fashion, can have a significant effect on compliance with standards. However, it is clear that self‐assessment is not a resource‐neutral intervention. All of the individuals from the intervention pool interviewed cited the extra work that they had to do to comply with the intervention protocol as a burden. In particular, study participants put an emphasis on the ‘long duration’ of the study that ‘discouraged’ the study participants. Future research on self‐assessment should include a larger sample of providers and should examine the impact of self‐assessment over time. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The study examines the costs of providing the services in a selected number of facilities in order to examine the reasons behind cost differences, assess the efficiency of service delivery, and determine whether management improvements might achieve cost savings without hurting quality. This assessment is important to African countries with ambitious goals for improving maternal health but scarce public health resources and limited government budgets. The study also evaluates the costs that consumers pay to use the maternal health services, along with the contribution that revenues from fees for services make to recovering health facility costs.</jats:p><jats:p>The authors find that costs differ between hospitals and health centres as well as among mission and public facilities in the study sample. The variation is explained by differences in the role of the facility, use and availability of materials and equipment, number and level of personnel delivering services, and utilization levels of services. The report concludes with several policy implications for improvements in efficiency, financing options and consumer costs. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Our objectives in this chapter are as follows: • Discuss the development of an Implementation Strategy. • Discuss the requirements for a Project Execution Plan. • Review the requirements for a Quality Plan to support the processes involved in development and implementation of an IDCM solution. • Consider an initial set of risks that can be useful to capture at the commencement of an IDCM implementation, and discuss the requirements for an Issue Register and Risk Register. • Review the requirement for the development of an effective Change Management Strategy and action plan. • Consider the contents of an effective Communication Plan for an enterprise IDCM implementation. • Discuss the typical requirements for a Data Migration Strategy to migrate existing (relevant) document registers and objects to the IDCM. • Consider scenarios for backfile conversion of (relevant) hard-copy documents and the development of a Backfile Conversion Strategy. • Consider the typical requirements for training and development of a Training Plan. • Define a strategy for testing the configured IDCM, covering System Integration Testing and System Acceptance Testing strategies, and the development of Test Specifications and Test Plan(s). • Review the importance of the Postimplementation Review study in the evolutionary deployment of an IDCM solution.</jats:p>"

They have influenced the technique of planning but only to a lesser extent the procedures of planning and the methodology of plan-making. More recently, information technology has challenged the whole concept of planning as an expert-and-government interplay. However, legal frameworks have not reflected the substantial change in the potentials of the technology.Any effort to reflect the new technology will face not only institutional inertia but increasingly also the human capacity of users of planning (i.e., decision-makers, administrators, stakeholders), namely the limited extent of overall IT literacy, which restricts the possible benefits of the technology. The dimension of access to and empowerment in planning may reappear in the context of new technologies, with new professional requirements for planners, beyond the computer, GIS and information technology.</jats:p>"

First, we develop a locally elastic contact model to describe the nonlinear coupling between the contact force and elastic deformation at the individual contact. Further, a set of “compatibility” equations are given so that the elastic deformations among all contacts in the workpiece-fixture system result in a consistent set of rigid-body displacement of the workpiece in its global system. We define the minimum norm of the elastic deformation at contacts as the objective function, then, formulate the problem of determining of the optimal clamping forces as a constrained nonlinear programming problem, which guarantees that the fixturing of the workpiece is passive force closure. The proposed planning method of optimal clamping forces is illustrated with numerical example.</jats:p>",

Several business sectors are considered. Some of the information systems and technologies available on the market to support planning initiatives are examined. The relevance of managing documents and their content is discussed in the context of a strategic planning framework that takes into account matters such as regulatory compliance and commercial processes. Our view is that effective application of IDCM strategy cannot be undertaken unless attention is paid to the general context of an organization’s business processes and the IT environment in which they operate. Our objectives are to do the following: • Outline the enterprise business planning framework. • Consider the commercial landscape and review some of the issues that may impact on business planning. • Consider the regulatory landscape and review some of the legislative, administrative regulations, and standards that may impact on business planning. • Reflect on the IT landscape and the implications for business planning. • Discuss at a conceptual level the role of document management systems as a key enabler of business planning. • Consider the overall implications of fragmented and mismanaged document environments on business planning.</jats:p>"

These two directives provide for the creation of a Europe-wide network of nature reserves — termed “Natura 2000”; this network is to be protected from any destructive influences, firstly by means on a prohibition on impairment and disturbance, and secondly by requiring FFH impact assessment. Comparatively little attention has been given so far to one question of particular importance in planning practice, namely whether FFH impact assessment is also to be mandatory within comprehensive spatial-planning procedures. Consequently, this article attempts to shed light on the areas where European nature-protection law and German spatial-planning procedures come into contact with each other.</jats:p>"

Many of these problems can be solved with the help of a computer model of the course of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the building created by a construction technology network diagram. The CONTEC integrated project planning, management and quality control system based on these diagrams has been used for bidding, planning and managing the reconstruction process of several significant historical buildings in Prague and other cities.</jats:p>"

As the company’s business expanded, the inadequacies of the founder/president’s management competencies, and the lack of effective corporate information systems, resulted in serious organizational and operational problems. The case illustrates the problems that can develop quickly when an organization does not have defined goals, effective management and supporting information systems.</jats:p>"

Tool orientation determination and tool collision avoidance are critical issues for 5-axis pencil-cut tool path planning. Detailed techniques of haptic rendering and tool interference avoidance are discussed for haptic-aided 5-axis pencil-cut tool path generation. Hardware and software implementation of the haptic pencil-cut system with practical examples are also presented in this paper.</jats:p>",

Ron's parents took over the farm in 1947, and with the advent of the bulldozer, clearing of Watkin's property and surrounding district began in earnest during the 1950s. Clearing continued as fast \"as money permitted\", until almost the last natural vegetation was knocked down in 1978 (Fig. 1).

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper reviews recent approaches to human action planning and the cognitive representation of intentional actions. Evidence suggests that action planning takes place in terms of anticipated features of the intended goal, that is, in terms of action effects. These effects are acquired from early infancy on by registering contingencies between movements and perceptual movement outcomes. Co-occurrence of movements and effects leads to the creation of bidirectional associations between the underlying internal codes, thus establishing distributed perception-action networks subserving both perceiving external events and intentionally producing them. Action plans determine only the general, goal-relevant features of intended actions, while the fine-tuning is left to on-line sensory-motor processing. Action plans emerge from competition for action control between several factors: overlearned habits, perceptual events, and emotional influences, among others. Accordingly, action control represents a balance between personal intentions and wishes on the one hand and environmental affordances and demands on the other.</jats:p>"

However, as school investments in ICT increase and they become more reliant on ICT, effective planning becomes more central to schools’ ability to maximize their use of technology. This research examines ICT planning in schools and proposes a four-stage model of the evolution of ICT planning maturity in schools. The model emerges from case studies conducted in eight New Zealand primary schools and provides insight into the nature of ICT planning in schools and the factors that contribute to planning maturity.</jats:p>"

The map of the environment is built during the real-time robot navigation with its sensor information that is limited to a short range. The real-time robot path is generated through the dynamic activity landscape of the neural network. The effectiveness and the efficiency are demonstrated by simulation studies.</jats:p>"

The relevance of knowledge management components in disaster planning has been underscored by the large-scale terror attacks of September 11, 2001. The objective of the chapter is to provide a different perspective on the risk management category of business continuity planning or disaster recovery. Specifically, the authors show how most plans ignore or downplay the essential requirement for the organization to preserve its critical knowledge resources in the event the possessors of that knowledge are killed. Most proponents of Knowledge Management have neglected this important facet of the field. At the same time, the risk management and disaster recovery fields have ignored the important contributions of Knowledge Management to a viable business continuity plan.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is hard to find good news stories about disasters. Disasters seriously damage an organisation’s health. Of businesses that experience a disaster, 40 per cent never reopen and 30 per cent close within 2 years. Perhaps because of this, over 80 per cent of UK facility managers in a recent survey now report that they maintain a Business Continuity Plan which most of them review at least once a year. An increasing number, however, now find themselves responsible for a portfolio of international facilities spanning continents and time zones. This paper looks at some real life implications of global business recovery planning. In the wake of September 11th, one can hardly do less. This paper provides strategies and justifications for international emergency planning procedures and processes. Practitioners will gain valuable information from actual events and case studies to validate the concepts offered as a model. It may seem that some of the information and processes which are outlined in this paper are obvious; but that is the point. The obvious can be overlooked, and excuses can be made for the lack of implementation of emergency plans. But those excuses will not stand in the light of real disasters and cataclysmic events.</jats:p>",

Local  adaptation was performed in two different ways: 1) by selecting local  data from a database with the MSN method and using that data as a  database in the basic k-nearest neighbour (k-nn) MSN method, 2) by  selecting a combination of neighbours from the neighbourhood where the  average of the predictor variables was closest to the target stand  predictor variables (Locally Adaptable Neighbourhood (LAN) MSN method).  The study data used comprised 209 spruce dominated stands located in  central Finland and was collected with harvesters. The accuracy of the  methods was analysed by estimating the tree stock characteristics and  the log length/diameter distribution produced by a bucking simulation.  The local k-nn MSN method was not notably better than the k-nn MSN  method, although it produced less biased estimates on the edges of the  input space. The LAN MSN method was found to be a more accurate method  than the k-nn methods.</ja:p>"

An important feature of our approach is that the planning domain is the workspace of the mobile robot rather than its configuration space. The basic idea is to imagine the robot being subjected to Brownian motion forcing, and to generate evolving probability density functions (PDF) that describe all attainable positions and orientations of the robot at a given value of time. By planning a path that optimizes the value of this PDF at each instant in time, we generate a feasible trajectory. The PDF of robot pose can be constructed by solving the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation using the Fourier transform for SE(N). A closed-form approximation of the resulting time-dependent PDF is then used to plan a trajectory based on the observation that the evolution of this “workspace density” is a diffusion process. Examples are provided to illustrate the algorithm.</jats:p>",

Nonholonomicity arises in many mechanical systems subject to nonintegrable velocity constraints or nonintegrable conservation laws. When the total angular momentum is zero, the control problem of system can be converted to the motion planning problem for a driftless control system. In this paper, we propose an optimal control approach for nonholonomic motion planning. The genetic algorithm is used to optimize the performance of motion planning to connect the initial and final configurations and to generate a feasible trajectory for a nonholonomic system. The feasible trajectory and its control inputs are searched through a genetic algorithm. The effectiveness of the genetic algorithm is demonstrated by numerical simulation.</jats:p>",

The parametric thrift of fractional potentials permits smooth variations of the potential in function of the distance to obstacles without requiring design of geometric charge distribution. In the approach we use, the fractional order of differentiation is the risk coefficient associated to obstacles. A convex danger map towards a target and a convex geodesic distance map are defined. Real-time computation can also lead to the shortest minimum danger trajectory, or to the least dangerous of minimum length trajectories.</jats:p>",

The main challenges are to maintain the shapes of the flexible elements during processing and to control precisely the geometries of adjacent regions of part material without either damaging the flexible elements or being hindered by them. The solutions involve sequences of controlled deposition and/or removal of part material and sacrificial “buffer” material. Functional considerations concerning strength and fatigue life may induce additional constraints on the processing sequence. Where conventional material removal is impractical, we present a new approach involving a hybrid of photolithography and shape deposition manufacturing. Alternative methods of achieving similar functions without cross-boundary embedding can ease fabrication and even improve performance. Design and process selection guidelines have been composed based on fabrication experience.</jats:p>",

Despite a considerable amount of publications on this subject, however, to the best of my knowledge, none of them has enjoyed a linguistic basis.1 When we talk about the history or evolution of a language, we must provide a firm linguistic basis for our claims. This essay aims to demonstrate the contributions of the Samanid Period to the development of Persian from a socio-linguistic point of view, that of \"language planning\". In my opinion, the Samanids were the first authorities that adopted a scientific and systematic approach to saving the Persian language from a gradual death.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Although many studies have been conducted and reported on ERP implementation cases in the developed countries, there is not much literature on the experiences of companies in Asia and other parts of the developing world. These organizations confront issues that are significantly different from those faced by companies in the developed world, because of differences in the sophistication of IT use, and cultural and social contexts. This chapter describes a three-stage model for analyzing the deployment of ERP in developing countries, based on an empirical study of ERP implementation exercises in Indian organizations. Each stage describes a specific aspect of the implementation process. The specific characteristics of each stage and their implications for managers have also been discussed.</jats:p>"

The use of Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP) and system design (CASD) applications in the early stages of a new engine program can greatly increase the reliability and quality of the solutions upon which these decisions are made. They can also reduce the engineering time and the time to evaluate proposals from system integrators. This leads to shorter product launch windows giving manufacturers a competitive edge. This paper reports upon a case study conducted to evaluate the state of the art in of CAPP and CASD technology based on a typical configuration of commercial and evolving software applications. The results show maturity of the technology in most of the core technologies. Challenges exist in integrating these solutions into a manufacturer’s working environment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Customer satisfaction is key for survival and success in today’s consumer market. It is crucial that the customer be used to differentiate between different variants of a product, also known as a company’s product portfolio. Numerous examples in industry prove the benefit of a platform strategy in product development. The aim is to capture a wider market share by launching a number of products based on a common platform and to reduce design and development cost by reducing design cycle time. In this paper we explore the possibility of using high level customer needs alone to define the product’s base platform and differentiating modules. The basic idea is to outline platform and differentiating modules during conceptual design stage of product development and thus plan a product family before we consider any architecture. Planning platforms in conceptual design stage reduces additional costs associated with designing, manufacturing and managing resources for each variant separately. We use design tools such as the functional basis and functional modeling in our approach. In this work we seek to validate the technique by first applying it to existing products and comparing the results against known product platforms. In this paper we outline platform and differentiating modules for a bike and shop vacuum. Future work will focus on applying this approach for more products and finally to new products during conceptual design stage.</jats:p>",

After introducing the basis of the strategic planning tradition model, which suggests the subordination of the Information Systems (IS) to the Business Strategy, we propose a new model that views the IS as an strategic instrument suited for the strategy formulation stage, rather than operational tools for the strategy control phase. Success in the application of this model we call “Concurrent Business/IS Strategic Planning Model” will closely depend on the consistency, coherence and soundness of the IS, both internal and external. In order to contrast the level of application of this model, an empirical case-study fieldwork was undertaken to rise up some empirical evidence on the degree of alignment between the entrepreneurial practice and the theoretical model proposed. This last section contains the main results arising from the empirical analysis.</jats:p>"

In both eastern and western Germany it is leading to dramatic changes in spatial structures and throwing up new challenges for spatial planning. It is, however, important to note that shrinkage and growth can often be found side by side and in extremely close proximity to each other. It is against this background that the author explores the changes which need to be made to spatial planning and possible perspectives for steering development. The combination of “top-down” framework steering and “bottom-up” co-ordination — i.e. an incentive-oriented, multi-tiered form of steering — could, it is argued, be a helpful approach to facilitate more differentiated reactions than have previously been possible to the local particularities of development processes.</jats:p>"

The optimization problem is first solved with no constraint. Consequently, the nonlinear inequality constraints, which model obstacles, are added to the problem. The formulation has been derived using Pontryagin Minimum Principle and results in a Two Point Boundary Value Problem (TPBVP). The problem is solved for a cooperative manipulator system consisting of two 3-DOF serial robots jointly carrying an object and the results are compared with those obtained from a search algorithm. Defining the obstacles in workspace as functions of joint space coordinates, the inequality constrained optimization problem is solved for the cooperative manipulators.</jats:p>",

System dynamics is a methodology for analyzing and understanding how complex systems change over time. System dynamic models have been developed for a broad range of information to client applications - from resource management problems to the mapping of stocks and flows on factory floors. The problem faced by many users of system dynamic models is their graphic complexity for users not trained in the field. This paper addresses new research into visualization of system dynamics models to make client information more efficient and accessible. This research involves the use of narrative, video and sound embedded in statistical material. This paper also considers one particular client group - that of politicians, planners and civil society in developing countries.</jats:p>"

The intent is to help novices understand and solve problems in their own words through the construction of natural-language style pseudocode as the first step in solving a programming problem. We have designed an environment supporting coached program planning and have used it in a human-to-human, computer-mediated evaluation of 16 novice programmers enrolled in a pre-CS1 programming course at the University of Pittsburgh. The results show that students who underwent coached program planning, compared to those who did not, were more prolific with comments in their programs, committed fewer structural mistakes, and exhibited less erratic programming behavior during their implementation. The dialogues collected from this experiment followed a clear 4-step pattern. Starting with this observation, we are developing a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system called the Pseudocode Tutor to support coached program planning.</jats:p>",

Analysis of case studies shows that the projects investigated have indeed had a considerable positive impact on regional development. The effects achieved go far beyond the projects themselves. This success can be primarily put down to the exceptional situation in the regions under review, effectively a “state of emergency”, brought about by such large-scale, environmentally focused co-operation projects and acting as the driving force for regional action. Recommendations concerning regional development and policy are made on the basis of findings from the case studies.</jats:p>"

This has led to wind-energy utilisation — and how to accommodate it — becoming one of the hottest topics of the day in spatial planning. It is against this backdrop, and in the light of a number of important recent changes to the law, that this article presents a critical analysis and survey of the current state of play and offers practical suggestions and recommendations on approaches to wind-energy utilisation.</jats:p>"

This study tried to generalize Universal Design concept in the planning of fishing port redevelopment Chatan town in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. In traditional town planning process of Japan, it was led by administrative organizations with limited public involvement. But in this study, we would like to introduce the idea of Public Involvement, especially participation of land users and investors on town and fishing port redevelopment planning procedure from the very early step of plan to the final decision of land zoning, nearly for the first working example in Japan. And as for the construction plan of project, Universal Design concept is also accepted as main motto based on angle of the most economically but considering natural environment and human need and high technical assistance. For example, regarding the planning of roads and facilities, accessibility of aged and handicapped people was considered as important factor. In this paper, it was shown of the results of facility planning, project establishment and resident involvement on the town planning under the concept of Universal Design.</jats:p>",

It is only having recently begun a a new research project that I have realized just how different things are now. Even more has changed since the ending of minority rule, as there has been a restructuring of both the State Archives Service and of the libraries of national deposit, as discussed later in this paper. The paper emerges from my reflections at this time and discusses both my experience of using archives in South Africa in the past and some of the resources which I have been able to make use of in planning my next research trip. My original research was on Afrikaner nationalist politics and identities in the 1930s and 1940s, and I now plan to work on Afrikaner moderates and English-speakers in the United Party during the same period, examining issues of identity and ideology, imperialism and nationalism. My work has taken me to several different archives in South Africa, which fall into two distinct types. The first of these are government archives, and the second are university archives. This paper will draw on my experiences of the archives I visited in 1997 and 1998, and on a brief trip I made to South Africa in 2002.</jats:p><jats:p>Government archives in South Africa are held by the National Archives of South Africa (NASA), established in 1996 by the National Archives of South Africa Act (No. 43 of 1996).

An intelligent sensor serves runtime data from bottom up to facilitate high-level decision-making. It assures that correct decisions are made in a timely manner, if compared with the best estimations of engineers. Being an adaptive system, a so-designed framework will improve the flexibility and dynamism of shop floor operations, and provide a seamless integration among process planning, resource scheduling, job execution, process monitoring, and device control.

The reasons for which the traditional total replacement strategy is not universally applicable or viable are discussed, and research is presented which tests many of the assertions made for the mandatory replacement of posterior teeth. Evidence is presented of the growing prosthodontic challenge posed by an increasing number of middle-aged and older partially dentate individuals in society: many of their remaining teeth are in poor condition, yet few such patients are willing to accept the prospect of becoming edentulous. The shortened dental arch concept is discussed and proposed as an appropriate strategy when complex intervention is to be avoided, inadvisable, or not possible. At the population level, current evidence suggests that prosthodontic strategies aimed at the restoration and/or replacement of all lost molars may be inappropriate in older, partially dentate individuals. A more limited yet targeted strategy is both more effective and more efficient, and should not be seen as compromised care.</jats:p>"

This chapter discusses the contingent nature of information systems strategic planning (ISSP) practices and presents the results of an empirical study of ISSP and the role of IS within 90 leading companies in South Africa. Results of a partial least squares analysis demonstrate the significant effect that perceptions of the future strategic role of IS within an organization have on ISSP behavior. Moreover, it was found that those organizations in the strategic quadrant of the McFarlan grid emphasized ISSP activities, committed more resources to the ISSP process and attributed greater importance to ISSP-business strategic planning integration mechanisms, than those organizations in the other quadrants of the grid. The relationship between ISSP and IS function performance was also significantly higher for firms in the strategic IS environment.</jats:p>"

After describing the background to these policy changes, we consider how one central tenet of the new realism—the need to manage demand—is taking shape within the local transport planning process in Cambridgeshire and Leicester. We argue that although a 'climate of desperation' exists in each case over levels of traffic growth and their associated impacts, policy learning and change have been confined to a 'weak' interpretation of new realism where transport planning remains effectively subservient to prevailing local notions of how economic competitiveness ought to be promoted. In conclusion, we argue that this poses fundamental challenges for national government's transport and sustainable development policies. </jats:p>",

Data was collected from faculty, students and campus leaders through a series of focus groups, interviews and online surveys. Findings were examined in light of the literature on technology adoption and the authors’ familiarity with portal initiatives at other large public universities. Participants described their vision of the ideal portal solution in terms of features, user interface and functionality. While faculty and students expressed enthusiasm about a campus portal, they also had concerns regarding training, support, reliability, security and standards. The authors make recommendations for addressing user concerns such as providing direction and leadership, segmenting the rollout, communicating the benefits and providing organizational support.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Most current information systems (IS) planning methodologies are focused on achieving ‘successful’ plans, i.e., plans that provide competitive advantage, can be implemented in a given period of time, and that solve the problems of information needs by taking advantage of the latest technologies available. Concerns are technology and business driven and focus on how to get the maximum profit for organisations from investing in information systems. However, this relatively narrow focus can be problematic, especially in developing countries, where the social contexts of IS implementation may require a different primary focus. This chapter presents a methodology for IS planning based on critical systems thinking—an approach that encourages the critical analysis of stakeholder understandings of social contexts prior to the selection and/or design of planning methods. The methodology presented in this chapter uses a combination of the systems theories of autopoiesis and boundary critique, which deepen our understanding of what it means to reflect on participation, values, and social concerns during IS planning. In the course of applying the methodology in a project in Colombia, an issue arose of the ethics of the practitioner. To address this issue, following completion of the project, we sought to enhance critical systems thinking with Foucault’s notions of power and ethics, which offer interesting alternatives for practitioner self-reflection. Implications for IS planning are derived from this perspective on ethics and power.</jats:p>"

Subjective and objective aspects of a career narrative are explored, and emphasis is placed on co-authoring a career story that is subjectively meaningful and objectively sound. The client's subjective understanding of the career story is given importance as being pivotal information that must be considered in career counseling.

The natural forest area is approximately 4.8 million hectares and for the near future there will be a need to increase the planted area. To avoid or minimize the impact of mechanized practices on forest soils, the reduced tillage has been developed. The aim of this work is to define the technical priorities of the reduced tillage for eucalyptus seedlings, using quality function deployment (QDF). The design requirements classified as the most important to attend seedling demands were the furrow width and depth, and clod sizes. QFD has the potential to be applied to agro-forestry systems to translate plant demands into technical requirements.</jats:p>"

Through systematic and early VVT strategy planning and continuous monitoring of the product development activities rework can be avoided and significant product lifecycle cost reductions can be achieved. In this paper a VVT process modeling procedure is described, which offers an effective method for reducing programmatic and technical risk through providing valuable assistance in the VVT strategy planning process. Programmatic risk reduction in the VVT process modeling procedure can be achieved by the elimination of redundant VVT activities, optimization of test schedule and restructuring of VVT activities into clusters based on the input needs of the tests and the deliveries of the product development activities. Through iterations in the VVT process during VVT strategy planning, the most effective combination of VVT activities can be found for the VVT goals and objectives. Iterations in the VVT process modeling procedure can be made based on the different durations, costs and effects on quality of the different VVT activities and methods applied at different points in the product lifecycle. Since the VVT strategy planning is an iterative process, the VVT process modeling procedure can be used to update the VVT process after every critical decision and milestone in the product development. The modeling concept for verification, validation and testing processes introduced in this paper, is currently being developed in a European research project, called SysTest (more information on the SysTest project can be found under: http://www.secoe.org/0105.htm).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>While the bending sequence planning has been intensively studied, design of the motion path of a sheet metal part in the bending operation tends to be ignored by researchers. Because during the bending operation, the space for maneuvering a sheet metal part is very small, collisions between the part and bending tools are likely to occur. When a robot is used to handle the part, the role of an automatic path-planning tool becomes more significant. In this study, an evolutionary pathplanning approach for robot-assisted handling of sheet metal parts in bending is proposed and implemented. The proposed approach globally searches the motion path space to identify feasible paths. Collision detection algorithms based on segment intersection are used to check the feasibility of the generated paths. This method can automatically design feasible handling operations for a robot. A simulation example on a simple “V” shaped part demonstrates that the approach is efficient and practical.</jats:p>",

The iterative procedure includes several heuristic algorithms to generate a radial network, to choose a set of open feeders to meet the reliability constraint, and to solve the reconfiguration problem in order to reduce the power–loss costs. Furthermore, in order to compare the reliability of potential solutions, a predictive reliability assessment measure is established.</jats:p>",

The person centred planning method, as it is termed, has been well established in working with adults with special needs but can be extrapolated to encounters with children. It focuses on three fundamental areas: relationship, meaning and narrative. In underscoring these areas, the method restrains the bureaucracy and experience of stigma that is often present for those residing in state care. On a wider plane, the paper argues that the method stands as a veritable example of Habermas's ideas concerning the application of communicative rationality and discursive democracy in social life.</jats:p>",

For each link, a spring connected to a jack (prismatic joint) is used to push the wheel against the wall of the pipe. The robot is actuated by DC motors applied on the wheels. The aim of the study is to define the trajectory of the robot in a curved pipe. Several experiments have shown that in this case, the robot may be stopped in some parts of the elbows. The path planning is performed assuming that the robot motion is very slow. An energetic method is used in order to detect the locking zones, and to define the best trajectories avoiding these locking phenomena.</jats:p>",

Contemporary tourism demands important areas of original or well protected environment, because only on this areas can be develops planned and brings economic and social advantages to domicile population (receptive) and to tourists (initiative). Science and practice for needs of tourism considers line of positive relations toward environment, because some of her elements are special tourist values. For need of tourism is underlines need of acceptation principles of active protection environment, because it is always better to plan, than to reclaim negative effects. In work which treats environment, modern tourism and planning, is appeared to scope of international tourism in world and dynamics of tourism development in a last six decades. It was special emphasized relations between tourism and nature, because in many countries offer of natural tourist values is more massive than offer of monuments. It is a word about need of nature protection for tourism, because nature is a real tourist value only when she is authentic or well protected.

Notwithstanding this exercise, the writer contends that in the face of the research, literature, legislation and expertise in relation to designing out crime, papers issued by ODPM and the form of the tender document itself demonstrate that it remains uncommitted to many of the accepted principles of design‐against‐crime and to the cross‐cutting crime reduction obligations of the police and local authorities under the 1998 Crime and Disorder Act. The author anticipates that this lack of commitment may be evident in the forthcoming revised planning out crime guidance and suggests possible approaches to this potentially influential document.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is increasing public policy interest in the management of rural landscapes for conservation, both in terms of natural and cultural heritage. Agri-environmental policies are an important part of an emerging vision for a sustainable countryside, with increasing support for the existing Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and Countryside Stewardship (CS) schemes. This paper provides insight into the nature of land-manager attitudes towards the conservation of rural landscapes and how these relate to differing modes and levels of engagement with these two schemes. It is based on the results of a recently completed project exploring the attitudes and practices of 100 land managers towards features of landscape and historic interest. Agri-environmental research has often sought to ‘typologise’ attitudes and practices around discrete land-manager types; an approach that may downgrade commonalities between land managers, the potential interplay of elements defining these types, and the possibility that land-manager identities may not be uniform. In this paper, in contrast, we emphasise the significance of these three analytical issues surrounding land-manager attitudes and practices. We explore land managers' interest and investment in conservation and go on to explain how these concerns were often closely related to the wildlife, historic and aesthetic goals of the schemes. The analysis then considers in detail how a concern for conservation often came to interplay with economic concerns to produce different attitudes and practices. We term these ‘styles of participation and nonparticipation’ to emphasise that such modes of uptake are not necessarily associated with specific land-manager types. Land managers developed these attitudes and practices with respect to different parts of their farms, types of landscape feature, and scheme in question. We conclude by emphasising the importance of contextualised analyses of land-manager values, knowledges, and practices for exploring the nature and possibilities of a ‘sustainable countryside', and the role of agri-environmental policy within this policy vision of rural areas. </jats:p>",

This column provides a general description of the four scenarios that emerged, some observations about how they might evolve, comments on their implications, and first-person stories, as told by fictitious residents. The process of scenario planning is connected to nursing science by explicating how five lessons of scenario planning are linked with Parse’s human becoming concepts of creative imagining, glimpsing the paradoxical, and affirming personal becoming. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study explored the linkages between environmental turbulence, strategic planning, and process effectiveness. Going beyond the traditional literature on the planning process, the present research included both an examination of the planning process itself and the external environment in which the organization of interest exists. The objective of this research was to examine the multi-dimensional treatments of environmental turbulence, strategic planning processes, and process effectiveness. It proposed to explore the planning-process effectiveness construct across two industries. By adding the aspect of environmental turbulence into the equation, the multi-dimensional treatments of planning and process effectiveness were broadened. </jats:p><jats:p> This study examined the linkage between the external environment, the strategic planning process, and effectiveness of the process. It addressed two research questions: What components and contextual elements of the planning process are critical for that process to be effective? Are these components and contextual elements of the planning process different in various levels of environmental turbulence? </jats:p><jats:p> The research model demonstrated that in different levels of environmental turbulence, the components and contextual elements of the strategic planning process would be stressed differently. Specifically, in more turbulent environments, the organization's strategic planning process would devote more resources to the planning function, be less resistant to planning, pay more attention to external and internal facets, employ more planning techniques, and encourage greater functional coverage and integration. All these were relative to another organization's planning process that was operating in a less turbulent environment. </jats:p><jats:p> One of the aims of this research study was to develop concrete recommendations to the automotive and beverage industries. Based on the findings of the study, it was recommended that: The strategic planning managers in the beverage industry pay special attention to ensure that there is sufficient functional coverage in their strategic planning process. Sufficient resources be made available to the planning function. Also, the level of resistance to planning be monitored by which resistance should be an on-going process throughout the strategic planning process and in every functional area of the firm. </jats:p><jats:p> The other aim of this research study was to explore the \"black box\" of strategic planning. The findings revealed that: Functional coverage was the key component in the process and that the adequate supply of resources to the planning function was the most critical contextual element for the effectiveness of the planning process. Organizations with highly turbulent environments tended to need more resources placed against the planning function and required extensive attention to the external facets of planning for their strategic planning process to be effective. At the same time, firms in lower turbulence industries such as paints and coatings, railroads, and forge casting could look to the beverage industry for a concrete action plan to improve the effectiveness of their planning processes. </jats:p>",

By focussing on a well-defined but substantial part family, we are able to achieve complete automation of all aspects of the process plan, including operations sequencing, parameter selection, NC code generation, etc. Thus, it becomes possible to go from design to NC code in a fully automated fashion. The focus on a tightly defined part family also results in very simple but robust automation algorithms. This is in contrast to much of the reported work on automated process planning, which generally target diverse part families, leading to complex algorithms that fall short of complete design-to-NC automation.</jats:p>",

I claim that both are manifestations of what economists refer to as a ‘hold-up problem’ and analyze how fast-growing private zoning, namely the ground-lease system and common interest developments, have evolved to respond to these problems. My argument is based on two spatial facts: the consumption of local collective goods is bundled with land and property; property owners have only limited ex post mobility. By comparing five different combinations of property rights and land use control, I submit that private zoning is most efficient in relieving the agency problem in urban land use. Policy implications of NIMBY and equity issues of private zoning are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that the framework is able to solve fairly difficult sensor planning problems online without requiring excessive amounts of computational resources. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To shorten product development lifecycles for machined powertrain components, it is necessary to develop technologies around integrated product design, process planning and system design. This integration should enable information once created to be readily available across all activities of the lifecycle. A key to achieving this is the creation of an information model for capturing and relating this information. This model should be comprehensive and easily navigable to enable, for instance, manufacturing engineers to trace tasks on the stations in a machining line to specific surfaces on in-process states of the workpiece. Also of importance are strategies that specify how instances of this model are created and how it is to be maintained. This paper presents information models created specifically for powertrain machining. These models have been implemented as a database within a framework for integrated product design, process planning and system design. An XML (eXtensible Markup Language) application based on the model has also been developed to standardize interfaces and facilitate communication within product development teams and with suppliers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article presents the analysis, comparison, and application of two alternative models to the optimal long–term operation planning of an hydro–thermal power system under conditions of uncertainty. The electrical system considered comprises one large reservoir, with interannual regulation capacity, and several smaller ones. The analyzed models employ stochastic dynamic programming as the solution methodology. The fundamental problem is to decide, on every temporal stage, how much water to use for generating purposes and how much to store, in order to minimize the total thermal and shortage costs. The original version of the studied model, created originally to forecast fuel consumption, assumes that the decision regarding the water release from the main reservoir is taken knowing the future hydrologic conditions. This criterion is known as <jats:italic>wait–and–see</jats:italic>. On the contrary, the new versions of the model, proposed in this article, consider a <jats:italic>here–and–now</jats:italic> criterion. Specifically, it is assumed that the future hydrologic conditions are not known at the time of making the operational decisions. The difference between the optimal cost of the proposed models and the original model defines the value of having the information regarding future hydrologic conditions before taking any decision. This value is generally known as the expected value of perfect information.</jats:p>",

The use of census origin–destination counts has in the past been restricted by data complexities and the lack of user accessibility. In order to improve accessibility a new, web-based interface has been developed which is the core of a Census Interaction Data Service, launched in 2002. The authors explain the Web-based Interface to Census Interaction Data from a user perspective, focusing on various features of the system that enable queries to be constructed and subsets of flow data to be extracted and downloaded in a quick and easy manner. Examples are provided to demonstrate alternative types of query and to illustrate the value of these data sets in providing insights into interaction behaviour. </jats:p>",

Drawing from a major cross-disciplinary investigation of food access and food poverty in British cities, the authors report in this paper findings from the first ‘before/after’ study of food consumption in a highly deprived area of a British city experiencing a sudden and significant change in its food-retail access. The study has been viewed as the first opportunity in the United Kingdom to assess the impact of a non-healthcare intervention (specifically a retail-provision intervention) on food-consumption patterns, and by extension diet-related health, in such a deprived, previously poor-retail-access community. The paper offers evidence of a positive but modest impact of the retail intervention on diet, and the authors discuss the ways in which their findings are potentially significant in the context of policy debate. </jats:p>",

It is a detailed operational methodology that combines analyses of basic freeway segments, weaving areas, off-ramp areas, and on-ramp areas. However, the new chapter does not contain guidance or examples for planning or preliminary engineering applications. To meet its numerous needs, Florida Department of Transportation engineers wanted to develop a freeway facility application that extends the HCM for generalized planning and preliminary engineering purposes but is not inconsistent with HCM 2000. Such a methodology was developed, documented, made into an executable software program called FREEPLAN, and is now being implemented throughout the state. The methodology is firmly based on HCM detailed analysis procedures but has assumptions and defaults that allow planners and engineers to use it effectively. At a generalized planning level, the basic construct was to provide tables of design volumes, v, and annual average daily traffic that could be achieved for various levels of service and freeway configurations for the default parameter values. At a preliminary engineering level, specific freeway facility inputs are used to determine v/c ratio, average travel speed, average density, and level-of-service grades. The initial results of applying the Florida freeway planning methodology to actual Florida data were outstanding in both urbanized and rural areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The high-end electronics manufacturing industry is challenged by the nature of medium/low volume and rich mix as it involves the management of various products and an extensive number of production recipes in a mixed productionflow. In addition, facing dynamic demands and the large amount of system transactions required to successfully manage the entire process further intensifies the complexity of the highmix supply chain. The key to enhance supply-chain operations of this complex process is the efficient use of information systems to (1) ensure the transparency of demand and (2) supply capacity data to all companies within a manufacturing supply chain. This will place companies in a position to anticipate demand fluctuations and respond accordingly. In the previous study [3], authors have introduced the development of the integrated capacity planning model in a high-mix electronics manufacturing environment. This ongoing study further enhances the model with the incorporation of sectionized yield information to improve the planning accuracy and the manufacturing execution information to validate the accuracy. In the previous study [3], an integrated capacity planning tool, composed of Tool Capacity Planning System (TCP) and Integrated Planning System (IPS), was introduced. TCP, an Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) tool, consists of a simulation system and a database that can be used to plan for the necessary equipment capacity with demand data. IPS is used for workload and staffing requirement planning. In this research, we further introduce the addition of the Manufacturing Data Warehouse (MDW), which hosts the operational data obtained from the manufacturing execution system. This addition enables the achievement of the abovementioned objectives, incorporation of sectioned yield information to improve the planning accuracy and the manufacturing execution information to validate the accuracy. The organization of this paper is as follow. The need and concept of integrated capacity planning are first described, followed by a review of some related works. The methodology section introduces the concept of unit hour and sectionized yield, as well as planning validation. Followed are several aspects of system development, including design guideline, requirement analysis, system architecture and system modeling. Some illustrated examples of said development activities are presented as well.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The preceding study demonstrated that normal subjects compensate for the additional interaction torques generated when a reaching movement is made during voluntary trunk rotation. The present paper assesses the influence of trunk rotation on finger trajectories and on interjoint coordination and determines whether simultaneous turn-and-reach movements are most simply described relative to a trunk-based or an external reference frame. Subjects reached to targets requiring different extents of arm joint and trunk rotation at a natural pace and quickly in normal lighting and in total darkness. We first examined whether the larger interaction torques generated during rapid turn-and-reach movements perturb finger trajectories and interjoint coordination and whether visual feedback plays a role in compensating for these torques. These issues were addressed using generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), which attempts to overlap a group of configurations (e.g., joint trajectories) through translations and rotations in multi-dimensional space. We first used GPA to identify the mean intrinsic patterns of finger and joint trajectories (i.e., their average shape irrespective of location and orientation variability in the external and joint workspaces) from turn-and-reach movements performed in each experimental condition and then calculated their curvatures. We then quantified the discrepancy between each finger or joint trajectory and the intrinsic pattern both after GPA was applied individually to trajectories from a pair of experimental conditions and after GPA was applied to the same trajectories pooled together. For several subjects, joint trajectories but not finger trajectories were more curved in fast than slow movements. The curvature of both joint and finger trajectories of turn-and-reach movements was relatively unaffected by the vision conditions. Pooling across speed conditions significantly increased the discrepancy between joint but not finger trajectories for most subjects, indicating that subjects used different patterns of interjoint coordination in slow and fast movements while nevertheless preserving the shape of their finger trajectory. Higher movement speeds did not disrupt the arm joint rotations despite the larger interaction torques generated. Rather, subjects used the redundant degrees of freedom of the arm/trunk system to achieve similar finger trajectories with differing joint configurations. We examined finger movement patterns and velocity profiles to determine the frame of reference in which turn-and-reach movements could be most simply described. Finger trajectories of turn-and-reach movements had much larger curvatures and their velocity profiles were less smooth and less bell-like in trunk-based coordinates than in external coordinates. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that turn-and-reach movements are controlled in an external frame of reference. </jats:p>",

Reasons for non-adoption of formal feed planning systems have been identified, but little is known about how farmers manage their pastoral farms in the absence of these systems. To this end, the feed management processes used by three successful farmers (2 dairy, 1 sheep and cattle) were investigated. Farmers separated the year into distinct planning horizons and alternated between formal and informal feed planning. Formal feed planning was used when critical decisions had to be made, accurate pasture measurement could be undertaken and the level of environmental uncertainty was perceived to be low. Informal feed planning, used at other times of the year, involved farmers accessing, from memory, plans that had worked in the past. These \"typical\" plans were modified in response to learning. In the face of uncertainty, micro-budgets were prepared at paddock level. Our findings raise the question with respect to planning and monitoring - should we continue to promote formal systems or learn how farmers do this and develop decision support systems in this context? Keywords: decision making, farmer knowledge, feed budgeting, planning, tactical management</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Even though the machining process has been integrated to the Multi-Axis Laser Aided Manufacturing Process (LAMP) System in order to get good surface finish functional parts [1], the quality of parts produced by the LAMP system is still very much dependent upon the choice of deposition paths. [2] Raster motion paths are replaced by offset spiral-like paths, which are discussed in this paper. Most commercial CAD/CAM packages are feature-based, and their use requires the effort and expertise of the user. The shape has to be decomposed into manufacturing features before the software packages can generate the paths. [3] Path planning has long been studied as discussed in this paper. There are still some problems associated with the previous algorithms and also assumptions are usually made. [6, 7, 27] An algorithm for directly generating offset edges, which can be developed to be the deposition paths, is presented in this paper. The skeleton of a layer or a slice of a 3-D CAD drawing is first generated. Based on that skeleton, the offset edges are incrementally constructed. This paper focuses on the characteristics of skeleton and offset edges as well as the construction algorithm for those edges. Simulations are used to verify this method.</jats:p>",

Examples presented mainly will focus on diabetic rat heart crude membranes. Diabetes mellitus (DM) was induced in rats by streptozotocin (STZ) injection that is one of the most popular experimental models for the study of type I diabetes. The shift in the peak positions, bandwidths and the intensity of the bands in FTIR spectra were analyzed to have valuable structural and functional information, which may have diagnostic value. In the diabetic membranes significant increase was observed in lipid order and lipids concentration. While the concentration of saturated lipids increases, the concentration of unsaturated lipids decreases. In addition, broadening of the amide I bands and the appearance of the new band around 1640 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup> together with the decrease in the amide I to amide II ratio indicate the structural changes occurring in proteins of diabetic membranes. A dramatic increase in oligosaccarite band (1042 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>) and a decrease in olefinic stretching band (3012 cm<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), were also observed.</jats:p>",

A before‐and‐after quasi‐experimental design was used. Craniotomy (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 112) and stroke (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic> = 171) patients were recruited and divided into control and intervention groups. Outcome indicators included length of hospital stay, change in activities of daily living (ADL), rate of nursing home placement, rate of unplanned readmission, and level of satisfaction. In the stroke sample length of hospital stay was shorter in the intervention group than in the control group. In the craniotomy sample unplanned readmission was less frequent in the intervention group than in the control group. No differences were found between the control and intervention groups in other outcome indicators. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 26:53–63, 2003</jats:p>",

The study made some substantial recommendations about technical approach and structure for improvements to MPO long-range plans. In 2002, CUTR again reviewed the state’s 25 MPO long-range transportation plans, following completion of the subsequent update cycle. The recent updates of Florida’s 25 MPO long-range plans are compared with the versions completed 3 to 5 years earlier. There has been much innovation and change in long-range transportation-planning practice across the state. These findings will be of interest to MPOs nationwide. </jats:p>",

The questionnaire's main items deal with general behaviour with regard to pregnancy, timing and proception (proception being the reverse of contraception). Values for these three items are added to yield a continuous score ranging from 0 to 12. The study population comprised 448 women of different cultural backgrounds recruited in prenatal, fertility and family planning clinics in Quebec and North Carolina. The results indicate that the internal consistency between the three items pertaining to pregnancy planning was excellent (Cronbach's alpha of 0.83). Test–retest reliability after a 4‐week interval was excellent, with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.86 for the planning score. The planning score median for women attending family planning clinics (1.00) was significantly lower than that for those recruited in fertility clinics (11.00), confirming the discriminant ability of the instrument. Path analysis shows that the conceptual model corroborates the observed data and explains 53% of the pregnancy planning variability. In conclusion, this is the first questionnaire specifically designed to assess the intensity of pregnancy planning effort, a potentially important variable in epidemiological studies and clinical practice.</jats:p>",

This paper explores the related, relatively uncharted territory of nonsurvey versus survey impact studies by means of a series of simulations. The base case is provided by a very detailed five region survey of both the forward and the backward impacts of the energy-distribution sector in the four northern provinces of the Netherlands. To deal adequately with the two-sided dependence between a firm or sector and a region, as opposed to using the traditional (gross) multipliers, we argue in favor of using a new multiplier concept: the net multiplier. Next, from examining alternative impact study methods ranging from quick and dirty, via semiextensive, to full-survey methods, we conclude that using even aggregate, first-order impact information is more important than using a very detailed survey-based input–output model. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Travel and tourism activities and trip planning decisions involving the interoperability complexities and interdependencies introduced by inter-modal and interurban transportation networks constitute an ample opportunity area for deploying the state-of-the-art mobile Internet technologies. It is becoming increasingly necessary to provide travelers with real-time information to assist them in preplanning or replanning their transport and travel activities or particular trip elements during their trip, while being on the move. Trip planning decisions, either before or during the trip realization constitute a derived demand, pushed by demand for tourism activities. However, they represent the most critical chain of the decision-making process on the grounds that they eventually determine the feasibility and the realization of the whole travel activity. From a different perspective, terminal operators, regional authorities, and other transport and tourism organizations show a vast interest and actively pursue alternative ways of dealing with the requirements of the demand for travel and tourism services. An integrated system providing value added logistical services related to travel and tourism, the World in your H@nds on the Move–WH@M system, has been implemented to support and optimize the trip planning process. A study had three objectives: to discuss the way that intermodality can be supported by such a technological application; to present the architecture, operations, and the solution approach governing the trip planning modules; and to provide a brief demonstration of the relevant trip planning modules of the system. </jats:p>",

This line of thinking, which involves deriving land use limits from infrastructure capacity, requires solving the inverse of the typical transportation planning problem. Modular artificial neural networks (ANNs) were developed for solving the inverse transportation planning problem. ANNs were designed to predict zonal trip ends, given the traffic volumes on the links of the transportation network. Computational experiments were performed to study the effect on ANN accuracy of three factors: transportation network size, variability in training data, and ANN topology. ANNs were shown to be quite capable of capturing the relationship between link volumes and zonal trip ends for both small and medium-sized transportation networks and for degrees of variability in the training data. Modular ANNs with one or two hidden layers appeared to outperform other ANN topologies. </jats:p>",

Parallel to the plane defined by the superior semicircular canal (defined as transverse) as well as perpendicular to the plane defined by the superior semicircular canal (defined as longitudinal). This was done using commercially available software. Sixteen surgically important relationships between neural, vascular and/or bony structures were measured and analyzed. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; Quantitatively, wide variations were obtained in the measurements obtained from images of both non-orthogonal planar orientations. These variations were not age or sex dependent. Qualitatively, the images obtained highlight the anatomy of the temporal bone and skull base as it will be encountered during otologic surgery, since the surgical visual axis is along the long axis of the temporal bone. &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; The reformatted images in non-orthogonal planes were superior to the axial and coronal series because they condensed critical relationships into a single perspective which promoted an intuitive understanding of the surgical approach. These reconstructed images show wide differences in quantitative measurements between surgically relevant landmarks. The protocol can be easily implemented in the clinical setting and is a potentially valuable educational tool. We recommend that non-orthogonal reconstructed images be routinely included with orthogonal temporal bone HRCT scans.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new approach to regional land use and transportation planning, which uses a genetic algorithm as an integrated optimization tool, is presented. The approach is illustrated by applying it to the Wasatch Front Metropolitan Region, which consists of four counties in the state of Utah. This genetic algorithm–-based approach was applied earlier to the twin cities of Provo and Orem in Utah, but here it is adapted to regional planning. Three issues make regional planning particularly difficult: ( a) individual cities have significant planning autonomy, ( b) the search space of possible plans is immense, and ( c) preferences between competing objectives vary among stakeholders. The approach used here addresses the first issue by the way the problem is formulated. The second issue is addressed with a genetic algorithm. Such algorithms are particularly well suited to problems with large search spaces. The third issue is addressed by using a multiobjective fitness function in the genetic algorithm. It was found that a genetic algorithm could produce a set of nondominated future land use scenarios and street plans for a region, from which regional planners can make a selection. Execution of the algorithm to produce 100 plans per generation for 100 generations took about 4 days with a high-end personal computer. Interesting trends for reducing change and traffic congestion were discovered. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title><p>The maintenance of cereal quality is a complex problem due to the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors in the stored grain ecosystem. The biotic factors (germination, insects, moulds and mites) provide information on the quality of the grain. The abiotic factors (time, temperature, moisture content, impurities and insecticides) influence the dynamics of biotic factors and provide information on grain storage conditions. The planning problem is to control the abiotic factors with a view to keeping storage conditions safe. The <italic>QualiGrain</italic> preventive approach includes four steps: assessment of the initial quality and condition of the grain; planning the optimal storage technical route; monitoring grain condition during storage; and re-planning the storage technical route if the grain condition drifts out of safe storage conditions. In the planning module, we use the biotic factors as state variables, the abiotic factors as control variables and the storage actions as actions of the plan. A storage action (drying, cooling, cleaning, treating with an insecticide or selecting a bin) is executable if the equipment and/or chemical(s) needed are available. 'Dry grain using the medium drier MD1 to reach 14.5% of moisture content' and 'Store grain in the vertical bin VB4', for example, are executable storage operations. The planning method is hierarchical, with two levels: (a) generation of generic storage plans, and (b) refining the generic storage plans taking into account time, the equipment available and the consumables allowed. An optimal storage technical route gives a plan of the storage actions to be executed during the storage period with the estimated safe storage interval after each action of the plan. A prototype of an expert system, <italic>QualiS</italic>, has been developed, running on Windows on a personal computer. The advice afforded by the decision support system has been validated by storage specialists before and after pilot-scale experiments in Denmark and the UK.</p>"

Tourism in the Opatija Riviera is lagging behind modem tourist trends. Hence, the primary objectives of this destination in its future tourism development should be the shaping of an identifiable, top-quality tourist product, the creation of its own identity, and the deliberation of tourism from the viewpoint of the destination, as the basis of tourism prosperity. With the aid of marketing mix activities, it is crucial to reposition the Opatija Riviera as an attractive and competitive tourist destination with a recognisable image, capable of attracting potential tourists. Through carefully directed marketing planning and with a view to tourism prosperity, the Opatija Riviera, as a tourist destination, will be able to achieve the required level of imagination, originality and variety with regard to the competition.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the research on coordinated transportation and land use methods such as transit-oriented development (TOD) has focused on the developed world, particularly the United States. The opportunities and challenges for such policies in the developing world were examined, and it is argued that these policies might have greater benefits in the developing world than in the developed world. Mexico City, Mexico, was used as a case study. In the developing world, where cities are growing rapidly and rates of automobile ownership are still low, TOD provides an opportunity to design a transit-oriented urban form. Low-income people can thus be served by cheap, high-capacity transit; spend less of their income on transportation; and have better access to jobs. They will make fewer and shorter trips by informal low-capacity transit, thereby reducing congestion and pollution. In the long term, TOD may slow down motorization and mitigate its effects. Mexico City faces a crisis of mobility, environment, and equity. However, it has many of the prerequisites for TOD: the densities, an extensive metro system, and metropolitan planning organizations. Opportunities for coordinated transportation and land use planning include station area development, downtown redevelopment, real estate development along a proposed suburban rail line, and a policy of building new affordable housing within walking distance of high-capacity transit. The greater the geographical scope of each option, the more government involvement is required, and the larger its potential positive impact. An estimate of environmental benefits is presented. </jats:p>",

Various urban models and geographic information system impact models have been in development for use in the Sacramento, California, region for several years. A comprehensive set of models is proposed. With the improvement of the urban economic model and the addition of a model for real-time scenario generation and evaluation, it is thought that a full suite of models exists for comprehensive regional planning. All the models are free, public license models, appropriate for application in large metropolitan planning organizations and other regional agencies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A multicommodity maximal covering network design problem (MCNDP) is formulated for identifying critical routes for earthquake response and seismically retrofitting bridges. MCNDP seeks routes that minimize the total travel time over the selected routes and maximize the total population covered, subject to a budget constraint on bridge retrofitting costs on the selected routes. The problem is formulated as a two-objective integer programming model and solved with the branch-and-cut module in the CPLEX optimizer. The model performance is analyzed with the transportation network of a seismically prone region in southwestern Indiana. A problem reduction strategy is introduced to reduce computational times by recognizing that the critical routes usually are not circuitous. Thereby, the search for the critical routes for an origin–destination (O-D) pair is confined to a limited geographical region around it. To further reduce computational costs, the formulation is extended to incorporate valid inequalities that exploit the problem structure. Computational experiments are conducted to investigate the effects of varying the budget and the relative weights of the two objectives. Noninferior frontiers that illustrate the trade-offs between the conflicting objectives for different budgets are constructed to provide practical insights to decision makers. In addition, a vulnerability analysis is performed for the various solution instances to infer their ability to ensure connectivity between all O-D pairs after an earthquake. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Now, more than ever, the planning and management of transportation systems in the real world is beset by change and uncertainty. Under these conditions, the quality of transportation education continues to be a matter of concern for the profession because of continuing demands and commitments at several levels. From an academic standpoint, topics such as public involvement, strategic management of capital resources, soft systems methodology, and applied ethics need to be incorporated in the curriculum in more substantial ways. On the basis of the demands of professional practice, as suggested by hiring agencies, the political working of the real world also needs to be understood by entry-level graduates. These and other relevant issues, relevant particularly for a graduate-level course on urban transportation planning, are described and discussed. On the basis of the “Millennium State-of-the-Art and Future Directions White Paper” sponsored by the Committee on Transportation Education, students are expected to have a deeper knowledge and acquire greater skills in the following four topics: intermodalism and systemicity, soft systems methodologies, applied ethics, and communication. A sample course outline incorporating these suggestions based on a three-credit course offered at the Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, in 2001 is described. Finally, the composition of the class and the student course evaluation are discussed. Overall, the course was well received by students. </jats:p>",

However, the emergence of resistant strains calls urgently for research on inhibitors of further viral targets such as integrase (IN), the enzyme that catalyzes the integration of the proviral DNA into the host chromosomes. Recently, we started studies on new IN inhibitors as analogs of natural products, characterized by one or two 3,4-dihydroxycinnamoyl moieties, which were proven to be IN inhibitors in vitro. Then, we designed and synthesized a number of derivatives sharing 3,4 dihydroxycinnamoyl groups, obtaining potent IN inhibitors active at submicromolar concentrations. Unfortunately, these derivatives lacked antiretroviral activity, probably owing to their high cytotoxicity. So we designed a number of 3,4,5-trihydroxycinnamoyl derivatives as less-cytotoxic IN inhibitors, which were proven to be antiretrovirals in cell-based assays. Finally, we designed and synthesized a number of aryldiketohexenoic acids, strictly related to the aryldiketo acid series recently reported by Merck Company, which were shown to be potent antiretroviral agents endowed with anti-IN activities either in 3' processing or in strand transfer steps.</jats:p>",

Several studies have derived general results without decisive conclusions or with partial coverage to assist the users in the selection process. Simulation modeling is used to compare operational traffic performances of isolated SPI and TDI without frontage roads. Modeling was conducted on similar geometries over a wide distribution of traffic flow conditions (101 scenarios). The 101 scenarios were run for both SPI and TDI to derive control delay, stop time, and percent stops from CORSIM. The multivariate statistical comparison of all three variables showed a combined significant difference between the two interchange types, favoring SPI. TDI created more delay, stop time, and percent stops when the left-turn off-ramp flows were very high. Regression models were derived to estimate the three measures for both SPI and TDI. The models are robust and are functions of the highest flows on the cross street and off-ramps. These models are tools that can help planners in the evaluation and selection process of these interchange configurations. </jats:p>",

The rationale for truck-only highways is described, and the history of efforts to separate trucks and automobiles on the nation's roadways is presented. The truck lane program of the Southern California Association of Governments is one of the most ambitious programs of its type in the United States. Preliminary analysis of truck lanes for SR-60 and I-710 is described. SR-60 is an east–west corridor linking downtown Los Angeles with the warehouse and manufacturing districts of the San Gabriel Valley and the Inland Empire. 1-710 is the major access route to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. Both freeways each have one of the highest truck volumes in California, and truck mobility on these corridors is a significant problem. Truck lane projects on SR-60 and I-710 are in the feasibility analysis stage and much has been learned in these early studies. Various issues are addressed, including the trade-off between limiting access to improve operational costs and limit capital costs, need to generate demand, time-of-day distribution of truck traffic and its relationship to potentially benefit truck mobility, and need for improved analytical tools. Also described are issues related to facility design and configuration, demand analysis, and toll analysis. </jats:p>",

These two types of deviations are combined into a weighted objective function, where the weighting value is determined by an interactive approach to obtain the best compromise solution. The single-day formulation is further extended to use link counts from multiple days to estimate the variation in traffic demand over multiple days. A case study based on the Irvine test bed network is conducted to illustrate the methodology and estimate day-to-day demand patterns. The application illustrates considerable benefits in analyzing the demand dynamics with multiday data. </jats:p>",

A first-year evaluation compiles the analyses provided by the participating MPOs and provides an assessment of the aggregate performance of the transit systems. A larger part of the study focused on the examination of the actual process used by the MPOs and transit systems to evaluate their services. Changes recommended to improve and refine the process for future years are presented, based on the first-time experiences of the MPOs. This evaluation serves as a model for other areas in the country interested in applying the customer-oriented assessment of transit based on the TCQSM. </jats:p>",

In general, it was found that organizational commitment partially mediates the relationship between the enforcement style of prioritization and perceptions of effectiveness. In this case, mediation and direct effects work together such that prioritization has by far the greatest positive total effect. In contrast, a coercive enforcement style is more completely mediated by organizational commitment, but this relationship is negative (that is, a coercive style appears to reduce organizational commitment, leading to lower perceptions of enforcement effectiveness). Although some differences are noted among the three samples, the overall pattern suggests that other enforcement styles (formalism, education, and external influence) appear to be much less influential in shaping perceptions of enforcement effectiveness. </jats:p>",

The case sites were 15 LEAs and a corresponding health trust partner, 10 self-rated as high collaborators. 57 health and education managers were interviewed about a range of themes relating to the strategic planning of services, collaboration, funding and resource allocation, training and professional development and the involvement of parents. We find extensive recognition of the need for collaboration between agencies, but wide variation in practices across England and Wales. At strategic level, various factors appear to facilitate joint planning, although constraints operate at several levels. Tensions in the current system are explored, with particular reference to how to achieve equitable distribution of resources whilst working towards an agenda of inclusive education. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many developing-country cities are experiencing severe air quality problems as a result of rapidly increasing vehicle use and highly polluting vehicles. Yet, data availability and modeling capabilities to support travel and emissions forecasting in developing countries are limited. One result is that policies that affect travel demand cannot be properly evaluated or are overlooked as solutions to air quality problems. Exploratory research to determine the need for and feasibility of developing a “sketch plan” travel forecasting method that can be applied in developing-country cities is described. Outreach to practitioners and researchers was undertaken to identify the extent of existing transportation data availability and forecasting capabilities. The research revealed a broad range of capabilities. Less-developed countries—including most countries in Africa and some in Asia and Latin America—often have no formalized forecasting approach, little data (which may be of suspect quality), and no institutional structure to support data collection or forecasting. Some of the more developed countries—especially in Southeast Asia and Latin America—have capabilities approaching or equal to those of western countries. The results suggest that, in many developing countries, there is a need for as well as interest in a simple tool for forecasting travel demand that minimizes data inputs and user requirements. Existing sketch-plan methods used in developed countries were also reviewed for potential application to developing countries. Because of significant differences between developed- and developing-country contexts and issues, however, a tool appropriate for developing-country cities probably would need to be developed from scratch. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The state of Florida has been experiencing an explosion of growth, and it is one of the fastest growing states in the country. While the state has been in the forefront of growth management initiatives, the results have been less than satisfactory. The state recognized the need to integrate land use planning efforts with transportation planning efforts. Legislation was passed that allows the formation of multimodal transportation districts, which focus on appropriate land use mixes and densities that would enhance the use of transportation modes other than the automobile. There are several key elements in the evaluation of these districts, using both land use analysis and the recently adopted multimodal level-of-service performance measures. To validate these evaluation techniques, especially focusing on the level-of-service performance measures, several case studies were undertaken. The guidelines for the formation of a multimodal transportation district provide local governments with a template for enhancing existing and new development. These guidelines also provide a blueprint for sustainable growth and the promotion and development of livable communities through the integration of transportation, land use, and urban design. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the primary determinants of signalized intersection delay, and consequently signalized arterial level of service, is progression quality. Progression quality is represented by an arrival-type variable in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) procedure for calculating signal delay. Ideally, the arrival type is estimated from collected field data, in particular the percentage of vehicles that arrive at an intersection approach while that approach has the green signal indication. The Florida Department of Transportation prescribes the use of its ARTPLAN software program for planning-level analyses of signalized arterial level of service in the state of Florida. This software is a planning-level implementation of the arterial analysis methodology contained in Chapter 15 of the 2000 HCM. One of the inputs to this software program is arrival type. Given the significant impact this variable can have on delay, and subsequently level-of-service results, it is prudent to have as good an estimate of its value as possible. However, collecting accurate data on progression quality is very difficult, and the intent behind a planning-level analysis is that detailed field data should not be required. Consequently, the blanket HCM recommendations for arrival type are often applied in these analyses without much consideration of how appropriate these values really are for the specified roadway, traffic, and control conditions. A method developed to estimate arrival-type values with a simulation-based approach from the planning-level inputs of ARTPLAN is described. Also provided is a summary of simulation-derived arrival-type values from a large number of sample data sets. </jats:p>",

The wide range of applicable geographic scales is a problem when exploring alternative strategies in such a region, so a single, multiscaled, technically based planning analysis was designed and conducted to unify decision makers around a comprehensive set of performance goals and the estimated potential effects of all reasonable actions. The analysis, built within an accelerated 10-month time frame under federal scrutiny, relied on participation by elected officials, planners, engineers, and regional stakeholders. It produced a full regionwide identification of long-term performance needs and an exhaustive assessment and prioritization of location-specific strategies. NJTPA applied this prioritization to select strategies to update its long-range transportation plan and to develop specific immediate guidance for implementation agencies. </jats:p>",

Positron emission tomography (PET) has been used in pediatric neuro-oncology to help in the understanding and management of brain neoplasms. We combined PET and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the planning of SBB in 9 children (5 males and 4 females, aged 2–14 years) with infiltrative, ill-defined brain lesions. Tracers used for PET were &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-&lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;-glucose in 4 cases, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C-methionine in 2 cases and both tracers in 3 cases. Biopsy targets were selected in hypermetabolic areas. PET-guided SBB provided accurate histological diagnosis in all patients and allowed a reduction of the number of trajectories in lesions located in functional areas. It also helped in better understanding and management of complex cases. This preliminary series suggests that combining PET and MR imaging in the planning of SBB in children (1) improves the diagnostic yield of SBB in infiltrative, ill-defined brain lesions, (2) makes it possible to reduce the sampling in high-risk/functional areas and (3) improves the quality of therapeutic management of pediatric brain tumors.</jats:p>"

Six zygoma fixtures of length 45 mm (Nobel Biocare, Göteborg, Sweden) were placed in three formalin‐fixed human cadavers using surgical drilling guides. The fabrication of these custom‐made drilling guides was based on three‐dimensional computerized tomography (3D‐CT) data for the maxillary‐zygomatic complex. The installation of the implants was simulated preoperatively using an adopted 3D‐CT planning system. In addition, anatomical measurements of the zygomatic bone were performed on the 3D images. The preoperative CT images were then matched with postoperative ones in order to assess the deviation between the planned and installed implants. The angle between the planned and actually placed implants was &lt; 3° in four out of six cases. The largest deviation found at the exit point of one of the six implants was 2.7 mm. The present study showed that the use of surgical drilling guides should be encouraged for zygoma implant placement because of the lengths of the implants involved and the anatomical intricacies of the region.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It has long been recognized that the selection of cutting conditions in process planning should optimize the economic performance of machining operations although it appears that common practice favours the use of ‘recommended’ cutting conditions which are known to be non-optimal. This practice seems to be partly due to the difficulties in establishing equations for the many technological machining performance measures and partly due to the complex nature and slow progress made in developing reliable multi-constraint optimization analyses. This paper presents multi-constraint optimization analyses and computer aided strategies for selecting the ‘optimal’ feeds and speeds in single-pass rough turning operations. The optimization, based on criteria typified by the minimum time and cost per component and suitable for the newer coated lathe tools with in-built chip breaker groove designs, incorporates chip breaking constraints for turning on computer numerical control (CNC) lathes. Despite the complexity of the analyses, clearly denned strategies that guarantee the global optimal solutions have been developed. Extensive simulation studies have highlighted the considerable economic benefits of using ‘optimal’ rather than ‘recommended’ cutting conditions, the potential for increased benefits from improved chip control and tool magazine designs and the need for technological performance equations as well as optimization analyses for the wide spectrum of machining operations for use in modern process planning. </jats:p>",

However, a detailed knowledge about the relationship between time/temperature exposure and resulting tissue thermal damage is needed to estimate the lesion extent. The aims of this work were to model the thermal response of laser‐irradiated tissue and to assess the value of Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) for tumor therapy planning and monitoring. MCS yielded true 3D distributions of laser‐induced temperature and thermal damage. These results were compared with 2D MR thermometry data from in vitro experiments performed on animal liver tissue over an ordinary range of laser powers (10–25 W) and irradiation times (5–25 min). Clinical reference data were available from MR‐guided liver LITT procedures. MCS correctly predicted the shape of temperature and damage distributions. The quantitative agreement between simulated and measured lesion diameters was within 10% and 15% for the in vitro and in vivo cases, respectively. The simulated 53°C isotherm best estimated the boundary of the final thermal damage (6% variance). This study shows that MCS of interstitial laser coagulation provides unique information that can be of use in the empirical correlation of temperature with thermal damage, and can assist greatly in thermal treatment planning and monitoring.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Uncertainties and imprecise information regarding customer demands, production, inventory, and MRP are very common in performing aggregate production-planning (APP) for the manufacturing in real world. This study presents a fuzzy linear programming approach for managing the uncertainties and imprecise information involved in industrial APP applications. Detailed discussions are given to the establishment of the Fuzzy Linear Programming approach with converting the fuzzy constraints of uncertain and imprecise items into deterministic equivalents. A mathematical model is developed for APP practice with the Fuzzy Linear Programming approach. For numerically performing an aggregate production planning with the Fuzzy Linear Programming developed, a computer simulation for an actual aggregate production-planning is presented. It is demonstrated in the study, the employment of the Fuzzy Linear Programming provides a great advantage in APP of manufacturing, if the parameters of the stochastic factors involved in the production planning are neither definitely reliable nor precise. The present study shows that the interrelated effects of the customer service level and facility capacity on the effectiveness and efficiency of aggregate production-planning is significant and should be taken into account in performing an aggregate production-planning </jats:p>",
