And this diversity has been increasing exponentially for the past sixty years. Two decades after its founding, 3M's business was relatively simple. In the early 1920s, the corporation manufactured a line of sandpapers, which it sold to several key industries, among them furniture and automotive. Its competitors offered similar products and sold to the same customers. In that era, 3M's strategy was straightforward: “We will make a quality product at a fair price—and sell it aggressively.”</jats:p>",

This book is a critical examination of the truth behind these stereotypes. Twenty-one specialists in the field of development studies look at the reality of agrarian change, either through historical analysis, or through in-depth village field-work, or from their experience as development planners. The first four chapters provide the historical context of agrarian change in India, Latin America and pre-industrial Europe. These are followed by eight detailed case studies of the impact of the green Revolution at village level in India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. The book finishes with six analysis of the effectiveness of government policies designed to intervene in the development process in South Asia and in East Africa.  The contributors to this book share a commitment to an interdisciplinary approach to the study of development problems.</jats:p>",

Planning down implies centralised policy direction and control, requiring operational activities to achieve levels of performance set for them. This is then contrasted with planning up, in which divisional and operational activities are able to exercise greater influence in the formulation of their own policies and objectives. Under this approach the corporate centre has to balance the forecasted financial consequences in the annual capital budget, aggregating and reconciling the various proposals it receives, using guidelines or criteria for resource allocation, rate of return and cash flow. The article concludes by comparing the two approaches and their relative advantages and disadvantages.</jats:p>",

Yet, as fate would have it, this has been a period of great economic difficulty dominated by contractionary budgets at the Federal level with inevitable restraint at State levels. It has also been a period of record unemployment with the average person much more concerned about unemployment, family budgets and survival than social issues such as provision of appropriate and rightful resources to educate handicapped children and adults. Indeed, the visibility and relevance of education generally as a social and political issue has been subjugated by more pressing survival issues.</jats:p>",

The author introduces two basic measures of urban form and interaction, and maps urban activities and interactions onto this two-dimensional space. Some of the broader impacts of technological change may then be considered as movements in this space. Information systems for monitoring the effects of technological change, for quantitative analysis of these impacts, and for prediction of further impacts of change are also discussed. Last, the implications for planning are considered. One possible model for use at various levels in this study is outlined in an appendix. </jats:p>",

However, increasing demands on customer service, added product complexity, increased transportation costs and intensifying competition have significantly broadened the scope of PD management. A modern PD manager must do more planning, command greater decision‐making authority and become more active in formulating and implementing marketing strategies (e.g. price setting, packaging design, etc). In order to assume these new responsibilities, PD managers will require a reconceptualisation of their jobs and function as an integral part of the firm. Most important is the need for a set of carefully conceived PD strategies and tactics that are sequenced according to some workable framework. The authors maintain that the product life cycle (PLC) concept represents such a guideline. They discuss how the PLC concept can be used to gauge changing market conditions as well as the subsequent impact this has on the formulation and implementation of timely PD strategies and tactics.</jats:p>",

The US economy, driven by comparative advantages enjoyed in the manufacturing sector, reached in the early 1950s a peak in its share of the world population. In comparison to the market economies of the world (WMEs) the United States of America reached a peak in the ratio of its per-capita gross domestic product to that of the WMEs in around 1920 and a peak in its share of the WMEs population around 1950. On all three counts the United States of America is currently continuously declining. It is hypothesized that this decline is caused by the gradual shift in the US economy from manufacturing to services and that it is of a rather long-term nature. The author presents an economic-ecological based model of the dynamic behavior of the US economy in reference to the WMEs. Empirical evidence, covering the period 1920–1980 is used to test a Volterra-Lotka type model. Some results are discussed in reference to the parameter values, together with their implications in projecting the future course of the US economy within the community of market economies. </jats:p>",

Conditions for weak dominance, a criterion proposed elsewhere by the authors, are also derived. The latter results are particularly useful when strict dominance cannot be established. This happens frequently in practice.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Internationalisation of domestic capital is decomposed into four distinct processes. As a result, it is possible to show that, from a national perspective, increased internationalisation and deinternationalisation of the national economy may occur at the same time. A brief historical analysis of internationalisation processes in the electronics industry also reveals that extensive phases are followed by intensive phases of reorganisation of capital. These are more ‘political’ in nature and do not follow the pattern of typical ‘market forces’. Basic concepts such as power and dependency structure are more suitable to the analysis of these phases. This is illustrated by the case of Philips, an international electrotechnical company. Part of the movement of Philips capital is determined by comparative costs advantages and export substitution; in particular, the movement towards Third World countries. An increasing part of its capital is flowing, however, towards countries in the core of the world economy, with larger (state) markets. This second movement can be understood as a strategic response to the increased dependency of multinational firms upon economic ‘backing’ powers of the state. As a result, employment in multinational firms, located in small industrialised countries like the Netherlands, is squeezed between these two capital movements. A quantitative analysis of the changing distribution of jobs within Philips worldwide is introduced to illustrate these issues. The data also show that a dual process is not only typical for small core countries, but also for large industrialising countries in the periphery. This, however, has been observed before, and it has played a role in modern theories of ‘imperialism’, like that of Galtung. In view of the present analysis, however, this theory should be refined: workers in small core countries have more interests in common with workers in some Third World countries than predicted by Galtung's theory. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the last decade, a number of models for the dynamic facility location problem have been proposed. The various models contain differing assumptions regarding the revenues and costs realized in the opening, operation, and closure of a facility as well as considering which of the facility sites are candidates for acquisition or disposal at the beginning of a time period. Since the problem becomes extremely large for practical applications, much of the research has been directed toward developing efficient solution techniques. Most of the models and solutions assume that the facilities will be disposed of at the end of the time horizon since distant future conditions usually can't be forecasted with any reasonable degree of accuracy. The problem with this approach is that the “optimal” solution is optimal for only one hypothesized post horizon facility configuration and may become nonoptimal under a different configuration. Post‐optimality analysis is needed to assure management that the “optimal” decision to open or close a facility at a given point in time won't prove to be “nonoptimal” when the planning horizon is extended or when design parameters in subsequent time periods change. If management has some guarantee that the decision to open or close a facility in a given time period won't change, it can safely direct attention to the accuracy of the design parameters within that time period.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper proposes a mixed integer linear programming model to determine which of a finite set of warehouse sites will be operating in each time period of a finite planning horizon. The model is general in the sense that it can reflect a number of acquisition alternatives—purchase, lease or rent. The principal assumptions of the model are: a) Warehouses are assumed to have infinite capacity in meeting customer demand, b) In each time period, any non‐operating warehouse is a candidate for becoming operational, and likewise any operating warehouse is a candidate for disposal, c) During a given time period, the fixed costs of becoming operational at a site are greater than the disposal value at that site to reflect the nonrecoverable costs involved in operating a warehouse. These costs are separate from the acquisition and liquidation values of the site. d) During a time period the operation of a warehouse incurs overhead and maintenance costs as well as a depreciation in the disposal value.</jats:p><jats:p>To solve the model, it is first simplified and a partial optimal solution is obtained by the iterative examination by both lower and upper bounds on the savings realized if a site is opened in a given time period. An attempt is made to fix each warehouse open or closed in each time period. The bounds are based on the delta and omega tests proposed by Efroymson and Ray (1966) and Khumawala (1972) with adjustment for changes in the value of the warehouse between the beginning and end of a time period. A complete optimal solution is obtained by solving the reduced model with Benders' decomposition procedure. The optimal solution is then tested to determine which time periods contain “tentative” decisions that may be affected by post horizon data by analyzing the relationship between the lower (or upper) bounds used in the model simplification time period. If the warehouse decisions made in a time period satisfy these relationships and are thus unaffected by data changes in subsequent time periods, then the decisions made in earlier time periods will also be unaffected by future changes.</jats:p>",

Of these goal programming is probably the most widely used one, at least in management science. Goal programming seems to offer considerable potential for application to multiple‐criteria problems in farm planning. However, its applications in agricultural economics have been few and far between. Even these attempts seem to suffer from some serious misconceptions. In this paper an effort is made to explain the structure of a goal programming model by deriving it from the familiar paradigm of linear programming. This is done to put the potential usefulness of goal programming and its relationship to linear programming in perspective, and to encourage further applications to multiple‐criteria decision‐making in farm planning.</jats:p>",

The primal program seeks a vector of vacancy transfers which minimizes the volume of new stock additions among market sectors required to satisfy a prespecified vector of primary vacancy demand. The dual program seeks a vector of shadow housing-prices which maximizes the value of units absorbed by primary demand while insuring that quasi-rents are driven to zero. Thus, a duality between vacancy transfers and housing price is identified, and the role of new stock development costs in housing price determination is defined. </jats:p>",

Responses to the CELI and selected utterances from the sample of spontaneous speech were analyzed in a manner similar to the procedure outlined by Carrow (1974a). While there was a high correlation between the proportion of errors on each task, there was also a significant difference between these proportions. All of the LI children had a lower mean proportion of errors on the language sample than on the CELI and discrepancies between the two were greater for the younger children with the lower mean length of utterances. Goals of intervention derived from the two sets of data also indicated differences. Three factors may have accounted for the discrepant scores-differences in lexical items, differences in the structural complexity of the sentences, and differences in the requirements of the two tasks. It is suggested that while standardized elicitation tasks, such as the CELI, serve to identify children with language impairments they may not be as useful as data from free speech samples for determining goals of intervention. </jats:p>",

Data on the receptor content of endometrial carcinomas and sarcomas and of ovarian tumours are fast accruing but the clinical relevance of the receptor content of these gynaecological tumours remains to be fully assessed. Overall, 76% of endometrial carcinomas are oestrogen receptor (ER) positive and 74% progesterone receptor (PR) positive. Poorly‐differentiated tumours are less likely to be receptor positive as are deeply invasive tumours. The presence of ER and PR have been shown to be a good guide to eventual hormonal therapy, but this is not absolute; actual receptor levels seem to be important. Information on receptors in uterine sarcomas is too scanty at present to be evaluated. Approximately 64% of epithelial ovarian tumours contain ER, 42% PR and 46% androgen receptor (AR); the presence of such receptors may point to a better prognosis, but correlations between receptor status and response to hormonal agents such as progestogens and tamoxifen have not been studied.</jats:p>",
