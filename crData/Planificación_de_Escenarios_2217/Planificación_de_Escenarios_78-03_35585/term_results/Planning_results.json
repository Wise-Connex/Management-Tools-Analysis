Parameters for several stochastic models of housing-market phenomena are derived from the account-based representation. Finally, potential planning applications of these accounting frameworks are explored together with conditions for their adoption. </jats:p>",

As befits its mandate, a great deal of attention has been paid to the technological component of our industrial difficulties. The Science Council is presently studying policy initiatives appropriate to the creation of a more viable manufacturing base. Sufficient research has been completed to give some broad indications of the conclusions being reached on the nature and causes of our industrial dilemma, and of the type of policy response which the Science Council believes is essential to redirect manufacturing towards viability.</jats:p>",

These decisions are most commonly based on convential accounting figures—product costs and profits—which are developed with much effort and in great detail in most companies.

Unlike previous modeling attempts, a strict central-place distribution of cities is not assumed, and communication between cities of all ranks is allowed. The model is subjected to a normative approach to determine the best use of the communication channels in reaching a given level of adoption at a minimal cost within a fixed planning period. It is shown that the choice of policies depends on the marginal productivities and costs of the communication channels. Given the initial conditions set forth in the paper, the most likely diffusion pattern is initially hierarchical, followed by increasing neighborhood diffusion. </jats:p>",

The conventional approach of searching for an underlying vector basis is germane for exploratory type research, but it is not directly applicable for normative purposes. Target rotation provides an analytical matrix-comparison methodology particularly useful in extending the utility of urban system findings from descriptive ecological studies to normative ones. An empirical example of this approach is provided, based upon 1970 census data of the Detroit SMSA. An empirical factor-loading matrix is presented, a target matrix of desirable performance standards is hypothesized, and the observed loadings are rotated upon the target loadings. Observed system performance is then directly compared with desired performance, indicating the direction and magnitude of convergence/divergence. Finally, policy implications of these empirical findings are suggested. </jats:p>",

The sequence used in the approach is to determine (1) the decisions to be made with the aid of inventory data, (2) the data needed to soundly base the decisions, and (3) the impact of sampling error in the data on the decisions. Sample intensities that minimize the cost of obtaining data plus the expected losses from using the data to make decisions were determined. A cost plus loss minimization framework for multiple-use planning inventory was developed and applied to a case study on a U.S. Forest Service planning unit. Results indicated that the procedure should provide useful guides for allocating sampling resources. </jats:p>",

First, there is no standard land-use classification employed consistently by all local authorities. Second, there is no standard and unambiguous set of areal units to which such a classification could be applied. Third, there is no efficient means of collecting land-use data in a form which meets the information needs of policymakers. Adoption of a standard land-use classification applied to functional units is advocated. It is argued that point sampling is a cheap and efficient means of collecting land-use statistics in a form which meets planning needs. The advantages of point sampling compared with alternative techniques are considered in detail. </jats:p>",

Reports of their actual subsequent family planning behavior were obtained 12 months later via a mailed questionnaire. The data was gathered and analyzed according to Fishbein's attitude‐behavior model which stipulates that the individual's actual behavior is a function of one's behavioral intention. This intention, in turn, is determined by two multiple factors: (a) the individual's beliefs about the consequences of performing the behavior multiplied by his/her evaluation of those consequences, and (b) one's normative beliefs multiplied by one's motivation to comply with the perceived norms. The results provided substantial support for the model; both behavioral intention and actual behavior were successfully predicted from the attitudinal and normative components of the model. It was also shown that the behavioral intention mediates the relationship between the model's attitudinal and normative components and actual behavior.</jats:p>",
