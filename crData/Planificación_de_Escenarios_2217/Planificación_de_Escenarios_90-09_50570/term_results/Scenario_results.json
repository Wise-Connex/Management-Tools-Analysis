      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Various approaches have been proposed for determining scenario probabilities to facilitate long‐range planning and decision making. These include microlevel approaches based on the analysis of relevant underlying events and their interrelations and direct macrolevel examination of the scenarios. The determination of a unique solution demands excessive consistency and time requirements on the part of the expert and often is not guaranteed by these procedures. We propose an interactive information maximizing scenario probability query procedure (IMQP) that exploits the desirable features of existing methods while circumventing their drawbacks. The approach requires elicitation of cardinal probability assessments and bounds for only marginal and first‐order conditional events, as well as ordinal probability comparisons (probability orderings or rankings) of carefully selected scenario subsets determined using concepts of information theory. Guidelines for implementation based on simulation results are also developed. A goal program for handling inconsistent ordinal probability responses is also integrated into the procedure. The results of behavioral experimentation (which compared our approach to Expert Choice and showed that the IMQP was viable) compared favorably in terms of ease of use and time requirements, and works best for problems with a large number of scenarios. Design modifications to IMQP learned from the experiments, such as incorporating interactive graphics, are also in progress.</jats:p>",
