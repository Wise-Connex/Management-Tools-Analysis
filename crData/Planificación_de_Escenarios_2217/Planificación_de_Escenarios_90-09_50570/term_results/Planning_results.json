      "abstract": "<jats:p> A key distinguishing feature of British society in the 1980s was a redrawing of the legitimate extent and nature of state intervention in the workings of a market economy. Deregulation, intended to enhance the power of capital, depended centrally not just upon creating and sustaining new labour-market conditions, but also on developing an environment in which capital had freedom to invest and manoeuvre (inter)nationally and locally. One mechanism for the latter was a redefinition of planning, epitomised in the creation of Urban Development Corporations (UDCs). This paper uses the area of the largest UDC, Teesside in northeast England, as a vehicle through which to investigate these recent policies in a broad historical context. It proceeds in three stages, at each of which Teesside was at the forefront of key national changes. From 1945 to the mid-1970s an increasing array of national and local government policies sought to plan the development of the area. This contrasted markedly with the context of deregulation which was created from the late 1970s onwards, partly in response to the apparent failure of state planning. An enhanced role for the private sector was encouraged by parallels drawn with the past, in particular with Victorian city-founding entrepreneurs, Although such analogies were questionable, they were revealing, for the legacy of this period on Teesside in social and environmental terms was devastating. The paper concludes by pointing to the significance of these lessons of history; of the new context for planning in Britain in the 1980s; and of political–institutional arrangements as a means of solidifying capital's command over space. </jats:p>",

Present national planning objectives focus upon developing the means to accommodate these centers. But such development strategies often encounter difficulties, for centralization on the order currently found in the Marshalls has neither historic nor sociocultural precedent. In this study regional change in the Marshall Islands is examined in terms of demographic development, and regional evolution assessed through complementary statistical measures of spatial autocorrelation, point-to-point temporal association, and spatio-temporal association. It is concluded that the current regional imbalance in population and human resources in the Marshalls represents a significant break from past trends which may well be unsustainable. Alternative regional planning strategies are suggested which appeal to the historic and sociocultural foundations of the area. </jats:p>",

Its conceptual and methodological basis is in sharp contrast to the neoclassical premise of location theory, in dealing with contingency, collectivity, multiplicity, and uncertainty. Industrial location decisionmaking is approximated with a multidimensional simulation of (intraurban) locational choice. The likelihood of the location of high-technology firms in an ‘incubator’ and/or a ‘research park’ environment is derived by using Saaty's analytic hierarchy process. From the simulation output a means of fine-tuning public and private objectives and priorities is provided, and alternative policies for development planning to affect a desirable outcome of industrial location within a targeted urban redevelopment zone are suggested. The variance in the degree of uncertainty which bears upon the multiple dimensions of the contemporary problem of deciding upon industrial location is shown explicitly. </jats:p>",

Minimizing future damage can best be accomplished by using existing systems more efficiently, thus. reducing the need for supply augmentation: In the U.S., agriculture accounts for 83% of the annual total water consumption. The municipal and industrial sectors account for the remaining use. These shares are inversely related to economic value; agricultural water is worth between $30 and $75 per acre-foot in most applications while water in the municipal sector may be worth as much as $300 to $500 per acre-foot. The system inefficiencies implied by the sectors' use and relative economic values make it clear that water supply planning can be improved. If cost-effectiveness were the criterion against which water supply options and alternatives were assessed, system management and end–use efficiency would replace supply augmentation. Institutional, not technical, constraints prevent the adoption of the mote efficient options. Were these constraints relaxed, the monetary and environmental savings would be substantial.</jats:p>",

As part of the kill planning, simulations by use of the dynamic two-phase pipe flow simulator OLGA were performed. The code, originally developed for two-phase hydrocarbon flow in pipelines and risers, was modified to handle injection of kill fluids and inflow from the reservoir. This paper presents the principles for the kill simulator, the results of the simulations and how these results were used in the design of the kill operation.

An n-surface convex polyhedron is viewed as the intersection of n half-spaces and is represented by n linear inequality equations while the square of the distance between two points is of a quadratic form in terms of two sets of x-y-z coordinates. The static distance-to-contact between two non-interfering convex polyhedral shapes is then directly solvable by quadratic programming. Based on the concept of distance-past-contact, distance calculations for situations with interference are presented and tested in optimization based robot path planning examples. The distance evaluation is further investigated for the dynamic situations by a swept volume computation strategy. The approach is illustrated in examples with a moving robot link and a fixed obstacle.</jats:p>",

Fifth-order non-periodic curves are chosen for this purpose. The main ideas are twofold: firstly, to avoid collision by moving around obstacles from the less blocking sides; and secondly, to assign two control points to all vertices of the control polygon. This method guarantees the generation of paths which have C3 continuity everywhere and satisfy the collision-free requirement. In addition, the obstacles can be of any shape, and the computational complexity and difficulty are relatively low. A computer code is developed for the implementation of this method. Cases study is given for illustration.</jats:p>",

Data (N = 718) were collected from textiles and clothing departments at 16 major universities across the nation, including majors in merchandising, apparel design, interior design, and/or consumer science. Perceptions of one's courses, overall satisfaction with one's university, attitude toward one's major, and occupational orientation were the most frequently significant multiple‐regression predictor variables of students'satisfaction with their majors/departments. Students did not differ significantly in their expectations of career opportunitieslservices or pro gram enrichment and differed only slightly in their expectations of attributes related to program quality/status. However, there were significant differences in current satisfaction with the department among the four groups of students. Students also differed across majors in the areas of attitude toward one's major, academic/career influences, social and self influences, overall satisfaction with one's university, and occupational orientation. The authors discuss these attitu dinal differences, possible reasons for them, and implications for departmental planning, recruiting, and retaining students in each of the four program areas.</jats:p>",

In this essay I aim to participate in such an endeavour by linking Mikhail Bakhtin's work to geographical inquiry. Concepts such as dialogism, heteroglossia, the chronotope, and polyphony are only a sample of his valuable contributions to the theory of knowledge, alongside the ‘carnival’ sense of the world that conveys a pathos of shift and change, of death and renewal. ‘Carnival’ sums up the rituals and diverse festivities that reflect popular culture. Together these notions lead to a better understanding of otherness and alterity. This understanding provides the basis for a conceptual landscape that indicates the moment and situation (time-space) of a dialogue whose outcome is never a neutral exchange. Landscape thus becomes not only ‘graphically visible’ in space but also ‘narratively visible’ in time through dialogue. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the mid-1980s, Britain initiated a new neighborhood regeneration program based on a US model, Neighborhood Housing Services. Both programs are based on a partnership between residents, the private sector, and local governments. The central objective of the British government was to reorient British national housing rehabilitation policy from its traditional public-sector, grant-based programs to the private-sector, loan-based system which characterizes US policy. The British program, Neighbourhood Revitalisation Services (NRS), began as a pilot program in four cities and was expanded to twenty-five more neighborhoods. Data suggest considerable reluctance among British homeowners to tap their own savings or borrow money to make home improvements in the NRS neighborhoods. That reluctance may stem from some disincentives built into the early stages of the new program. Thus, at least in the short term, the data suggest that the transition to the US private-sector model has not been readily embraced by British homeowners. In the long term, the success or failure of the policy transfer effort is likely to hinge on whether British homeowners can be convinced that the private-sector approach is here to stay and that a change of governments will not bring a return of the long-established public-sector model with its grant-based foundation. </jats:p>",

An attempt is made to strip rent discourse of those peculiarities that have alienated some of its potential audience, thereby turning the theory into the esoteric property of an academic coterie. The discussion of the last fifteen years is divided into three phases, namely consensus (in the 1970s), transition (at the turn of the decade), and rupture (in the 1980s). The typical beliefs, claims, and tenets of each phase are reconstructed and discussed, and the transition from one phase to another is analyzed. In order to facilitate and incite further discussion the present, that is third, phase is purposefully construed in terms of two rival lines of thought: the idiographic line (that denies the possibility of a general theory of land rent, advocating instead the analysis of concrete situations), and the nomothetic line (that searches for general laws). The first line is rejected in favour of the second. </jats:p>",

A capital-asset-pricing model is used which enables investors, on the basis of the risk characteristics of investing in private rental housing, to quantify the rate of return they might require from investing in this sector. Aggregate data are used to show that in much of Britain fair rents have been greater than the target rate of return identified. It is argued that the reasons for disinvestment, as well as the challenge facing any policy initiatives which set out to attract new capital, are to be found in other characteristics of the sector, such as management costs, political risk, and the relationship with capital values in the owner-occupied sector. It is also argued that these additional characteristics are likely to have less of a negative influence on investment for middle-income, rather than low-income, tenants. </jats:p>",

The problem, which McQuillan called the declining even flow effect (DEFE), can occur during repeated iterations of a planning process in cases where a timber harvest scheduling model whose objective is wealth maximization subject to nondeclining yield constraints is utilized. The DEFE creates a situation in a sequence of plans over time in which the first period harvest level declines below that attained for previous planning iterations. This paper addresses the relationship between the process used by the Forest Service to develop FORPLAN models and the DEFE. An example using Kootenai National Forest planning documents is presented to illustrate the highly constrained nature of Forest Service planning models. The effect of these constraints and other characteristics of FORPLAN models on the DEFE is examined. Two items common to nearly all forest planning models, a land base which is not entirely old-growth and constraints to assure that the 40-ac clearcut limit is not violated, caused a large reduction in the DEFE observed in a FORPLAN version of McQuillan's case study model. However, one characteristic of Forest Service planning models, the use of intermediate harvest options, which plausibly could have reduced the DEFE, did not. The major conclusion of the study is that the regulations, initial conditions, and formulation of the FORPLAN model all tend to reduce the likelihood and magnitude of the DEFE. For.

In this way the differential properties of motion of the end-effector are obtained from the well-known curvature theory of a ruled surface. The robot can then be programmed so that the end-effector will follow the prescribed trajectory with high accuracy. In the case where the ruled surface cannot be described by an explicit analytic function, the ruled surface may be represented by a geometric modeling technique. Since a ruled surface can be expressed in terms of a single parameter, a curve generating technique is used to represent the ruled surface. The technique presented in this paper is the Ferguson curve model which guarantees that the trajectory will pass through all of the set points and will have curvature continuity at each set point. To illustrate the proposed method of robot trajectory planning, a practical example is included in the paper.</jats:p>",

By applying the new technique of catastrophe theory into this new urban economic framework, it is shown that the spatial structure which will dominate the intraurban space will depend on the values of two parameters, representing the income level and the unit cost of transporting the central services. When these parameters take certain critical values the urban system may undergo catastrophic structural transitions from equilibrium to disequilibrium or the reverse. </jats:p>",

In this paper it is argued that this need not be the case if a set of environmentally compensating, or ‘shadow’, projects within an overall portfolio are used to ensure a sustainability objective of setting a constraint on the depletion and degradation of the stock of natural capital. This can be achieved through both a ‘weak’ and a ‘strong’ sustainability criterion. In both cases the resulting optimum differs from the efficient optimum of the conventional cost-benefit criterion, but the basic cost-benefit model remains intact. </jats:p>",

The company had 110,000 U.S. employees at more than 100 locations engaged in a variety of manu facturing, research, sales, and support occupations in 1980. The PRECEDE framework was used to focus program planning and evaluation on key areas of health knowledge, attitudes, and behavior. The needs assessment included use of company morbidity and mortality data, a survey of medical and human resources staff, and a survey of employees, spouses, and pensioners. An in-house network of lay committees, site medical personnel, and corporate health education, nutrition and fitness specialists was used to staff critical program functions. Interventions included: public health approaches to program kick- off and health risk assessment; group and self-directed lifestyle change activities; rec ognition and awards; and workplace climate changes such as smoking policies that favor nonsmokers. One pilot location experienced a 47.5% decline in hourly employee absen teeism over six years versus a 12.5% decline in the total Du Pont hourly workforce. A number of lessons are discussed on how to improve the planning, implementation, in stitutionalization, and evaluation of health promotion programs in large industrial com panies. Four areas where future research and practice should be focused include: reaching spouses, sales personnel, shiftworkers, and employees at small sites; balancing what is popular with what reduces risks over the long-term; documenting program impacts when research resources are scarce; and integrating health promotion programs with workplace medical, safety, employee assistance and benefits programs. </jats:p>",

In fact, the industry, having been a world leader until the late 1950s, declined until its demise by 1975. In Italy the success of the restructuring process was not based on the reorganization of existing firms, but on the emergence of new producers and product differentiation. The major factor in the restructuring of the Italian motorcycle industry was a radical innovation in the production process of motorcycle frames. This innovation has led to the development of two types of motorcycle firms with different final products and in different locations. </jats:p><jats:p> In Northwest Italy, the lower production cost of the new frame led to the appearance of several new, large, highly-integrated manufacturers geared to standardized mass production. At the same time, however, new motorcycle production also began in Central Italy in a large number of small, specialized firms. In this case, the success of the restructuring was based not so much on low production costs as on the flexibility of production allowed both by the new production methods and by the social characteristics of the region. </jats:p>",

Agglomeration forces and market opportunities, unions, wages, climate, and university research parks are best used to explain employment growth. Employment losses are related to declining markets and the downsizing of establishments. Agglomeration forces which influence the growth of total manufacturing are metropolitan-size related, in contrast to industry-specific externalities for individual high-technology sectors. The results indicate that growth rates decline with increasing industry concentration and metropolitan size. Policy variables based on taxes and public expenditures are not significant. The interrelationships between social and economic characteristics in selected metropolitan areas are explored. The effects of these relationships on the determinants of total manufacturing growth and decline are identified. </jats:p>",

This study examines the impact of different procedures for considering inventory‐related costs and capacity limitations in the two phases of planning: master production scheduling and bill‐of‐material (BOM) processing. A total of nine procedures are considered for integrating the two phases of planning. The results indicate that the integrated procedures have a significant effect on the trade‐offs among inventory‐related costs, work load variations, over/under time costs, and excess work loads. Further, the results suggest that the method used to develop the MPS has the primary influence on these trade‐offs, but the method used by the BOM processor can sometimes have a moderating effect.</jats:p>",

Nurse and client engage in a truly collaborative planning and implementation of care only after there is mutual understanding of the special meaning of beliefs and values from which health behaviors are derived. Educational preparation with experience in applying cultural knowledge is essential to the development of sensitive nursing practice. Integrating such information and experiences into baccalaureate nursing curricula through a sociocultural project will enhance student awareness of client values and beliefs and their potential nursing implications.

As this trend continues, it is not surprising that there is growing emphasis on the ability of organizations to plan, design and implement critical information systems. A major strategy to improve the effectiveness of these processes is the use of computer-based planning and design aids. However, there is little empirical evidence that using this technology provides a significant performance impact. One factor limiting research on the impact of technology on planning and design is the manner in which this technology has been conceptualized for measuring usage behavior. This research develops a functional model of I/S planning and design support technology that distinguishes three general functional dimensions: Production Technology, Coordination Technology and Organizational Technology. An empirical analysis is used to test the robustness of the proposed model and its ability to discriminate among current design aids in a meaningful way. Implications for the use of this model in the study of I/S planning and design processes are discussed. </jats:p>",

We present a hierarchical design for a planning system which addresses some of the real-time aspects of planning for threat response. This paper concentrates on the lowest level of this hierarchy which is responsible for planning combat maneuvers at low altitude over hilly terrain when the enemy is not in sight. REACT’s Lost Line of Sight module attempts to maximize the amount and depth of knowledge which can be utilized in the time available before the system must commit to its next action. It utilizes a hybrid architecture for planning decisions which incorporates multiple knowledge representations and planners based on artificial intelligence, neural networks, and decision theory. This architecture allows planning at different degrees of competence to be performed by concurrently operating planners with differing amounts of knowledge. We describe research on the planning issues in REACT as well as the associated knowledge representation and knowledge acquisition issues. In addition, we describe how work on developing terrain reasoning capability in REACT has suggested guidelines for knowledge base design and data management, system and language specifications, and planner architectures pertinent to real-time coupled systems. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The developing countries would need to achieve an increase in their agricultural output by more than threefold during the next century to keep up with increasing demand, stemming from growth in population, incomes and urbanization. There is an urgent need for each country to quantify its long-term food and agricultural requirements and assess them against the possibilities of sustainable production from its own land resources. The extent to which physical resources of soil, climate, terrain and water can be utilized to produce food and agricultural products is limited. The ecological limits to production are set by soil and climatic conditions as well as by specific production inputs and management applied. Any 'mining ' of land resources beyond these ecological limits will, in the long run, only result in degradation and ever-decreasing productivity of land and of outputs, unless attention is paid to the management, conservation and enhancement of the natural resource base. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization agro-ecological zone (AEZ) methodology is concerned with the quantification of land resources and their potential agricultural productivity and population supporting capacity for development planning. The AEZ Kenya country methodology is described.</jats:p>",

Evidence is reviewed on the linkages between health conditions and three of the most important educational problems in developing countries-children who are unprepared to begin school at the usual age, the failure of many students to learn adequately in school, and the unequal participation in schooling by girls. It is clear that although less attention has been paid to the health and nutrition status of school-age children than to that of children of preschool age or of adults, existing data are adequate to identify several widespread problems among school-age children that have well established negative consequences for school participation and performance. These problems include chronic protein-energy malnutrition, iron-deficiency anaemia, iodine deficiency and intestinal helminth infection. It was also observed that a number of other infectious diseases, as well as disability, premature fertility, and substance abuse, are also likely to undermine the health and educational success of many school-age children. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the history of policy for the management of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom is reviewed, highlighting the numerous shifts in policy and the combination of political and technical factors at work. It is argued that much of the public distrust of plans for radioactive waste and the public perception of the risks of the disposal of radioactive waste is heavily influenced by that history. </jats:p><jats:p> Reviewed in particular in this paper is the recent public discussion programme on the deep disposal of radioactive wastes. With use of the writings of C Wright Mills, it is argued that public responses to that programme of discussion reflect certain ‘vocabularies of motive’ which are constrained by the broad framework of policy for the management of radioactive waste in the United Kingdom. Rather than being simply NIMBY responses, many of the public views expressed reflect a hierarchy of concerns about environmental risks: local economic impact, health and the environment, and distrust of the nuclear industry. It is argued that the NIMBY concept may be applied too readily, a convenient attribution of motive which disguises a more fundamental range of technical, environmental, and socioeconomic concerns. The NIMBY concept should therefore be rejected as distorting and unhelpful. </jats:p>",

Discussion is placed within the particular context of studies of US deregulation, and their wider relevance to proposed European Community liberalisation. From these, a consensus is emerging that deregulation can succeed only if accompanied by vigorous government measures to act against merger, acquisition, and other anticompetitive devices used by existing carriers to protect their positions. Thus, in part, successful deregulation demands both airport capacity and airport competition in order to increase the number of potential routes for new-market entrants and to obviate at least some of those advantages which accrue to incumbent carriers. Because these conditions are satisfied in Northern Ireland, that region is used as a case study of the efficacy of UK domestic deregulatory policy. The analysis concludes that, given sufficient airport capacity, the increased competition between airlines and airports sponsored by deregulatory policies can have significantly positive benefits for producers in terms of increased demand. Consumers also gain on fares but particularly from enhanced frequency of services. In turn, the advantage of greater frequency is dependent upon the utilisation of a different type of domestic aircraft fleet. </jats:p>",
