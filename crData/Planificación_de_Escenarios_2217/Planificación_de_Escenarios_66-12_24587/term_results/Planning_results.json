The main impulse for the gradual elaboration of a distinctive national system came from two directions. First, the Yugoslav conception of federalism was based on the association of six regions (Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Macedonia, Montenegro) with very distinct national, historical, and social traditions and in different stages of economic development. This meant balancing central economic direction with concern for regional needs and interests. Second, the break with Stalinist Russia in 1948 no doubt stimulated a desire to develop, together with political and ideological independence, a distinctive national economic philosophy of communism in contrast to the overcentralized planning bureaucracy of the Soviet Union.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> At present, the term planning has many meanings and little substance. It is an omnibus word or a dressing gown under which a variety of management matters masquerade. So many management activities are described as planning that the significance of the term may have succumbed to generality. </jats:p><jats:p> The planning function appears to be a status generator, presumably because planning is closely associated with top managements' interests. It is surrounded with emotional issues furthermore, that help to obscure the difference between what we say we are doing (i.e., planning) and what we are doing (?). </jats:p><jats:p> Although planning models are the subject of this paper, from the viewpoint of consistent terminology and unambiguous definition they don't exist. On the other hand, as judged by common usage, most management science models qualify as planning models. At the uppermost entrepreneurial levels planning is almost exclusively an intuitional affair. But characteristically these domains are dramatically unstable. No maps exist for traveling in such regions. Usually, even the fundamental dimensions are unknown. </jats:p><jats:p> What planning models have been built to cope with these real and vital top-management problems? Search and survey answers, none. Consequently, a paper about planning models can either continue as in present practice to ignore critical issues, or can begin with simple classification—more or less as Linnaeus started back in the 1700's. We have chosen the latter course and begin this paper by attempting to develop a workable taxonomy. </jats:p>",

But, instead of demanding an analysis of research itself, from which conscious control might ultimately be expected, they focus their attention on the consequences of scientific activity. They recommend the scientific comprehension of the results of science, on the ground that only thus can we save ourselves from calamitous consequences. A feeling of helplessness and resignation in the face of the apparent autonomy of technological development is quite common. Its origins may reach far back. With Heraclitus, we feel that war is “the father of all things,” and reach the height of our pessimism in Spengler's Kulturkritik. “The master of the world becomes the slave of the machine.” </jats:p><jats:p> This attitude of resignation prevails among large numbers of educated Germans, who persist in closing their eyes to the connections between scientific development and social factors. </jats:p>",

Various definitions of physical planning are discussed leading to the conclusion that the execution of a policy invariably means a synthesis of physical elements, social aims and economic forces.</jats:p><jats:p>Following the introduction a paragraph is devoted to the social changes which affect the physical lay‐out of our countries. Demographic, economic and social changes are reviewed. It is concluded that far‐reaching urbanization will be the result of these changes. This urbanization, in juxtaposition to all the changes already taking place, will lead to the fact that agriculture will be pressed even harder and be confronted with the necessity to adapt. It is noted that demands are made upon rural areas from the urban regions. The countryside will be, next to an area of agrarian production, a recreation area and spatially an open area. This necessitates a change of policy with regard to agriculture and rural areas. The various ways in which this can be done are demonstrated by the Dutch situation. The country is divided into primarily agriculture areas, agricultural‐recreational areas, agricultural areas in the urban sphere, and buffer zones. Special attention is paid to the legislation on physical planning in general and on rural reconstruction in particular.</jats:p><jats:p>The paper ends with the confirmation that there is a definite interaction between physical planning and social change. Finally, it is emphasized that co‐ordination of the various policies carried out by ministries, provinces and municipalities is an absolute necessity for really satisfactory physical planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Some parts of the long-range planning problem have been widely discussed. Other parts have received less attention. Of the relatively neglected areas, one of special importance is manpower planning. Manpower planning includes a specification of the kinds and numbers of men an organization will need to accomplish its profit, growth, or service objectives; a forecast from current personnel inventories of how well it is now set to meet the projected needs; and by a comparison of needs with forecasted supply, the formulation of plans for recruiting, assigning, and developing personnel. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper explores some issues in manpower planning. We review some of the kinds of approaches that have been tried and look in some detail at two approaches which seem especially promising. </jats:p>",
