      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is argued that there are difficulties in current transportation practice because the existing process does not reflect adequately the context in which urban transportation investments are actually made. Such investments are made sequentially and the planner therefore has the opportunity to monitor the performance of implemented projects and to use this information to reappraise future investments. Decisions are also made under conditions of uncertainty with respect to future demand and costs of construction and operation. This paper demonstrates how some principles of statistical decision theory may be used to structure the sequential nature of transportation investments and to provide for formal treatments of uncertainty and the value of information. A hypothetical example is presented to illustrate the application of the framework developed. </jats:p>",

Knowing where your family’s records and valuable documents are and being able to pick them up and take them with you, if you must evacuate, can save valuable time. For your “on the go” papers you will want to purchase a packet, folder, brief case or other carrying case for your documents. Place documents in this case in a secure but easily accessed location in your home. Then if you need to evacuate, important documents that need to go with you are in one place. This document is FCS9197, one of a series of the Department of Family, Youth and Community Sciences, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, IFAS, University of Florida, Gainesville FL 32611.

The popularity and success rate of the Library can be determined by the fact that within a year of its launch, it not only attracted more than 24,000 visitors and gained more than 1,500 subscribers, but also increased the volume of the hosted content from a few documents to more than 2,000 important documents, presentations, tutorials and links.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThe KnowGenesis (KG) Library presents a unique case for repository designers to study the complex design and implementation process that contributed to the stability and overall success rate of the online Library.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nThis paper not only shares the designing and implementation challenges faced by the KnowGenesis team, but also presents the approach used to match the user requirements with the Library design.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Quality Assurance Agency (QAA, 2001) suggests that all Higher Education Institutions must offer every student the opportunity to consider their own personal development and promoted Personal Development Planning (PDP) as an important part of supporting and engaging students in their own development whilst within higher education and beyond. The term Personal Development Planning means many things to many people and institutions often appear to adopt their own definition of it. This can be complicated further when faculties or departments within an institution each create their own meaning. Research indicates that staff perceptions of the material they are teaching has a direct link with studentsÃ¢â¬â¢ opinions of these activities, so in order to promote and resource PDP effectively it is essential to consider what staff actually think of PDP.This paper considers the difference between the perceived usefulness of PDP and its elements (reflection, self awareness, action planning and employability), and what it is that impacts upon that view of PDP. The data collected offers the opportunity for both qualitative and quantitative analysis, using free text and ranks of usefulness through an online questionnaire across different faculties within Birmingham City University. The research suggests that both PDP as a process and its elements are perceived as useful by academic staff and it also indicates that the elements are seen as significantly more useful in isolation. It further suggests the rationale for the ranking of PDP as a process was directly linked to perception rather than experience.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the UK, institutional strategies regarding Personal Development Planning (PDP) are based on two main approaches: 1) legitimising local practices, with an emphasis on PDP process, and 2) central approaches, often IT based, focused on meeting threshold requirements (Ward et al., 2006).This paper reports on the nature and purposes of situated PDP practices that have evolved in four academic programmes of study within a UK university that took the first approach. The study examines the sorts of local PDP practices that have developed within such an institutional framework; how they have come about and what they say about the role and nature of PDP.Using an ethnographic approach, supplemented by staff interviews and document analysis, the four case studies illustrate how an enabling institutional framework has afforded academic course teams the spaces to develop implicit and explicit PDP practices. In two cases a formal and explicit programme-deep model of PDP through e-Portfolio has been developed. In the others, there are implicit, but strong PDP practices evident although they are not necessarily claimed as PDP. The four case studies are not readily categorised but they do exhibit hybrid characteristics of the Ã¢â¬ËprofessionalÃ¢â¬â¢, Ã¢â¬ËemploymentÃ¢â¬â¢ and Ã¢â¬ËacademicÃ¢â¬â¢ domains (Clegg and Bradley, 2006).In conclusion, it will be argued that the diverse and situated nature of PDP practices that have emerged in different contexts need not be seen as institutionally troublesome. These four cases present authentic pictures of what PDP has become, even if it isnÃ¢â¬â¢t called PDP.</jats:p>"

The curricular changes, the new role for the personal tutor and the design of the necessary staff development programme are explained. Having begun to implement the new role, personal tutorsÃ¢â¬â¢ views are explored through interview data. A key theme to emerge is the significance of relationship building in this new curriculum structure and, following identification of the challenges, the paper concludes with recommendations in light of this experience.</jats:p>"

A third of dissertations received grades equating to third class honours or fails and this was viewed by the Faculty as being unacceptable. As a Fellow of the UniversityÃ¢â¬â¢s Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning with a focus on personal development, I was asked by the course leader to identify possible causes and suggest changes. My critical reflection on the dissertation suggested that its creation is predicated upon Personal Development Planning (PDP) processes practised through the mediation of the tutorial. I am investigating the effectiveness of the tutorial to support learner development over a two year period, contributing to an overarching action research project undertaken by the National Action Research Network (NARN). This paper presents the outcomes of the first cycle of my action research, involving the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data from students and dissertation supervisors. At this stage it appears that the design of the dissertation meets the needs of some students but not all, particularly the lower third of the sample cohort. Furthermore some students, including a number of thirds and fails, do not perceive tutorial support as essential for the successful completion of their dissertations. Overall, it appears that the tutorial process requires review in order to support the autonomous and/or collaborative learning needed for effective learner development.</jats:p>"

The role of technology in supporting PDP processes is acknowledged and in particular the close association between PDP and e-Portfolio practices is examined. The article concludes with a look at current initiatives which draw on PDP concepts, the continuing importance of these concepts to educational practice and the size of the research task which still lies ahead.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past decade government policy has emphasised the need for effective and active partnerships between employers and higher education providers (DfES, 2003; Wedgewood, 2007; CBI, 2008; BIS, 2009) to meet the requirements of a globalised knowledge economy. This paper discusses the findings from a research project undertaken at the University of Salford which sought to explore how:Personal Development Planning (PDP) input can support the development of employability skills for part-time sponsored students.Employer engagement could be drawn upon to enhance such provision.Informed by the Appreciative Inquiry approach (Cooperrider 1986, cited Reed, 2007), the methodology included a questionnaire survey of two student cohorts and thirteen semi-structured interviews with organisational development managers from sponsoring organisations to explore perceptions of the value of PDP within day release provision and potential benefits to the organisation. A follow up focus group with employers explored further staff development needs and the potential for PDP processes within Higher Education (HE) courses to complement their existing Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and in-house staff and workforce development strategies.Savory, Conroy and Berwick The role of Personal Development Planning (PDP) for employer sponsored studentsThe paper concludes that dialogue between academic staff, students and sponsoring employers is valuable in developing shared understandings of the role of PDP activities within HE curriculum, the potential benefits for individual professional development and the workforce development requirements of organisations. Employers participating in the research stressed the importance of 'functioning knowledge' (Biggs 2003, cited Walsh, 2008) and discussions highlighted the potential for PDP to provide a bridge between the discipline specific knowledge which forms the main focus of HE courses and the trans-disciplinary knowledge produced by the largely informal learning that occurs during the course of professional practice (Gibbons et al., 1964). The joint dialogue enabled exploration of perceptions of the difference between CPD and PDP and identification of how links between PDP and appraisal processes in the workplace could be strengthened, including suggestions for practical activities which could be incorporated into HE programmes and employers' performance review processes.</jats:p>"

This was a National Teaching Fellowship Scheme funded project which ran from 2007-1010 and involved sixteen English Higher Education institutions (HEIs). The context, purposes, theoretical underpinnings and framework for the NARN are briefly explained before the experience of members is explored through an analysis of their own accounts. The NARN was proposed in response to widespread calls for more research evidence to underpin our understanding and implementation of Personal Development Planning (PDP) and e-Portfolio practices, taking its lead from Clegg's (2004) invitation to produce more researched examples of situated PDP and e-Portfolio practice. The NARN was primarily a capacity-building project aimed at developing a community of PDP and e-portfolio practitioners into practitioner researchers. Borrowing heavily on ideas of community and participative inquiry as well as concepts about developing communities of practice, the project placed an emphasis on promoting collegiality, a sense of belonging and the establishment of the project as a safe space in which to discuss research work. It is evaluated here through the thematic analysis of a particular data set of twelve anonymous accounts provided by project members. The NARN project's emphasis on process rather than product or output, mark it apart from most Higher Education (HE) learning and teaching funded projects. Its success carries an important lesson for fundholders, educational developers and HE managers about the funding of more process-based learning and teaching development in HE. It also provides a possible framework for similar capacity-building projects across other communities.</jats:p>"
