      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the course of many years, professional planners have used a plethora of methods and tools to support their planning activities. Nevertheless, it can be argued that planning practioners have never fully embraced the much wider diversity of available methods, techniques, and models developed in the research laboratories. On the basis of this observation, this study poses several questions about why there is an apparent mismatch in planning practice between supply, demand, and applications of planning-support instruments (including ‘planning support systems’) and their outcomes (dedicated information and knowledge), and how this mismatch can be solved. In order to arrive at an answer, a conceptual framework is constructed, which constitutes crucial factors that influence the potential planning support roles of information, knowledge, and instruments. With the help of this framework, a developmental overview is interpreted of the theoretical planning traditions that exerted an influence on planning practice during the last half millennium in the Western world. From this interpretation, some lessons can be learned about the improvement of the planning-support role in factual planning practice, and moreover, it opens up some new questions and discussion points. </jats:p>",

First, it briefly sketches the status of planning education at present in India, in relation to the role of planners in planning practice. It then descibes the changes that have taken place in general, following the Constitutional Amendment Act, dwelling more on the specific changes within the State of Kerala. The implications of these for planning education in general are then discussed normatively, highlighting three areas that need immediate attention from the planning academic community. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A strong current of food-systems research holds that local food systems are preferable to systems at larger scales. Many assume that eating local food is more ecologically sustainable and socially just. We term this the local trap and argue strongly against it. We draw on current scale theory in political and economic geography to argue that local food systems are no more likely to be sustainable or just than systems at other scales. The theory argues that scale is socially produced: scales (and their interrelations) are not independent entities with inherent qualities but strategies pursued by social actors with a particular agenda. It is the content of that agenda, not the scales themselves, that produces outcomes such as sustainability or justice. As planners move increasingly into food-systems research, we argue it is critical to avoid the local trap. The article’s theoretical approach to scale offers one way to do so. </jats:p>",

There are strong rationales in pedagogic, professional development, employment, and personal terms. But what of student experiences of work experience? How do student planners approach, experience, and reflect on workplace engagements? This article explores these experiential dimensions through a survey of a cohort of Australian students involved in a yearlong paid placement as part of an accredited undergraduate planning degree. It discusses the changing expectations of students and whether these were realized, their major learning experiences, and an overall evaluation of off-campus learning. The findings have wider relevance for evaluating student assessments of work-based learning in planning education. </jats:p>",

By looking explicitly at the planning process through a series of case studies and a review of newspaper coverage, the research suggests strategies for how practitioners can craft a comprehensive and meaningful framework for assessing and addressing equity issues. </jats:p>",

These are injustices that planning traditionally attempted to address but now often obscures under the primacy of the economic imperative within dominant institutional interpretations of the sustainable development narrative. </jats:p>",

Sexual violence is defined as nonconsensual sex ranging from the use of threats and intimidation to unwanted touching and forced sex. Twenty‐five percent of women surveyed reported ever being physically forced to have sex; 13 percent reported that forced sex was attempted; 31 percent said that they were touched against their will; and 11 percent reported being forced to touch a man's genitals. Boyfriends were the most common perpetrators of actual and attempted forced sex (66 percent and 44 percent, respectively); known community members were the most common perpetrators of touching the respondent against her will (52 percent). Currently married women and those with more education were less likely than others to report that sex was forced upon them by an intimate partner or by another type of perpetrator. Women living in areas where a program raising awareness about sexual violence was ongoing were more likely to report a history of sexual violence. Given the high prevalence of HIV in Lesotho, programs should address women's right to control their sexuality.</jats:p>",

This study examines differences among temporary migrants in terms of sexual behavior and factors that make female migrants more vulnerable to the risk of acquiring HIV infection. Results suggest that the interplay of migration and gender renders female temporary migrants particularly vulnerable to engaging in casual and commercial sex. Although male temporary migrants do not differ from male nonmigrants in prevalence of casual and commercial sex, the prevalence rates of casual and commercial sex for female temporary migrants are found to be 14 and 80 times those for female nonmigrants, respectively. Female temporary migrants' higher unemployment rate and concentration in the service and entertainment sectors are keys to understanding differences in the prevalence of casual and commercial sex among temporary migrants according to sex. Policy measures to promote female temporary migrants' equal access to employment are urgently needed to improve their economic well‐being and to reduce their risky sexual behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I attempt to develop a comprehensive, robust model of urban morphology from a phenomenological and behavioral perspective. I do so by comparing the findings of two extensive empirical studies of users' experiences of urban public space: one primarily examining people's perceptions in relation to the practical task of wayfinding, and the other my own research into people's playful behavior in Melbourne, London, Berlin, and New York. Lynch himself called attention to “our delight … in ambiguity, mystery … surprise and disorder”, but little is known about what role specific spatial conditions might have in framing such experiences, or indeed about the diversity of impractical activities people actually pursue in urban spaces. With this paper I seek to fill these gaps. Three elements common to both studies (paths, nodes, and edges) describe the fundamental topological structure of space in relation to movement and visibility. I focus on the four spatial elements which differ between the two models (landmarks, districts, thresholds, and props). Field observations illustrate ways in which the latter two spatial elements frame particular noninstrumental, ‘playful’ experiences which are characteristic of the urban condition: spontaneous encounters with strangers; unfamiliar and risky bodily experiences; distraction, and interpreting new meanings in the urban fabric. </jats:p>",

On the Israeli side, we find that terrorism has contributed to an existing momentum of decentralization and accelerated a declining city center. On the Palestinian side, the construction of the Jerusalem barrier has changed the shape of the metropolitan area, separating neighborhoods from one another and some from the rest of the city. Together, terror and barriers are changing the topography of metropolitan Jerusalem. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The influence of colonial (British) rule on native (Indian) culture and vice versa has resulted in the development of ‘hybrid’ architectural styles, which are seen in the external ‘form’ of the buildings. The development of a hybrid style is an important phase in the evolution of domestic architecture in India. In this paper we explore whether such hybrid nature is also reflected in the spatial organizations of some colonial houses of eastern India. For this, a suitable methodology was evolved to analyze the spatial organizations. The compositional rules in the generation of spatial layout in these houses are analyzed through the use of space syntax analysis, with some modifications, in order to type them spatially. Typically, space syntax analysis deciphers the spatial organization by the formation of ‘inequality genotypes’, which describe only the integration (and segregation) of spaces as per the access relations. To understand more about the Indian social and cultural norms that might have influenced the spatial organizations of the houses, the accessibility, adjacency, and orientation of the spaces also need to be studied. In this paper we explain the methodology used to generate ‘genotype strings’, incorporate the aforementioned information, and help to understand and document the ingrained social and cultural factors in spatial organizations of the houses more explicitly. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Increasing recognition of the extent and speed of habitat fragmentation and loss, particularly in the urban fringe, is driving the need to analyze qualitatively and quantitatively regional landscape structure for decision support in land-use planning and environmental-policy implementation. The spatial analysis required in this area is not well served by existing spatial-data models. In this paper a new theoretical spatial-data metamodel is introduced as a tool for addressing such needs and a new formalism is presented for spatial-data models on the basis of ideas from mathematical graph theory and category theory. Additionally, this formalism is used to describe a specific spatial-data model useful within the problem domain of decision support for socioecological systems. This model explicitly includes the notion of graph duality. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we revisit the concept of entropy as it manifests itself in spatial terms. We focus specifically on the question of how entropy measures applied to different urban contexts can be adjusted to allow for meaningful comparisons between cities with differing geographic dimensions. It is well known that entropy is affected by the number of geographic units over which it is computed. As a result, the size and number of census tracts in an urban area constitute an intervening factor in making direct comparisons. Some authors advocate addressing this problem by normalizing entropy to its maximum value to derive a ‘relative entropy’ measure. We prove that this conventional normalization procedure does not suffice, and we show further that Theil's decomposition method does provide the proper solution. We then demonstrate how to apply this technique through the use of census data for US cities in 2000, with the empirical results clearly underlying the importance of making these adjustments. </jats:p>",

A key feature of the government's reforms has been the strengthening of regional spatial planning and the transfer of the regional planning function to unelected regional assemblies. We examine how far these reforms have assisted regions to achieve greater discretion over planning policies and a more corporate approach to spatial planning. Our central argument is that, given the absence of elected regional government in England, there are outstanding institutional, cultural, and resource obstacles to extending regional freedoms and flexibilities. Nonetheless, the introduction of new statutory regional spatial strategies, together with a greater commitment in Whitehall to coordinate regional budgets, offers a potential way forward. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present and apply a modeling methodology to reduce stormwater runoff through land-use planning, in order to mitigate the impact of nonpoint source pollution. A stormwater-runoff simulation model is used to generate peak discharge pseudodata, that are inputted into a regression analysis, in which the functional relationship between peak discharge and land-use variables is approximated as a quadratic function ( R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.98). This function is then used in an optimization model to allocate future land uses (urban, conservation, and agriculture) at the subwatershed level, in a way that minimizes the resulting peak discharge at the watershed outlet. A discharge reduction of 44% is achieved, compared with the discharge resulting from the present (actual) land-use pattern. The most downstream and upstream areas are to be protected with more conservation, and most urban activities are allocated to the minimal impact subwatershed. Sensitivity analyses are performed and suggest maintaining at least 25% of the land in a conservation state, developing no more than 12% for urban purposes, and no more than 70% for agricultural purposes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently, design-build-operate-transfer-style private-public partnerships have gained popularity both with left-wing and with right-wing governments as a means of effectively delivering large-scale transportation infrastructure projects. Proponents suggest that introducing competition and market forces into the procurement of public infrastructure can make decision making more accountable, contribute to greater technological innovation, and reduce the potential for construction-cost escalations that consistently have plagued transportation projects. However, this article shows that in the case of a new rapid-rail development in Vancouver, Canada, the private-public-partnership method of project delivery has been largely incongruent with increased accountability while failing to drive technological innovation or limit cost escalations during the planning process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, many planning departments at American universities have begun to teach introductory world-cities courses at the undergraduate level. This trend is explained by the growing recognition of the role and importance of undergraduate planning education, increasing interests in effects of globalization on cities, and pressures from university administrators for planning faculty to increase enrollment. This article reviews strategies adopted to teach world cities to undergraduate students. It presents insights from several sources: a content analysis of forty-three world-cities syllabi, a survey of instructors whose syllabi were analyzed, and the experience of one of the authors in teaching a hybrid course in world cities in which part of the course was taught online and another in class. The study findings provide useful suggestions for instructors, departments, and universities interested in innovative approaches to teach undergraduate courses in global urban topics. </jats:p>",

The two areas are similar in terms of socioeconomic characteristics, but the MCH‐FP area provides better maternal and child health and family planning services, resulting in different reproductive patterns, including lower fertility rates and longer intervals between pregnancies. We use data from the Matlab Demographic Surveillance System for nearly 126,000 singleton live births that occurred between 1982 and 2002 to investigate the extent to which the different reproductive patterns in the MCH‐FP area explain why infant and child mortality rates are lower there. Differences in reproductive patterns account for a small portion (up to 20 percent) of the variation in these rates between the MCH‐FP and comparison areas, suggesting that the majority of the difference is due to the quality of MCH services.</jats:p>",

This article synthesizes the survey literature on attitudes toward abortion in the region. We searched standard computer indexing services and polled colleagues at regional meetings to identify every methodologically sound quantitative study of abortion opinion in LAC published between 1985 and 2005. Of the 26 studies that met inclusion criteria, none was conducted in the Caribbean, 11 were conducted in Brazil, 11 in Mexico, 3 in Argentina, and 1 in Colombia. The majority of populations surveyed support abortion under a greater number of circumstances than are permitted in their respective countries, particularly in cases of rape and threat to life or health. Future abortion opinion surveys should ask about support for the legality of abortion rather than about abstract acceptance of abortion, and questions should be worded carefully to capture the complexities of the public's views on this issue.</jats:p>",

This study assesses the prevalence of and factors associated with induced abortion among 601 young women aged 15–24 who were surveyed in Edo State, Nigeria, in 2002. We find that 41 percent of all pregnancies reported by the young women surveyed were terminated, and we estimate the age‐specific abortion rate for 15–19‐year‐olds in Edo State at 49 abortions per 1,000 women, which is slightly higher than previous local estimates and nearly double the countrywide estimate for women aged 15–49. We construct explanatory multivariate models to predict the likelihood that a young woman has experienced sexual intercourse, has become pregnant, and has undergone an induced abortion, controlling for important demographic and risk‐behavior factors. Young women unmarried at the time of the interview are found to be significantly more likely than married women to have had an abortion. Young women who have experienced transactional or forced sex are also significantly more likely to report ever having had an abortion, as are young women who have experienced more than one pregnancy. We conclude with suggestions for modifying the content and target populations of behavioral change messages and programs in the area.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we report a study that uses space-syntax theories and techniques to develop a model explaining how spatial layouts, through their effects on movement and visible copresence, may affect face-to-face interaction in offices. Though several previous space-syntax studies have shown that spatial layouts have significant effects on movement and face-to-face interaction in offices, none has investigated the relations among movement, visible copresence, and face-to-face interaction in offices with significantly different layouts. On the basis of statistical analyses of the spatial and behavioral data collected at four moderately large offices, this study shows that spatial layouts have consistent effects on movement, but inconsistent effects on visible copresence and face-to-face interaction; that visible copresence, not movement, is an important predictor of face-to-face interaction; that movement has negligible effects on the relationship between visible copresence and face-to-face interaction; and that functional programs have little or no effect on the culture of face-to-face interaction in these offices. Limitations of the research design for workplace study and implications of the research findings for workplace design and management are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The major steps of sewerage rehabilitation include inspection of sewerage, assessment of structural conditions, computation of structural condition grades, and determination of rehabilitation methods and materials. Conventionally, sewerage rehabilitation planning relies on experts with professional background that is tedious and time-consuming. This paper proposes an automation model of planning optimal sewerage rehabilitation strategies for the sewer system by integrating image process, clustering technology, optimization, and visualization display. Firstly, image processing techniques, such as wavelet transformation and co-occurrence features extraction, were employed to extract various characteristics of structural failures from CCTV inspection images. Secondly, a classification neural network was established to automatically interpret the structural conditions by comparing the extracted features with the typical failures in a databank. Then, to achieve optimal rehabilitation efficiency, a genetic algorithm was used to determine appropriate rehabilitation methods and substitution materials for the pipe sections with a risk of mal-function and even collapse. Finally, the result from the automation model can be visualized in a geographic information system in which essential information of the sewer system and sewerage rehabilitation plans are graphically displayed. For demonstration, the automation model of optimal sewerage rehabilitation planning was applied to a sewer system in east Taichung, Chinese Taiwan.</jats:p>",

The simplifications inherent to the modeling approach are outlined to question the relevance of the models to predict athletes’ responses to training. These simplifications include the selection of the variables assigned to the system’s input and output, the specification of model structure, the collection of data to estimate the model parameters, and the use of identified models and parameters to predict responses. Despite the gain in insight to understand the effects of an intensification or reduction of training, the existing models would not be accurate enough to make predictions for a particular athlete in order to monitor his or her training.</jats:p>",

In contrast, for women born during the last third of the 1900s experienced menarche at age thirteen, first engaged in sexual intercourse at age seventeen, and had an average of 2.1 children. These changes during the 20th century reflect the technologic changes in family-planning methods available to American women and men increasing couples' ability to successfully control the number and timing of children, increased women's control over fertility, and gave rise to alternative medical provider networks for women's reproductive-health care. This chapter summarizes key changes in family planning over the last century and provides an overview of changes in contraceptive technology and in the provision of reproductive health and contraceptive services.</jats:p>",

Urban tourism is a growing tourism market and especially are attractive the cities in Europe. The cities as an important tourist destinations came of age during 1980s. The local governments came to recognize that tourism could have a role in urban economic development. The invisibility of tourism in cities partly arises from the fact that many facilities are used both by residents and visitors. Improving these facilities therefore provides benefits for local residents as well as assisting the promotion of tourism. City tourism development plan should be prepared as an integral part of global economic and social development plan of the city, with the main aim to integrate the tourism in existing urban economic development, and at the same time to prevent conflict situations. Tourism development in the city needs a network and cooperative relationships between local government, tourist organization, tourist agencies and different organizations/institutions in the city; public-private partnership is a must. In the paper are analyzed the main attributes, principles and goals of the tourism in the cities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> That the historical geography of the modern city is intertwined with the practice of biopolitics has in recent years gained wide currency. In this paper I seek to deepen and complicate this perspective by focusing on Weimar Berlin (1919–33) and on the active role of the experimental life sciences in manufacturing a new habitus for a rapidly modernising metropolis. To do so, I investigate the ways in which contemporary psychiatric theories and experimental practices seized on and transformed different aspects of the metropolitan experience, and turn, in particular, to accounts of the psychotechnical testing enterprise ( Psychotechnik). In addition to the development of a series of experimental embodiments which were scientifically fashioned and tested, I also shift attention to the widespread dissemination of new realms of everyday conduct that were equally tasked with accommodating the impact of the modern urban experience. Ultimately, I hope to show to what extent the various incarnations of Weimar psychiatry were themselves enrolled in a larger project of policing and recuperating a national Gemeinschaft. As I argue, these experimental arrangements not only represented another example of the pervasive injunction of the period to ‘perform or else,’ but also spoke to the wide governmental reach of a pouvoir psychiatrique (Michel Foucault, 2003 Le Pouvoir Psychiatrique Seuil, Paris) through which experimental procedures for analysing, shaping, and regulating a new habitus were introduced, tested, and widely circulated. </jats:p>",

The dominant pattern identified is one of dispersed, unstable, and informal supplier relations, which can be explained by the importance of small specialized chains, the predominance of family and management ownership, and a low concentration level in French clothing retailing. Since the late 1990s, however, the largest retailers operating in the standard-product segment, some of them engaged in ‘financialization’ strategies, have launched supply-chain rationalization policies aimed at reducing the number of suppliers, stabilizing relations with preferred suppliers, and externalizing manufacturing-related services. A new sourcing model of Anglo-Saxon origin can thus be seen to be diffusing under the combined influence of concentration and financialization in the French clothing retail scene. </jats:p>",

We are also required to offer information to enable women to make choices regarding screening for sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, hepatitis B and C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). In my professional experience, and taking into account the predominance of articles which focus on this latter area of practice in the literature, I would question whether the maternity services place more emphasis on the midwife's role in antenatal screening for sexually transmitted diseases rather than giving contraceptive advice. From the dearth of literature regarding contraceptive advice found in the midwifery journals, it might be supposed that less value is attached to offering contraceptive advice. Perhaps we should be asking how effective we, as midwives, are in fulfilling this aspect of our role? </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Generally, the utilization of traditional scheduling methods represents a complex and cumbersome task for most project managers. Using the existing tools often requires long preparation, and the quality of the graphical output of the planning job is suboptimal. The lack of accuracy in the representation of the execution process diminishes the reliability of the schedule. This article proposes a new planning approach that that can simulate the real conditions of projects. The concepts of graphical scheduling models are analyzed to position the new chronographic approach among other graphical scheduling techniques. The theoretical concept, the mathematical model, and the graphical approach for this new planning method are summarized. Among other features, the proposed chronographic method allows the internal division of activities and relationships as a function of quantities, and new realistic types of floats are proposed. The output may be represented on numerous levels of hierarchical detail or as a combination of these levels. The result is modeling that produces improved visual clarity, increased flexibility, and more adaptability to changes for construction projects.Key words: planning, scheduling, modeling, time-scaled, chronographic method, Gantt, critical path method, precedence.</jats:p>",

Approached from the perspective of the Foucauldian-inspired governmentality literature, this neoliberal reworking of responsibility and risk across state and occupational pensions is characterised by the summoning up of the responsible individual worker as an entrepreneurial investor subject. Collective insurance, as a technology for constructing, managing, and pooling ‘risk’ as potential danger, is sidelined in favour of the promotion of individual investment to calculate, embrace, and bear ‘risk’ as opportunity or reward. As pension guides produced by state agencies for popular consumption illustrate, only financial market investment appears as capable of providing the individual with a secure and ‘free’ retirement. Contradictions in neoliberal government ensure, however, that the investor as a subject position that is called up in this discourse is not simply an identity that is performed by individuals. </jats:p>",

This paper investigates whether improving the project plan can lead to improved success for high‐risk projects. A quality of planning index was designed to explore how the presence of high risk affects the quality of planning and project success. The index includes managerial aspects such as costs, human resources, procurement and quality, as well as organizational support aspects based on organization maturity models. In a field study based on data collected from 202 project managers regarding their most recent projects, it was found that the levels of risk at the beginning of projects has no effect on their final success. Drilling down to find an explanation for this surprising phenomenon, we found that in the presence of high risk, project managers significantly improve their project plans. Hence, in high‐risk projects, better project plans improve all four dimensions of project success: schedule overrun, cost overrun, technical performance and customer satisfaction. However, in low‐risk projects, better project plans did not contribute to reducing schedule or cost overruns. In other words, while endless risk management tools are developed, we found that improving the project plan is a more effective managerial tool in dealing with high‐risk projects. Finally, the paper presents the most common planning tools currently being used in high‐risk projects.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

Six geographical points of distinction are identified for promotion based on linear-nearest neighbor analysis and the connectivity index. A functional diagram evaluates each point based on infrastructure, natural and cultural attractions. Finally, these indicators suggest marketing considerations, which may lend support to Management or stakeholders’ discussions to maximize the geographic points.</jats:p>",

Of these, the terms coarse filter and fine filter have been used inconsistently, we propose, therefore, consensual grounds for a definition. The term \"gap analysis\" has been used to refer to the prescriptive methodology of Gap Analysis and the latter is not consensual among conservation biologists. Nevertheless Gap Analysis has contributed greatly, along with the systematic conservation planning methodology, to the development of conservation planning. Overall, conservation planning has proved sound enough to merit interest and involvement from forest managers.

We develop tractable bounds on the optimal base-stock levels and use them to devise a general class of heuristic solutions. Through this analysis, we identify a necessary and sufficient condition for the myopic policy to be optimal. Finally, to assess the effectiveness of the heuristic policies, we develop upper bounds on their value loss relative to optimal cost. These solution bounds and cost error bounds also work for general dynamic inventory models with nonstationary and autocorrelated demands.

In terms of saving rig time and successful downhole milling operations, one critical success factor of milling operations is structured pre-and post-job guidelines. The guidelines may include a structured pre-job information questionnaire, which provides a more accurate picture of the problem and allows for a more detailed and auditable fit-for-purpose solution to the problem in terms of equipment selection, job procedures, and well programming. Without a set of stringent guidelines to assist in detailing the correct tools required for each application, the success of each intervention may not be realized. Through case histories this paper will show that utilizing, appropriate technology, tool designs, and structured guidelines lead to successful through-tubing intervention milling operations in cases when removing multiple composite bridge plugs. Discussion will involve the pertinent information required prior to equipment selection and job engineering and how that information relates to the equipment's performance and overall success or failure of the objectives for the intervention.</jats:p>",

To mimic the actual flexible fin of a real fish, we created a ribbon fin type actuation device with a series of connecting linkages and attached it to the robotic fish.

The driving linkages are used to form a mechanical fin consisting of several fin segments, which are able to produce undulations, similar to those produced by actual fins. By virtue of the modular and reconfigurable fin mechanisms, two robotic fish with different fin layouts have been designed and constructed: The first prototype is a robotic stingray, swimming by undulations of a pair of lateral fins-the second is a robotic knifefish, swimming by undulations of a long anal fin. The locomotion scheme and mechatronics implementation of the robotic stingray are presented and discussed with a parametric study of the slider’s workspace and joint trajectory. Some experimental observations of the robotic knifefish are alsoshownanddiscussed. Theresults demonstrate that the designed fin mechanisms are able to undulate sections of pectoral and anal fins, with different amplitudes and phases, along the length of the fin in the direction of motion. This may lead to further developments that better mimic the fin locomotion capability of real fish. </jats:p>",

It traces how the early Radical Liberal critique of colonial rule gave way to the influence of Fabianism, which provided the guidelines to the Labour government's post‐war development measures. These sought to incorporate Africans into institutions which would simultaneously provide more productive labour and consolidate colonial rule. The development of the African colonies was believed to reside in restructuring the interface between the state and society. A challenge to the Party's Fabian‐inspired colonial policy emerged in the 1950s. In the midst of the ideological struggle between the party's left and right wings, arguments questioning the African colonies’ economic subordination to metropolitan interests briefly entered into policy debates.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

The literature regarding this process is reviewed. The ways in which risk avoidance and autonomy promotion philosophies influence decisions are examined and a new approach is proposed. Summary. One approach is based on risk avoidance, where decisional control rests with professionals, but the client is left out of the process. Another is that of autonomy promotion, in which decisional control rests with the client. When risks are high, this can result in ethical dilemmas. The importance of the environment, its relationship to occupational performance, and differing interpretations of client-centred processes are important considerations. Practice Implications. In response to the inadequacy of models grounded in risk avoidance or autonomy promotion, occupational therapists are challenged to move toward a balanced approach to decision making with older people, grounded in partnership, shared power, and negotiation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In reconfigurations of the ‘nature’ of the English child and childhood in the early 20th century a key role was played by the Malting House Garden School in Cambridge, England, founded by the unorthodox trader and inventor Geoffrey Pyke and codirected by pioneer educator and psychoanalyst Susan Isaacs. Known scurrilously in the town of Cambridge as ‘a pregenital brothel’, the Malting House School was supported by ecologist A G Tansley and psychologist Jean Piaget amongst others for its ‘copious and careful record of phenomena’. Though short lived, the Malting House School experiment became widely known through popular and influential books, written by Isaacs on early childhood development and education, based largely on data collected at the school. Less is known concerning Pyke's applications of psychoanalytic knowledge, his powerful scientific networks, and his grand vision for a new form of education. With recently recovered records and other archival documents, I seek to contribute to a historical geography of localized psychoanalytic knowledge by exploring the tangle of disciplinary relations in the mutual and imaginative constitution of two pillars of the Malting House School: natural science and psychoanalysis. In particular, I examine what Isaacs referred to as ‘the ecological point of view’ as well as the place of hatred in relation to the nursery school's attempted manufacture of infant scientists eager to ‘find out’. For Pyke, the main threat to the “vigorous survival of an intelligent bourgeoisie” was the Oedipus situation, as described by Sigmund Freud. Through new educational techniques that recognized powerful emotion between generations, Pyke sought to help mould a race that would be able to survive the great changes which he expected science to create in our environment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Prompted by the recent discovery that ethnic minority businesses (EMBs) are not utilising information and communication technology (ICT) to the same degree as are other small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs), policymakers have become interested in the promotion of ICT amongst EMBs. The authors assess a pilot initiative sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry that aimed to stimulate ICT adoption amongst EMBs in the North West region of the United Kingdom. Our first objective was to evaluate the approach used to implement the initiative in the light of extant adoption models. Second, a comparative approach was deployed that included Asian-owned firms in Rusholme and Chinese businesses in Manchester's ‘Chinatown’; this permitted an assessment of the distinctiveness of delivery issues in respect of EMBs. The value of an action-research approach to policy evaluation is reflected upon. An action-research approach was adopted as a means of evaluating the initiative. We were involved at all stages; thus a longitudinal dimension is a further distinctive feature of the study. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered. The findings point to the importance of a contextually appropriate engagement strategy that embraces formal and informal business-support agencies. Accordingly, existing models of ICT adoption need to be refined and developed if they are to be applied to EMBs; the business-support needs of EMBs are not necessarily different from those of other SMEs, but there are potentially distinctive delivery issues; and a systematic application of an action-research approach can aid the process of policy evaluation. The findings have implications for policy delivery and therefore EMBs, offering actions that may be taken to improve public support across two diverse ethnic minority groups. </jats:p>",

I reconstruct Laycock's ideas about memory, notably what he understood by ‘ancestral memory’ rooted in ancestral times and spaces, and I relate these ideas to his deeper conceptualisations of the time – space fabric of creation. I also examine Laycock's approach to the letters and drawings of one unnamed artist – patient, showing that it is possible from other sources to give this patient a name (William James Blacklock) and even a ‘voice’ of sorts; and I suggest that Laycock was guilty of failing to engage properly with this evidence, yet also of overinterpreting it at the same time. Acknowledging the dangers of ‘presentism’ in this paper, I critique how Laycock's ideas captured ‘otherness’ in a grid of ‘sameness’ largely indifferent to the very different, perhaps unknowable, imaginings present in madness (and in all who depart from established norms). My contribution should be taken as a circumspect effort to write a ‘critical and effective history’ inspired by Foucault's claims in the introduction to The Order of Things (1970, Tavistock Publications, London) about the relationship between ‘the Same and the Other’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> While apparel manufacturing is often considered the quintessential global industry, the regional dimension of trade and production in the textile and clothing sector is less widely noted. In this paper I discuss two macroregional production blocs: North America (defined as the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean Basin countries) and Greater Europe [which includes the European Union (EU), Central and Eastern Europe, Turkey, and North Africa]. Analyzing what opportunities regionalization might provide is particularly relevant given China's increasing dominance of both the EU and US import markets in the post-Multifibre Arrangement period. Drawing on the global commodity chains literature, I discuss three dimensions around which cross-regional comparative research on the European and North American apparel sectors can be organized: (1) production model; (2) institutional context; and (3) development outcomes. Several similarities between these production blocs are noted, particularly with regard to the intraregional division of labor expressed by networks connecting firms in higher-wage and lower-wage countries and the coexistence of assembly subcontracting and full-package manufacturing in both regions, but differences include the existence in Europe of a stronger textile base and a more expansive regionalization strategy (as suggested by the Euro–Mediterranean Partnership), which may strengthen the competitiveness of the Greater European bloc vis-à-vis its North American counterpart. </jats:p>",

Towards this end, we first analyze the global dynamics that have facilitated Turkey's incorporation into global value chains and the development of full-package production. Second, we outline the key strategies which Turkish full-package suppliers have employed to meet international standards, typically associated with this export role. Third, we show that all of these developments have unfolded against a national context, unique features of which have further helped Turkey to sustain its competitiveness in this export role. Our analysis shows that, in the Turkish national context, more attention should be given to the role of business associations and the state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agoraphobia—literally fear of the agora, the Greek place of assembly or marketplace— emerged as a named disorder in 1871 and, from the start, stymied physicians who attempted to explain its cause. They found it difficult to explain why overwhelming anxiety overtook otherwise ‘sane’ individuals in particular settings. In this paper I argue that the affective nature of agoraphobic anxiety could neither be explained by nor captured within the accounts of space perception and representation put forward in the late-19th-century clinical literature. Those accounts relied on a ‘specular’ model in which the individual was able to represent to himself or herself that which he or she perceived; in contrast, the patients' experiences of overwhelming anxiety were characterized by a temporary loss of the symbolization of spatial relations and could not, therefore, be understood within a specular economy. I read late-19th-century attempts to account for agoraphobia, then, not as exemplars in a typology of ‘psy’ practices, but, rather, as a failure of the psy complex to map the spatial coordinates of agoraphobic anxiety adequately. </jats:p>",

Most industrialised countries provide a degree of business support to small and medium-sized firms, such as information and advice. It is normal for programmes to be justified using arguments about market failure and programme designers tend to weight different aspects of market failure leading to different policy choices. The paper was based upon a literature review of business support in OECD countries conducted in 2004. A visual analogue scale was developed based on the choices made by policy makers across OECD countries which developed a taxonomy of business support choices to enable both a more systematic comparison of, and to differentiate, programmes. There are a considerable number of choices that can be made regarding how a programme is designed and delivered for a specific set of market failures. The key result of the research is to suggest a hierarchy of policy choices. At the top are four choices: Who delivers? What ‘type’ of support? How is it rationed? And how is it funded? At a point in time when there are significant institutional changes in English business support the paper has the opportunity to contribute by making more explicit the policy choices in the area of business advice to small firms. </jats:p>",

Unlike China, Mexico, Eastern Europe, and other South Asian countries, India's recent surge in clothing exports has occurred despite the lack of major foreign direct investment in textile and apparel production, the lack of entry into preferential regional trade agreements with buyer countries, or the lack of any significant direct role of global buyers. Arguing that changes in domestic policy and in the structure of domestic demand throughout the 1980s and 1990s played an important role in triggering new growth in India's textiles and apparel exports, and in reshaping the capabilities of local firms, I examine three features of India's recent integration into global clothing markets: the striking emergence of design as a source of comparative advantage in Indian apparel, the growing importance of outward-bound investment by Indian clothing firms in recent years, and the powerful new role that retail is playing in organizing the Indian domestic market, driven in part by surging consumer demand from entirely new mid-market youth segments associated with the country's information technology–business process outsourcing boom. </jats:p>",

During this period psychology evolved from a philosophical field content with generalised statements about the human soul to a scientific field concerned with measuring and individuating the psyche. This paper focuses on how while psychology quickly laid claim to establishing the contours of normative mental health it was simultaneously deployed in the service of identifying and bolstering normative physical health. As interiority was systematically brought within the realm of science, the traditional metonymic connection between physicality and morality materialised into a new relationship between the self and its numerical existence. This relationship is explored here through an examination of physical-health testing in New York schools during the Progressive Era. My aim is to draw out the manifold ways in which psychological technologies were absorbed into spatial practice, supporting the claim of this theme issue that the proliferation of psychology can be traced through multiple governing practices and into specific geographies. </jats:p>",

We emphasise the diversity of firm-level strategies that have been implemented to cope with increasing competitive pressures, liberalisation, and outsourcing in the industry. We identify a dominant trajectory of factory closure, job loss, and deindustrialisation as firms are unable to compete on the basis of the kinds of contracting requirements of buyers and retailers in a high-cost location such as London. We also identify a range of strategies that firms continuing to operate in London have adopted, including the development of new functions in the supply chain, repositioning in relation to specific market niches, coordinating the relocation of production offshore, upgrading towards more design-intensive, small-batch production, and spreading risk across a range of activities. While some of these strategies connect to wider public policy discourses concerning the creative industries in London, they also suggest the need for a broader framing of firm-level trajectories set within the context of the power of major buyers and retailers. Consequently, in the paper we raise concerns over the extent to which creative industries can contribute to enhancing social inclusion and economic development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The ability to describe business processes as executable models has always been one of the fundamental premises of workflow management. Yet, the tacit nature of human knowledge is often an obstacle to eliciting accurate process models. On the other hand, the result of process modeling is a static plan of action, which is difficult to adapt to changing procedures or to different business goals. In this article, we attempt to address these problems by approaching workflow management with a combination of learning and planning techniques. Assuming that processes cannot be fully described at build-time, we make use of learning techniques, namely Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), in order to discover workflow activities and to describe them as planning operators. These operators will be subsequently fed to a partial-order planner in order to find the process model as a planning solution. The continuous interplay between learning, planning and execution aims at arriving at a feasible plan by successive refinement of the operators. The approach is illustrated in two simple scenarios. Following a discussion of related work, the paper concludes by presenting the main challenges that remain to be solved. </jats:p>",

The substantive findings of various studies and their methodological approaches are critiqued. Many studies suffer from inadequate conceptualisation of ‘regulation’ and methodological shortcomings, and fail to investigate the causal mechanisms through which regulation contributes to business-performance outcomes. In some cases, they positively encourage superficial and misleading results. More sophisticated approaches, using qualitative data, demonstrate that regulations generate a variety of consequences and should not be conceptualised solely in terms of costs and constraints. Rather, regulation can impact upon small businesses directly and indirectly, and both constrain and enable and motivate business owners to act. The impact of regulation is contingent upon business owners' adaptations to particular interventions within the broader social contexts within which they operate. The implications for policymakers are discussed. </jats:p>",

This is done by combining document and policy analyses with data from thirty-seven semistructured personal interviews with Aboriginal and nonAboriginal housing actors. Following changes to federally driven social-housing policy in 1993, housing stakeholders in Winnipeg self-organised to engage all sectors of society in processes of urban citizenship around low-cost-housing goals. Aboriginal citizenship pursuits have not been interwoven with the pursuit of these social goals. There is a role for the federal government in ensuring the coupling of Aboriginal with urban social citizenship. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold><jats:sc>Summary</jats:sc></jats:bold> A new methodology is proposed for estimating the proportion of true null hypotheses in a large collection of tests. Each test concerns a single parameter δ whose value is specified by the null hypothesis. We combine a parametric model for the conditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐value given δ with a nonparametric spline model for the density <jats:italic>g</jats:italic>(δ) of δ under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion of true null hypotheses and the coefficients in the spline model are estimated by penalized least squares subject to constraints that guarantee that the spline is a density. The estimator is computed efficiently using quadratic programming. Our methodology produces an estimate <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/BIOM_704_mu1.gif\" xlink:title=\"inline image\" /> of the density of δ when the null is false and can address such questions as “when the null is false, is the parameter usually close to the null or far away?” This leads us to define a falsely interesting discovery rate (FIDR), a generalization of the false discovery rate. We contrast the FIDR approach to <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b6\">Efron's</jats:ext-link> (2004, <jats:italic>Journal of the American Statistical Association</jats:italic><jats:bold>99,</jats:bold> 96–104) empirical null hypothesis technique. We discuss the use of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/BIOM_704_mu2.gif\" xlink:title=\"inline image\" /> in sample size calculations based on the expected discovery rate (EDR). Our recommended estimator of the proportion of true nulls has less bias compared to estimators based upon the marginal density of the <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>‐values at 1. In a simulation study, we compare our estimators to the convex, decreasing estimator of <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#b12\">Langaas, Lindqvist, and Ferkingstad</jats:ext-link> (2005, <jats:italic>Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B</jats:italic><jats:bold>67,</jats:bold> 555–572). The most biased of our estimators is very similar in performance to the convex, decreasing estimator. As an illustration, we analyze differences in gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains of barley.</jats:p>",

These are referred to as individual conditional distributions, in contrast to approaches that rely on unconditional distributions that use random assignment in the construction of WTP distributions within a sampled population. The interest in alternative specifications is in large measure attributed to the search for empirical ways of deriving the WTP distribution that satisfies a behaviourally acceptable sign and range over the entire domain. In this paper we examine both conditional and unconditional approaches to establishing WTP distributions within the context of a mixed logit model. We find that calculating WTP measures from ratios of individual-level parameters in contrast to drawing them from unconditional population distributions empirically reduces the incidence of extreme values. Our results suggest that although problematic estimates cannot be ruled out, the use of the extra information on each individual's choices is a valuable input into the derivation of WTP distributions. </jats:p>",

This discriminant function model allowed us to predict which group each of the test sites would be in if it were in reference condition, and then measure the relationship between the amount of human activity and the biota in each of these groups.</jats:p><jats:p>6. These relationships were turned into projections of what will happen to a stream ecosystem's biota if the stressor environment is either improved or degraded. These projection models form the basis of evidence‐based land use planning that takes into account the health of freshwater ecosystems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Product recovery operations in reverse supply chains face rapidly changing demand due to the increasing number of product offerings with reduced lifecycles. Therefore, capacity planning becomes a strategic issue of major importance for the profitability of closed‐loop supply chains. This work studies a closed‐loop supply chain with remanufacturing and presents dynamic capacity planning policies developed through the methodology of System Dynamics. The key issue of the paper is how the lifecycles and return patterns of various products affect the optimal policies regarding expansion and contraction of collection and remanufacturing capacities. The model can be used to identify effective policies, to conduct various “what‐if” analyses, and to answer questions about the long‐term profitability of reverse supply chains with remanufacturing. The results of numerical examples with quite different lifecycle and return patterns show how the optimal collection expansion/contraction and remanufacturing contraction policies depend on the lifecycle type and the average usage time of the product, while the remanufacturing capacity expansion policy is not significantly affected by these factors. The results also show that the collection and remanufacturing capacity policies are insensitive to the total product demand. The insensitivity of the optimal policies to total demand is a particularly appealing feature of the proposed model, given the difficulty in obtaining accurate demand forecasts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The expectation that Chinese apparel and textile exports will swamp the US and EU retail markets now that international quotas on those products have been eliminated has fueled much of the discussion of the future of these industries. Although imports from China have surged since the elimination of quotas on 1 January 2005, this conventional wisdom masks important choices that remain for public and private policies over time. In particular, two factors will continue to have major effects on the location of apparel and textile production going forward. First, public-policy choices will continue to influence sourcing location; in particular, as they relate to tariffs and regional trade polices as well as to policies affecting the linkages between countries. Second, the lean-retailing model that now prevails requires apparel suppliers to replenish basic and fashion basic products on a weekly basis. As that retailing model became dominant in the 1990s, so too did the advantage of sourcing these apparel items closer to the US market so that products could be manufactured and delivered more rapidly from a smaller finished-goods inventory. Even though costs remain a driving factor, we show that proximity advantages for certain classes of products will continue in a postquota world as retailers raise the bar ever higher on the responsiveness and flexibility required of their suppliers. </jats:p>",

This paper presents a method aimed at supporting software product development organisations in the identification of process improvement proposals to increase requirements selection quality. The method is based on an in-depth analysis of requirements selection decision outcomes after the release has been launched to the users. The method is validated in two separate case studies involving real requirements and industrial requirements engineering experts. The conclusions from the two case studies are that the method seems valuable in situations with complex release planning decisions, such as in market-driven projects. It also appears essential that participants with different viewpoints attend the root cause discussion. Requirements interdependencies seem to play a big role in release planning decision-making. In addition, successful projects can also be a source of learning. </jats:p>",

From findings drawn from a survey of over a thousand British small enterprises, marked variations in firm behaviour with respect to health and safety were found, underlining the heterogeneity of small firms in this respect, and the way such behaviour reflects their varied contexts. Factors identified as being particularly associated with a propensity to make compliance-related improvements were: regulatory enforcement activity, use of external assistance with respect to health and safety issues, enterprise size and growth performance, management training and experience, and membership of trade or business associations. Although, as a group, ethnic-minority businesses were found to be neither more or less likely to make improvements of this type compared with their white-owned counterparts, detailed analysis revealed that such variations did exist between individual ethnic groupings; variations that are themselves seen to reflect a number of factors, particularly the employment size and sectoral context. Primarily the authors conclude that inspections on the part of regulatory officials are the most important influence, although there is some scope for more innovative approaches to encouraging compliance-related improvements. </jats:p>",

In the past, SWC plans did not incorporate farmers' knowledge, and the economics of SWC was not given much attention at the planning stage. This research evaluated the applicability of two tools for participatory soil erosion mapping using farmers' indicators of soil erosion and financial analysis of SWC measures at the planning stage. The two tools were evaluated in Kwalei catchment in the West Usambara highlands, Tanzania. The participatory soil erosion‐mapping tool uses farmers' indicators of soil erosion to identify, classify and map soil erosion at the catchment level. The financial analysis tool involves farmers in a stepwise analysis of the costs and benefits of SWC measures before the implementation. The erosion‐mapping tool increased farmers' awareness on the severity of soil erosion problems, and they realised the need for SWC plans at both field and catchment scales. With the financial analysis tool farmers participated in the cost and benefits analysis and were able to select SWC options that were feasible under their socio‐economic situation. The two tools were able to demonstrate that farmers' participation in SWC planning increases the acceptance of SWC measures because they solve problems that are perceived by themselves. The financial analysis tool demonstrated how farmers could make selection of SWC measures that are feasible under their biophysical and economic condition if they are informed about the costs and benefits.

They seek to provide policymakers with a more realistic assessment of the extent to which their interventions might be able to affect the rate of new-business formation. An empirical investigation of the separate impacts of sector, specialisation, and space, suggests that the share of business-services businesses in the business stock seems to play the largest role in accounting for the spatial distribution of the business birth rate across the United Kingdom; and that this share is significantly influenced by the spatial pattern of population density. Policies which involve setting ‘targets' for business birth rates need to take the local ‘context’ into account and, perhaps more importantly, aspirations may have to change: it seems unlikely that stimulation of business birth rates should realistically be expected to close the ‘enterprise gap’ between different parts of the country. </jats:p>",

Modern, individualised therapeutic strategies require an accurate determination of the extent of the disease. This study investigated the potential impact of 2‐[18F]‐fluoro‐2‐deoxy‐<jats:sc>d</jats:sc>‐glucose positron emission tomography/computerised tomogrpahy (FDG‐PET/CT) in the planning of involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). <jats:italic>Patients and methods:</jats:italic> Thirty patients received staging FDG‐PET/CT before therapy, and IFRT after a short course of ABVD (adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) chemotherapy. IFRT planning was performed using only the CT data from the FDG‐PET/CT scan. Later, the IFRT planning was performed anew using the FDG‐PET/CT data as basis for contouring. <jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> In 20 out of 30 patients, the radiotherapy (RT) course was unaffected by the addition of FDG‐PET/CT. FDG‐PET/CT would have increased the irradiated volume in seven patients where the volume receiving a minimum of 90% of the target dose was increased by 8–87%. FDG‐PET/CT decreased the volume in two patients where the volume was reduced by 18% and 30%. <jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> When used for RT planning, FDG‐PET/CT results in larger IFRT treatment volumes. If FDG‐PET/CT is introduced to RT planning, the method should be accompanied by a change in RT treatment strategy, aiming at more targeted therapy in order to best avoid radiation to normal tissues.</jats:p>",

One of the main challenges consists of finding a design that will minimize the cost of installation and operation of harvest machinery, road construction, and timber transport, while complying with the technical restrictions that apply to the operation of harvesting equipment and road construction. We can model the network design problem as a mixed-integer linear programming problem. This model is fed with cartographic information, provided by a geographic information system (GIS), along with technical and economic parameters determined by the planner. We developed a specialized heuristic for the problem to obtain solutions that enable harvesting economically profitable volumes at a low cost.

Meu ponto de partida está no conceito de gênero discursivo da perspectiva sistêmico-funcional de linguagem (HALLIDAY; HASAN, 1989; MARTIN, 1992; EGGINS, 1994; THOMPSON, 1996; EGGINS; MARTIN, 1997), no conceito do conhecimento sobre gêneros (BERKENKOTTER; HUCKIN, 1995), associado ao conhecimento partilhado pelos usuários ao utilizarem gêneros escritos (JOHNS, 1997), além de aspectos relacionados ao planejamento de cursos instrumentais (ROBINSON, 1991; HUTCHINSON; WATERS, 1987). Relato, em um primeiro momento, como tais conceitos foram operacionalizados para sua implementação pedagógica. Em seguida, apresento algumas atividades desenvolvidas, bem como as percepções dos alunos sobre tais atividades.</jats:p>"

The research aim of REMEUCHI is to quantify the impact of genetic and environmental factors on scholastic achievement in a multicausal approach. The Ministry of Education of Chile, in collaboration with the Registry Office, provided the list of possible twin pairs graduated from high school in 2004 in Chile's metropolitan region. From a population of 70,065 school-age children who had graduated from high school, 434 possible twin pairs were analyzed. Of these, 327 were twins reared together (75.3% of the 434 possible twins pairs) and born between 1986 and 1987 in Chile (mean age 18 years), and approximately 8% were not twins despite matches on full name and birth data. The rest of the possible twin pairs were probably twins reared apart, since one member of the pair had moved to study in another region of Chile. Zygosity was determined through questionnaires, maternal reports of twin similarities, and by the hospital records of the twins at the time of birth. Three hundred and twenty-seven pairs were identified, where monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins represented 46.8% and 53.2% of pairs, respectively, with a DZ/MZ ratio of 1.14. Considering same-sex MZ pairs, the percentage of female pairs was greater (55.6%) than male pairs (44.4%). When DZ pairs were analyzed, 47.7% were of opposite sex, 20.1% were male pairs and 32.2% female pairs. In Chile, these findings represent a baseline study to contribute to the establishment of a national twin registry in the future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>An adequate venous outflow is essential for securing viability of both graft and remnant in adult living donor liver transplantation (ALDLT). Seventy‐five potential live liver donors were evaluated for LDLT by means of an “all‐in‐one” CT, which defined the biliary tree, portal vein, hepatic artery, and hepatic vein anatomy. The acquired data sets were further analysed by means of the software HepaVision (MeVis, Germany). Only a minority (29%) of potential donors were found to have a vascular and biliary anatomy consistent with the classically described “normal” patterns. The vast majority (71%) had “anatomical variations”. Thirty‐nine (52%) donors underwent ALDLT hepatectomy. The right hepatic vein was dominant in 64 cases, representing 48 ± 6% of the total liver volume (TLV). The middle hepatic vein was dominant in 11 cases, making up 40 ± 8% of the TLV. The left hepatic vein was never dominant. The volume contribution of the middle hepatic vein (MHV) was 114–782 ml for the right and 87–419 ml for the left hemiliver. Computer‐assisted planning allows for the 3D reconstruction of the vascular and biliary anatomy, automatic calculation of the total and territorial liver volumes, and risk analysis of hepatic vein dominance relationships. This comprehensive data acquisition supports preoperative evaluation and provides a high degree of safety for donors and improved outcomes for recipients.</jats:p>",
