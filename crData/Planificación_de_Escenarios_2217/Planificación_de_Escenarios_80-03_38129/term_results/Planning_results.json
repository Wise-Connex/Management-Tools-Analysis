      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article distinguishes design research that is concerned with further developments of existing formal systems from fundamental research in technical or geometrical fields that is capable of opening up new form-generating programmes. A historical discussion includes analysis of an early series of ‘spatial compositions’ by the pioneer Soviet Constructivist artist and designer Aleksandr Rodchenko. The general character of serial form is discussed, and its relationship to the concept and the transmission of ‘style’. Reference is also made to work by the nineteenth-century Russian mathematician P L Chebyshev, the American designer George Nelson, and the pioneer of Soviet Rationalist architectural theory in the 1920s, Vladimir Krinskii. Illustrations include the Rodchenko works discussed, and examples drawn from the author's own research, his public commissions, and his devices for developing spatial and combinatorial thinking amongst architecture students. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a framework for architectural research of an applied nature, that is, research that will generate ‘operational knowledge’ in relation to architecture's principal identifying characteristic, and that element which rests in the hands of the designer, namely the organisation of space. A theoretical framework is developed which insists upon a clear distinction between the characteristics of the space and the ‘meanings’ constructed upon the spatial object by ‘consumers’. The nature of ‘conflict’ is defined, as that noncorrespondence within the system comprising a society and its architectural activity which propels the evolution of new spatial types forward over real time. Architectural objects are conceived as complex products of three categories of relationships; functional, compositional, and constructive. On the basis of those categories are defined architectural types, activity types, and ‘applied’ types, each of which may exist in conflict-bearing or canonical forms. The framework for an architectural science is then constructed which distinguishes its object, its subject matter, and its method. Measurements are identified as the fundamental elements of operational knowledge, and they are distinguished as being of two kinds—‘parameters’ of the object itself, and ‘properties’ describing its functioning in some human context. </jats:p><jats:p> A methodology of applied architectural research is presented which comprises alternating deductive and inductive cycles. Each has three component operations, which are discussed in some detail. The discussion of parameters and properties leads to the distinguishing of three classes of object, the empirical (actual), the hypothetical (possible), and the type (the required), and a corresponding array of functional, compositional, and constructive models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article addresses the problem of mathematical modelling of the operation of urban passenger transport, a problem that has great practical importance for both the design of urban transport networks and the organisation of transport services for the urban population. It demonstrates that a model of urban passenger trips will only be adequate for this task if it reflects the distribution of those trips over the twenty-four-hour time period, as well as their distribution between different parts of the city: in other words, that it will only be adequate if it is dynamic. It is thus impossible to apply here classical (plane) matrices accommodating only two dimensions of the system—in this case zones of departure (origins) and arrival (destinations). For modelling urban passenger movements we have therefore to move to spatial (three-dimensional) matrices, and the article describes such a model which has been built. A method is proposed for processing the spatial matrices by carrying out partitions of them. A new operation of the superposition (short multiplication) of plane and spatial matrices is introduced, which makes it possible to solve the problem of mathematical modelling of complex systems. A method is described whereby the dynamic model of urban passenger journeys has been used to optimise design solutions of urban transport networks and to improve the operation of urban passenger transport. Other possibilities for the use of spatial matrices in the modelling of complex urban systems are also indicated. </jats:p>",

Simon. 1960. Planning Production, Inventories, and Work Force. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.), especially for its application to a paint factory. A discrete control version of a related quadratic production-inventory model was studied by Kleindorfer, Kriebel, Thompson, and Kleindorfer in (Kleindorfer, P. R., C. H. Kriebel, G. L. Thompson, G. B. Kleindorfer. 1975. Discrete optimal control of production plans. Management Sci. 22 261–273.). </jats:p><jats:p> In the present paper we solve a continuous version of the model in Kleindorfer, Kriebel, Thompson, and Kleindorfer (Kleindorfer, P. R., C. H. Kriebel, G. L. Thompson, G. B. Kleindorfer. 1975. Discrete optimal control of production plans. Management Sci. 22 261–273.) in complete detail. The reason we are able to obtain a complete solution (which can rarely be done in control models) is that the linear decision rule, which is optimal here as in other quadratic models, permits the elimination of the adjoint function from the state variable equation after one differentiation of the latter. Thus the difficult two-point boundary value problem which usually arises in control problems is converted into an ordinary second order differential equation, which is readily solved. </jats:p><jats:p> One advantage of having a complete solution to the problem is that it is possible to determine turnpike horizon points. These correspond to zeros of the adjoint function, and have the property that if they are known exactly, then a production-inventory plan which is optimal up to the next horizon point also forms part of the overall optimal plan. In the case of cyclic demand these turnpike horizon points usually occur every half cycle. Similar horizons are likely to exist in real production-inventory problems. A planning procedure for a real problem which extends only as far as a suspected horizon has a good chance of producing an optimal or near optimal solution for that period of time. </jats:p><jats:p> A second advantage of having the complete solution available is that it is possible to develop a practical production-inventory system which intermingles a prediction procedure (such as the use of a finite Fourier series) with the solution procedure so that a comparison between predicted and actual inventories can be made continuously. Whenever the discrepancy between these two becomes sufficiently large, the model suggests proper corrective actions to be taken. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Improving the productivity of computer personnel requires an integrated view of the factors which promote effective and efficient work. Motivation, training, performance planning, and productivity are so closely interrelated that to attack them individually results in initiatives which often conflict with one another and lead to confusion of ends by professional personnel. Successful integration of these factors results in a management style and organizational form that supports the accomplishments of productive work.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The framework identifies five major areas contributing to performance and behavior: personal effort, knowledge and skills, attitudes and values, environment, health, and sense of direction. These areas define the impact of training, personal development, management style, project control, performance planning, and job/goal direction-setting on performance and behavior.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The framework also identifies five outcomes of work performance and behavior: rewards, costs, appraisal, equity, and satisfaction. The roles played by reward strategies, appraisal techniques tied to performance planning, and personal job costs to the worker are placed in a unified concept.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The framework provides a view of how to make these factors work together to improve productivity.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Data processing personnel career development implies the exercising of a specific plan within a structured environment. Career development should allow an individual to start as a programmer trainee or anywhere in the hierarchy of the group and progress to appropriate levels of responsibility, authority, and pay that are commensurate with the individual's abilities and desires.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Career development is \"GOOD BUSINESS\" for the company and for the individual, as it provides for the development and optimal use of existing potential. It can provide significant contributions to productivity improvement and at the same time reduce retention problems. If a career development program is to work, it must be pragmatic. First, it has to be developed and implemented within the environment of each individual company. Second, it has to have sufficient flexibility to allow for the specific career requirements of each individual. This \"tall order\" has been met with varying degrees of success.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>This case study is intended to provide one example of how career development can and does work for the Missouri Pacific Railroad computer professional.</jats:p>",

A number of examples of this process in action in the fields of transport planning, operation, and safety are described and discussed, emphasising how the achievement of improvements depends upon understanding not only what changes are likely to be beneficial but also how people will respond to attempts to bring about these changes. The examples are concerned with injury to occupants of colliding vehicles, accidents associated with driving after drinking alcohol, the competition between activities and movement for space in congested urban areas, and the operation of a main radial route into a city centre. In conclusion, current attempts to assess the wide range of effects that transport changes can have upon the quality of life are related to the writings of Jeremy Bentham, whose thinking contributed strongly to the foundation of University College London 150 years ago. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Classical partial-equilibrium analysis of integration in a spaceless world is extended by introducing the spatial dimension into the model. It is argued, however, that this model, owing to its unrealistic homogeneity assumptions, generates an extremely rigid response by the endogenous variables to tariff reductions. </jats:p><jats:p> Therefore two approaches are discussed for introducing heterogeneity into the model: A deterministic utility-maximization approach and a probabilistic choice approach. Both approaches lead to a substitution of the transportation model, which is embedded in the homogeneous model, by a trade-distribution model of the gravity type. In the framework of this model, regional shadow prices are derived which play the same role as the shadow prices of the transportation model and can be used for measuring the impact of economic integration on regional access to input and output markets. Finally a family of elastically constrained gravity models is considered, which are derived by linking price-elastic supply and demand with the trade-distribution model. These models can be empirically applied for calculating simultaneously the effects of tariff reductions on regional supply and demand as well as on interregional trade. </jats:p>",

Black teenage patients experienced the highest fertility. Patients age 20 years and over with some education beyond high school experienced approximately one-third the fertility of less-educated patients. The program effectiveness of the IUD and the Pill was substantially better than that of foam and condoms. Excluding teenagers, the program effectiveness of the IUD was better than the Pill. Changes in family planning services for high-risk patients may help them achieve their fertility control objectives. Linking family planning clinic records to official birth records as described in this study can help determine clinic success in meeting patient objectives.
