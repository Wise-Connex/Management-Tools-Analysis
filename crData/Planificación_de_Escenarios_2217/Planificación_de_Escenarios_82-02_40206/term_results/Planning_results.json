As the company passes $27 billion in sales and $1.5 billion in earnings, G.E.'s widely publicized strategic‐planning system has led the company to invest in everything from ultrasonic cardiac scanners to high‐technology robots and information systems. Planning Review asked Steve M. Cohen, a Review contributing editor, to talk about G.E.'s strategy with William E. Rothschild, staff executive for corporate planning development.

As a result, educational issues critical to successful integration may not be thoroughly explored nor their solutions carefully planned. Without specific plans, a handicapped child may not be ready to integrate, nor the receiving teacher willing or able to accommodate the child. Some of these issues are presented in this paper along with consideration of directions for their solution. Specifically, they are (a) selecting likely candidates for integration, (b) planning what to teach in the special education class to prepare the child to integrate, (c) planning how to teach this content, (d) assessing the readiness of a child to integrate, (e) changing the attitudes of the receiving teacher, (f) providing support services, and (g) making a smooth transition To assess a child's readiness to integrate, a “competency-based assessment” is described. Here, the standards of a particular regular class are measured and the handicapped child's competencies are compared to these standards. </jats:p>",

One of the factors in the experiment was requirement uncertainty, a factor heretofore not incorporated in MRP lot‐sizing research. The results of the experiment confirm MOM (and to a lesser extent LUC) as an effective lot‐sizing procedure. In addition, the work shows that the differences between the procedures tend to vanish as the amount of uncertainty in the requirements increases.</jats:p>",

However, it is shown here by means of labor-force migration estimates derived from the Continuous Work History Sample over the period 1958–1975, that US interstate migration is quite volatile over the short run with respect both to its adjustment to macroeconomic fluctuations and to its geographical structure. A hierarchical clustering routine is utilized to analyse yearly estimates of interstate gross in-migration and out-migration so as to identify the temporal stability and characteristics of the geographical patterns of migration. States enter the national migration linkage tree at different levels for different years, depending upon the level of short-run economic activity. It is also shown that when national economic conditions worsen, labor-supply adjustments are more localized and the degree of interstate interdependence is less than in times of economic boom. An Almon distributed-lags time series regression model is used to formally test the relationship between spatial interconnectivity (as represented by interstate migration flows) and national fluctuations. </jats:p>",

Three distinct migration streams with differing sensitivity to distance are identified and separately incorporated in a simultaneous equation model in which employment growth, unemployment, house construction, and house prices are also endogenous. Results are presented for estimation of this eleven-equation model with cross-sectional data for seventy-one areas in inner London, outer London, and the Outer Metropolitan Area. Important linkages are identified between the availability of rentable accommodation, labour migration and thus unemployment, between long-distance migration, and rates of private construction both in the areas of original destination and subsequent dispersal, and between intrametropolitan housing-related moves and the consequent decentralisation of employment. The distribution of new housing and employment opportunities, more than residential preference, is seen as the key factor in locational change within the region. </jats:p>",

Optimization models, however, can be used to generate alternatives that are good and different so that analysts and decision makers can examine a wide range of alternatives to gain insight and understanding. Modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) techniques have been designed to serve this purpose. This paper provides a preliminary assessment of the capabilities of the Hop, Skip, Jump (HSJ) method, a random method, and a branch and bound/screening (BBS) method for generating good and different alternative solutions. These three methods are illustrated using an example water resources planning problem represented by a mixed integer programing model. Each method yields sets of alternatives that are different from each other, but for each method the alternatives are different in different ways. Given that all three methods are efficient, it may be most fruitful to use more than one method and thereby to consider alternatives that are not only different, but different in different ways.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One aspect of the ‘regional problem’ in the British context has been the tendency for certain regions to suffer from unemployment levels persistently above the national average, often reinforced by high degrees of sensitivity to national cyclical changes. The paper examines the relationships between levels of unemployment within the Northern Region and the nation as a whole, focussing particularly upon changes in these relationships over the last decade. The lack of stability identified, with areas reacting differently to different cycles or parts of cycles, raises a number of questions concerning the interpretation of interregional unemployment convergence or divergence trends. </jats:p>",

An explicit assumption underlying this method is that the professional health educator is an agent for behavior change who works, primarily via other health professionals, to enhance the health of the target population.</jats:p><jats:p>To effect change, the health educator must be skilled in (a) problem definition, (b) program development or the treatment of the problem, (c) program implementation and (d) program evaluation. To illustrate this approach we present a model for measuring attitudes and social normative factors which seems useful in defining education need, illustrate its use in a cross‐culture comparison of a sample of adolescent cigarette smokers in Australia and United States of America and suggest some further steps to aid in planning and evaluating health education activities.</jats:p><jats:p>While this paper emphasizes the role of attitude, attitudes are but one of a number of factors to be considered in health education program development. Anderson<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> and Green<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> suggest that attitudes and knowledge contribute to a predisposition to a particular behavior but that the ultimate behavior is also influenced by a set of factors best described as enabling the behavior and a set of factors which reinforce the behavior.</jats:p>",
