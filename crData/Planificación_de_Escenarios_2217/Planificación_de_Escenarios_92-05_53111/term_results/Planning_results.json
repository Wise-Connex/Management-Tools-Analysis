Exurbanization is a product of the continued deconcentration of population and economic development in the contiguous forty-ight states. Some writers offer that exurban development will dominate the continent by the early part of the next century. This article reviews the reasons why millions of households choose the exurban countryside, suggests the sociocultural orientations of exurbanites, and discusses the implications of exurbanization for theories of urban form and urban policy. It is argued that there is a need for a definition of exurbia that allows for convenient statistical analysis. Once a definition is agreed upon, research into the characteristics and implications of exurbanization can proceedfrom a common base. </jats:p>",

With advancements in horizontal drilling technology, many wells have been drilled successfully and economically. In fact, in many areas these drilling projects have essentially become routine. Drilling fluid research has primarily focused on drill cuttings transport in horizontal wells for both water-based and oil-based muds. Although hole-cleaning considerations are important and necessary, other factors are equally important when drilling unconsolidated zones.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Control of drilling fluid properties is essential when encountering unconsolidated formations in horizontal wells. These properties include fluid density and resulting wellbore pressure, type and quality of filter cake to be deposited on the unconsolidated zone, the effects of mud chemistry and mud hydraulics on hole erosion, and the compatibilityy of the fluid with regard to formation damage if the the unconsolidated zone is a potential producer.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper describes guidelines for the mud selection process when drilling unconsolidated formations in extended reach and horizontal wells. Selection of the proper drilling fluid should be based on these guidelines at the planning stages of the well.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>SURVEY OF PROBLEMS</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In nearly all offshore drilling areas, soft unconsolidated sand formations are penetrated at some time during drilling operations. These unconsolidated formations present the drilling operation with a number of difficulties in maintaining a mechanically stable wellbore, transporting drill cuttings with non-erosive flow, and preventing formation damage. These problems all become more severe when highly deviated or horizontal wells are drilled through unconsolidated formations. Drilling fluid composition and properties play an important role in minimizing the problems presented by unconsolidated sands.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>CAUSES OF WELLBORE INSTABILITY</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Unconsolidated sands are composed of sand grains that do not have any inherent cohesion between one another. They differ, on one hand, from clays wherein attractive force between clay particles give the sediment a weak natural cohesion, and, on the other hand, from sandstones and limestones wherein natural mineral cementation between grains gives these rock materials a considerable degree of natural cohesion. The lack of natural cohesion between the grains of unconsolidated sands gives these formations mechanical properties that lead to several types of wellbore instability.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Confining stress on unconsolidated sands plays an Important role in determining their strength in the subsurface environment. In addition to the pore pressure of fluids in the sediment, the mechanical state of the formation is defined by a mechanical stress field. 1 For the purpose of defining the stress field for granular permeable materials, effective stress is used. 2 The effective stress is simply the absolute stress minus the pore pressure, PP. The effective stress field in an unconsolidated sand in the subsurface can be characterized by three mutually perpendicular principal effective stress components: (available in full paper)</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

In the mid‐1980s, AT&amp;T's American Transtech subsidiary cut its prices to customers by 50%, then avoided layoffs, then became even more profitable by moving to more fully self‐managing teams. And tiny Litel Communications (now LCI) used teams to cut time to process a service order from two weeks to one day.</jats:p>",

Indeed, marketing efforts and practices rarely succeed if one defines success as demonstrating a reasonable return on investment.

Research suggests similar failure rates for new movies; financial products and services; and consumer durables, including automobiles, appliances and consumer electronics. One CEO of a major company admitted last year: “We would have made more money if we had taken everything we spent creating and introducing new products in the last ten years and put it into certificates of deposit.”</jats:p>",

This method, which is referred to as the Constant-Curvature Method, has several advantages over the conventional Radius-of-Curvature Method and Constant-Turn-Rate Method. The new method yields constant curvature wellpath sections which are compatible with the directional performance of deflection tools. In addition to this advantage, this method also yields less dogleg severity of well trajectories, and, consequently, less drag and torque on the drill string. As a result, it is expected that the directional drilling operation should be easier, safer, and more economical if the wellpaths are planned using the proposed method. Mathematically, the formulation of the method involves integrals that do not have closed form solutions and need to be estimated numerically. To avoid the numerical integrations, two alternative approximations to the exact solution, namely Piecewise-Radius-of-Curvature Method and Piecewise-Constant-Turn-Rate Method, are presented. Sample computations show that the Piecewise-Constant-Turn-Rate Method gives better approximations and the calculations can be carried out using a hand-held calculator.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ln dem Beitrag werden die makroökonomischen Wirkungen des wirtschaftsstrukturpolitischen Aktionsprogrammes für Bremen und Bremerhaven bis 1995 (WAP 95) herausgearbeitet und quantifiziert. Damit wird ein Beitrag zur wissenschaftlichen Evaluierung der WAP-Programmatik geleistet. Im Mittelpunkt steht eine Wirkungs- und Effizienzkontrolle der bremischen Wirtschaftspolitik im Zeitraum 1984–1991, welche die politikinduzierten Wirkungen auf Beschäftigung, Wertschöpfung und Steueraufkommen von den sonstigen Einflußfaktoren auf diese regionalen Zielgrößen zu isolieren versucht. Vom Ergebnis her werden statistisch signifikante und quantitativ beachtliche WAP-Wirkungen herausgearbeitet. Der in dem Beitrag entwickelte theoretische Bezugsrahmen, der verwendete methodische Ansatz zur Isolierung der Politik-Wirkungen, der Exkurs über den sog. Mitnahmeeffekt sowie die fiskalische Analyse unter Einbeziehung von Finanzausgleichs-Effekten machen den Beitrag über den spezifischen Bremen-Aspekt hinaus interessant.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of regulation has become critical to recent debates about the nature of restructuring in geographical and economic contexts. This paper is an exploration of the theoretical implications of viewing regulation as social practice as opposed to economic imperative. Emphasis is placed on French regulation theory and those attempting to reconstruct an understanding of regulation from within a hermeneutic—interpretive framework. By definition, these two approaches represent contrasting points of view. However, the author warns against setting the context of regulation within such oppositional parameters. The commentary is not about providing a definitive approach to regulation, but, rather, is an exploration of the methodological and epistemological issues arising from the divergent approaches to regulation that have emerged in the literature. The author draws heavily on the debate between interpretivists and legal positivists and argues that this domain provides a new and exciting avenue for research on the nature of regulation in the spatial sciences. </jats:p>",

As an operational tool, planning seems formidable to structure the role of the state in accordance with its ideological underpinning. Therefore, not only is planning as an instrument tuned to economic regeneration, it is inextricably tied to the regime's political preference as well. The aim here is not to argue for a deterministic network between planning and the ideological slant of the regime and its leadership and viceversa, but to show the complex interdependence which entails, at the same time, an interplay of various pulls and pressures in a rapidly changing social fabric. Colonial India provides us with a political system embedded in both the age-old and primordial value system and various other cultural influences which, <jats:italic>inter alia</jats:italic> reflected the system's absorption of alien value preferences. This obviously was not a smooth process, for India which drew on loyalties based on primordial ties strove to absorb new stimuli which had their roots in a completely different socio-political and economic environment; the result being tension among those presiding over the destiny of the country which had its reflection in the political discourse of the day. By concentrating on planning which, among other things, strove to transform India from a traditional to a modern society, the paper seeks to explain the difficulty facing the Congress stalwarts, Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhas Chandra Bose in particular, despite their confidence in planning as the only instrument to rejuvenate India after the British withdrawal.</jats:p>",

In general, they suggest that the ‘real’ significance of regulation is only made apparent in distinct geographical and economic contexts. Although different in subject matter these papers are about how regulation is institutionally organized, and the origins of regulation in theory and in the exigencies of past and present circumstances. Here, the logic behind this kind of analytical commitment is explicated through a discussion of the notion of ‘real’ regulation in the US context. Emphasis is on the administrative practices of the modern state, eschewing idealism for an appreciation of the significance of institutional cultures of regulation. These arguments are briefly illustrated by reference to the administrative mechanisms used to regulate labor-management relations and corporations' pension obligations in particular. The preoccupation in this paper is with the formalities of regulation. As such, the paper is a manifesto for a way of studying regulation in the spatial sciences which builds upon related literature in administrative law. </jats:p>",

The first is concerned with the identification of component features and their parameters, while the second addresses the problem of automatically ordering the manufacture of the features into an efficient process plan. BEPPS is a CAPP system under preparation at the University of Bath. It has been designed with a modular structure that includes modules for conventional machines, NC machines, tooling and fixtures, cost estimating and links to both CAD and Production Management Systems. This paper concentrates on the BEPPS‐ROT module for planning rotational components on conventional machine tools, and in particular on the methodology adopted for feature ordering. The novel feature ordering logic is based on rules gathered from industry and takes into account the constraints imposed by such features as the work holding arrangements and the need to rechuck the component during manufacture. After the feature identification stage has been completed the feature ordering logic enables machine tools and equipment to be selected and the process plan to be generated automatically.</jats:p>",

Das aus dieser Initiative hervorgegangene “Forum Rhein-Main” hat für die Region Felder der regionalen Kooperation definiert.Gleichzeitig haben die Oberbürgermeister der Städte Frankfurt am Main, Darmstadt, Wiesbaden und Offenbach am Main sowie der Direktor des Umlandverbandes Frankfurt in ihrer “Rhein-Main-Erklärung” die Kooperation der Wirtschaftsförderung vereinbart.Damit wurde für die Wirtschaftsförderer der Region offiziell die Grundlage, aber auch die Aufgabe einer regionalen Kooperation geschaffen. Dies bedeutet ein Umgestalten der Wirtschaftsförderungskonzeption, weg von der rein lokalen Optimierung, hin zur regionalen Zusammenarbeit.Inzwischen hat sich im Rhein-Main-Gebiet ein regionaler Arbeitskreis Wirtschaftsförderung konstituiert. Dieser Arbeitskreis hat mögliche Kooperationsfelder erarbeitet und erste konkrete Projekte der Zusammenarbeit begonnen. Dabei wird insbesondere im Bereich Flächenmanagement, Strukturentwicklung, Gewerbebestandsentwicklung und bei der Vermarktung des Standorts kooperiert. Ziel ist es, mit diesen Projekten die Kooperation zu stärken und die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung der Region, aufbauend auf den vorhandenen Stärken und Schwächen, zu intensivieren.</jats:p>"

Three levels of automation technology, ranging from the facility automation to information and decision automation, are discussed. At the facility level, the operations of the CMMs are examined for the dimensional inspection of various manufactured objects. In this research the dimensional inspection of objects having complex and sculptured surfaces is emphasized. At the information level, a CAD-directed inspection system is implemented. The system is composed of three key elements: CAD/CMM inspection planning module, CAD model based localization algorithm, and comparative analysis module. In addition, the concept of inspection attributes is introduced. Inspection attributes are some pieces of information that are stored in the CAD database along with the design model for inspection application. Typical inspection attributes include functional tolerances and manufacturing capability. At the decision making level, an inspection planner is proposed in conjunction with the CAD directed inspection to provide links between the CAD/CMM system and inspection goal. The planner is a knowledge based system which utilizes artificial intelligence technologies to automate the decision making in inspection planning.</jats:p>",

Unlike much of that debate this paper is focused on an empirical field—telecommunications deregulation—and on questions of market strategy rather than those purely of production. After an analysis of the nature and rationale for regulation there is a focus upon the political and economic processes leading to deregulation in the telecommunications industry in the United Kingdom and USA. Attention is directed to ‘natural monopoly’ and ‘public service’ rationales for regulation and the importance of spatial issues is noted. The deregulatory climate and its effects upon computing and communication are then traced out and it is shown how corporate activity is tending towards ‘quasi-regulation’ to reduce competitive and market-based uncertainties. </jats:p>",

R is equipped with a sensor system that is capable of detecting all visible vertices and edges of the obstacles. Algorithms that plan a required path for R have been reported earlier in literature. In this paper, we investigate some trade-offs in the performance of such algorithms in terms of distance traversed, number of sensor operations and computational complexity. These trade-offs accrue as a result of the details of an underlying graph search algorithm, and in this sense are independent of the other properties of the terrain. We show that among a general class of these algorithms (a) depth-first implementations result in minimum computational complexity, (b) shortest-path implementations result in a globally shortest path in each step, and that (c) among a set of implementations that attempt to optimize the distance to the destination, the A<jats:sup>*</jats:sup> implementation results in minimum number of scan operations.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Local community opposition constitutes the single greatest hurdle to the siting of hazardous waste facilities in the United States. Conventional explanations of its causes focus on questions of risk and equity; that is, on outcomes of facility siting. In this focus it is assumed that hazardous waste management is synonymous with facility siting, when siting is in fact only one of many possible answers to the management problem. Rather than ask why local communities oppose facility sitings, it is asked how the waste management problem gets defined as a siting problem in the first place, and how public participation in the siting process is postponed until it is defined around a specific location. The analysis shifts the focus from siting outcomes to the fundamental structure of hazardous waste regulatory policy. A strong claim is asserted: that the basic assumptions of hazardous waste regulation define the hazardous waste problem as a locational problem confronting the state, rather than an investment problem for capital, and that local opposition to hazardous waste facility siting is a reaction against these basic assumptions. Local opposition to facility siting is explained in terms of the structural constraints that dispose the state to define management problems as siting problems and to arbitrate the siting disputes by means of interest-group conflict. This explanation, in turn, helps to clarify the conceptual and practical relationship between state structure and political process by disclosing the ways that pluralist democracy helps the state to manage politics in a way that sustains the basic assumptions that structure its relation to capital.</jats:p>",

In particular, the author focuses upon antitrust (competition) legislation and its differential interpretation and enforcement in the two countries. Following a survey of that legislation, the regulatory experience of grocery retailing in the postwar period is considered in detail. The hostility of the US regulatory environment to the development of big capital in retailing throughout much of the period is contrasted with the benign regulatory environment experienced by UK grocery retailers. Finally, the implications of this differential regulatory experience during a more recent period of nonenforcement and regulatory convergence are considered. </jats:p>",

The study comprised 20 feet in 19 patients having an average age of 53.3 years, with an average follow-up of 2 years. Preoperative magnetic resonance images were taken and graded for assignment to one of three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based groups. The surgical grade was determined intraoperatively based on a previously described classification scheme. </jats:p><jats:p> No medical or rheumatologic conditions predisposing to failure could be identified. Failure was defined as postoperative progression of pain and deformity which required subsequent triple arthrodesis. There were six failures at an average of 14.7 months. Surgical evaluation was not correlated to outcome following reconstruction. MRI grading, however, was predictive of outcome. The superior sensitivity of MRI for detecting intramural degeneration in the posterior tibial tendon that was not obvious at surgery may explain why MRI is better than intraoperative tendon inspection for predicting the outcome of reconstructive surgery. Therefore, it may be helpful to obtain preoperative MRI when this particular reconstruction of the posterior tibial tendon is contemplated, since this provides the best measure of tendon integrity and appears to be the best predictor of clinical success after such surgery. </jats:p>",

Each critical tradition is sceptical about the ontological status of its disciplinary foundation—‘law’ in legal studies, and ‘space’ in geography. Furthermore, the reification of particular distinctions in legal discourse is deepened by spatial distinctions. A convergence of critical legal and geographic analyses can thus have powerful analytical consequences, and the authors attempt to demonstrate this point by investigating judicial approaches to the regulation of worker health and safety in two federal states, Canada and the United States. They conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and political significance of critical legal geography, and suggest some directions it might take in the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Evidence on the geographical dimensions of corporate restructuring in the United States suggests that, if left to themselves, corporations often break the law or at least the spirit of law in furthering their economic interests. The design and implementation of restructuring involving the spatial relocation of work is in many instances conceived with the goal of circumventing corporations' social obligations. Workers' pension entitlements (and their contractual agreements with corporations on many other matters) are at risk when the economic imperatives of competition and technical innovation are the driving forces behind corporations' actions. These issues are explored with respect to rational choice theory, advancing an argument to the effect that if corporate restructuring is only understood in these terms, the prospects for effective public regulation are bleak indeed. A regulatory framework that explicitly references moral standards could be, however, more effective because the terms of evaluation would be legitimately other than simple benefit-cost analysis. This last argument is briefly illustrated by reference to the moral component inherent in making contracts between agents. </jats:p>",
