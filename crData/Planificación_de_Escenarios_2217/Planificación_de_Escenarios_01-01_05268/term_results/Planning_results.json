Private providers competing with each other for efficient provision of such services should be sought with financial incentives in funding arrangements encouraging healthy ageing thereby reducing expenditure in health care in the next decades.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Approximately half of deliveries in Honduras take place in hospitals, however hospitals rarely offer family planning (FP) services to postpartum or postabortion patients. In 1999, the Honduran Ministry of Health and the Population Council began a two-year project to expand access to FP counseling and methods following childbirth or treatment for incomplete abortion. The intervention built upon a previous Population Council project that showed that 30 percent of women hospitalized for a delivery or an abortion-related complication were interested in adopting an FP method prior to discharge. In all five hospitals participating in the study, delivery was the principal reason for admission. Admission for abortion complications was also relatively common. The intervention consisted of training all staff members assisting postpartum and postabortion women in FP service promotion and counseling; training 65 physicians and nurses in contraceptive methodology; providing FP methods, equipment, and educational aids; and supervising activities. As detailed in this brief, when providers were trained to provide FP counseling and methods to postpartum and postabortion women, the proportion of women receiving this information doubled and the proportion who received a method tripled.</jats:p>"

It is useful to look at international experiences which go beyond the conventional USA and UK examples. Health sector restructuring in Chile has as its goals: using evidence‐based decision‐making to reduce variations of practice, contain costs and increase the effectiveness of clinical practice. A key area of change is within primary health care. But how does the implementation of evidence‐based health care proceed in reality? In order to understand this, it was decided to assess the policy environment using stakeholder analysis.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Methods</jats:title><jats:p>Fifteen stakeholders from the public health sector were interviewed in depth using a snowball strategy for sampling. Material relating to perceptions, thoughts and aspirations about evidence‐based innovations in primary health care was collected. Content analysis of the material produced a matrix of criteria and indicators of operational power.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Concepts of evidence and effectiveness are different according to the role of each stakeholder in the health system. Most innovations proposed by government are related to management and stakeholders considered them as not being evidence‐based. Informal mechanisms of decision‐making predominated over the formal. Political issues are more important than formal evidence. All stakeholders felt they had power to define policy criteria but not to implement them. Implementation difficulties are related to how the system is organized and the culture within each organization. Most stakeholders indicated the need for human resources with appropriate knowledge and personal skills in order to implement these changes. These findings reveal again the importance of human factors within organizations. Policy‐making should consider such processual aspects in order to implement changes in practices in Chilean health care system more effectively.

Where such ships unload, rather than transship, state transportation agencies responsible for multimodal planning and highway connectivity are affected by greater flows of containers passing through the load center. A planning process is described that can be applied at the state level to select a megacontainership site. It was developed as part of a Texas Department of Transportation research study into the effects of containerships on the state transportation system but is generic in structure and can be applied at port sites located in other parts of the United States. </jats:p>",

In order to gain a better understanding of the current practice of the three groups of key actors in Swedish health care—politicians, senior civil servants and operational managers—and their perception of effectiveness, a study was carried out in a Swedish county council using both qualitative and quantitative methods. While in general the concept of effectiveness is thought of as crucial, it is not clearly or uniformly defined within the organization. Each of the three groups defines the concept in a way that reflects their own function, which may lead efforts to achieve effectiveness into a blind alley.

Reproductive health is of critical importance in Cambodia, which has one of the highest levels of unmet need for family planning in the developing world and suffers from what is arguably the most severe STD and HIV/AIDS problem in Asia. The study is unusual in that it examines and compares aspects of service delivery and pricing along with the socio‐economic profile and health‐seeking behaviour of clients self‐selecting services in the two settings. The socio‐economic status of clients was much higher than the norm in Cambodia but did not differ significantly between the two clinics. A few service indicators suggested that the quality of care was better in the NGO clinic. Underlying variables—such as the broader mandate of the public sector institution and the significant discrepancy between public and private sector salaries—offer an obvious explanation for these differences. The Ministry of Health in Cambodia has been developing policies related to the NGO sector, which has expanded rapidly in Cambodia during the 1990s, and it is struggling to increase staff remuneration within the public sector.

While traditional costing allocates overhead and indirect costs in proportion to production volume or to direct costs, ABC assigns costs through activities within an organization. ABC uses personnel interviews to determine principal activities and the distribution of individual's time among these activities. Indirect costs are linked to services through time allocation and other tracing methods, and the result is a more accurate estimate of unit costs.</jats:p><jats:p>The study concludes that applying ABC in a developing country setting is feasible, yielding results that are directly applicable to pricing and management. ABC determines costs for individual clinics, departments and services according to the activities that originate these costs, showing where an organization spends its money. With this information, it is possible to identify services that are generating extra revenue and those operating at a loss, and to calculate cross subsidies across services. ABC also highlights areas in the health care process where efficiency improvements are possible. Conclusions about the ultimate impact of the methodology are not drawn here, since the study was not repeated and changes in utilization patterns and the addition of new clinics affected applicability of the results.</jats:p><jats:p>A potential constraint to implementing ABC is the availability and organization of cost information. Applying ABC efficiently requires information to be readily available, by cost category and department, since the greatest benefits of ABC come from frequent, systematic application of the methodology in order to monitor efficiency and provide feedback for management. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential applications of ABC in the health sector in developing countries. Copyright © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For some years, the massive spreading of technically complex products as well as the shortening of product life cycles have led to a constantly rising return flow of discarded technical devices. The removal of these devices today occurs mostly through disposal-oriented strategies, i.e. used products are shredded and finally stored in dumps or eliminated thermally in domestic refuse combustion plants. For a long time, the product flow was a one-way street. Public and legal pressure have led to an increase in the importance of environmentally-oriented aspects in both the industrial and private sector. This leads to a rising demand for the establishment of a cycle-oriented economy. The cycle-oriented economy aims to keep materials and products in economic circulation as long as possible. The objective of the cycle-oriented economy is motivated by the shortage of resources (energy and raw materials) and the shrinking of disposal areas (air, water, soil), as well as the realization that economically usable potentials are currently being thrown away (Gupta and Veerakamolmal, 1999). Disposal, as central component of the cycle-oriented economy, includes recycling. Recycling includes disassembly as a type of treatment. In contrast to other types of treatment, disassembly permits a higher maintenance of value of old products; however, it usually requires a higher expenditure as well. In contrast to alternative types of treatment (i.e. shredding), the recovery of functional components and assemblies for reuse (product recycling) and the possibility of the recovery of materials (material recycling) are possible advantages of conducting a disassembly process (Seliger and Kriwet, 1993). In general, disassembly follows the same objectives as production; thus remanufacturing is often spoken of (Rautenstrauch, 1999).</jats:p>"

These include organization-scale solutions such as enterprise resource planning systems, inter-, extra-, and intranet applications, product data management, and enterprise document management systems. At the same time, the end user is ever more capable of rapidly developing and tailoring small-scale applications for groups, organizational units, and personal purposes independently (Grover, Teng, and Fiedler, 1998). Furthermore, corporations are investing in information technology infrastructures that take full advantage of global networking and business process re-engineering (Broadbent and Weill, 1997; Grover et al. 1998). The emerging types of systems are becoming necessities in many smaller companies too. For example, a successful subcontracting network may require certain systems to be used by all the partners. (Song and Nagi, 1997; Toh, Newman and Bell, 1998). Evidently, the above trends call for a holistic but dynamic organizational perspective on information systems planning1 (ISP) (Huysman, Fischer and Heng, 1994; Grover et al., 1998; Spil &amp; Salmela, 1999).</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Two outranking methods, ELECTRE III and PROMETHEE II, commonly used as  decision-aid in various environmental problems, and their applications  to decision support for natural resources management are presented.  These methods represent âthe European schoolâ of multi-criteria decision  making (MCDM), as opposed to âthe American schoolâ, represented by, for  instance, the AHP method. On the basis of a case study, outranking  methods are compared to so far more usually applied techniques based on  the ideas of multi attribute utility theory (MAUT). The outranking  methods have been recommended for situations where there is a finite  number of discrete alternatives to be chosen among. The number of  decision criteria and decision makers may be large. An important  advantage of outranking methods, when compared to decision support  techniques most often applied in todayâs natural resources management,  is the ability to deal with ordinal and more or less descriptive  information on the alternative plans to be evaluated. Furthermore, the  uncertainty concerning the values of the criterion variables can be  taken into account using fuzzy relations, determined by indifference and  preference thresholds. The difficult interpretation of the results, on  the other hand, is the main drawback of the outranking methods.</ja:p>"

The literature identifies a consistent lack of success by organisations in achieving business benefits from their SIS investments and in particular the difficulties of obtaining a sustained competitive advantage over rivals. There appears to be little evidence that this record has improved as organisations increasingly rely on SIS to support their business strategy. The chapter focuses upon the need for appropriate SIS planning, the role of unique, causally ambiguous ‘isolating mechanisms’ in order to sustain SIS-derived competitive advantages and concludes by summarising the implementation factors deemed to be of real practical importance for the success of large-scale SIS projects based upon recent empirical research. The high failure rate of SIS applications in business is deemed to be largely of a managerial rather than a technical causation (Earl, 1989;Burn, 1993; Galliers et al., 1994;Barnett and Burgelman, 1996; Powell and Dent-Micallef 1997; Willcocks and Lester 1999; Watson et al., 2000). This chapter identifies and considers three components which are critical in this respect to enable an IT strategy fusion with the rest of the business (Papp, 1998). </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In recent years, there is a growing awareness of the    importance of reachability and relevance-based pruning techniques for    planning, but little work specifically targets these techniques. In    this paper, we compare the ability of two classes of algorithms to    propagate and discover reachability and relevance constraints in    classical planning problems. The first class of algorithms operates on    SAT encoded planning problems obtained using the linear and Graphplan    encoding schemes.  It applies unit-propagation and more general    resolution steps (involving larger clauses) to these plan encodings.    The second class operates at the plan level and contains two families    of pruning algorithms: Reachable-k and Relevant-k.  Reachable-k    provides a coherent description of a number of existing forward    pruning techniques used in numerous algorithms, while Relevant-k    captures different grades of backward pruning.  Our results shed light    on the ability of different plan-encoding schemes to propagate    information forward and backward and on the relative merit of    plan-level and SAT-level pruning methods.</jats:p>"

Regional labour-market management represents one possible strategy for moving incrementally towards a new practice of implementation-oriented local labourmarket policy. Clearly, no form of „bottom-up” employment policy can replace the labourmarket policies of the Federal or of Land governments. However, the regions do have an important contribution to make and can add vital impulses both to labour-market policy and to the general development of economic competitiveness within their region. Over the foreseeable future there is every reason to expect a continuation of the need for an implementation-oriented, regionalised labour-market policy. Finally, such a policy needs to be organised as a learning process and to be regularly reviewed, refined and improved.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

Here time series (1971-1991) of the input variables are used in order to examine the changes of the Viennese social structure. The results are visualised as three-dimensional trend surfaces. It can be shown that urban planning has to react to “double segregation”-processes of the population as well as to new demographic “cycles of ageing”.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Forecasting the future is fun but futile since most forecasts are wrong. The only constructive strategy is to plan for the unknown. Therefore this talk will contain (almost) no predictions. It will simply consider how we may best cope with the shock of the new; the information explosion, the accelerating pace of change and its bewildering changes of direction. To do this we need to hold fast to a small number of big, lasting truths. I can survive on four, two of which are humanistic, two simply biological. These are:</jats:p><jats:p><jats:list list-type=\"bullet\"><jats:list-item><jats:p>Biological systems evolve through modification by natural selection. The word ‘modification’ does not imply new creation but redesign from a relatively small range of standard parts and processes to meet changing needs.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>The application of reason is an effective and honest approach to the process of discovery and understanding. Almost all issues can benefit from application of the scientific method (reason challenged by experiment). However, almost all issues also contain elements that transcend science but these too are amenable to reason.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>Humans are sentient animals. In common with other sentient animals, we are powerfully motivated by how we feel (as distinct from what we think) and most powerfully motivated by the need to feel good. This need may be physical or spiritual. The physical need to enjoy comfort, the satisfaction of a good meal, or sex, ensures our genetic survival. The emotional need for security, or spiritual satisfaction ensures the stability of our communities, since in a stable community, discretion and goodness have survival value.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>All life forms have value. Moral philosophy argues that a life form such as a tree has an intrinsic value independent of its extrinsic value to us (e.g. for its beauty, utility or as a carbon sink). While I accept the concept of intrinsic value, I suggest that it is more useful to redefine the concept of extrinsic value in a less anthropocentric way (e.g. a tree has extrinsic value to a squirrel).</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>"

Based on an extensive survey of young stands, individual tree basal area growth models were estimated using a mixed model approach to account for dependencies in data and derive the variance/covariance components needed. While most of the stands were reinventoried only once, a subset of the stands was revisited a second time. This subset was used to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted stand basal area distributions. Predicting distributions of forest yield, rather than point estimates, allows for a Bayesian approach to planning and decisions can be made with due regard to the quality of the information.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For many years there has been substantial urban political and economic interest in exploiting the use of cultural and aesthetic planning in order to improve the position of cities, within an expanding inter-urban competition. Built environments, places and spaces, have been regenerated in order to exploit their aesthetic, cultural, and historical significance so as to enhance commercial, consumption and public value, either for their citizens and/or tourists and capital. To date, discussions on urban planning have mostly ignored the fact that this ‘millennium urbanism’ also requires a lot of ‘discursive planning’, especially about the production of a place-identity and an urban imaginary. Discursive planning means staging the social meaning of urban space through texts, photographs, and visual signs. Aesthetic urban planning is not only about creating ambient surroundings, but also creating images, symbolic representations, and fantasies discursively using books and advertising, newspapers and television, research, and political agendas. These discursive practices are used to signify an identifiable and/or imaginary place-identity to form a sense of place or feeling of belonging to place. The article first discusses the theoretical relationship between discursive planning and representational space. The ‘how’ of discursive planning will be exemplified using the Environmental City Programme in Oslo, Norway as a case-study. I conclude by discussing how this form of urban planning needs a reflexive and semiotic community. </jats:p>",

L'image de Montréal s'appuie, en effet, à l'instar d'autres grandes métropoles, sur la mise en scène de grands ensembles naturels, d'une frange agricole périurbaine et d'une nature de proximité. Les tentatives de planifier l'aménagement d'une métropole nature donnent toutefois des résultats mitigés. Il n'en reste pas moins qu'une grande proportion du territoire de la région métropolitaine, soit près de 60 %, est toujours composée d'espaces verts, naturels ou agricoles, mais subit les effets d'une constante érosion. Par contre, le partage de la nature dans la métropole apparaît, à la lumière d'une analyse pour la période récente, refléter les differentiations socio- économiques. Les banlieues à statut socio-économique élevé sont plus vertes et perdent moins de leurs surfaces boisées. </jats:p>"

Along with the demand for an environmentally-friendly handling of important resources, recycling of worn-out products, for example, in the automotive sector, electrical and electronic equipment, or industrial goods, will gain crucial importance in the near future. In addition, comprehensive environmentally-related legal demands force the industry to take recycling of products into consideration (BMU, 1999; EU, 1999; Griese, 1997; Seliger et al., 1997; Thierry et al., 1995). Additionally this includes several processes (Figure 1) of the post-usage phase, such as: • systematic take-back of used products to specific facilities, • definition of adequate recycling strategies, • dismantling of products, • reprocessing of components, • mechanical treatment, • reuse of components and utilization of materials as well as • redistribution of the recycled goods into production and secondary raw material market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, state funded, practitioner-led organizational improvement programmes have become increasingly common within the Irish education system. Central to this new model of public funding has been the demand for extensive evaluation of each programme, a demand that has raised a number of important theoretical and practical issues for programme evaluators. The issue addressed in this article is that of the difficulty of designing approaches to evaluation which can meet the cultural and organizational needs of schools, while at the same time providing evidence as to the effective or otherwise implementation of national educational policy. </jats:p><jats:p> Initially, the article identifies and examines the tension that has arisen between programme funders' demand for an evaluation process that produces measurable 'outputs' and the programme participants' demand that the evaluation be sensitive to the specific cultural climate and needs of the organization under investigation. </jats:p><jats:p> An approach to overcoming these conflicting demands arising out of a project where such problems became central to the process of evaluation is suggested. This approach grew out of the distinction drawn by Habermas (1972) between practical and emancipatory knowledge and was developed in light of Daly's (1997) application of this concept to research, in her identification of first and second order stories or narratives. </jats:p>",

The problem of ‘Strategic Planning for Technology Products’ ranked well above all others in terms of its evaluated importance. A follow‐up DELPHI study was completed to clarify the nature and dimensions of the top problem. This second study identifies the 21 top ranked sub‐problems within the Strategic Planning for Technology Products general problem and ranks these sub‐problems in order of importance. The two most important of these sub‐problems are ‘Linking Technology Strategic Planning to Corporate Strategic Planning’, and ‘Linking R&amp;D Strategic Planning to Business Unit Product Development Planning’. Seen as closely related, these two problems are discussed in this article as ‘the linkage problem’. The 11 highest ranked problems of this second study are considered individually in this article. This follow‐up study has important implications for both academic researchers and company managers. For researchers the results suggest specific avenues of research that can fruitfully be followed. For technology managers as well as corporate managers the study offers strong indications of areas where company planning performance may be weak, as well as steps that can be taken to deal with any planning weaknesses perceived.</jats:p>",

Within the framework of anaytical studies on cause and effect, computational models have been developed for the western and eastern parts of Germany, and for Germany as a whole.

We illustrate how this organization utilized techniques to include intangibles in the implementation project’s cost benefit analysis. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the state of valuing ERP projects and questions to be answered in the future.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The need to improve the quality of health care has led to a strong demand for clinical protocols and computer systems supporting both their creation and execution. We need to build complex protocols, but also to reason about them in different ways in order to verify, select, and modify protocols, to consider the effects of different protocols over time, and to monitor the patient&amp;apos;s health conditions and the protocols&amp;apos; execution in parallel. Techniques, like Workflow Management Systems or Planning are appropriate to implement well-structured observations and processes, but are not suitable for the dynamically changing nature of therapy planning. Because of the limitations of existing approaches, we propose plan management consisting of fully integrated and inter-leaved tasks, namely plan design (authoring and/or generating), verification, validation, selection, adaptation, execution, monitoring, modification, evaluation, critiquing, and visualization. The Asgaard-Asbru project outlines task-specific problem-solving methods to support design, implementation, and execution of clinical protocols represented as time-oriented, skeletal plans. We illustrate how the idea of plan management is implemented in our Asgaard-Asbru project.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\nOur cultural landscape is more and more endangered by anthropogenic influences. Therefore concepts are necessary which help to preserve such areas. Basic information is needed, in order to quantify the monetary value of cultural landscapes. Valuing the landscape two special problems appear. First the collective-good-problem, caused by the public character of the environment, and second the existence of external costs. The results of two empirical studies which ascertain the monetary value of cultural landscapes by the Contingent Valuation Method are discussed. The main question is how much additional money local people and tourists are willing to pay in order to preserve the terraced wine growing landscape of the Moselle valley. Results which were gained show that there is a remarkable willingness to pay for the preservation of this cultural landscape among all questioned persons, especially among the locals. The findings of the Contingent Valuation Method should not be conceived as precise figures. Nevertheless is the benefit of the examined terraced wine growing landscape of approximately the same hight as the estimated costs for the agricultural support measures ruled by governmental programmes. The conclusion is that there is a cost-benefit ratio.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The introduction of computerized systems in medicine started more than a decade ago. The first applications were mainly focused on archiving and the general database management of patient records with the aim of building fully- integrated Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and fast transfer of data and images (e.g. PACS - Picture Archiving and Communication Systems) between HIS. In parallel with this more general development, specialized computer systems were built to process and enhance image data from such systems as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. The use of enhanced CT and MRI images led to the birth of Image Guided Surgery (IGS). Other terminology for similar concepts has since been used, e.g. Computer- Assisted Surgery (CAS), Computer Integrated Surgery and Therapy (CIST) (Lavallée et al, 1997) and Computer-Assisted Medical Interventions (CAMI). In this chapter, we shall look mainly at Computer-Assisted Surgery (CAS) systems and related systems which are aimed at the training of surgeons and the simulation and planning of surgical interventions. The emphasis will be on the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) aspect rather than the technological issues of such systems. The latter will be briefly discussed in the next section, to make the reader familiar with the terminology, the history and the current state of the art in CASPIT.</jats:p>"

Accordingly, any transport policy that includes the economic component needs to delimit business traffic to reflect the needs of business, both employers and employees, and consumers. Participants in the transport policy discourse have thus agreed to talk of “necessary traffic” when it comes to urban conglomerates. SMEs, which are among the main providers of urban core workplaces and which offer a broad range of consumer goods and services to their immediate vicinity, are especially affected by an inadequately functioning urban street network and by access restrictions. Several urban regions in Europe, among them London, Paris, Munich and Vienna, were in the early 1990s faced with the need to address the problem of business traffic, in order to respond to international competition between business locations and an increasingly critical traffic situation.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

In turn, as the auditee's reported earnings increase, the auditor increases audit effort. We also find that the auditee (who knows the auditor will use the report for audit planning) selects reports that increase his own expected payoff, relative to reports he would select if the auditor did not observe the report before finalizing the audit plan. By contrast, the auditor is no better off using the auditee's report for audit planning. Inherent risk, detection risk, and overall audit risk can increase when the auditor uses the auditee's report. Thus, because of the dynamic interaction between the auditor and auditee, procedures that aid in assessing audit risk may not reduce that risk or result in more efficient audits.</jats:p>",

In addition, 52 school professionals completed a parallel survey of their perceptions toward parent participation. Analyses indicate that culturally and linguistically diverse parents are active in the transition process and, in some instances, their level of reported participation surpassed that of European-American parents. In contrast, professionals described culturally and linguistically diverse parents as less involved than European-American parents in the majority of transition activities. The results are discussed in terms of how the participation of culturally and linguistically diverse parents can be better supported and the importance of transition planning extending beyond school to include other life domains. </jats:p>",

Wildfires in the west have increased to levels close to or\nabove those estimated for historical conditions, despite increasing efforts\nand expertise in fire prevention and suppression capability. To reverse these\ntrends, planning for fire and land management policies, budgets, and\nrestoration must address multiple decision levels (national, regional, local,\nand project) and incorporate an improved understanding of conditions and their\nlinkage across these scales. Three fundamental issues are identified and\ndiscussed that relate to traditional types of planning and the associated lack\nof achievement of multi-scale integrated resource and fire objectives. Various\nexamples of planning that address these three fundamental issues at different\nscales are compared to traditional types of planning. Outcomes predicted for\nan example national scale landscape dynamics model are used to illustrate the\ndifferences between three different multi-scale management scenarios.\n</jats:p>"

Our goal was to identify a battery of tasks which would provide a range of brain imaging studies which could be used clinically for surgical planning, with the requirement that they could be performed and analyzed rapidly, thus, cost effectively. These tasks were chosen to assess (1) motor control of the hands, fingers, and feet, and (2) language processing using both auditory and visual task presentations. From January through April 2001, five patients and eight normal subjects were studied. A selection of three or four tasks acquired with an EPI sequence coupled with a high resolution 3D MR sequence were completed in 45– 60 min of scanner time. Identification of the location of eloquent cortex serving aspects of motor and language functions was successful in four of the five patients and all of the eight normal subjects.</jats:p>"

They draw on a synthesis of the literature and their research experience and propose a three-stage checklist summarizing strategies that worked for them and addressed some of the problems described in the literature. The strategies proposed involve the three stages of prepare, contact, and follow-up. The prepare stage involves finding information sources and key contacts or champions, discovering related projects, and drafting alternative samples. The contact stage involves negotiation with key contacts and potential participants, confirmation, and plans for continued involvement. The follow-up stage involves feedback and continuing links in public events, action, and advocacy resulting from the research. The preparation and follow-up stages can require considerable time and resources, which, if not available within grants, can be provided through partnerships with community agencies or by seeking supplementary resources. </jats:p>",

We model the forecast of discrete demand as a band defined by the lower and upper bounds on demand, such that future forecasts lie within the current band. We develop a capacitated production planning model for a single product with terminal demand. We develop four heuristics for the problem and characterize their performance. In particular, two of the heuristics are optimal for the no holding-cost case. In our computational study, we analyze the performance of our heuristics and compare them to the optimal solution and to a simple heuristic that simulates common industrial practice using point forecasts. We find that two of our heuristics are very close to the optimal solution (less than 0.5% away from optimal on average under the conditions studied). Further, we consider forecast update patterns with primarily early, intermediate, and late information updates and provide insights on the effect of information update patterns on optimal costs. </jats:p>",

Moreover, it provides a means of addressing uncertainty without recourse to the use of subjective probabilities, which can suffer from serious cognitive biases. However, one underdeveloped element of scenario planning is the evaluation of alternative strategies across the range of scenarios. If this is carried out informally then inferior strategies may be selected, while those formal evaluation procedures that have been suggested in relation to scenario planning are unlikely to be practical in most contexts. This paper demonstrates how decision analysis can be used to structure the strategy evaluation process in a way which avoids the problems associated with earlier proposals. The method is flexible, versatile and transparent and leads to a clear and documented rationale for the selection of a particular strategy.</jats:p>",

Little attention, however, has been paid to the variable nature of paid informal exchange. Instead, the unchallenged assumption is that such exchanges are universally conducted under work relations akin to formal employment for profit-motivated purposes. To evaluate critically this dominant conceptualisation of the character of paid informal exchange, empirical research is here reported from lower-income and higher-income neighbourhoods of two English cities. This identifies that although most paid informal exchange in affluent suburbs is conducted under market-like relations for economic gain, this is not the case in lower-income neighbourhoods. Here, such exchange is more undertaken for and by friends, neighbours, and relatives for an array of reasons associated with developing social capital and/or redistribution. We conclude by suggesting that a more socially, culturally, and geographically embedded appreciation of the nature of paid informal exchange is now required alongside a fuller exploration of its implications for policy. </jats:p>",

This study uses the 1993 Kenya Demographic Health Survey data collected from 1257 couples to examine the socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics of married men and women and their communication with their spouses over fertility and family planning decision-making practices. The logistic regression analysis shows that education for both men and women, discussion of fertility and family planning between spouses, male approval of use of contraception and male family size desires are important factors that influence ever-use of family planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Worldwide influenza pandemics have occurred at irregular and unpredictable intervals throughout history and it is confidently expected that they will continue to occur in the future. It is now recognised that these pandemics result when avian influenza A viruses succeed in adaption to and transmission between humans. The impact of pandemic influenza is substantial in terms of morbidity, mortality and economic cost and there is the potential for serious social disruption. Influenza vaccines remain the most effective defence against influenza but will be in short supply during a pandemic, as will the new specific anti‐influenza drugs, due to the lead‐time required for production and rapid spread of the virus. To minimise the impact of pandemics it is imperative to maximise the availability of both vaccines and antivirals and to ensure that they are used optimally. This requires planning at both the international and national levels. The World Health Organization has, therefore, developed a staged plan for responding to a pandemic threat which is based principally on its surveillance program. It has also prepared guidelines to assist national agencies in their planning. However, there may be further options for increasing our preparedness which should also be considered.

To assist the implementation of this policy, the then Department of the Environment (DoE) commissioned a number of demonstration projects to develop approaches to assess the potential for landsliding and to identify the best ways of incorporating this information in the planning process.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            In the UK there are many situations where historic development has resulted in the concentration of urban development and infrastructure on unstable ground. This is often on a scale such that total avoidance or abandonment are out of the question, as is recourse to large-scale and inordinately expensive engineering solutions (e.g. the Bath area, Lyme Regis, the South Wales valleys, etc. (Jones &amp; Lee 1994)). Under these circumstances, detailed knowledge of slope instability is required so that pragmatic policies can be developed to assist communities to reduce risk. This approach has been pioneered by the detailed study of the Undercliffat Ventnor, on the south coast of the Isle of Wight, England (Lee &amp; Moore 1991; Lee\n            <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>\n            . 1991\n            <jats:italic>a,b,c</jats:italic>\n            ; Moore\n            <jats:italic>et al</jats:italic>\n            . 1991).\n          </jats:p>",

The creation of planned mixed-use centres intended to become hubs of transit and pedestrian movement within the dispersed suburban environment represents one such intensification strategy. I investigate three suburban mixed-use centres in the Greater Toronto Area, selected for their advanced level of development, and identify the planning rationales and objectives that have led to their creation. To verify the extent to which they meet their intensification goal, I monitor the three selected centres' level of development, modal split, land-use pattern, inner synergy, and inner movements. Findings are mixed. If the suburban centres have been successful in attracting development and attaining levels of transit use, pedestrian movement and inner synergy exceeding those of the typical suburban area, they are not as distinct from the remainder of the suburb as intended and thus fall short from their planning objectives. I conclude that a strategy combining the creation of nodes (such as suburban mixed-use centres) with high-density, transit-oriented corridors within the suburban environment would be more effective in bringing intensification to this portion of the metropolitan region. </jats:p>",

The explanation for this is to be found in the myriad barriers which exist. Thus the main object of this article is to identify in a systematic fashion the personal, intra-organisational, inter-organisational and structural barriers which impede regionalisation in the field of industrial production; this identification is based on a systematic analytical raster transferable to materially related questions. Based on the analysis of the obstacles thus identified, it is then possible to identify from the perspective of industry the areas which need to be given priority status as the focus of measures to support the realisation of concepts of regional economy. This study draws on the results of a survey of 25 representatives of industry conducted as part of a research project supported by the Federal Ministry for Education and Research (the BMBF).&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n &#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A projection of water demand in the region indicates a continuous aggravation in water deficit in the coming years. Analyses of countermeasures on the supply and demand side suggest that the conventional wisdom of ‘opening up new sources and economising on the use of resources’ may not be an optimal way to deal with water scarcity in the region. Importing water in the form of grain should be taken as an additional measure. This ‘virtual water import’ option needs to be incorporated into the current regional and national agricultural development strategy in which crop structural adjustment is at the core. </jats:p>",

However, operationalizing this integration of theory, research, and practice to develop a concrete program that can be delivered in communities is a difficult task that many practitioners feel illequipped to accomplish. This article describes the steps and processes used in designing the Teens Eating for Energy at School (TEENS) study, a school-based nutrition education program. The goal of TEENS is to increase middle and junior high students’ intake of fruits, vegetables, and lower fat foods to reduce their future risk of cancer. In this article, the authors describe a 10-step process of creating health behavior change programs. The authors use examples from the TEENS study to illustrate how a very concrete, community-based intervention is developed from behavioral theory, research, and knowledge of practice and the target audience. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\nThis paper was presented at the conference ‘Integrating spatial technologies and ecological principles for a new age in fire management’, Boise, Idaho, USA, June 1999\nSpatial data products are most often developed to support resource management\ndecisions. Rarely can the data stand by themselves as spatially-explicit risk\nassessments. We discuss the technical aspects of true risk assessments, and\nthe contrast between risk assessments and the underlying spatial data that an\nagency might use to perform one. We then present the development methodology\nand results from a comprehensive, national effort at creating resource data\nproducts that may be useful in agency- or geographically-specific risk\nassessments.\nWe have produced a suite of spatial data layers, each a continuous coverage\nfor the conterminous United States, to support national-level, programmatic\nplanning efforts for fire and fuel management. This document describes the\ndevelopment of seven data layers: (1) Potential Natural Vegetation Groups; (2)\nCurrent Cover Types; (3) Historical Natural Fire Regimes; (4) Current\nCondition Classes; (5) National Fire Occurrence; (6) Potential Fire\nCharacteristics; and (7) Population Density Groups. This paper documents the\nmethodology used to develop the spatial products. We used a Geographic\nInformation System (GIS) to integrate biophysical and remote sensing products\nwith disturbance and succession processes. We then assigned attributes\ndeveloped from succession diagrams to combinations of biophysical, current\nvegetation, and historical fire regime data layers. Regional ecologists,\nsilviculturists, and fire managers developed the succession diagrams, reviewed\nand refined the data layers, and assigned condition classes.\nNone of these data layers were developed to stand alone as an integrated risk\nassessment. Technically-robust risk assessments require quantification not\nonly of the probability of an event occurring—wildland fire in this\ncase—but also of the values at risk of damage or loss. The\n‘values’ component of a risk assessment is highly dependent on the\nresource management policies and objectives of the responsible agency. The\ndata presented here were developed for integration by individual agencies into\nagency-specific plans and risk assessments. For example, planners will use the\nCurrent Condition Class data to allocate resources for fire and fuel\nmanagement. These data are posted on the national, USDA Forest Service website\nhttp://fs.fed.us/fire/fuelman.</jats:p>"

Documentation systems for these purposes have to be planned systematically and should be goal oriented. We applied the method of a so-called ‘standardized documentation protocol’ for systematically planning two documentation systems in oncology: one for the tumor center Heidelberg/Mannheim and the other for a nationwide project in the field of documentation and therapy planning in pediatric oncology. The method proved to be helpful in both cases even though the resulting documentation protocols are completely different and although they served different objectives. Therefore, the aim of the paper is to motivate and help medical informatics professionals to systematically plan other documentation systems using this method.</jats:p>"

Satellite imagery, I therefore conclude, is not an impartial tool for the settlement of debates about land cover but is instead the result of prior debates about the character of nature. Moreover, such imagery acts as a force in the transformation of the environment; by fixing certain interpretations of the environment and forcing certain forms of management, technology changes on the land through a process of reverse adaptation. I conclude, therefore, that bureaucratic efforts at mechanical objectivity serve to institutionalize and therefore create measurable, quantifiable, and aggressive land covers through the practice of ecological modernization.</jats:p>",

The bed capacity evolution in a hospital is fixed by considering the different proposals of the hospital in negotiation with the regional hospital agency. Types of beds are differentiated according to the patients&amp;apos; needs : medicine, surgery and obstetrics_ The first approach is taken at the national level and then at the regional level using a specific ratio of beds for 100 000 inhabitants in each category. For a given hospital, the authorized number of beds takes into consideration their occupation. Target bed occupation ratios were fixed in 1992 and are still in use. In the establishment project of the University Hospital of Nancy (developed over a five year period) four approaches have been formulated and their results have been compared.</jats:p>"

Projector based augmented reality in medical applications represents a new field of research and gives an alternative solution to the commonly used Head Mounted Display technology. Moreover, the projector is not only used for visualization, but also for registration of the patient without the usage of invasive fiducial techniques as e.g. screw markers or frames. Recent results showed an achieved accuracy of &amp;plusmn;1.5 mm which roughly meets clinical demands.</jats:p>"

L'objectif est d'examiner à quelles conditions cette procédure peut contribuer à instaurer un nouveau mode de gouvernement de l'eau : on commencera pour cela par caractériser cette forme d'action publique terrrtorialisée participative et par en préciser les enjeux ; puis, on analysera sa mise en œuvre, à partir d'une étude empirique de 12 cas. On montrera notamment l'importance des dimensions managériales et politiques, laissées dans l'ombre par la procédure, dans l'élaboration d'un SAGE. </jats:p>"

This technological assemblage is organised around software formats and Internet distribution systems. The paper is concerned with the relationship between technological innovation, economic competition, and the contestability of markets for goods and services within an era of digital content. I begin by setting out two opposing discourses currently circulating within the music industry: one that denigrates the emergence of software formats, and another that celebrates it. Both discourses concur that this new technological assemblage will fundamentally reorganise the music industry as it is currently configured, with some doubt being cast over the long-term viability of the industry owing to the problems of protecting the intellectual property rights of music contained within open software formats. I provide a critical analysis of electronic markets and their impact upon economic organisation, and examine the impacts of digital content and electronic markets within the music industry through the concept of the musical network. Four networks with distinctive organisational and spatial characteristics are identified within the musical economy: networks of creativity, of reproduction, of distribution, and of consumption. I argue that all four networks are being reshaped as a result of the impact of software formats and Internet distribution systems. These developments are found to threaten the short-term profitability of some established firms within the industry, but I argue that the industry is already beginning to restabilise around a new technological and regulatory regime designed to protect copyrights in music in software formats. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In an effort to control the high prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in Ghana, which studies have shown to be of public health significance, a number of interventions are being pursued. Periodic, massive-dose supplementation strategy, developed as a short-term life-saving intervention, is currently under way, either as part of the polio eradication program or combined with the existing health delivery system, schools, or community-based infrastructures. This has been successfully accomplished, and therefore the stage is set for the design and implementation of a long-term, sustainable solution. This is important in order to make the transition from a subsidized periodic capsule-distribution effort to a more sustainable food-based intervention, which could supply other vital nutrients as well as vitamin A in the diet. This report describes a proposal for a food-based strategy against a backdrop of low consumption in spite of the relatively high availability of some vitamin A–rich foods in most parts of Ghana. The aim is to improve vitamin A status of vulnerable groups through increased production, availability, and consumption of vitamin A–rich foods. The proposal is therefore to undertake a range of food-based interventions that will include horticultural interventions that aim to increase production and availability of vitamin A–rich foods, such as dark-green leafy vegetables and orange-colored fruits and vegetables and tubers in the diet of Ghanaian households. There will also be a comprehensive behavior change and communication strategy, to raise awareness of the causes and consequences of vitamin A deficiency and the need for consumption of adequate vitamin A–rich foods at the household level. Further emphasis will be placed on efforts to promote consumption of red palm oil, since this oil is generally available and not subjected to acute seasonal shortages. A phased community-based program will be implemented in four districts during the next three years, with the aim of applying lessons learned to the rest of the country. The monitoring framework will cover the planning process, provision of services, utilization of services, and coverage of target groups. These dietary approaches offer long-term sustainable options for improving the quality of family diets and overcoming vitamin A deficiency. </jats:p>",

This six-stage model should help planners and project promoters go through the task of developing and implementing large transportation projects. The model describes the different issues in each stage and embedded in the discussion are ways for addressing them. The political, institutional, as well as technical aspects are addressed, and they are linked to show how they affect the evolution of the project. The analysis presented in the six-stage model can be inter preted as a call for planners and project promoters to acknowledge that large transportation projects are very complex and that planning and implementing them requires planners and promoters to behave in a strategic way that includes intertwining technical and political issues. </jats:p>",

We determined the reliance of each of these species on hollows in standing trees, assessed the relative frequency of occurrence of suitable hollows (based on the size of hollow and hollow entry), and further categorized species by the size of their home range and their current dependence on publicly-owned forest. No species was identified as being at high or immediate risk of decline. Eight species (6 bird, 2 mammal) were identified as excellent candidates for monitoring, with one species (Trichosurus vulpecula) most likely to provide the earliest indication of any critical reduction in the long-term supply of large hollows at small spatial scales. Past impacts of Aborigines and Europeans on populations of the larger species are likely to have been substantial, as these were hunted for food and trapped for fur. Hollow-using species are considered at present to be adequately safeguarded by: extensive areas of forest reserved from logging; science-based prescriptions mandating the retention of trees in Jarrah Eucalyptus marginata forest available for timber harvesting; a forest-wide baiting program to reduce predation by the introduced Red fox Vulpes vulpes; and a 70 year tradition of adaptive forest management. The recovery of populations of medium-sized mammal species following control of foxes will provide an opportunity to re-assess the adequacy of current hollow-management strategies. Future research should include modelling of stand structure, determining the home range of priority species, and assessing the extent of overlap of home ranges. Monitoring of indicator hollow-using species should take place at landscape scales. </jats:p>"

We make use of a simple humanlike manipulation strategy in which a single finger is moved at each instant while the other three are maintained fixed (with regard to the palm)—an extended version of the original finger-tracking scheme of Rus. This new version es sentially incorporates frictional rolling and sliding at the fingertips and deals with the related contact kinematics and quasi-static mo tion/force prediction issues. Our contribution is twofold. First, we describe an analysis showing that this extended scheme is suitable for reducing the space of the object motions, thereby making motion planning easier and operating on a search space of low dimension. Our second contribution is a planner that exploits such a search space reduction and applies the extended finger tracking at the core of a multilevel hierarchical framework to search for global reorien tation trajectories. The planner has been implemented and used for achieving several nontrivial frictional reorientation tasks that show the capabilities and the promise of our approach. </jats:p>",

It is noted that several traveldemand models can be estimated by using aggregate data, such as trip rates, mode shares, and trip-length frequency distributions. Aggregate data of this type were extracted from the National Personal Transportation Survey of 1995 (NPTS 95) and the North Central Texas Council of Governments Survey of 1996 and compared with those from the Baton Rouge Personal Transportation Survey conducted in 1997. The measures were similar in certain cases and dissimilar in others. Bayesian updating was used to update values from the NPTS 95 survey with values from a small survey conducted in Baton Rouge in 1998. Transferability was marginally improved, although it is expected that the improvement would have been more pronounced if a larger sample of approximately 500 households were available. A panel of 500 households surveyed on an annual basis and used to update transferred data from a variety of sources appears to present a more cost-effective solution to the provision of urban transportation planning data for model estimation than a periodic full travel survey. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is considerable interest in the design and funding of European pension systems. While many commentators emphasise the financial burden of underfunded European social security systems, less understood are the structure and performance of European supplementary pensions. We introduce readers to the Dutch system of funded supplementary pensions, focusing upon the governance structure of those pension funds in the context of European competition policy. From the early 1950s the Dutch government has encouraged the development of employer-sponsored and industry-wide supplementary pensions covering most employed Dutch workers. As the government has slowly discounted the real value of social security, supplementary pensions have come to play an increasingly important role in maintaining high levels of income replacement upon retirement. From the perspective of Anglo-American competition policy, these pension institutions appear unusual. In many instances, firms are required to participate in sector schemes, denying them the right to make separate arrangements with competing financial institutions. Moreover, many sector schemes are mutually owned financial conglomerates selling services to captive internal markets. Referencing the decision of the European Court of Justice in Maatschappij Drijvende Bokken BV we assess the arguments for and against this model of pension provision in the light of European competition policy and the geography of finance. While we are sympathetic to the goals of social solidarity, the underlying structure of governance combines the risks of moral hazard with limited transparency and accountability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The September 7,1999 earthquake sequence hit the northwestern part of the basin of Athens (area between Aigaleo and Parnis Mt.), causing a large number of deaths and injuries, as well as extensive damage to structures. The major area represents a small basin which is covered by thick post-alpine formations, which are extended talus cones and, to a lesser extent, neogene lacustrine and fluvial deposits. The latter have been blanketed by the talus and the alluvial deposits at the north of the area. The basin is flanked by a hill range, where the non-metamorphic alpine carbonates of the \"Sub-Pelagonian\" Unit and an allocthonous tectonic melange that belongs to the \"Athenian nappe\" outcrop. The talus cones, with a thickness that ranges from a few m. to 100 m., contain frequent lateral transitions alternations of cohesive or semi-cohesive scree and loose deposits -sand, pebbles, gravel, clay, etc. The alluvial deposits consist of clay, red soils and conglomerates is clay matrix and have a thickness between a few m. and 20-30 m. The rieogene deposits comprise relatively compacted phacies of marls, marly limestones, clays and conglomerates. The alpine formations of both the autochton and the allocthon consist largely of carbonate rocks (limestones and marbles) and, to a lesser extend, of clastic deposits (sandstones, shales, schists, and graywackes). The main tectonic feature in the area is the contact between the two alpine units, located at the eastern margin. Besides this tectonic discontinuity, numerous other faults were located, either at the basin flanks, or within the postalpine formations. All these faults determined by a large number of boreholes. They are neotectonic structures that belong to two sets, one with NNW-SSE strike and 60°-80° WSWward or ESE-ward dips, and a second one with ESE-WNW strike and 60°-80° northerly or southerly dips. In fact, these faults are directly related to the creation and evolution of the small neogene basin, which is now buried under the talus scree and the alluvial deposits. It is a complex structure, since it incorporates smaller-scale horsts and grabens. The whole picture is in good accordance with the one we get from the greater area. The damage is located within a broad, NNE-SSW trending zone that covers the central and eastern parts of the area. The correlation of this picture with the geological and structural data from the studied area showed that the most serious damage took place on loose foundation formations, which were either the unconsolidated members of the talus cones, or the alluvial deposits. However, this was not the only factor that affected the damage distribution, since the heaviest damage was located (i) along the trace of the tectonic contact between the two alpine units, (ii) at the areas with higher fault density, usually close to the basin margins, but also locally within the basin. These faults were not reactivated in the September earthquake, but \"channeled\" the seismic energy into specific zones, which also holds, at a larger scale, for the greater meizoseismal area. Hanging wall effects, effects of sedimentary basins, basin edge effects and focusing effects are also probably to have played a significant part, at the locations where the fault geometry and the basin structure performed as reflectors, magnifying the effects of shaking and thus maximizing the strong ground motion values. Besides, the fact that the heaviest damage is located at the central and eastern part of the basin, where the fault fabric is denser and the faults better expressed, is not accidental.</jats:p>"

To assess VDOT’s delivery of these services and identify areas for potential improvement, approximately 300 questionnaires were distributed to customers statewide. The questionnaire categorized planning functions into seven services (performing strategic long-range planning, providing liaison services, conducting passenger planning, conducting freight planning, performing site plan reviews, assisting with modeling and quantitative analysis, and answering questions and providing technical assistance) and asked recipients to identify the providers, evaluate service delivery, and rank the services in order of importance. Customers were most interested in strategic long-range planning. Localities were most interested in site plan reviews, and MPOs, PDCs, and VDOT’s urban districts were most interested in modeling and quantitative analysis. Urban respondents ranked modeling and quantitative analysis as the service that VDOT performs best, whereas rural respondents gave answering questions and providing technical assistance this ranking. The survey cannot replace in-depth discussions between a provider of transportation planning services and its customers, but it can yield practical customer input stratified across the seven services described. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A kinetic model describing the hepatic methylation of arsenite ([As[III]) was developed on the basis of limited data from in vitro mechanistic studies. The model structure is as follows: sequential enzymic methylation of arsenite to its monomethylated (MMA) and dimethylated (DMA) products by first-order and Michaelis-Menten kinetics, respectively; uncompetitive inhibition of the formation of DMA by As(III); and first-order reversible binding of As(III), MMA and DMA to cytosolic proteins. Numerical sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate systematically the impact of changes in input parameters on model responses. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the possibility of designing experiments for robust testing of the uncompetitive inhibition hypothesis, and for further refining the model. Based on the sensitivity analysis, the MMA concentration is the most important response on which to focus. The parameters V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub> and k<jats:sub>i</jats:sub> can be reliably estimated by using the same concentration time-course data at intermediate initial arsenite concentrations of 1–5μM at 30 ± 5 minutes. K<jats:sub>m</jats:sub> must be estimated independently of V<jats:sub>max</jats:sub>, since the two parameters are highly correlated at all times, and the optimal experimental conditions would include lower initial concentrations of arsenite (0.1–0.5μM) and earlier time-points (about 8–18 minutes). The use of initial arsenite concentrations much above 5μM would not yield additional useful information, because the sensitivity coefficients for MMA, protein-bound MMA, DMA and protein-bound DMA tend to become extremely small or exhibit erratic trends. Overall trends in the sensitivity analysis indicated the desirability of performing measurements at times shorter than 60 minutes. This work demonstrates that physiological modelling and sensitivity analysis can be efficient tools for experimental planning and hypothesis testing when applied in the earliest phases of kinetic model development, thus allowing more-efficient and more-directed experimentation, and minimising the use of laboratory animals. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, access to computers and the Internet is quite limited in developing countries. Not all licensed service providers operate, many users are actually foreign nationals, telephone connections are unreliable, and electricity supplies are intermittent. In this context, computer, e-mail, Internet, and CD-Rom use by health and health education program officers in five states in southwestern Nigeria were assessed to document their present access and use. Eight of the 30 organizations visited were government health ministry departments, while the remainder were non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Six NGOs and four State Ministry of Health (MOH) departments had no computers, but nearly two-thirds of both types of agency had e-mail, less than one-third had Web browsing facilities, and six had CD-Roms, all of whom were NGOs. Only 25 of the 48 individual respondents had computer use skills. Narrative responses from individual employees showed a qualitative difference between computer and Internet access and use and type of agency. NGO staff in organizations with computers indicated having relatively free access to a computer and the Internet and used these for both program planning and administrative purposes. In government offices it appeared that computers were more likely to be located in administrative or statistics offices and used for management tasks like salaries and correspondence, limiting the access of individual health staff. These two different organizational cultures must be considered when plans are made for increasing computer availability and skills for health education planning. </jats:p>",

All women under 25 years of age\nhaving annual exams were tested for <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic> during the visit. At the time of exam, both behavioral and\ndemographic data were collected on all women participating in the study.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> The majority of women in the study (96%) reported no symptoms of chlamydia. Only 2.5% of all women\nhad a positive test result. In the multivariate model, the odds ratios were significantly increased among the youngest\nage (14–17 years; OR = 2.2), those with mucopurulent cervicitis (OR = 3.4), cervical friability (OR = 2.2),\nsymptomatic for infection (OR = 1.8), risk history (OR = 1.6), and black race (OR = 1.2) and predictive of a\n<jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic> infection.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> Risk factors predictive of <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic> infection among younger aged women attending family\nplanning clinics in a Midwest rural population are consistent with predictors of infection among women attending\nfamily planning clinics across theUnited States. The overall findings suggest the importance of developing screening\nguidelines as a means of lowering chlamydia rates. This may be a particularly difficult task in light of the low rate of\nsymptoms that would lead a woman to seek medical care, even in younger age women who are at higher risk. In\naddition, screening guidelines would be more difficult to implement in a rural setting.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) was developed as a replacement for the four-step travel demand model. The goal was to provide a simulation system that could analyze issues facing transportation planners such as sustainable development, environmental impacts of proposed projects, and intelligent transportation systems deployment. Because TRANSIMS represents a significant shift from the current state of the practice, the transportation planning community will need to spend significant human and capital resources preparing for the transition. Some insight into these transitional issues is provided on the basis of lessons learned from research on actual calibrated transportation networks in Texas. An overview of TRANSIMS in terms of its main components along with a brief comparison with the four-step model are supplied, followed by a discussion of the data requirements with specific reference to the current data needs associated with the four-step model. The challenges inherent in converting databases that have been developed for four-step models are also discussed on the basis of the conversion of existing traffic network files. Next, the TRANSIMS traffic flow theory is described, and the challenges for transportation planners are illustrated using calibrated networks from two highway corridors in Houston, Texas, and one diamond interchange network in College Station, Texas. Last, the capabilities of TRANSIMS with respect to output analysis are described. </jats:p>",

The research is based on LOS research for the individual modes and uses a comprehensive arterial approach based on research conducted in Florida. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) developed a multimodal LOS analysis process to measure and provide mobility for diverse roadway users. In 1999 the Florida legislature authorized creation of multimodal transportation districts. It also directed FDOT to develop methods for the measurement of performances of various transportation modes to assist local governments with concurrency requirements for growth management. The Highway Capacity Manual’s (HCM) assessment of arterial LOS does not describe the quality of transportation service provided by the facility as much as it describes the quality of service provided to the through vehicle (automobile) users on the facility. Although this concept does address the primary mode of travel, it does not address the service that the arterial provides to other major potential modes (e.g., transit, walking, bicycling) or allow a multimodal LOS analysis. In the 2000 HCM, LOSs for pedestrians and bicyclists are essentially based on how crowded the respective modal facilities are. However, recent research on quality of service for pedestrians and bicyclists indicates that the most important factors are the lateral separation of the mode and motorized vehicle volume, speed, and type and frequency of transit service. FDOT’s research has applied these models with planning-level assumptions. </jats:p>",

It was found that a regional polarization process toward the core Zhujiang Delta region has occurred. The roles of old central cities such as Shaoguan, Zhanjiang, and Shantou outside the core region have been gradually weakened while some emerging cities such as Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Shunde, Nanhai, and Panyu in the core region have become strong growth centers. The dominant role of Guangzhou, established in the prereform planning system, has also been significantly weakened in the postreform period. Among the forces of development from above, below, and outside, local government revenue and savings per capita were found to be the key factors determining the level of development in various localities, confirming the key role of ‘local state corporatism’ in regional development in China. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Highway corridor alignment presents a highly complex decision environment in which a variety of social, environmental, and economic factors must be defined and weighted and trade-offs must be evaluated. These data vary widely in format and quality. Stakeholders from various groups, often with competing interests, should be integrated into this process efficiently to determine objectives, to select data, and then to quantify the importance. Corridor planning is therefore an appropriate domain for the development and application of enhanced methodologies that conjoin multicriteria decision-support techniques with the spatial analytic and presentation capacities of a geographic information system. The analytic minimum impedance surface (AMIS) methodology is presented, and its application to a case study in the southeastern United States is evaluated. AMIS features the structured integration of stakeholder input into a hybrid analytic hierarchy process. The advantages of the approach are highlighted, along with the significance of process design in building an effective methodology. Several potential applications are discussed. Conceptual constraints and problems related to the implementation of AMIS are set forth, and future enhancements are posited. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A major problem in transportation modeling is the acquisition of quality employment data. Employment data are used in transportation planning to model the journey to work and other types of trips, but they rarely are collected solely for transportation purposes because of the large expense involved. Census data, on the other hand, are inexpensive but are collected only every 10 years (although the American Community Survey provides some continuous data). This presentation outlines and assesses a process to develop systems and protocols for using an already-collected set of detailed employment data for an alternative purpose, transportation planning. Tapping this source may provide an ongoing, economical, and annual source of important transportation data that allows planners to better model and predict transportation needs, from the commuter and the business perspective. A better understanding of travel patterns, in turn, helps planners to evaluate investments in fixed physical infrastructure and public transportation. The data set also has valuable uses in other fields, such as workforce development planning, economic development, land use planning, and social service delivery. The success of this project required intergovernmental cooperation from several key partners. </jats:p>",

In order to assess the current practice, visits were made to several MPOs and transit districts around the country to learn how safety and security were being addressed in both the long-range and short-range transportation planning processes. Although safety and security were reflected in planning policies and goals and short-range project selection and programming incorporated measures of safety and security, there were few instances in which long-range planning incorporated these issues. In many cases the lack of data and limited analysis tools resulted in a reliance on subjective assessments of safety and security issues.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Like most other transit agencies in the United States, the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) in San Diego, California, had never developed a strategic plan. Nevertheless, such plans are necessary for public agencies to better understand their present and potential roles in shaping the future of their respective metropolitan areas. MTDB conducted a review of other transit systems’ strategic plans, particularly the strategic plans of transit systems overseas, to determine the characteristics of the most successful planning processes. It then embarked on an extensive market survey to learn why residents in its service area made the travel choices that they did. These proved to defy common stereotypes and led to the segmentation of the market into six discrete groups of travelers. By understanding the needs of each market segment and their respective travel patterns, the agency was then able to craft four service strategies aimed at appealing to the largest cross section of the region’s residents. The MTDB board of directors was then presented with four alternative scenarios describing transit’s potential role in the region over the next 20 years. Each scenario was associated with a different level of transit financing and influence over land use patterns and transit priority. By using the market research information, alternative transit concept plans were developed for each scenario and overall funding needs were identified. The process was completed in October 2000 with MTDB’s selection of the most ambitious of the four scenarios, Transit First. Given the positive support from business, community, and environmental groups, this action signals a paradigm shift in the region that public transportation can and should play an increased role in meeting the region’s mobility needs over the next 20 years. </jats:p>",

Seaport operations will require operational and infrastructure changes to maintain the growth of international cargo operations. Truck and rail trip generation and modal split models will provide transportation planners and public agencies with valuable information for prioritizing funds for roadway upgrade projects and port infrastructure modifications. Two methods are presented for developing freight trip generation models—regression analysis and back-propagation neural networks. These models are applied in predicting the levels of cargo truck traffic moving inbound and outbound at seaports. For the Port of Miami, the back-propagation neural network model was more accurate than the regression analysis model. However, the neural network model requires a sizable database. A second application of the back-propagation neural networks approach developed a truck trip generation model and a truck-rail modal split model for the Port of Jacksonville. The primary factors affecting truck and rail volume were found to be the amount and direction of cargo vessel freight, commodity type (bulk, break bulk, or liquid bulk), and weekday of operation. In summary, the neural network model results were found significantly accurate for both Florida ports. </jats:p>",

Relatively little attention has been focused in the literature on urban recreational trips. However, urban recreational trips are contributing increasingly to overall urban travel. Attraction-end choice models for home-based urban recreational trips are examined. A nonlinear-in-parameters multinomial logit model is estimated using the 1996 Dallas–Fort Worth household activity survey. The effects of level-of-service, zonal attribute, trip attribute, and socio-demographic variables on recreational attraction-end choice are examined, and the implications of the results for land use, transportation planning, and air quality analysis are discussed. </jats:p>",

The model \nis based on a careful functional diagnosis in the context \nof neurological syndromes, on prognosis, and on treatment \nplanning. The importance of functional diagnosis cannot \nbe emphasized enough. It constitutes a base of treatment \nplanning and prognosis and I was very happy to read a textbook \nusing functional diagnosis. Unfortunately, I got somewhat \nconfused. From my point of view as a neuropsychologist, \nfunctional descriptions are mixed with terms of localizing \nvalue. The authors have chosen an uncommon way to present \nfocal cognitive, emotional, or executive disturbances within \nthe context of different etiologies, e.g., Wernicke's \naphasia and neglect are presented as specific stroke syndromes. \nThey very often are, but certainly not always. Specific \nneurological deficits are presented with regard to prognosis \nand likelihood for impairment. Treatment studies are reviewed. \nThe neurologic rehabilitation model treats deficits in \nan “egalitarian way,” mixing sensory, motor, \nand cognitive problems.</jats:p>",

The collimated laser beam was 3 mm in diameter. Stimulus duration was set to 200 msec. The power of laser stimulus exposed to the dorsum of the right hand of 10 healthy volunteer subjects (5 women and 5 men) was varied between 0 and 10 watts to determine the pain threshold. EEG signals during the exposure of 1.5 times the threshold value were recorded from scalp electrodes placed on areas Fz, Cz, Pz, C3, and C4 according to the international 10–20 system. The stimulus presented during the EEG recording was described as a bearable pain sensation like a pinprick perception by the subjects. After 0.1–30 Hz analog low‐pass filtering, 100‐msec prestimulus, and 900‐msec poststimulus EEG epochs were recorded at 256 Hz sampling rate and evaluated statistically. Thirty stimuli were presented by randomly varying the interstimulus duration between 5 and 9 seconds.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>Latency and amplitude values of LEPs were found in accordance with those reported in the literature.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title><jats:p>The 980‐nm diode laser used is a suitable stimulator for LEP studies.

In contrast, at higher concentrations of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> (9 and 12 mol %), the phase transition shifts to lower temperatures and a significant broadening in the phase transition curve is also observed. Low concentration of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> decreases the frequency of the CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> stretching mode, implying an ordering effect, whilst high concentration of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> disorders the system. Furthermore, at low and high concentrations, vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> causes opposing effect on membrane dynamics. It decreases the bandwidth of the CH<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> stretching modes at low concentrations while increasing it at high concentrations. We have also observed different actions of vitamin D<jats:sub>2</jats:sub> at low and high concentrations in the deep interior and interfacial region of the membrane, by monitoring the frequency of the CH<jats:sub>3</jats:sub> stretching band and C=O stretching bands, respectively.</jats:p>",
