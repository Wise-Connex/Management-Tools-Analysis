Their impacts on agriculture, water availability and other natural resources are of serious concern. The paper briefly summarizes the existing information on global warming, past climatic anomalies and occurrence of extreme events vis-a-vis their impact on south Asia in general and Indian in particular. Use of GCM models in conjunction with crop simulation models for impact assessment in agriculture are briefly touched upon. The impact on hydrosphere in terms of water availability and on the forests in India are also discussed. A major shift in our policy makers paradigm is needed to make development sustainable in the face of climate change, global warming and sea level rise.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Compared to other industries, the aerospace sector is characterized by long product cycles in a very complex environment. The aircraft manufacturer has to base his product strategy on a long-term view of risks and opportunities in the transport industry but he cannot predict the development of relevant factors in this market environment with any certainty. In this situation, scenario methods offer a pragmatic way to limit the uncertainties and to work them up methodically, in order to derive recommendations for cost-intensive strategic decisions like for example the go-ahead for a new aircraft concept. By including scenario methods in the aircraft design cycle, the ‘design robustness’ can be improved, i.e. the design is not optimised for a prognosticated operating environment, but can cope with various possible future developments. The paper will explain the three fundamental aspects in applying scenario planning to the aircraft design process: requirement definition, design evaluation and technology identification. For each aspect, methods will be shown, which connect the rather qualitative results of a scenario process with aircraft design, which typically demands a qualitative input.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<ja:p>Forests play an important role in the sequestration of carbon dioxide  and the storage of carbon. The potential and efficiency of mitigation  options in forestry have been studied using large-scale forestry  scenario models. In Finland, three models have been applied in attempts  to estimate timber production and related carbon budgets. In this study,  these models are compared. The oldest, MELA, was designed in the 1970s  for the regional and national analysis of timber production. The  European Forest Information Scenario Model, EFISCEN, originally a  Swedish area matrix model, was developed in the early 1980s. SIMA, a  gap-type ecosystem model, was utilised in the 1990s for regional  predictions on how the changing climate may affect forest growth and  timber yield in Finland. In EFISCEN, only the development of growing  stock is endogeneous because the assumptions on growth, and the removal  and rules for felling are given exogeneously. In the SIMA model, the  rules for felling are exogeneous but the growth is modelled based on  individual trees reacting to their environment. In the MELA model, the  management of forests is endogeneous, i.e. the growth, felling regimes  and the development of growing stock are the results of the analysis.  The MELA approach integrated with a process-based ecosystem model seems  most applicable in the analyses of effective mitigation measures  compatible with sustainable forestry under a changing climate. When  using the scenarios for the estimation of carbon budget, the policy  makers should check that the analyses cover the whole area of interest,  and that the assumptions on growth and management together with the  definitions applied correspond with the forestry conditions in question.</ja:p>"

Moreover, it provides a means of addressing uncertainty without recourse to the use of subjective probabilities, which can suffer from serious cognitive biases. However, one underdeveloped element of scenario planning is the evaluation of alternative strategies across the range of scenarios. If this is carried out informally then inferior strategies may be selected, while those formal evaluation procedures that have been suggested in relation to scenario planning are unlikely to be practical in most contexts. This paper demonstrates how decision analysis can be used to structure the strategy evaluation process in a way which avoids the problems associated with earlier proposals. The method is flexible, versatile and transparent and leads to a clear and documented rationale for the selection of a particular strategy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aims of organic farming include the recycling of nutrients and organic matter and the minimisa-tion of the environmental impact of agriculture. Reduced nitrogen (N)-losses and energy (E)-use are therefore fundamental objectives of conversion to organic farming. However, the case is not straightforward, and different scenarios for conversion to organic farming might lead to reduced or increased N-losses and E-use. This paper presents a scenario tool that uses a Geographical Information System in association with models for crop rotations, fertilisation practices, N-losses, and E-uses. The scenario tool has been developed within the multidisciplinary research project Land Use and Landscape Development Illustrated with Scenarios (ARLAS). A pilot scenario was carried out, where predicted changes in N-losses and E-uses following conversion to organic farming in areas with special interests in clean groundwater were compared. The N-surplus and E-use were on average reduced by 10 and 54%, respectively. However, these reductions following the predicted changes in crop rotations, livestock densities, and fertilisation practices were not large enough to ensure a statistically significant reduction at the 95% level. We therefore recommend further research in how conversion to organic farming or other changes in the agricultural practice might help to reduce N-surpluses and E-uses. In that context, the presented scenario tool would be useful.</jats:p>"

Our scenarios either assume that current trends continue or that nitrogen (N) inputs to aquatic systems are reduced as a result of changes in agriculture practices and fuel combustion technologies. The results indicate that moderate changes in the human diet in North America and Europe, reducing worldwide fertilizer use by only 16%, relative to Business-as-Usual (BAU) levels, may reduce DIN export rates to the North Atlantic and European Seas by about one third and associated N2O emissions by 36 to 77%. We furthermore calculate that relatively large reductions in NOy deposition rates in Europe (of about 80%) may reduce DIN export by rivers by a moderate 8% or less, relative to BAU levels. The potential effect of reduced NOy deposition on riverine DIN export is moderate, because most N in European rivers stems from agriculture, and not from fuel combustion. Nevertheless, the calculated 9% reduction (relative to BAU) in DIN inputs to the North Sea as a potential side effect of air pollution control may help achieve the international policy targets for reduced N inputs to the North Sea.</jats:p>"
