      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper addresses the notions of communicative and participative planning through an examination of some empirical difficulties in the case of a British planning process. It focuses on the different understandings found amongst participants to a local plan process in terms of the aims and methods of planning and of the future. Two particular problems are considered: the notion of representativeness required for participants to achieve legitimacy, and the disconnections between process and outcome. The paper further considers the rituals of planning as a form of institutionalized thought that supports a particular sort of governance and lends weight to certain epistemologies and technologies. This also challenges the Habermasian notion that participants can somehow set aside their own interests or power during discussions, since this assumes that power and interests are attributes that can be shed, rather than flowing from intrinsic ways of thinking and being in the world. </jats:p>",

Rather than develop such a critique, this paper shows that there are in fact significant points of agreement between communicative theorists and the French historian of modernity, in particular with respect to the relationship between theory and practice. However, Foucault's work raises important questions about the relationship between theory and history, and it challenges Forester, Healey, and others to situate communicative planniing in its historical context and to assess the dangers that it poses for individuals and for society at large. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of planning theory has incorporated the communicative practice critique to deconstruct both plans and planning. These critiques have given planning theorists and practicing planners a useful way to think about how plans through their very structure, language, and techniques-may empower certain participants and disempower others. To date, however, the deconstruction of plans as texts still remains to be extended to a critical deconstruction of plans as spatial texts. Because planning embodies representations about the spatial-material world, its language is also spatial, and this spatial language may benefit from the lens of a deconstructive spatial critique. This paper begins by laying out a rationale for such a critique. I then show how an explicitly spatial deconstruction might proceed, and finally, I turn this examination to one particular plan for a neighborhood in the city of Lexington, Kentucky. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is an implicit paradigm in the theory of spatial planning, which we call “spatial planning as a design discipline”. It is implicit in much of planning theory, and the exposition here is in many respects an ordering of ideas from planning theory which have been in circulation for many years. I will make them explicit and relate them to each other in order to lay bare the underlying assumptions, to help planning education, and to improve the relationship between theory and practice. Such an ordering of existing ideas inevitably looks backwards, so I will also investigate how the paradigm presented here relates to some recent innovations in planning theory. Because many of the ideas have been in good currency for a long time, it is probable that they have had a strong influence on planning practice in much of Western Europe: there is not just a paradigm shared by academics but also a discourse shared by academics and practitioners. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on debates over social impacts of biodiversity conservation and the role of power relations in community participation, this paper reports on field research examining community involvement in protected area planning in Belize. The research takes an actor-oriented approach to analyze the social, political, and technical processes involved in initiating and planning of two protected-area projects. Discussion focuses on the scope of public involvement, the power differentials among actors in the planning process, and the mechanisms through which power was exercised. The pattern that emerged showed planning officials endeavoring to mitigate or circumvent social and political dissent rather than foster an active, broad-based form of community participation. The paper suggests that the notion of containment may have a general applicability wherever protected areas are planned by external agencies that aim to engage local participation. </jats:p>",

We point to alternative analytical positions that focus on issues of power, of the state, and of political economy, in ways that are often underplayed in the communicative literature and that demonstrate a healthy diversity in the field.

Results of prior research indicate that such perceptions are an important determinant of contraceptive use in rural Tanzania. The data for this study are drawn from two surveys conducted in rural Tanzania. Three models are tested separately for women and for men. The important determinants of perceptions of quality among women and men are: perceived travel time to the facility, availability of immunizations, and availability of maternal and child health services. Additionally, the ratio of the number of staff to outpatients is important to men. The data explain a moderate amount of the variance in the quality measures, indicating that perceived quality is not fully predicted by common objective measures of quality. Future surveys of facility quality should develop objective measures to better predict the perceived quality, with the underlying goal of increasing contraceptive use.</jats:p>",

Four aspects of data quality are considered: completeness of the data for reported events, evidence of omission in the reporting of events, plausibility of the pattern of sibling deaths, and sampling errors of the maternal mortality estimates. Although the data relating to reported events are complete for most variables, comparisons of sibling‐history‐based estimates of adult mortality for both males and females with other independent estimates suggest that sibling estimates are more likely to be underestimates than overestimates. The downward bias is probably greater for female mortality than for male mortality. The sampling errors associated with maternal mortality ratios are substantially larger than those associated with other frequently used DHS indicators. This lack of precision precludes the use of these data for trend analysis and has led to the recommendation that this DHS module not be used more than once every ten years in the same country.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The transition experience in Russia in the 1990s has produced benefits for some people, but it has not generally been a happy one. The level of GDP is well below what it was at the beginning of the period, inequality has increased very sharply, and other indicators of well being, such as crime and human health, have deteriorated significantly. Much of this is not unique to Russia; many of the other transition countries have faced similar problems. Although Russia was not the worst performer for many of the indicators, one might have expected better given its initial advantages, especially the immense natural resource wealth. In this paper we seek to understand why the transition process has been difficult in Russia, and in particular to what extent these difficulties arise from its resource-rich status. Three hypotheses are analysed. First is the view that resource-abundant countries are slow to make reforms as they have a cushion of rents to rely on. The second explanatory factor is the impact of resource abundance on the real exchange rate. The last factor is a social one. Resource abundance creates social conflict, as the benefits from this are unequally distributed. Although all three factors have played some part in explaining the relatively poor performance of Russia during the transition period, in our view the last explanation is the most potent. For the future, the government must pay the highest attention to reducing the social conflict. This requires a crackdown on corruption and criminal activity. Furthermore, when reforms are introduced, the government must ensure that these are not used as a vehicle for a few people to extract more rents from the system. A more careful accounting of the rents from natural resources, allocating them to the highest value uses in a transparent way, would clearly be beneficial. </jats:p>",

These are: environment as a stimulus to tourism; environment as a constraint on tourism; tourism and sustainability; environment and place marketing; and tourism impacts on the environment. It is concluded that, although tourism should be viewed as just one element of postcommunist development, it has a multifaceted relationship with natural and cultural environments which demands that particular attention be paid to sustainable management. </jats:p>",

In spite of the obvious benefits in terms of efficiency and effectiveness to be derived from sharing geographic information both within and between organizations, the idea continues to be resisted, leading to inefficiencies from duplication of data collection and storage. Using case-study methodology, we examine in this research the mechanisms and behavioral factors that can facilitate or inhibit the willingness of organizations to share GIS and databases. Five cases, including organizations with varied levels of joint GIS and database activities, were studied to determine the characteristics underlying successful interorganizational GIS. Our findings offer a number of suggestions for organizations seeking to derive maximum benefits from the interorganizational GIS activities. </jats:p>",

In some Central and Eastern European countries in particular, the funds are major financiers of environmental investments. The funds are typically governmental institutions capitalised by various revenue sources, including environmental charges and fines. They generally provide grants or soft loans for a wide range of environmental protection activities. Although a number of circumstances in economies in transition may justify the provision of subsidised finance for environmental investments, and though funds have been endorsed as potentially effective transitional mechanisms, a number of concerns remain as regards their role vis-à-vis other environmental policy tools, their effectiveness and efficiency, and their impact on the development of more market-based financing mechanisms. In this paper I will review development trends among the funds, examine issues critical to their role and operation, and identify institutional strengthening needs. </jats:p>",

In this paper we explore the role of spatial information systems, spatial modelling, and virtual reality in the analysis and prediction of visitor location and movement patterns. The quantitative modelling of the time spent by visitors on various aspects of the site attractions and of visitor conflict has not been widely attempted, having only recently become possible because of greater computer power, better spatial data storage options, and new modelling paradigms. Rule-driven autonomous agents can be used as surrogates for human visitors. Behavioural rules can be derived and calibrated from visitor surveys. This is, however, an expensive and time-consuming process and testing of people's decisions in a virtual environment may provide sufficient information for rule definition. Once a rule-set is determined, the autonomous agents move over a GIS-based model of the landscape. Rendering algorithms determine what an individual agent is able to “see”. Based on the established rules, this and other factors (such as tiredness) determine behavioural choice. Recording of model runs to file allows managers to undertake additional analysis to quantify and explore the influence of alternative management options on recreationist movement, congestion, and crowding. Through the GIS, impacts such as erosion can also be modelled. In the longer term the combined models can become part of a decision support system for sustainable tourism in fragile environments. </jats:p>",

In this paper we review the role played by the economies in transition in the climate negotiations until early 2000, especially in light of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to the Climate Convention. We consider emissions trends and the scope for further emissions reductions. Subsequently, the potential benefits of the “Kyoto Mechanisms”, which include emissions trading, joint implementation, and the Clean Development Mechanism, are discussed. We find that the climate policies in Central and Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union are drifting further apart. Activities in Central and Eastern Europe are dominated by the EU accession process, while the countries further east continue to grapple with economic crises. </jats:p>",

In so doing, it is possible to contribute to legal regulatory frameworks that are more appropriate to informal settlements.

Quantitative and qualitative data are used to illuminate the difficulties faced by implementers of reproductive health programs in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa, and Zambia. In these countries, clear evidence is found of a critical need to reexamine the continuing focus on family planning services and the nature of the processes by which managers implement reproductive health policies. Implications of findings for policy and program direction are discussed.</jats:p>",

Levels of sexual activity and factors associated with risky sex are discussed. The intervention was successful in raising the young men's awareness ofSTDs significantly in all areas except for the length of time that symptoms take to manifest following risky sex and the ineffectiveness of washing one's genitals after sex to avoid acquiring STDs. Lessons learned during the intervention are described as a means of informing future STD‐education programs, and issues requiring prompt attention are identified.</jats:p>",

The results show a clear pattern. In Comoros, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe, women prefer much longer birth intervals than those they actually have, compared with women in the other 15 countries studied. As a consequence, the potential effects of spacing preferences on the level of fertility and on the prevalences of short (less than 24 months) birth intervals and child malnutrition are greatest in the same five countries. The covariates of preferred birth‐interval lengths are also examined. An explanation is offered for this pattern, based on the observed sharp decline infertility recently experienced by these five “forerunners.” In general, women who know, approve of, discuss, and use family planning prefer longer intervals than do their counterparts. The policy and program relevance of these results is discussed.</jats:p>",

Negotiation is characterized in four stages, from normative precedent for decisionmaking to communication, disagreement, and conflict resolution. Indirect forms of communication between partners predominate, contributing to the tendency of both men and women to overestimate each other's demand for additional children. Partner opposition is found to cause a statistically significant increase in unmet need reported by women and a shift in contraceptive mix favoring use of traditional methods over modern methods. For women, partner opposition may account for as much as 20 percent of unmet need in urban areas, 12 percent in rural areas, and 15 percent overall.</jats:p>",

For any research, even the most elementary, it is wise to prepare a statement about what you intend to do and how. This is more formally known as a research protocol. For a simple study it need be no longer than a page; it would start with a single sentence statement of the aim of the study and be followed by a paragraph or two on the precise method that will be used to achieve the aim.

In this paper, on the basis of findings of a recent OECD study, we look at progress across the region in light of these recommendations. In several CEEC, there has been a synergy among economic reforms, democratic development, and environmental improvement. These countries have seen important improvements in environmental conditions but now face a variety of challenges, many tied to the process of accession to the EU and the need to deepen integration between environment and sectoral policies, such as those for agriculture and transport. In other countries, and in particular many NIS, pollution reductions have mainly resulted from declines in economic production. Many of these countries face ongoing crisis in terms of establishing economic reform, stable societies, and environmental protection. In several areas of the former Soviet Union, environmental problems—in particular poor access to safe drinking water—pose serious threats to human health. Addressing these problems presents a difficult challenge both for national governments and for international cooperation agencies. </jats:p>",

It will be argued that macro‐level factors, over which the industry has no control, have compelled airports to expand their commercial activities. As a consequence, airport authorities have been forced to adopt a more marketing‐orientated approach. To fully capitalise on the opportunities afforded to them, a range of segmentation categories have been developed that are specific to an airport environment. It will be argued that authorities act as “gatekeepers” and use this unique form of a priori segmentation to determine the most suitable tenant mix for their airport. Once operating within the airport, the retailers themselves also undertake a further series of segmentation strategies based either on a priori principles or on “micro‐level” techniques.</jats:p>",

Using the European Union as an example, the discussion includes an overview of policy inputs to international marketing decisions, specific legislation related to marketing strategy, and impending issues that may affect marketing decision making in the future. The article incorporates a proactive orientation toward the marketing policy environment through a review of both current laws and other topics with a legal and political component.

To achieve a set of tolerances as closely as possible, relationships between part geometry, tolerances, and process variables must be understood quantitatively. This paper presents an empirical model for stereolithography apparatus (SLA) accuracy, as specified by geometric tolerances, and a process planning method based on response surface methodology and multiobjective optimization. Response surfaces are used to capture the relationships among part surfaces, tolerances, and process variables. These response surfaces were generated by extensive design‐of‐experiment studies for a variety of geometries. An annotated STL data format is also presented that enables the inclusion of tolerance and surface information in faceted representations. Application of the accuracy models and process planning method is illustrated on one part.</jats:p>",

In particular, looks at the extent to which academic guidelines for adding value to performance measurement systems are applied. Four service sectors where service delivery is seen as being critical were selected for the research. In each of these sectors, one of the top four organisations (in terms of turnover) agreed to collaborate in the development of a series of case studies. The research found linkages between objectives, drivers and key performance measures. However, the organisations still have some way to go in moving performance measures from being something that keeps score to something that helps people and teams improve their performance. Clarity of the communication of results and their relationship to corporate priorities is also an area where major development is still required. Finally, there is a tendency for performance measurement systems to be technology driven rather than needs driven. As a result, the complexity and breadth of measures now available may actually make it more rather than less difficult for service outlet managers to manage.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> While the question of social class contributed centrally to the emergence of social theory in geography in the 1970s and 1980s, it has recently fallen out of favour as a lens for viewing the social construction of space, place, and nature. The causes for this loss of class vision can be found partly in the rise of alternative political perspectives focusing on identity and emphasizing a cultural rather than economically rooted politics, but they also stem from weaknesses within late 20th-century Marxism itself. The vaguely classless politics that emerged from some strands of the 1960s movements, as well as very powerful reactions against the 1960s, have also contributed. But this reaction has now run its course, and we find ourselves without a sophisticated language of class precisely at the time when, globally, class is being reasserted with a vengeance. From the economic boom, then crisis (1997–99), then boom again in Asia to the reassertion of class in Mexico and Eastern Europe, or the dramatic class formation in postcolonial South Africa not to mention Blair's Britain or Clinton's United States, class represents a crucial political dimension of social difference. Multiculturalism comes to look like an apology for capitalist ‘diversity’ while politics in academic circles is increasingly equated with the liberal common denominator of morality. This is not a narrow back-to-class appeal, but rather an argument that we need to find a way of reintegrating class into the issues of identity and cultural politics that for very good reasons have occupied the political foreground in recent years. </jats:p>",

For independent dealer businesses to survive, they must clearly demonstrate to consumers that they represent the best possible channel for the acquisition and maintenance of their motorisation needs. They must also demonstrate to manufacturers that they represent the best route to market for them. Proposes a way that dealers can not only survive but, in co‐operation with their manufacturers, prosper in the market of the future. Such an approach would comprise the removal of wasteful activity, the reduction of costs and prices, delivering greater customer value and improving customer retention. In short, true lean distribution. The concept centres on a “customer account manager”, who pro‐actively manages the consumer’s needs for after‐sales of all types, thereby managing demand and removing waste from the system. As a consequence of this demand management, he or she is able to monitor the consumer’s needs (and even his family’s needs) for a new or used replacement car, again removing waste. The approach enables the dealer to exchange ineffective, costly, direct marketing and advertising for value‐adding contacts from which the consumer and manufacturer directly benefit, thereby creating a virtuous circle.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In 1998, the state of Maryland adopted some of the toughest nutrient management planning regulations in the Nation, requiring virtually all agricultural operations plan and implement nitrogen and phosphorus-based management plans by Dec. 2002. The nursery and greenhouse industry is faced with a far more complicated nutrient management planning process than traditional agronomic planning scenarios. Factors include a large number (&gt;500) of plant species, various fertilization and irrigation strategies, with crop cycles ranging from 6 weeks (bedding plants) to upwards of 15 years for some tree species in field production, often with a lack of knowledge of specific nutrient uptake rates and utilization. In addition, unique infrastructural and site characteristics that contribute to water and nutrient runoff from each nursery contribute to a multitude of variables that should be considered in the planning process. The challenge was to identify a simple, effective process for nutrient management planning that would a) provide an accurate assessment of nutrient loss potential from this wide variety of production scenarios, b) identify those specific factors that contribute most to nutrient leaching and runoff, and c) provide a mechanism to economically assess the various risk management (mitigation) scenarios. This risk assessment process provides information on a number of fixed (site) and dynamic (management) variables for soils/substrates, irrigation and fertilization practices, together with any surface water management systems (e.g. containment ponds, riparian buffers). When all the risk factors for a nursery are evaluated and scored, the complete picture of risk assessment then emerges. By identifying higher risk factors and evaluating different risk management options, the grower and/or nutrient management planner can then choose economic alternatives to reduce the potential for nutrient runoff.</jats:p>",

This division, though, assumes that the two components can operate independently, which is not always true. The IGEN generator eliminates the need for this assumption; it handles interactions between the components without sacrificing the advantages of modularity. IGEN accomplishes this by means of annotations that its linguistic component places on the structures it builds; these annotations provide an abstract description of the effects of particular linguistic choices, allowing the planner to evaluate these choices without needing any linguistic knowledge. This approach allows IGEN to vary the work done by each component independently, even in cases where the final output depends on interactions between them. In addition, since IGEN explicitly models the effects of linguistic choices, it can gracefully handle situations where the available time or linguistic resources are limited. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper addresses the problem of computing goal orderings,    which is one of the longstanding issues in AI planning.  It makes two    new contributions.  First, it formally defines and discusses two    different goal orderings, which are called the reasonable and the    forced ordering. Both orderings are defined for simple STRIPS    operators as well as for more complex ADL operators supporting    negation and conditional effects. The complexity of these orderings is    investigated and their practical relevance is discussed. Secondly, two    different methods to compute reasonable goal orderings are developed.    One of them is based on planning graphs, while the other investigates    the set of actions directly. Finally, it is shown how the ordering    relations, which have been derived for a given set of goals G, can be    used to compute a so-called goal agenda that divides G into an ordered    set of subgoals. Any planner can then, in principle, use the goal    agenda to plan for increasing sets of subgoals.  This can lead to an    exponential complexity reduction, as the solution to a complex    planning problem is found by solving easier subproblems. Since only a    polynomial overhead is caused by the goal agenda computation, a    potential exists to dramatically speed up planning algorithms as we    demonstrate in the empirical evaluation, where we use this method in    the\tIPP planner.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent years have seen efforts to critique the dichotomy of ‘nature’ and ‘society’ in Western thought, and to demonstrate their coconstruction under specific material conditions. As yet, however, little work has uncovered the discourses of animality that lie buried within a social field whose ontological status until recently has been securely ‘human’. In this paper, I show how Western concepts of animality have circulated across the nature border and into a politics of social relations. Concepts of savagery and vulgarity can, in particular, be found within racialised representational systems with whose historicity, I will be suggesting, we can make fresh critical engagements. In much recent work on colonial power formations, ‘othering’ practices have been implicitly conceived within a psychoanalytic frame—one in which the white self's ‘interior beasts’ are anxiously displaced onto an externalised other. Whilst not refuting the efficacy of repression I wish to historicise the workings of a peculiar western model of the Human self, ‘split’ into physical ‘animal’ and cultural ‘human’. This is done both through an extended theoretical account, followed by a microstudy of geographies of savagery and civility in Sydney, Australia. </jats:p>",

Along any route chosen, extensive tunnelling would be necessary. The aerial geophysical survey aided geologists in mapping the area and provided information on the presence of geological structures, particularly faults and fractures, which could hinder tunnel construction if they are major water conduits. The helicopter survey collected magnetic, electromagnetic, radiometric, and very low frequency (VLF) electromagnetic data, and mapped a number of geophysical lineations and other structures. Most lineaments appear to be related to dikes, faults and fractures. Known major faults appear on all data sets, and minor faults appear on one or more of the individual data sets. Magnetic measurements proved to be the most useful geophysical tool for locating dikes in the area. Contacts between dikes and surrounding rock have been shown to be major water conduits, so the locations of dikes were as important as fault and fracture location. The combination of data sets proved valuable for corroborating the findings from any given data set. From the geophysical data, it appears that the western half of the survey area is more intensely fractured than the eastern half, although a few large lineations, presumably fractures of faults, appear in both areas. Ground follow up in selected areas confirmed the reliability of the airborne data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I seek to describe, explain, and evaluate three decades of Left geographical change. Now that ‘critical geography’—rather than ‘radical geography’—has become the privileged descriptor for Left geographical inquiry, it is argued that this temporal switch of labels is of more than merely semantic significance. Specifically, it is suggested that the supercession of the ‘radical geography’ label is symptomatic of a substantive shift in the nature and purposes of Left geographical inquiry. This shift has entailed the ‘professionalisation’ and ‘academicisation’ of Left geography. Both developments have occurred in the context of a thirty-year transition from a ‘modern’ to an ‘after-modern’ higher education system. Taking the Anglo-American case, it is argued that the current vitality of the geographical (read ‘critical’) Left in the academy correlates with its detachment from ‘real world’ political constituencies and also a blindness to the academic changes underpinning this inverse correlation. Rather than worrying over their apparent failure to connect with constituencies ‘out there’, it is argued that geographical Leftists need to recapture something of the radical geography spirit of action and engagement in order to contest changes occurring ‘in here’: that is, changes in the political and moral economy of the higher system that enables and constrains our academic labours. A brief manifesto for a ‘domesticated critical geography’ is offered by way of a conclusion. </jats:p>",

In intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), the difficulty for computer optimization of the beam directions arises from the fact that they are coupled with the intensity profiles of the incident beams. In order to obtain the optimal incident beam directions using iterative or stochastic methods, the beam profiles ought to be optimized after every change of beam configuration. In this paper we report an effective algorithm to optimize gantry angles for IMRT. In our calculation the gantry angles and the beam profiles (beamlet weights) were treated as two separate groups of variables. The gantry angles were sampled according to a simulated annealing algorithm. For each sampled beam configuration, beam profile calculation was done using a fast filtered backprojection (FBP) method. Simulated annealing was also used for beam profile optimization to examine the performance of the FBP for beam orientation optimization. Relative importance factors were incorporated into the objective function to control the relative importance of the target and the sensitive structures. Minimization of the objective function resulted in the best possible beam orientations and beam profiles judged by the given objective function. The algorithm was applied to several model problems and the results showed that the approach has potential for IMRT applications.</jats:p>",

By focusing in particular on leisure spaces, some of the ways in which the identities and spaces available to older people are constructed by class, ability, and gender are highlighted. These sites have different meanings and associations, reflecting positive as well as negative discourses of ‘old age’, allowing some individuals to negotiate ‘old age’ through maintaining distinct and separate leisure activities and spaces. </jats:p>",

A useful approach is to adapt the Bank's new paradigm but still retain many of the proven benefits of a disease specific approach for problems like certain infectious diseases like malaria, AIDS, TB and hepatitis.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimization of intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for charged particle beams is a necessary prerequisite to evaluate the clinical potential of this treatment modality in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons. A theoretical study for IMRT with charged particle beams delivered by rotation therapy is presented. First, the inverse problem for two‐dimensional rotation therapy with arbitrary depth dose curves is formulated. Then a numerical strategy is devised to calculate fluence profiles for the simplified case of arbitrary rotationally invariant dose distributions. This mathematical framework is applied to study various aspects of charged particle IMRT. A central topic of the investigation is the evaluation of dose delivery, based on distal edge tracking (DET) and intensity modulation. The potential of DET‐IMRT with charged particle beams is studied in comparison to an optimal, conventional dose delivery technique, which employs the concept of a spread‐out Bragg peak (SOBP). Moreover, a comparison to photon IMRT is provided for simple geometric dose patterns. The technique of DET‐IMRT for the delivery of a homogeneous target dose is only feasible for targets up to a critical radius, depending on the individual shape of the employed Bragg peak. The irradiation of larger targets requires energy modulation in addition to the range modulation for DET. The accurate placement of the Bragg peak with respect to the target edge is found to be of potential importance. Comparing dose delivery via DET‐IMRT with the optimal SOBP technique revealed a significant advantage of DET‐IMRT, especially a saved integral dose in target‐adjacent healthy tissues of up to 30%, and a reduction of the penumbra at the target edge by almost 50%. A saving in integral dose to healthy tissues by a factor of 2–3 was observed for DET‐IMRT in comparison to IMRT with high energy photons.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1990, a large flood-control project called the Flood Action Plan (FAP) was started in Bangladesh. The FAP built many embankments to divert water during the rainy season. This paper includes two case studies of diseases that are related to flood control in Bangladesh: kala-azar and diarrheal disease. Kala-azar is caused by the protozoan Leishmania donovani and is transmitted to humans by the sandfly Phlebotomus argentipes. It was found that the incidence of kala-azar in embanked areas of northwest Bangladesh was significantly higher than the incidence in nonembanked areas. This can be attributed to the lack of seasonal flooding in the embanked areas, because flooding reduces the number of P. argentipes larvae in these areas. Hood control is also related to diarrheal disease near the Bay of Bengal. Diarrheal disease incidence data were collected for people who were hospitalized at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Hospital from 1 January 1992 to 31 December 1994. Individuals living in flood-controlled areas were 2.47 times more likely to be hospitalized with cholera than those living outside flood-controlled areas. The relationship between flood control and noncholera diarrhea was not quite as strong with a relative-risk ratio of 1.42. </jats:p>",

To do so, we examine the different aspects of costs for local services, the minimum cost size facility used to provide local services, and the minimum efficient size for a local authority. We then argue that, for a given level of service, the belief that a tendency for local authorities to become enablers rather than producers would reduce the minimum efficient size of authority may not be correct. Finally, the model is developed to determine simultaneously the optimum quantity of local services and the minimum efficient size. It shows that the solution depends on how preferences vary among different citizens, and argues that governments paid too little heed to these variations. Thus we conclude that it is very doubtful whether either the 1970s or the 1990s reforms produced the structure of local government that would have emerged if the approach adopted by the governments concerned had been used with more care. </jats:p>",

The campaign to zone out pornography, a point of solidarity around which a number of disparate and often hostile interest groups have rallied in order to reclaim public space in the name of community (as though the term itself were transparent and monovocal) is linked to both gentrification and the socioeconomic dynamics underlying the emergence of what Neil Smith has characterized as the revanchist city. ‘Quality of life’ issues stand euphemistically for the domestication and sanitization of an urban landscape whose perceived unruliness is emblematized not only by the presence of large numbers of homeless people, but also by the outré display of sexually explicit imagery associated with XXX-rated businesses. By focusing on the discursive strategies that seek to identify sex shops with so-called ‘secondary impacts’ such as increased crime and decreasing property values, I aim to uncover the social biases and economic motivations that work to shape the urban landscape. I argue that the move to zone out pornography in New York City is imbricated within larger spatial practices that operate both to maximize the productivity of social space and to reproduce the social values of the majority. </jats:p>",

Their geographical-scale approach to globalization is contrasted with Bauman's emphasis on the space of flows. Four arguments are sustained. First, to produce a viable social science treatment of globalization the academic pecking order has to be reversed: political science dominates the analysis. Second, an emphasis on geographical scale promotes a comparative ‘historical globalizations’ approach which, combined with the politics, leads to the omission of the 1970s global watershed when a century of reducing economic polarization was reversed. Third, the problems of studying flows are rehearsed and it is emphasized that networks need to be studied in the whole; you are not studying flows unless you have both origins and destinations. Fourth, the embedded statism is recast as a problem of metageography, a states metageography exists which has no rivals; a possible alternative metageography, the world-city network, is briefly introduced. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Chinese government has made repeated attempts to end the so-called welfare provision of housing so as to reduce the burden on the state and the individual work units. Development companies have been set up to undertake housing construction and the housing units sold as commodities; these are referred to as ‘commodity housing’. The author conducts a comparative study of housing consumption in Beijing and Guangzhou, drawing upon two surveys of newly completed commodity housing conducted in 1996. In Beijing, which is dominated by the traditional socialist system of economic and social organisation, only a tiny portion of such housing is traded on the open market. In Guangzhou, where many of the market-oriented reform measures were first experimented with, the open market already accounts for a substantial proportion of the newly constructed stock. In both Beijing and Guangzhou, however, the work unit still constitutes the single most important buyer and distributor of commodity housing. Further, if the analysis is restricted to the subsidised sectors, which also include housing managed by the municipal housing bureau and resettlement housing, a comparison of the two samples reveals quite similar differential factors underlying housing consumption in the two cities, despite their difference in social and economic structure. The traditional redistributive system still exerts tremendous influence on housing consumption, even in cities renowned for their openness and market orientation. Certain differences in the results between the two cities are also revealed. For example, seniority is important only in Beijing, whereas professional and technical workers assume a special position only in Guangzhou. These differences point towards the importance of contextual considerations in the study of housing consumption in China. </jats:p>",

Manchester is used to illustrate how a particular local settlement’ was forged between institutions and actors in the city: a combination of national policy diktat and guidelines and local political negotiation. Marketing Manchester is analysed to assess how the arrival of new (national) institutions and the growth of the (local) partnership model of development affected local policy, and to examine how a consensus emerged around the need for a marketing organisation to promote and sell the city. On one hand, the formation and practices of Marketing Manchester are located within the local politics of Manchester. On the other hand, the author explains the failure of Marketing Manchester as a result of tensions and change in the local and the national political terrain. The election of New Labour in the General Election of 1 May 1997 in part shaped local responses to the slogans and campaigns of Marketing Manchester. The cultural élite that formed in opposition to Marketing Manchester took part both in the ‘high politics' of ‘rebranding’ Manchester and in the low politics' of political hedging, as leading actors in Marketing Manchester became cast, within local political circles, as politically obsolete because of the change in national politics. The author argues that there is a complex relationship between how national political change structures local political actors and how local regeneration experiments shape national policy. </jats:p>",

However, the management of production planning and control activities can differ greatly from management activities in traditional manufacturing. We report on managerial remanufacturing practices via a survey of production planning and control activities at remanufacturing firms in the United States. Production planning and control activities are more complex for remanufacturing firms due to uncertainties from stochastic product returns, imbalances in return and demand rates, and the unknown condition of returned products. We identify and discuss seven complicating characteristics that require significant changes in production planning and control activities. We also describe the research opportunities that exist for each of the complicating characteristics.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In July 1997 we reinterviewed fifteen of these enterprises and explored the land-use changes that had occurred over the prior year. Of the fifteen enterprises, fourteen had completed acquisition of their land. Subsequent land transactions, including land leasing, selling, or purchasing were conducted by eleven and a further one has plans to sell a portion of its land. None of the enterprises has seriously considered selling and relocating to the city fringe. These findings are relevant for all cities undergoing the transition from a planned to a market economy. </jats:p>",

Maps uncertainties are handled using the local map concept, which is introduced as a set of the best landmarks used for planning and executing robust motion movements.

The inequitable benefits of growth have been challenged more recently by the introduction of growth-management practices that heighten the role of local residents in land-use decisions. In this paper, the concepts of the ‘growth machine’ and ‘growth management’ are applied to an examination of the resort community of Whistler, British Columbia. This approach transforms previous theorizations of resort formation which draw upon Butler's (1980) life-cycle model, by focusing on the social and political dynamics of growth. Whistler is seen to progress through a phase of uncontested growth-machine dominance, to a phase of local contestation that is then moderated by the introduction of growth-management practices. The evolutionary process is seen as a cumulative one in which, over time, social and environmental imperatives are imposed upon the economic imperatives of the growth machine. </jats:p>",

But contrary to common self-congratulatory accounts that have made their way into the social scientific literature, this gay identity was woefully unprepared to launch an effective political response to AIDS in the 1980s. The AIDS activism movement which did finally emerge in the form of ACT UP/New York was born from within the gay identity, but it embraced a more expansive coalitional politics. Its amplified vision called for a critique not only of medical research procedures and public funding initiatives but also of the larger political-economic and social structures that had translated a medical emergency into a social catastrophe. This more expansive politics gave rise to the Queer movement, premised less on essential identity than on affinity of commitment. But this political evolution was not internally uncontested: the more privileged white middle-class men within ACT UP resisted any movement away from a narrowly medical approach to AIDS for those with access. The resulting conflict eventually crippled ACT UP, perhaps irrevocably. Some gay and queer geographical theorizing has learned from the Queer movement and has embraced the politics of affinity, in that it has been willing to incorporate in its analyses an investigation of the ways in which gay identity politics is implicated in the wider systems of stratification along axes of gender, race, and class. But most gay geography remains trapped in the rather narrow vision of identity politics. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban planning is usually portrayed as a benign and progressive societal force. This interpretation is critically examined through an evaluation of Israel's development town project. According to the ‘best’ planning concepts available during the 1950s, Israel built 28 new towns, mainly on the country's peripheral ‘frontiers’. New immigrants, chiefly low‐income Mizrahi Jews, were housed in the towns, which provided a cornerstone of Israel's national project of ‘Judaising’ the country. The evidence shows that the planning of the towns has had many regressive consequences: it reinforced and reproduced patterns of deprivation and inequality through the creation of segregated and low‐status Mizrahi ethnic spaces. In the longer term, this spawned continuing grievances and protest, fluctuating political orientation and the emergence of a low‐status Mizrahi ethno‐class. The case in hand casts doubt over the notion of planning solely as a progressive force, and highlights its potential to act as an instrument of control and domination in the hands of societal elites. In Israel, promotion of the ‘national imperative’ of settling the frontiers, the advent of ‘modern urban planning’, and later ‘corrective’ policies to close the centre‐periphery gap, all worked to obscure the regressive stratifying processes caused by the development town project.</jats:p><jats:p>La planification urbaine est généralement vue comme une force sociale bégnine et progressive. Cette interprétation est examinée de facon critique avec une évaluation du projet de développement de la ville en Israël. Suivant les ‘meilleurs’ concepts de planification des années cinquante, Israël a construit 28 villes nouvelles, principalement sur les ‘frontières’ périphériques du pays. Les nouveaux immigrants, avant tout des juifs Mizrahi qui avaient des revenus bas, furent logés dans les villes, qui étaient au centre du projet national israélien de rendre le pays plus judaïque. L'évidence montre que la planification des villes a eu de nombreuses conséquences régressives: elle a renforcé et reproduit les modèles de privation et d'inégalité par la création d'espaces ethniques Mizrahi de bas standing et isolés. À long terme, cela a donné lieu à des protestations et des doléances continuelles, à une orientation politique changeante et à la naissance d'une ethno‐classe Mizrahi de statut peu élevé. Ce cas d'étude met en doute le fait que la notion de planification soit uniquement une force progressive, et illumine le fait qu'elle peut servir d'instrument de contröle et de domination pour les élites sociales. En Israël, la promotion de ‘l'impératif national’ de stabilisation des frontières, l'arrivée de la ‘planification moderne urbaine’ et la récente politique ‘corrective’ pour réduire la distance entre le centre et la périphérie, ont toutes contribuéà obscurcir les processus régressifs de stratification dus au projet de développement des villes.</jats:p>",

At the same time, the Government requires local authorities to develop local transport plans that comply with national policy on integrated transport. However, there is evidence to suggest that the transport system that local communities want does not necessarily meet the guidelines set by central government. As part of the best value process, local authorities will be measured against a series of performance indicators. Critically, for transport, no strategic indicator has been suggested. This is curious since transport planners have considerable experience of setting strategic objectives and evaluating their plans against them. The local transport plan system could be developed to double as a performance plan for transportation and, through this, the development of local solutions could provide feedback to inform and develop national policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine the interplay of race and sexuality in 19th-century British colonial legislation concerning prostitution. I demonstrate that British systems of regulation of prostitution predated the introduction of the Contagious Diseases Act in 1864, and that rather than spreading from Britain to its colonies regulationist measures developed from the interplay of metropolitan-colonial relations. The example of Hong Kong serves to illustrate both the priority of colonial systems for the regulation of prostitution and the explicitly racialised nature of this legislation. I argue that colonial practice served as more than a merely legislative precedent for domestic measures, however, as racial discourse and practice can be seen to mark all attempts at the regulation of prostitution, at home and abroad; and the conception of ‘racialised sexuality’ is useful for understanding both colonial and domestic measures for the regulation of prostitution. Understanding the historical geography of regulation therefore undermines conventional analyses of relations between imperial metropole and colonial periphery, and directs our attention to the articulated categories of race, class, sexuality, and gender in the complex colonial spaces of the British imperium. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is a response to the question “can radical geography also be postmodern?” It is argued that the answer to this question is “yes” and that this is so because of the contingent, socially constructed nature of the social relations through which the universal but geographically differentiated practices of social reproduction take place. The possibility of radical impulses within postmodern thought is explored through an examination of certain Foucauldian notions of discourse, truth, and power, and Marxian notions of social relations as expressed in the work of Maurice Godelier. A critique of the limited geographical imagination of Foucauldian and Marxist accounts of power provides the context for an argument which suggests that difference is predicated on sameness and that geographies of social reproduction offer one such sameness which is, nevertheless, differentiated by social relations of reproduction. Economic geographies are therefore constructed out of difference and struggle and offer an alternative reading of the economic than that of either Foucault or Marx/Engels. Such socially constructed geographies present the possibilities of resistance to metapractices of power exerted through the discourses of truth and the social relations which are sustained by such discourses. They may be local—although they are not necessarily only local. But they are radical in proposing alternative forms of social relations/discourses. They suggest-again after Foucault—that resistance or struggle is itself a radical impulse. It may or may not stem directly from contradictions in prevailing circuits of social reproduction (that is, it may or may not stem from economic geographies) and it may or may not contribute to the displacement of such metapractices but it does express resistance and practise alternatives. Such resistance is, therefore, politically significant whatever its specific material consequences. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the key features that culminated in the collapse of Communism in the late 1980s and early 1990s was a growing demand from within the societies affected that the state and the people be seen as separate, and that there be explicit recognition of the role of civil society—distinct and separate from the state. A key element in this transformation has been the creation and establishment of independent legal systems; the authors analyse the evolution of legal services in Germany's New Bundesländer since 1989, assessing the extent to which access and social justice have been achieved. The analysis is based on data from a survey of lawyers in the former East Germany, which formed the major part of a three-year research project. The authors first look back to the former East Germany and show how independent lawyers ( Rechtsanwälte) were progressively eliminated and marginalised as the Communist state became established, with dire consequences for the creation of an indigenous legal service after unification. In the second section they examine the evolution of the service provided by lawyers in private practice since 1990, concentrating on the growth in numbers, the composition of the profession, and its geographical distribution within the New Bundesländer. Third, attention is directed at changing attitudes to the law and legal services through the eyes of the lawyers who chiefly provide them. The authors conclude that given the magnitude of the task, progress has been encouraging and that very few people in the New Bundesländer are completely denied a local legal service, even if it may not be as attuned to their needs as they would ideally wish.</jats:p>",

These results parallel the functional segregation previously described between the medial and lateral premotor cortex underlying planned and contingent motor control and extend this division to the anterior prefrontal cortex, when task management and planning are required.

Increases of 0.44–1.0% per annum are forecast, mainly driven by service sector demand. Water companies and regulators cannot influence economic activity, but have the ability to manage demand using price controls. Waste minimisation also offers the potential to offset forecast increases, if widely adopted. Current application of price controls act to increase demand, counter to the goal of environmental sustainability; therefore it is concluded that, within the UK water industry, competition should be focused on levels of service and environmental‐impact measures, rather than on price.</jats:p>",

The values obtained from the measurements on tomographs were divided by an enlargement factor of 1.5 (as defined by the manufacturer) and then compared with those from the real measurements on the skulls. Real measurements were on average 0.24 mm (SD 0.19) lower than the tomographic measurements (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.05).

We focus on the role of the forest reserves in biodiversity conservation and describe a procedure we developed to design a national system of forest nature reserves. In the late 1980s a policy was instituted to dedicate half the area of forest reserves to sustainable timber production and the other half to environmental protection (with 20% as nature reserves). To select suitable sites, a 5‐year, US$1‐million program of biodiversity and resource assessment was undertaken, focusing on five biological indicator species groups and covering all the major forest reserves. Based on data generated by the field studies, we ranked each forest in terms of various criteria—(species richness, rarity, value for nonconsumptive uses, timber production, and importance to local communities)—and used an iterative site selection procedure to choose the most suitable combination of forests for nature reserve establishment. Our procedure maximized complementarity in representing species and habitats in reserves across the whole protected‐area system. We initially selected sites using purely biological criteria but later modified our procedure to ensure that opportunity costs and potential land‐use conflicts were minimized. Our preferred network of sites included 14 forests that, in combination with the existing national parks, would account for 96% of species represented in the country's protected areas. These 14 forests were classified as “prime” and “core” sites and were selected for the establishment of large nature reserves (averaging 100 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>). The addition of 25 smaller “secondary” forest nature reserves (averaging 32 km<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>) would protect more than 99% of the indicator species.</jats:p>",

Examples are provided in which this validation identified subtle errors, either in the dose model or in the implementation of the dose algorithm. These errors would not have been detected if the commissioning process only compared relative dose distributions. A set of beam configurations, with varying field sizes, source‐to‐skin distances, wedges, and blocking, were established to validate monitor unit calculations for two different beam models in two different radiation treatment planning systems. Monitor units calculated using the treatment planning systems were compared with monitor units calculated from point dose calculations from tissue‐maximum ratio (TMR) tables. When discrepancies occurred, the dose models and the code were analyzed to identify the causes of the discrepancies. Discrepancies in monitor unit calculations were both significant (up to 5%) and systematic. Analysis of the dose computation software found: (1) a coordinate system transformation error, (2) mishandling of dose‐spread arrays, (3) differences between dose calculations in the commissioning software and the planning software, and (4) shortcomings in modeling of head scatter. Corrections were made in the beam calculation software or in the data sets to overcome these discrepancies. Consequently, we recommend incorporating validation of monitor unit calculations as part of a photon beam commissioning process.</jats:p><jats:p>PACS number(s): 87.53.–j, 87.66.–a</jats:p>",
