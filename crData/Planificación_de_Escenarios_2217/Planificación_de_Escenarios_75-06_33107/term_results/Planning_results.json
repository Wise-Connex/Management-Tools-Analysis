      "abstract": "<jats:p> The major points established in this paper are: classic marginal pricing is far from optimum for a rapidly evolving business; more appropriate dynamic models can be formulated if one has some feeling for the dominant evolutionary forces in the business environment; and, planning based on the dynamic models can lead to a significant improvement in the long run profit performance. Two developments in the management science literature, the experience curve phenomenon and market-penetration models, are used to illustrate the nature of the dynamic feedback between market and production activity which causes a new growth business to evolve. A specific illustrative example is offered which demonstrates the fact that dynamic price models can be used to test the long run consequences of specific pricing rules or to determine the optimum long run pricing scenario within the context of any constraints which a manager might wish to impose. As opposed to the conventional static theory which emphasizes the instantaneous profit flow, the dynamic models use an appropriately discounted accumulated profit as the major parameter for making value judgments. The specific example considered emphasizes the importance of these ideas for a growth market and suggests that dynamic models can lead to as much as an order of magnitude more profit in the long run than the conventional static theory. More modest, but significant, improvements in long run performance can be obtained in a moderate growth business. </jats:p>",

Definitions of external control are discussed, and its incidence in Scotland is shown to vary widely between industrial sectors; between different sizes of manufacturing enterprise; between different types of enterprise organisation; and between the different subregions of Scotland. The theoretical and policy implications of the Scottish situation, where nearly 60 per cent of the ownership and control of manufacturing employment lies in other regions of the United Kingdom and overseas, are discussed, and areas for future research outlined. It is argued that this factor is one of vital importance for the understanding of the processes and constraints of regional economic development, and that its neglect has contributed to much of the dissatisfaction expressed about the achievements of postwar British regional development-policy. The paper concludes that the development of a high level of control is not in the long-term economic interests of Scotland. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Rehabilitation clients should play a major role in planning and implementing their own programs. This includes direct participation in selecting a rehabilitation center or workshop which meets the client's needs as jointly determined by the client and counselor. In order to actively participate in this process, the client has to be provided with objective information about available resources. The traditional method for providing this information usually consists of verbalizations about facility programs and servces on the part of the counselor. However, in other areas of education and learning, audiovisual media has been shown to be a much more effective means for transmitting information. It is the authors' contention that the use of audiovisuals provides a valuable technique for orienting clients to the programs and services of individual rehabilitation agencies. As a result of being directly involved in choosing a facility or program, it is hypothesized that the benefits to individual clients resulting from services will increase. It is suggested that further study be undertaken to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach to client orientation to rehabilitation facilities.</jats:p>",

Land use projections for each of 19 hydrologic planning units are provided by a linear programming analysis of agricultural activities. Inputs to the model include rainfall, runoff, evapotranspiration (ET), aquifer properties, topography, soil types, and vegetative patterns. A water balance is developed in the uplands based on infiltration, ET, surface runoff, and groundwater flow. Valley continuity is based on stage‐volume relationship for inflows and outflows and a variable roughness coefficient dependent on vegetative patterns. Land use changes form the basis for predicting hydroperiod variation under alternative management schemes. Plans are ranked according to two criteria, deviation from a natural hydroperiod and flood or drought control provided. Results indicate that (1) a single reservoir without irrigation and (2) floodplain preservation plans are superior to (3) multiple reservoir with irrigation and (4) uncontrolled floodplain plans with regard to both criteria.</jats:p>",
