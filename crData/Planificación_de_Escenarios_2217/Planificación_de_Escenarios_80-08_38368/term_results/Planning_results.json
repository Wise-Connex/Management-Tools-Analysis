Stripped of some of their previous advanced technological excesses, professional and spontaneous paratransit services are now perceived as the linchpin of unconventional wisdom which also involves trimming conventional transit to more densely populated corridors and improving the management of private cars. Promising near-term improvements at an acceptable cost, paratransit, with its emphasis on appropriate organisation and appropriate technology, heralds a return to a freer play of market forces in advanced capitalist countries (the ingredient of a new conservatism?). As such, paratransit has captured the imagination and, more importantly, the financial support of many local, national, and supranational organisations. The original task of reviewing the Economic Research Centre's (1979) Paratransit, which reflects this widespread interest, was transformed into a commentary to accommodate more recent material. This commentary contrasts paratransit services in advanced capitalist countries and the Third World before reflecting on a possible reciprocal transfer of organisations and technology. </jats:p>",

Present and future requirements for different career specialty areas in the Navy are considered in terms of years of commissioned service and related to various “choke points” where inventories fall short of requirements in officer force structure. An illustration of the use of this model is provided which involves assessments of the effects of phasing out one comissioning source. Other uses and possible further extensions are also indicated for this model, which now forms a part of the Navy's manpower planning procedures. </jats:p>",

In particular the use of revealed-preference theory is criticised on the grounds that mere modification of aspatial economic theories to take account of the spatial dimension may reduce the original aspatial economic theory to an inconsistent and nonoperational set of ideas. Neoclassical economic theory and behavioural notions are seen not as mutually exclusive but as points on a spectrum of possible choice models, and a general framework for the analysis of spatial choices is suggested which attempts to marry these approaches together in a logical, integrated way. </jats:p>",

The research identified a very marked and consistent urban–rural shift in the relative distribution of manufacturing employment during this period, associated primarily with nonstructural influences. Regression tests of specific hypotheses derived from previous work, concerning the possible impact of government regional policy incentives, residential space preferences, and female labour availability (the ‘restructuring hypothesis’), failed to add significantly to the statistical explanation achieved. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of possible implications for UK regional policy in the 1980s. </jats:p>",

Hierarchical cluster analysis is used to group attitudes that entrepreneurs hold toward their regional economic environments into patterns of similarity, and to provide visual and quantitative evidence for the level at which various firms enter a group, and the number of alternative groupings which are undertaken before any two firms comprise the same group. The paper concludes that a single ‘regional economic milieu’ does not exist for all entrepreneurs inhabiting the same regional location, that entrepreneurs' attitudes differ between and within the region's two metropolitan centers, and that decisionmakers perceive regional location opportunities as individuals, according to their personal needs and those of their firm (but not of their industry). </jats:p>",
