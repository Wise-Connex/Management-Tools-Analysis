Begins with an overview of relevant literature. First, existing views on the content, processes and obstacles to strategic marketing planning are reviewed. Second, the topics of sports management, organization and sports marketing planning are introduced and discussed. After the presentation of the research design and methodology employed, the findings of an exploratory study into the extent and the barriers to strategic marketing planning within UK rugby union clubs are presented. Finishes with a discussion of conclusions and implications for both theorists and practitioners.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Retention of existing customers is a priority for businesses to survive and prosper. The high cost of acquisition of new customers in a mature market has pushed organizations into actively seeking to build and sustain long‐term relationships with customers. Such relationships are strong enough to provide a substantial barrier to switching business over to competition in most cases. The transition of a neutral or negative relationship into positive territory is based on changes in one or more of the cognitive, affective and behavioral dimensions of the relationship. Information exchanges between an organization and its customers play a significant role in such a change. The nature and scope of relationship with a customer changes, as the customer needs evolve in the course of the product life cycle in the customer’s industry. A framework merging the concepts of “customer relationship management” and “product life cycle” into “customer relationship life cycle” is proposed.</jats:p>",

I find that there are persistent problems in measuring QOP, highly personal links between individual QOP perceptions and aggregate QOP measurements, mostly unintended impacts of public policy decisions on QOP outcomes, and inadequate triangulation across model approximations and data limitations when building tools to support local decision-making. The analytical community should therefore acknowledge that people hold diverse preferences, increase efforts to detect and model the consequences of policies, look across levels of decision-making for influences on QOP, and build adaptive analytical capacity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most planning theory is normative and does not aim at explaining the design of planning processes. However, once the relationships between organisational characteristics and the various modes of planning are established, these connections can be used for developing positive planning theory. The problem is to explain why an agency practises a particular mode of planning (synoptic, incremental, etc), or even why it performs a specific variant of such a mode. It is argued that the impossibility theorems of social choice provide a useful platform for attacking such problems. In order to explain the practice of planning agencies, a scheme for linking agency properties and planning modes is combined with alternative strategies for resolving dilemmas of agency decision-making. A brief survey of other theoretical approaches to the construction of positive planning theory opens the discussion and places the social choice analysis in a theoretical context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Theories about communicative planning have forcefully emphasised how language and modes of communication play a key role in shaping planning practice, public dialogues, policymaking, and processes of collaboration. These days, however, discussions on planning seem to reestablish an old philosophical confrontation between Jürgen Habermas's plea for a discoursive ethic and Michel Foucault's thesis of the omnipresence of discoursive powers. Some—mostly overlooked—central themes to this controversy are the epistemological and ontological conditions of Habermas's theory of communicative action. Furthermore, theories of communicative and collaborative planning are criticised because they do not deal with questions on government and governmentality when the power of institutional discourses and the planning of legal decisional structures are discussed. In this paper, I will exemplify the controversy between the Habermasian (the ethics of participation and democratic communication) and the Foucaultian (the art of governance) planning theories, by comparing public participation in Norway with experiments on citizen involvement in Denmark. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>There has been a boom in American rail transit construction in the past two decades. That new investment has prompted the question of what planners can do to support rail transit. One popular answer has been transit-oriented development (TOD), increasingly described as a comprehensive strategy for rail-based land-use planning throughout an urban area. This is most clearly illustrated by Bernick and Cervero’s (1997) description of how such projects can link together to create “transit metropolises” where rail is a viable transportation option for many of the region’s residents. In addition, TOD provides an opportunity to examine the regulatory issues discussed in chapter 6, both because it is an explicit attempt to use urban design as transportation policy and because the intergovernmental issues are especially stark in relation to these developments. Having discussed how travelers behave in the first part of this book, we now ask what we know about how cities behave. Stated in general form, the question is rather broad. It concerns the process by which cities and other land-use authorities decide where to put streets, how to structure the local hierarchy of streets, when to develop more or less densely, how to position employment centers relative to residential areas, and so on. Still, the feasibility of land-use plans with transportation goals depends critically on how such authorities behave. Any discussion of the effectiveness of these strategies must address both how communities plan for transportation and how travelers respond to those plans. The primary transportation goal of TOD generally, as currently practiced, is to coordinate land-use policies to support rail transit. In particular, focusing both residential and commercial development near rail transit stations is aimed at increasing rail ridership (e.g., Bernick, 1990; Bernick and Hall, 1990; Calthorpe, 1993; Cervero, 1993; Bernick and Cervero, 1997). Some evidence suggests that residents near rail transit stations are two to five times more likely to commute by rail when compared with persons living elsewhere in the same urban area (Pushkarev and Zupan, 1977; Bernick and Carroll, 1991; Cervero, 1994d).</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on the Census for Transportation Planning Package (CTPP) 1990, in this paper I will attempt to explain intraurban variations of commuting time and distance in Columbus, OH. Whereas commuting times are directly available from the CTPP, commuting distances are recovered by GIS network techniques as the shortest-time distances through the urban road network. Explanations of commuting are first attempted by measures of job proximity such as distances from employment centers and a gravity-based index accounting for job competition among workers. The influence of employment centers on commuting sheds new light on polycentric urban models. The variation of commuting distance is well explained by the gravity-based job proximity index. That is to say, how far people commute is explainable to a large extent by urban land use. However, how much time people spend on commuting is complicated by their socioeconomic status, which affects their choice of commuting modes. Finally the research demonstrates the promise of explaining commuting times by workers' characteristics such as percentage of black workers, female labor participation ratio, percentage of multiple-worker households, home-ownership status, educational attainment, and wage rate. In the analyses, spatially lagged dependent variables are introduced to control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>The facts, figures, and inferences in chapter 7 regarding municipal behavior toward transit-oriented housing opportunities illustrate many points. Still, there is much that even a careful statistical analysis might miss or misunderstand. For that reason, we also explored what we could learn by talking to real planners about these issues. The case of San Diego is interesting and useful for several reasons. First, the San Diego Trolley is the oldest of the current generation of light rail projects in the United States. Unlike many newer systems, the age of San Diego’s rail transit (the South Line opened in 1981) allows time for land use planning to respond to the fixed investment. Second, the San Diego system is no stranger to modern transit-based planning ideas. The San Diego City Council approved a land-use plan for their stations that includes many of the ideas promoted by transit-oriented development (TOD) advocates (City of San Diego, 1992). Third, the light rail transit (LRT) authority in San Diego County, the Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB), is often regarded as one of the more successful municipal LRT agencies. The initial parts of the MTDB rail transit system were constructed strictly with state and local funds, using readily available, relatively low-cost technology (Demoro and Harder, 1989, p. 6). Portions of San Diego’s system have high fare-box recovery rates, including the South Line, which in its early years recovered as much as 90 percent of operating costs at the fare box (Gómez-Ibáñez, 1985). All of these factors make San Diego potentially a “best-case” example of TOD implementation. When generalizing from this case study, it is important to remember that the transit station area development process in San Diego is likely better developed than in many other urban areas in the United States. The results from San Diego County can illustrate general issues that, if they have not already been encountered, might soon become important in other urban areas with rail transit systems. Also, given San Diego County’s longer history of both LRT and TOD when compared with most other regions, any barriers identified in San Diego County might be even more important elsewhere.</p>",

A quasi‐market also exists between the NHS and higher education for the purchasing (or procurement) of nursing education. This paper uses policy documents such as the National Health Service Executive Circular (March 1999) on ‘Good Contracting Guidelines’ for Non‐Medical Education and Training, plus other relevant literature on the commodification of higher education, quasi‐markets and contract theory to examine this market, and the confusion of two rhetorics, those of competition and partnership. Nursing occupies a marginal place in higher education in England, having only recently become part of it. The emphasis of the quasi‐market on the output of a trained ‘fit for purpose’ labour force combines with professional attempts to create an academic discipline, in complex ways which are as yet underanalysed.

But the exact characterization of this complex link remains critical, especially because of the extreme morphological heterogeneity at a fine granularity level: the building and its close environment. In this approach I try to cope with this difficulty, by working at the district or city scale, by assimilating the urban fabric into a porous medium with a rigid solid skeleton, and by proposing a simple spatial model based on a set of original morphological indicators of environmental performance: density, rugosity, porosity, sinuosity, occlusivity, compacity, contiguity, solar admittance, and mineralization. This system of indicators has been embedded in a shell of development of GIS and applied to various urban fabrics. The possible applications of this model are diverse: simplified analysis of outdoor microclimate tendencies, sustained environmental evaluation of a neighborhood, interdistrict or intercity comparisons, or modelling of the climate effect on future urban amenities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In New Zealand the governance of public sector hospital and health services has changed significantly over the past decade. For most of the century hospitals had been funded by central government grants but run by locally elected boards. In 1989 a reforming Labour government restructured health services along managerialist lines, including changing governance structures so that some area health board members were government appointments, with the balance elected by the community. More market oriented reform under a new National government abolished this arrangement and introduced (1993) a corporate approach to the management of hospitals and related services. The hospitals were established as limited liability companies under the Companies Act. This was an explicitly corporate model and, although there was some modification of arrangements following the election of a more politically moderate centre‐right coalition government in 1996, the corporate model was largely retained. Although significant changes occurred again after the election of a Labour government in 1999, the corporate governance experience in New Zealand health services is one from which lessons can, nevertheless, be learnt. This paper examines aspects of the performance and process of corporate governance arrangements for public sector health services in New Zealand, 1993–1998.

Decentralization of decision‐making from the central authority to local and provincial levels is generally regarded in the literature to be an important way of achieving a more equitable distribution of health care and better management practices, aligned with local priorities and needs. However, in the absence of clear guidelines, continuous monitoring and an adequate supply of financial and human resources, decentralization processes are more likely to have a low impact on the process of health care reform and can, to a certain extent, provoke inequalities between regions in the same country. This qualitative study in Nampula province, Mozambique, was conducted to assess the impact of decentralization, through an analysis of the viewpoints of provincial health managers regarding their perceptions of the process, particularly with regard to the management of basic and elementary nurses. Secondary data from Nampula provincial reports and documents from the Mozambican Health Ministry were also reviewed and comparisons made with the experiences of other developing countries.

Particularly so-called 'elite bilinguals' (middle-class international couples, expatriates, academics who raise their children in a non-native language, etc.) make carefully considered choices when it comes to the question whether to educate their children bilingually, and how to go about it. This article reviews the research literature on childhood bilingualism as it pertains to parental language planning. The main part of the article is devoted to an exploration of the choices parents make in such contexts, the ideologies that inform those choices and the practices that they engage in (as evidenced in self-reports). Finally, the attention will turn to the reported outcomes and the evaluations of those outcomes. The findings suggest that only a very limited number of aspects of public discourses (the research literature) filter through into private discourses (parental reports on their language planning). Consequently, the parents act in a societal context where bilingualism is increasingly valorised, but where a limited understanding of the sociolinguistics of bilingualism often leads to disappointment and self-doubt.</jats:p>"

For the Kestrel well, Mississippi Canyon 632#1, geologists, geophysicists, drilling engineers and pressure prediction specialists worked together to design and drill a well that had to contend with shallow water flow sands and narrow margins between pore pressures and fracture gradients.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The design required understanding the pore pressure and stress environments at offset wells and their relationship to the Kestrel well location. Of particular concern was up-dip transfer of sand pressures. The pore pressure predictions hinged on the seismic data interpretations and the accuracy of the time-depth relation used to predict formation tops. During drilling, pressure while drilling (PWD) and logging while drilling (LWD) technology along with recently developed drilling practices for dynamic pressure control were used to \"walk the tightrope\" between pore pressure and fracture gradient. The real-time data and leak-off tests indicated that the pore pressures and fracture gradients at Kestrel were close to predicted values and as a result the well was drilled under time and under budget.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Drilling in deep waters has forced a more complete understanding of, and appreciation for, pore pressures and fracture gradients. Shallow water flow sands perhaps exemplify the most extreme example of how narrow the window between pore pressures and fracture gradients can be. As stated by Mark Alberty of BP at the 2000 Offshore Technology Conference in OTC11971, shallow water flow sands are overpressured, unconsolidated sands encountered before pressure control is in place on the wellhead assembly. They may flow into the well bore if their pore pressures are not balanced by the mud weights. However, if the mud weights are too highly overbalanced, the sands may fracture resulting in lost returns and loss of well control. The margins for well bore pressures may be less than + 100 PSI for shallow depths below mudline in deep water wells.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The Kestrel well was drilled at a water depth of 2795 ft. in Mississippi Canyon Block 632, an area of welldocumented shallow water flows. Data from nearby wells were incorporated in designing the casing and mud weight program. Essential to the design were predictions of the pore pressures and lithology. Efficient well design required a pore pressure prediction of not only the shallow water flow section but the deeper overpressured sections as well. Accurate predictions required the input of a pore pressure analyst, geophysicists, seismic interpreters, operations geologists and drilling engineers.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Planning of the Well</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Kestrel well was designed with information from a number of wells, but a great deal of the most important information came from the Mississippi Canyon 718#1 well. Planning for shallow water flows in this well was very well presented in OTC 7971 in 1996. Figure 1 is a map showing the positions of the Kestrel and MC718#1 wells.

While users were able to identify the operational benefits of SAP, they were still doubtful at the end of the evaluation process whether the system had resulted in any significant positive financial benefits for the business. Two themes related to this observation are explored. First the time lag between operational improvements and subsequent financial impact. Second the importance of learning as a means of reducing the time lag. Learning in this context is a multi‐dimensional concept and covers learning how to use the system, learning how to improve the system and learning how to improve the implementation process.</jats:p>",

Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small    modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains.  We    demonstrate this fact by developing a sound and complete partial-order    planner for planning with concurrent interacting actions, POMP, that    extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward    way.

Managerial implications for mall administrators are discussed. Concludes that to enhance its appeal to variety seeking shoppers, the mall should monitor consumer buying trends and make necessary adjustments to its tenant mix. Amenities and center quality also need to be considered. Recommends further research of this type in other communities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>Given the pervasiveness and importance of information technology (IT) in modern organisations, it is somewhat surprising that senior management often feel unsure about the business value of their IT investment. It is sometimes suggested that more careful planning of the IT resource and a more deliberate intention to align IT strategies and investments with business strategies may help ensure an adequate return on investment. The authors of this paper accept this premise. However, of interest and concern, is the issue of whether current approaches to strategic information systems planning (SISP) have kept pace with contemporary business environments. The argument that will be developed in this paper will suggest that this is not the case: that current approaches to SISP are somewhat lacking and inadequate in the increasingly interconnected business environments which are currently emerging. In addition, the authors will present a revised framework for SISP within the dynamic environment of dynamic trading networks or of what will be referred to as strategic business networks (SBNs).</p>",

A general framework is developed for CAD‐guided robot motion planning. The problem is formulated as a constraint‐satisfying problem of tool configurations or, robot hand poses. Two types of robot motion are considered: discrete motion, or point to point motion, and continuous motion. Triangular facets are used to approximate the part surfaces. A pre‐partition process decomposes the complex part surfaces into several simple, easy‐to‐solve patches. For each patch, robot hand poses are determined to satisfy certain task constraints. In this paper, the approach is applied to two applications: vision sensor planning and spray painting gun path planning. It is our belief that more robot planning applications in manufacturing can benefit from this method.</jats:p>",

The project was developed in three phases over a period of less than two decades covering almost the entire area of Peninsular Malaysia.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>While the power sector will continue to drive the future growth of PGU gas demand, the demand from the gas based industries is also expected to increase rapidly in tandem with the growth of the national economy. In recent years, the role of natural gas is becoming more important as the existing and upcoming petrochemical industries rely heavily on the natural gas for the feed stocks to generate high value added products. Indeed, the PGU project acts as a catalyst to the power generation sector and other gas based industries providing significant contribution to the national economy.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Malaysia is endowed with abundant natural gas resources to support the long term development of the PGU project. In addition to the commitment to develop the discovered gas resources, PETRONAS through its Production Sharing Contractors (PSCs) is also committed to intensify exploration efforts to discover new gas resources. Prudent planning is therefore vital for ensuring a sustainable natural gas supply to the gas projects.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper will review the historical and future outlook of the gas industry in Peninsular Malaysia. Among others, the paper will cover topics on an overview of the PGU project and challenges in gas supply planning to meet demand. Prudent gas supply planning will result in an optimum gas supply and demand matching, sufficient excess capacity margin and optimisation in gas development and evacuation which in turn will improve companies' bottom line as well as other benefits to all parties.</jats:p>",

The model defines an obstacle as a posture that, if adopted, would intersect with any part of the environment (including the actor himself or herself). The model finds a trajectory that is likely to bring the end-effector to me target by means of a one- or two-stage planning process. Each stage exploits the principles of instance retrieval and instance generation. In the first stage, a goal posture is identified, and the trajectory of a direct transition to that posture is tested for collision. If that direct movement has no collision, the movement to the target is immediately executed in joint space. If. however, the direct movement is foreseen to result in a collision, a second planning stage is invoked. The second planning stage identifies a via posture, movement through which will probably avoid the collision. Movement to and from the via posture is then superimposed on the main movement to the target so that the combined movement reaches the target without colliding with intervening obstacles. We describe the details of instance retrieval and instance generation for each of these planning stages and compare the model's performance with the observed kinematics of direct movements as well as movements around an obstacle. Then we suggest how the model might contribute to the study of movements in people with motor disorders such as spastic hemiparesis.</jats:p>",

A spatial cuing procedure was used in which the infants were presented with a central fixation stimulus and a peripheral cue. A peripheral target followed the cue on the ipsilateral or contralateral side of the cue. The procedure resulted in covert orienting of attention in these participants, reflected in behavioral (e.g., response facilitation or inhibition of return depending on cue‐target stimulus‐onset asynchrony) and ERP (P1 facilitation to ipsilateral target) indexes of covert orienting of attention. A presaccadic ERP that occurred over the frontal cortex about 50 msec before the saccade onset was largest when the saccade was to a target in a cued location. A presaccadic ERP potential that occurred about 300 msec before the saccade onset was largest for the saccades toward the cued location whether the target was present or not. These results suggest that saccade planning occurs in infants at this age and that infant saccade planning is controlled by cortical systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The damaged state of the environment in what was Czechoslovakia seemed to symbolise all that was at fault with the Soviet political, social, and economic model. In response to increased domestic and international concern about levels of pollution, plus the fact that the new government included former dissidents who had been involved in the clandestine environmental movement prior to the revolution, the environment was identified as a key priority in 1990. The tenth anniversary of the collapse of communist rule provided an appropriate point at which to assess the progress made and to consider the development of environmental capacity in the Czech Republic. Although I broadly adopt the conceptual framework of ‘environmental capacity building’ in this paper, I also argue that any assessment of environmental policy must focus primarily on the underlying processes of political, social, and economic reform that, in conjunction, continue to shape environmental policy and strategies. Thus, the objective here is to consider the impact of economic reform on the environment, how a decade of political reform has affected environmental nongovernmental organisations, and what has been the actual result of external aid and assistance. Two overriding points emerge from the discussion. First, much of the improvement in levels of pollution is in fact attributable to the decline in manufacturing output rather than conservation measures or large-scale restructuring. Second, the strengthening of environmental capacity is inextricably linked to the complex process of democratic consolidation and is thus constrained not just by the legacies of communist rule, but by the evolving relationship between society, the global economy, and the state. </jats:p>",

As shown here, the model can also be used to simulate grasping movements whose kinematics resemble those of grasps performed by people with spastic hemiparesis. The simulations demonstrate effects of: (a) reduced ranges of motion of arm joints on the size of the reachable workspace, (b) awkward starting postures on me time course of the hand closing around an object, (c) increased costs of joint rotations on movement time, and (d) addition of noise to biphasic joint rotations on the low-velocity phase of wrist transport.</jats:p>",

PURs are believed to offer a means of promoting regional economic competitiveness while safeguarding environmental objectives. This paper interrogates the concept and examines its relevance to the central Scotland region. Central Scotland has a polycentric physical form, but the evidence that it is a single functional region in economic terms is much more mixed. The dominant pattern of interactions suggests two separate city-regions, although links between adjoining areas seem to be growing. Despite considerable rivalry between public organisations across the region, there appears to be increasing support for the development of some kind of strategic spatial framework to inform key investment decisions and to promote closer collaboration. This would not necessarily be based on the PUR concept, since it is too broadly specified at present to guide the kinds of decision that need to be made. Further work is needed to elaborate and refine the concept. </jats:p>",

We find little effect of risk on planned personnel hours, but show that the firm responds to fraud and error risk factors by applying engagement-planning strategies such as assigning more high-risk specialist personnel, assigning more industry expert personnel, applying more intensive testing, and/or performing additional review. Analyzing proposed fees while controlling for planned personnel hours, we find risk premia for both fraud and error risk factors. Supplemental analysis of accepted vs. rejected bids shows that the risk premia are detectable for bids accepted by clients (i.e., the engagements the firm will actually perform), implying that risk premia are not bid away in the market. We also find that for clients purchasing additional services, the firm plans more hours and uses industry experts more often. Results reveal a relatively small fee premium for additional services clients across all bids, but analysis of accepted vs. rejected bids implies that this premium is bid away in the market.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The relationship of space and time has become a vexed issue in accounts in the postmodern metropolis. Rich and enlivening accounts use spatial categories to describe the interrelationships of elements of the city—moving from historicism to geography, to gloss Jameson's development of cognitive mapping. Postmodern geographies utilising the ideas of cognitive mapping show marked similarities with the accounts of time and space describing classical and medieval arts of memory and the Romantic writings of Flaubert on Athens. However, spatialised accounts of the city often seem to replicate problematic divisions of space and time that also underlay historicist accounts and merely invert the latter's priorities. The work of Bergson offers key insights into how this division occurred and a sense of temporality that may be lost in spatial metaphors. This is a sense of difference and alterity that we trace in the work of Proust and argue can be brought to inform the urban theatre of memories through a careful reworking of ideas suggested by de Certeau and Derrida. In this paper we take the case of Athens, bringing together East and West, ancient and modern, original and copy, as a grounding to discuss these issues. We suggest a sense of time- space as both fragmented and dynamic; a sense of the historical sites as creating instability and displacement in collective memory. </jats:p>",

First, dwelling has come to the fore recently as an approach to nature, place, and landscape, but we argue that further development of this idea is required in order to address issues relating to romantic views of places, authenticity, localness, and the way we ‘see’ landscapes. Second, we turn to the notion of dwelling to develop interconnected views of the world which can still retain a notion of place, a key but problematic concept within geography, landscape studies, and environmental thinking. In particular, we seek to develop ideas of place within the context of actor network theory. We explore the notion of dwelling in Heidegger and as adapted by Ingold, and we trace how dwelling has been deployed subsequently in studies of landscape and place. We then develop a more critical appreciation of dwelling in the context of an orchard in Somerset which we have researched as a place of hybrid constructions of culture and nature.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The process of population redistribution is influenced by a complex set of factors which can be grouped in economic, socio-cultural, demographic and policy factors. Most countries in Europe have to a certain extent tried to influence population redistribution through policy measures, mostly in the sphere of spatial planning, in the recent past. This paper offers a critical evaluation of the degree to which 'spatial planning matters' in the population redistribution process. First, the focus will be on the Netherlands, a country with a polynucleated settlement pattern that is known for its ambitious policies to counteract the continuous deconcentration of population. In addition, an international comparison with three other areas in north-west Europe (also characterised by a polynucleated settlement system) will be presented, in which the key question is: to what extent do different spatial planning systems lead to different developments in population distribution? The evidence presented, with striking similarities in population redistribution in the four case-study areas, suggests that the influence of spatial planning is very modest. To conclude this paper, the possible future role of spatial planning in the deconcentration process is questioned. Will spatial planning be able to counteract or control the formation of urban fields, in which people, companies and services are seemingly spread out 'at random' over large areas? </jats:p>",

After the collapse of state socialism in Europe between 1989 and 1991, many immediate approaches to environmental reconstruction assumed that economic liberalisation and democratisation would alleviate problems. Since then, critics have argued that these proposed solutions were themselves problematic, and too closely reflected Western European and North American conceptions of environmental quality and democracy. The result has been a counterreaction focusing on detail and specificity at national levels and below. In this paper, we summarise debates about the environment and postsocialism since the period 1989–91. In particular, we examine whether an essentialistic link can be made between state socialism and environmental problems, and how far civil society—or environmentalism—may result in an improvement in perceived environmental quality. Finally, we consider the possibility for developing an approach to the environment and postsocialism that lies between crude generalisation and microscale studies. </jats:p>",

In opposition to the suggestion that the writings of all Euro-American travellers during the Age of Empire’ were determined only by a single, superior, and colonising representational economy, I assert that encounters with foreign lands were as important in the formation of travellers' ideas as the theories and preconceptions brought with them from Europe. Although it is argued that the more bombastic rhetoric of the travel texts of European, and particularly British, travellers in Argentina were in part influenced by British financial and technological dominance in Argentina in the 19th century, the importance of other sources of inspiration are also drawn, including the landscapes and natures of Argentina themselves. Focusing particularly on the writings of William Henry Hudson, the prominent Victorian natural historian, the paper lays out the significance of the Patagonian landscape in the development and vindication of his ideas about nature and the human self—summarised in Hudson's theory of ‘animism’. Hudson's combination of Darwinian and eugenicist theories of evolution with Argentine-government-inspired ideas of social development are also noted. In conclusion I argue both for the need to pay attention to the sociocultural and historical processes that engender discourses on particular places and natures, as well as the importance of acknowledging dispersion and multivalence within such discursive formations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent work on the history of urbanization in South Africa suggests that the development of urban apartheid policy was influenced by the broader discourses of modernization and planning which guided the morphology of urban areas in the industrial West. Less attention, however, has been given to the ways in which these discourses of modernization served to define and control certain forms of subjectivity within the urban order. Accordingly, in this paper I examine the relationship between urban policy and public discourses about race and space in the city of Durban in the 1940s. In the first part of the paper I argue that the development of urban apartheid was marked by a modernist impulse to define and control the subjects and spaces of the city. This control was fostered by new circuits of power designed to produce racialized working subjects and the orderly and efficient management of urban space. Despite these attempts, however, Indian and African residents created informal spaces on the outskirts of the city, spaces which posed a challenge to the political and economic hegemony of the white settler population. In the second part of the paper, I draw upon Julia Kristeva's notion of abjection to argue that one such space—an area known as Cato Manor—became a repository of larger fears about the changing nature of identity and alterity within the city. These abject fears burst into public consciousness in 1949, after an Indian–African ‘riot’ in Cato Manor called into question the efficacy of the city's attempts to manage the social and spatial contours of urbanization. In response, the city set about enacting policies of formal residential segregation, policies which can be read as attempts to manage the troubling presence of racialized ‘others’ through spatial control. </jats:p>",

In many parts of the industrialised world, forests have essentially become places of consumption (of amenity, recreation, and wildlife observation) by a largely urban population, rather than places of production (of timber) for a largely urban population.

Like other institutions they reflect first of all the comparatively successful attempt to hold together a society fragmented with respect to linguistic and religious diversity along territorial lines. This system is marked by strong territorial decentralization both of taxing powers and expenditure assignments and by low equalizing incidence in general combined with important redistribution in cases of high symbolic value. However, both the internal demographic changes and the pattern of immigration in the last 50 years bring into question the sustainability of the present arrangements. Therefore, federal fiscal equalization is under review. It remains to be seen, if the outcome will sufficiently take into account the new forms of fragmentation in Switzerland. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper comprises two readings of the work of Jean Baudrillard. The first, by Richard Smith, locates itself amid the polarization of debate between Marxism, postmodernism, and poststructuralism, which he claims is both ill-judged and unproductive. In contrast to this standoff Smith argues the case for a ‘transgenic’ or ‘transversal’ post-Marxism by demonstrating that the oft-repeated claims for an ‘epistemological break’ between an early, Marxian Baudrillard and a later, postmodern Baudrillard are not borne out by the evidence. Rather, Smith foregrounds the continuity of Baudrillard's work by highlighting how an antagonistic entwining of the semiotic and the symbolic structures Baudrillard's oeuvre. Crucially, Smith suggests that the possibilities of post-Marxism will only come into clear view once the semiotic logic at the heart of ‘the general political economy of the sign’ is freed from the Utopian mystique of symbolic exchange. In the second series of readings, Marcus Doel engages with the spacing at play with Baudrillard's and Smith's texts in an attempt to demonstrate that they are perpetually turning against themselves. By way of a series of angled, slanted, curvaceous, and suspended readings drawn from Althusser, Baudrillard, Deleuze, Derrida, and Lyotard, Doel deconstructs Smith's post-Marxism in order to affirm the irreducible, aleatory drift of Baudrillard's spiralling texts. </jats:p>",

Over the years complex intergovernmental fiscal arrangements have been developed in order to permit relatively uniform treatment of people living in very different provinces. These arrangements have on the whole been successful in delivering services effectively to a diverse population, but they have more likely perpetuated than reduced regional economic inequality. From a political perspective, the results have been equally mixed. The system has worked in that the country has stayed together, grown respectably, and treated most citizens well and surprisingly uniformly. But the way in which this success has been achieved has reduced Canada's ability as a state to cope with the rapidly changing world environment and may, in the end, have strengthened rather than weakened regional separatism. Despite Canada's considerable success to date in adapting its system of fiscal federalism to cope with both political and economic imperatives, it thus remains unclear how long this fiscal juggling act can be continued without some more basic change in political institutions. </jats:p>",

Daughters had more contact with mothers than with fathers, and children were less likely to see their fathers at least weekly if their mother was no longer alive, indicating a strong gender dimension to intergenerational contact. These associations were observed whether or not proximity, which was very strongly associated with contact, was controlled for in the analysis. Odds of at-least-weekly contact with parents were significantly lower in 1995 than in 1986, but there was no significant difference between 1999 and 1986, and so no clear indication of a trend towards reduced contact. </jats:p>",

Organizations are at different stages in the implementation process ranging from the initial analysis of implementation options, through completed standard implementations and to the sophisticated exploitation of ERP systems using advanced knowledge management, customer relationship management and supply chain management systems. The authors present a maturity model for ERP systems that identifies three stages and this is illustrated using case data selected from the study which is based on 24 organizations in the US and Europe. In Stage 1, organizations are managing legacy systems and starting the ERP project. In Stage 2, implementation is complete and the functionality of the ERP system is being exploited across the organization. In Stage 3, organizations have normalised the ERP system into the organization and are engaged in the process of obtaining strategic value from the system by using additional systems such as customer relationship management, knowledge management and supply chain planning. It is shown that the organizations follow an S-shaped curve, and that most companies are in the middle stage. An analysis of the implications for organizations at each stage of the maturity model is presented which will be of value to practising managers. The implications are categorised as impacts on cost, entropy, complexity, flexibility and strategic competitiveness.</jats:p>",

The simulation results presentations were key ingredients in planning the West of Shetland Block 204 exploration program and in selecting the final development scenario for Horn Mountain.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Deepwater operations are complex and risky endeavors. Specifically, it is very difficult to estimate the impact of the metocean environment (wind, wave and current) on drilling operations. This is particularly important in areas with harsh conditions, as it is essential to understand the magnitude and causes of the risk, in terms of both timing and cost. Modeling using Monte Carlo simulation is a natural tool to help quantify the impact of this type of risk. Though the method has been available for many years, it has not often been applied to operations such as deepwater drilling, but with the availability of fast and very economical computers and the development of convenient simulation software, simulation can now readily be applied to deepwater operations</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>In this paper we discuss the use of this simulation model by ARCO and Vastar (now both merged into BP) to assist in planning and evaluating deepwater drilling programs both West of Shetland and in the Gulf of Mexico. For the West of Shetland operations, simulations were performed to plan the exploration program and to evaluate alternative development options. In the Gulf of Mexico, Vastar recently used the simulation to model alternatives for the Horn Mountain development options.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

More specifically, we query the adequacy of the population-density indicator, which is widely used in statistical formulae such as those by which the British government allocates funding to English local authorities. Our approach is to work through a series of topics, starting with an introductory discussion of the ideas raised by analyses of population distribution, and followed by a section on issues involved in the measurement of settlement patterns. In the third section, we outline the types of public-policy concern which call for statistical indicators of settlement patterns, and then present a set of guidelines for measurements which will be of value in the specific context of British local-government finance-allocation systems. In the next three sections, these guidelines are used to assess the appropriateness of settlement-pattern indicators which are already in use in such systems, in each case moving on to outline an alternative form of measurement designed in the light of weaknesses of current indicators. In the penultimate section, we provide an empirical assessment of the new measures developed here, then in the final section we briefly review the appropriateness of the approach that has been adopted. </jats:p>",

In promoting new working relationships between different state agencies and between the public, private, and voluntary sectors, partnerships have arguably contributed to a reconfiguration of the scalar hierarchy of the state. In this paper we draw on recent debates about the ‘politics of scale’ and on empirical examples from Mid Wales and Shropshire to explore the scalar implications of partnerships. We investigate how discursive constructs of partnership are translated into practice, how official discourses are mediated by local actors, the relationship between partnerships and existing scales of governance, and the particular ‘geometry of power’ being constructed through partnerships. We argue that the existing scalar hierarchy of the state has been influential in structuring the scales and territories of partnerships, and that, despite an apparent devolution of the public face of governance, the state remains crucial in governing the process of governance through partnerships. </jats:p>",

In particular, there is relatively little research on urban sprawl that focuses specifically on measurement and modeling of environmental impacts. The purpose of this paper is twofold: to survey the literature on urban sprawl, with a focus on environmental aspects and to identify a research agenda that might result in a greater number of anaytical tools for academics and practitioners to characterize, monetize, model, and make planning decisions about sprawl. </jats:p>",

The focus of the book on Rassul Galwan's growth through colonial labor, combined with the authenticity imposed on him and his account through a number of textual and editorial devices, allows the book to be read credibly as a text that aids the colonial establishment in utilizing a discourse of Native authenticity in support of a somewhat discredited discourse of benevolent colonial labor relations. We begin by introducing the sociopolitical context within which it was useful for such a book to be published, sponsored and described as authoritative by the colonial establishment. In the second main section, we describe the ways it was a useful authenticating text, arguing that the interplay between Rassul Galwan's narrative and the introductory and editorial comments fulfils three attributes of a convincing piece of ‘Native authenticity’: to identify what the text is meant to authenticate, to establish the author's authenticity as a Native voice in terms acceptable to a Western audience, and to tell the appropriate story in a way that sounds authentic to a Western ear. In the third section we demonstrate that Servant of Sahibs cannot be understood as unproblematically accommodative either to colonial constructions of trans cultural labor relations or to the notion of Native authenticity. Without necessarily crediting Rassul Galwan with intent to resist, we argue that the accommodative text he helped create contains within it a tactical alternative to the very discourses it ostensibly naturalizes. This, we suggest, is characteristic of cultural products of transcultural contact zones, as well as of public transcripts of accommodation more generally. We end the paper by examining briefly (a) the possibility that Rassul Galwan's major theme of growth through colonial labor is informed less by satisfaction with his subservience to colonial masters than by interests only tangentially related to the field of domination which he is ostensibly addressing, and (b) the editor's apparent willingness to include Rassul Galwan's tactical disruptions and thus potentially recuperate those disruptions into colonial discourse. </jats:p>",

Like other episodes in the history of European exploration, from the quest for the North-West passage to the search for the source of the Nile and the races to the North and South Poles, the scramble to reach Timbuctoo was sustained by intense international rivalry and spawned a widespread speculative discourse involving politicians, scientists, scientific patrons, explorers, and journalists. Drawing on recent work on the social history of truth, the author considers how and why different geographical descriptions of Timbuctoo were deemed credible by the scientific communities of London and Paris. Judgments about ‘new’ geographical information were influenced, if not determined, by a complex and shifting rhetoric of adjudication in which moral assessments about the character and status of rival claimants loomed especially large. When the French explorer René Caillié claimed the prize of the Paris Geographical Society as the first explorer to reach and return from Timbuctoo in 1828, his achievements sparked an acrimonious debate between British and French geographers that raised fundamental questions about the purpose of African exploration and the nature of geographical truth. Of central concern were the legitimacy of disguise as an exploratory tactic, and the importance of physical courage and bodily comportment in assessing an explorer's scientific credibility and moral authority. </jats:p>",

The main finding is to establish that ecological associations of various indicators of individual adversity with a census-based indicator of area deprivation are largely, if not entirely, accounted for by individual and household characteristics. For some outcomes there is evidence that social and economic inequalities between more and less disadvantaged individuals are especially marked in more affluent areas, rather than in more deprived areas. This emerges in the form of significant interactions between residence in social housing and ward deprivation in models allowing such interdependence. At the same time, there is evidence of variation in the experience of adverse life events between wards not accounted for by individual and household factors and area deprivation. It is concluded that, although individual characteristics are very important for the differences in social and economic outcomes observed between people, their geographical setting also has some significance. The results have implications for policies aiming to reduce social and economic inequalities </jats:p>",

This paper compares blocking methods based on forest-cover polygons and manually designed harvest units.

Three harvest rules that influence adjacency and the cutting of polygons within a block are applied to each block size distribution to compare forecasts generated by forest-cover and operational blocks. Generally, volume flows from the two methods deviate by less than 5%, and the highest deviations usually occur during the first 20 years. Projected landscape structure, as measured by interior forest area, is also similar under the two blocking methods. The results indicate that forest-cover data provide a reasonable alternative to manual blocking in tactical and strategic plans. This is significant because it removes an important barrier to timely and cost-effective planning, especially for large geographic problems where manual blocking is not an option. </jats:p>",

Since that year, the Autonomous Communities (the intermediate level of government) have strongly increased their role and currently represent around 25% – 30% of total public expenditure. Therefore, financing autonomous government has become a crucial issue with important financial and political consequences. The present system is based mostly on grants from central government, while tax revenues and fiscal accountability are weak. The financing system can play an important, albeit complementary, role in ensuring cohesion within a decentralised state. On the one hand, it can achieve a certain level of equalisation in providing public services all over the territory. On the other hand, it can allow all regions to obtain an appropriate level of self-government. However, it is important to stress that territorial cohesion requires as a precondition, a political consensus and the acceptance of a common project among the different regions. Financial problems can certainly become political problems, but political problems can rarely be solved through financial measures alone. Therefore, we should not demand of intergovernmental finances what they cannot do. </jats:p>",

This has greatly increased the complexity and flexibility of the new space economy for organisations and individuals, and increasingly we have to live in ‘two spaces’. Since the late 1980s researchers have successfully dismissed the misconception about the ‘death of distance’ in the information economy. However, the dissemination of this progress has been slow and fragmented. Utopian views about the ‘end of geography’ remain very influential in current business thinking and in research on information systems and organisational innovations. Numerous failed business applications of information systems have resulted from a lack of geographical considerations. This situation has been significantly exacerbated in the last few years by the rapid developments of the Internet and new applications based on it, such as e-commerce and e-business. Researchers have a duty not only to understand the new geography of the information economy, but also to inform the public about the key features of the ‘two spaces’ that all organisations and individuals have to live in. In this paper, some case studies and emerging business phenomena are used to illustrate the importance of introducing a geographical dimension into research on information systems and organisational innovations. Several new themes for further research are also highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on recent primary research, in this paper I explore the emerging contours of the postcommunist forest-products sector in Bulgaria and, in particular, the ramifications for community-level restructuring in a small, mountainous region located in the southwestern part of the country. After ten years of postcommunist transformation, the current government has only very recently initiated the task of wholesale reform of communist-era structures extant within the forestry and forest-products sectors. This is an unavoidably complex process, involving reorganising tenure over forest resources (with some measure of restitution of formerly private forest resources to precommunist era owners), privatising and decentralising logging and related activities in the woods, redefining the role of the state in oversight, management, and planning, and the development of a supportive institutional context for the growth of, in particular, small and medium-sized private enterprises throughout the forest-products chain. Restructuring of the wood-products sector in one Bulgarian mountain locality is the primary focus of the paper, with a five-fold descriptive typology of wood-processing enterprises proposed. Based in part on manifest differentiations in corporate governance and institutional network orientation (including markets), this typology assists with the analysis of challenges to sustainable local restructuring in resource dependent communities. These models are discussed in turn in terms of both the theoretical implications for Bulgaria's ‘transition model of development’ and the empirical ramifications for regional development and well-being. </jats:p>",

A key area of contention and struggle is likely to occur over the contribution of the RDAs to sustainable development. Although the pursuit of sustainable development is a stated goal of the RDAs, in this paper we argue that this goal is likely to be compromised by tensions and contradictions emerging in the evolving new governance landscape of England. In terms of promoting sustainable-development policy, the regional scale of the UK state is becoming materially and discursively significant, and a particular focus of struggles around economic and environmental issues. These struggles strategically intersect with wider processes of reregulation and rescaling in the UK state. We not only consider the practical policy implications of integrating the economy and environment at the regional scale, but also analyse emerging tensions in regional governance in the light of processes of social reregulation and rescaling within the UK state. We argue that theoretical approaches to the latter need to incorporate the uneven process of rescaling and the contingent nature of regional state forms and institutions. </jats:p>",

The problem formulation and exposure analysis phases are presented in this article; an analysis of effects and risk characterization is presented in a companion article. The intent of this article is threefold: (1) to illustrate the development of a generic framework for the ecological risk assessment of an activity, (2) to show how the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's ecological risk assessment paradigm can be applied to an activity other than the release of a chemical, and (3) to provide guidance for the assessment of ecological risks from low‐altitude aircraft overflights. The key stressor for low‐altitude aircraft overflights is usually sound, although visual and physical (collision) stressors may also be significant. Susceptible and regulated wildlife populations are the major assessment endpoint entities, although plant communities may be impacted by takeoffs and landings. The exposure analysis utilizes measurements of wildlife locations, measurements of sound levels at the wildlife locations, measurements of slant distances from aircraft to wildlife, models that extrapolate sound from the source aircraft to the ground, and bird‐strike probability models. Some of the challenges to conducting a risk assessment for aircraft overflights include prioritizing potential stressors and endpoints, choosing exposure metrics that relate to wildlife responses, obtaining good estimates of sound or distance, and estimating wildlife locations.</jats:p>",

The intervention included the coaching of youths in the application of student-directed planning skills to achieve transition goals, peer-based mentorship and parent support, and in-service education for school transition staff. An independent groups, repeated measures design was used to evaluate the impact of the intervention with 43 youth who experienced diverse disabilities. Results indicated that students in the treatment group demonstrated significant increases in their involvement in transition planning activities, empowerment, transition awareness, and level of participation in transition planning meetings compared with youths in the wait-list or control group. Implications of these findings are discussed and the need for additional research emphasized. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article describes the different phases of the development and implementation of the Videotaped Addiction Challenge Tool (VACT, initially termed the Video Addiction Challenge Test). This instrument employs a video depicting the `average life‐story' of a resident of a Therapeutic Community for substance abusers. The video film is used as a clinical method for assessment and individual treatment planning, and as a research instrument that gives care‐givers a deeper insight into the residents' personal characteristics and treatment requirements at any given moment in the Therapeutic Community.</jats:p><jats:p>The article reports the results of administering the VACT to 38 residents (31 male and 7 female) at the De Kiem Therapeutic Community in Belgium. Detailed description of the procedure and its principles assures reliability and makes accurate reproduction possible. The validity of the instrument was tested by comparing, characteristic by characteristic, the results of the VACT, life‐story and social anamnesis. The correspondence between the VACT and the life‐story was 94% and between the VACT and the social anamnesis, 98%. The VACT has also contributed new information not measured by other instruments. Content analysis of this information shows that TC residents are characterised by negative communication between parents, negative communication with father, an unhappy childhood, child maltreatment or abuse, and relational problems due to drug abuse. Residents reported feelings of inferiority and suicidal thoughts and/or suicide attempts. Many new residents also reported sexually related problems such as abortion, sexual abuse, prostitution and shyness. There were no specific female problems; men reported sexual abuse as often as women. The implementation of this new instrument leads to a more methodical approach. It is, however, also more time‐consuming and can be a problem for staff who tend to give priority to immediate action and direct problem‐solving.</jats:p>",
