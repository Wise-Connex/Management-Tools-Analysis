      "abstract": "<jats:p> The issue of public participation in the planning process can be examined from the vantage point of the general ideological antecedents of planning ideas. Unfortunately, participation studies usually avoid the issue of ideology and planners tend to be unaware of or unwilling to acknowledge the role of ideology in planning practice. Even though the importance of ideology in Israel's development is often mentioned, studies of Israeli planning seldom include ideology in their models. This is true even for studies looking in particular at participation. In this paper several orientations towards the theme of participation, set within the Israeli context, are looked at. The orientations suggested as characteristic of the Israeli pattern of development are: Ad-hocism, clientelism, populism and kibbutz democracy. The ideological origins of these orientations are traced relative to the three major political camps. Next, these orientations are compared with the theoretical positions and prospects for ideological change. The aim in this paper is to help clarify some basic conceptual issues that may help in improving the professional contact between planner and public and perhaps provide the planner with some self-awareness and sense of responsibility. </jats:p>",

Particular attention is paid to the ideological and political dimensions, and their changes, as guided by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which accompany the need to modernize China's underdeveloped economy. In part 1 of the paper the interpretations of the urban question, within the Marxist–Maoist school of thought, upon which the policy rationales and justifications are based, are outlined. Then, a two-part historical–contextual analysis of the regional policy and its development in China with a tentative schema is provided, that focuses on so-called ‘town–country’ contradictions and processes of urbanization and other spatial issues. Part 4 is a synthesis of the development pattern including a discussion of the underlying dynamics. The paper ends with remarks on the reemergence of ideological–political struggles within and beyond the party, and its repercussions for the urban question in the coming decade. </jats:p>",

It is based on solving an aggregate problem, which is of moderate size, at higher levels of derision. The results obtained lead to land allocations and input-output targets for the different zones of the forest. At a lower level of decision, based on the land allocation and input-output targets, each zone is modeled in a detailed way. These problems are again of moderate size. Consistency between the two levels of derision is preserved. The economic and algorithmic implications of this methodology approach are discussed. A test case is presented to show the feasibility of this approach. For. Sci 37(2):439-460.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper six attempts to periodise economic life are distinguished—those due to Gibson and Horvath, Kleinknecht, Lash and Urry, Lipietz, Mandel, and Piore and Sabel. The aspects of the economy that they analyse, the type of period they describe, the spaces associated with the periods, and the processes of transition are contrasted. The theories differently explain the economic slowdown of the 1970s and 1980s, and crucial distinctions are: whether the productivity slowdown is a cause or a consequence, what factors determine changes in profitability, and the role of newly industrialising countries. It is argued that recent phases in economic life can more accurately be interpreted as waves or cycles than as periods. The paper concludes with an assessment of the capacities of the theories to incorporate a role for space and to interpret the contemporary transition. </jats:p>",

The empirical study reported here suggests that while many practitioners apparently aspire to use this model, few use it as prescribed. In particular, few firms included specific action programmes for the marketing mix or any forecasts of competitors’strategies. At the individual firm level there was also some mismatch between the contents of the plan and the intended benefits of planning. Whether or not they produced an explicit annual marketing plan, most firms’planning behaviour consisted mainly of extensive budgeting combined with limited strategic analysis. The main thesis is that the standard model of marketing planning aims to achieve too much and may even be counter‐productive as well as time‐wasting and energy‐sapping. A simpler and more action orientated model is proposed.</jats:p>",

Two different types of gentrification are distinguished, one the work of the property developer, the other the outcome of the localised collective behaviour of households. Existing accounts of gentrification are criticised for their lack of explanatory value. It is argued that gentrification is unlikely to be founded in the distinctive behaviour of particular fractions of the middle class, because their cultural practices are weakly constrained. Rather it is the ways in which women adapt to new patterns of employment that provide the most plausible explanation of the origins of the process. </jats:p>",

Multinational involvement in the acute hospital sector and in the provision of ancillary services is discussed, and attempts are made to relate this to wider processes and patterns of uneven development in the United Kingdom. It is argued that, despite the high profile of multinationals, their actual impact is still relatively limited, but in the long term the qualitative effects on the way health care is delivered will be of greater significance. </jats:p>",

The model, which runs on a microcomputer, incorporates a demand-forecasting facility by patient category. Alternative care options can be specified for each patient category. For any given set of categories, forecasts, and care options, AIDSPLAN produces estimates of resource and cost requirements and can also produce a variety of aggregated or disaggregated summaries.

In this paper the theoretical rationale, empirical evidence, and implications of utilizing the private sector to deliver government services are examined. In addition, the ‘tools-of-government-action’ idea and the challenges it poses for public management and privatization proponents are looked at. The paper is concluded by the suggestion that a serious rethinking of conventional wisdom surrounding public management be undertaken and by a review of the issues raised by these alternative arrangements in terms of the standards of efficiency, equity, accountability, and authority. </jats:p>",

From the mid-1960s there have been wide-ranging changes in flows of international finance through the City's financial markets. Despite these outside changes the City remained almost spatially intact. Through a distinctive social power, built on generational layers of ‘invented traditions’ and an interpretation of ‘Englishness’, the City has been able temporally and spatially to regulate incoming financial capitals to the trading mores of the ‘Square Mile’. In this way the City has been able to innovate its way through change in international financial markets. Yet to ensure its survival in the financial league tables of the late 1980s and beyond, not only did the City have to deregulate its securities markets, it had to deregulate its social space. Informed through an understanding of the gender and class composition of the City, this paper is an attempt to capture this social and spatial transition. </jats:p>",

Past approaches fall into three categories: optimization formulations of idealized situations, heuristic approaches, or practical guidelines and ad hoc procedures reflecting the professional judgement and practical experience of transit planners. We discuss the sources of complexity of the TNDP as well as the shortcomings of the previous approaches. This discussion motivates the need for AI search techniques that implement the existing designer's knowledge and expertise to achieve better solutions efficiently. Then we propose a hybrid solution approach that incorporates the knowledge and expertise of transit network planners and implements efficient search techniques using AI tools, algorithmic procedures developed by others, and modules for tools implemented in conventional languages. The three major components of the solution approach are presented, namely, the lisp‐implemented route generation design algorithm (RGA), the analysis procedure TRUST (Transit Route Analyst), and the route improvement algorithm (RIA).

Decommissioning of its CANDU nuclear stations will begin about 2012 when the first station at Pickering is scheduled to be shut down after an operating period of 40 years. Other stations at Bruce and Darlington will be shut down and decommissioned subsequently. The cost of these operations is being charged to customers and is calculated using the annuity method. In this chapter, Nihal Jayawardene and Peter Stevens-Guille describe Ontario Hydro’s decommissioning policy, financial planning and method of funding future decommissioning costs. One policy requirement is that future generations should not have to pay for decommissioning costs; deferring costs far into the future is not financially prudent. The current status of public opinion in Canada on decommissioning and radioactive waste management, including the tourism value of a decommissioned reactor, also is discussed. </jats:p>",

This system of regional economies overlays the political geography of the nation but does not correspond to national boundaries, just as metropolitan economic regions do not correspond to state or local political boundaries. Policymaking thus confronts two major but noncongruent systems: Economic federalism and political federalism. Noncongruence constitutes a major obstacle to economic policymaking and implementation. A political economy of these two federalisms is needed to fuse politics and policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years a series of persuasive arguments have been developed that describe the growth of new industrial spaces. This new geography of production is seen to stem from the attempts of companies to respond to a new, more flexible, marketplace by becoming more vertically disintegrated through a reliance on a series of dense transactional supply and innovation linkages with spatially proximate firms. To date, much of the debate about these processes has rested on an empirical base which is rather limited in both its spatial and sectoral coverage. In this paper the debate is added to through reference to a recent survey of the UK high-fidelity audio sector. The impact of changing market demand and competitive pressures on the sector is outlined. The responses of firms to these pressures have resulted in a series of changes to corporate organisational structures. These changes are presented in the form of a broad-based sectoral analysis. In the concluding sections of the paper the possible spatial ramifications of the findings are dealt with. It is shown that many recent theoretical assertions do not accurately describe and predict the processes of change presently characterising the sector. </jats:p>",

The incremental aspects of innovation are defined and, with use of Canadian examples, situations are identified in which policy interventions may be justified because of unmet goals of national (or regional) industrial performance and because of knowledge-market imperfections encountered by small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). Use is made of the concept of transaction costs to explain the problems some SMEs encounter in being innovative. Survey evidence confirms the theoretical arguments: Some successful SMEs establish input linkages with specialists but many more are impeded from establishing relevant contacts with consultants in the public and private producer services and with other manufacturers. The geographic and policy problem, therefore, becomes one of designing networks to assist the development of superior information connections by SMEs. The principles for policy design are discussed in the light of the theory used to identify market imperfections. </jats:p>",

In this study nursing student's attitudes towards abortion and family planning in Italy and Sweden are described, to identify general characteristics of students that could be of interest to compare and to identify reasons for approval and/or disapproval of abortion. Some social characteristics of the students are similar, like fathers' profession/activity. Italian nursing students are more religious. Some factual knowledge is low in both samples. The nursing student's feelings, attitudes towards abortion are expressed differently in the countries. Many Italian students believe abortion is justified only on medical grounds, Swedish students indicate psychological effects as the most likely consequence both for woman and for man.</jats:p>",

It is applied to the lifetime unemployment histories of a sample of men in Northern Ireland who were aged between eighteen and sixty-five during August 1973. With controls for other factors, it was found that the probability of reemployment was generally lower for Catholics than Methodists and members of the Church of Ireland, but it was not markedly lower than for Presbyterians.

In case studies of the impact of the scheme on two local labour markets, Preston and Crewe, links are established between patterns of colonisation by YTS and (1) the nature of the preexisting training institutions, and (2) the state of the local labour market. YTS is shown to be bringing about far-reaching consequences for the process of skill formation and for patterns of labour-market segmentation. </jats:p>",

Monitoring programs in support of contaminant modeling of large waterbodies, such as for Green Bay, are expensive and their extent is often limited by budget limitations, laboratory capacity, and logistic constraints. Therefore, it is imperative that available resources be used in the most efficient manner possible. This use, or allocation of resources, may be aided through the application of readily available models in the planning stages of projects.</jats:p><jats:p>To aid in the planning effort for the Green Bay project, a workshop was held and studies designed to aid in the allocation of resources for a year‐long intensive field study. Physical/chemical and food chain models were applied using historical data to aid in project planning by identifying processes having the greatest impact on the predictive capability of mass balance models. Studies were also conducted to estimate errors in computed tributary loadings and in‐Bay concentrations and contaminant mass associated with different sampling strategies. The studies contributed to the overall project design, which was a collaborative effort with many participants involved in budgeting, field data collection, analysis, processing of data, quality assurance, data management and modeling activities.</jats:p>",
