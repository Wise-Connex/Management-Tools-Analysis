      "abstract": "<jats:p>Instructional design models address important issues of learning, content, and context during the development of instruction. The prescriptive premise behind instructional design is that if an instructional design is followed, the learning outcomes identified in the design will occur. As one evaluates the extent to which learners achieve learning outcomes, changes in the instructional design may be warranted. Documenting these changes provides designers and users of the model with feedback on its efficiency and effectiveness. Despite these attributes, the merits of instructional design have not been achieved in some settings, and some users, including teachers and product developers, are looking elsewhere for instructional development guidance. But should they? The premise of this chapter is to propose a scenario-based ID model that addresses a major shortcoming of instructional design; namely, the gap between formative design decisions and design review. Scenarios are used to keep people designing, reflecting, redesigning. </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Simulation may be the most practical way to assess the risk of systems with complex behaviors such as those that include hardware, software and human elements. However, since under normal design conditions human-designed systems generally perform in familiar and expected ways, a typical simulation will frequently lead to known and anticipated results. As such, the simulation program wastes a lot of time on familiar results without generating new knowledge about the system’s vulnerabilities. In order to increase our knowledge of risk, it would be preferable to push the system toward its limits to test the system’s ability to handle more difficult situations. Such an approach can help system designers to better understand risky situations and close the vulnerability gaps in their design. The primary objective of this study is to develop a risk simulation Planner (SimpraPlan) which generates scenarios that can explore the system’s vulnerabilities and offer a superior assessment of the risks involved. The Planner uses high level engineering knowledge (including the functional requirements and physical structure of the system) to generate scenarios that can exploit the system’s vulnerabilities. In this paper, the scenario generation process is explained in detail and scenarios generated by the SimpraPlan are compared with those generated by classical approaches to risk assessment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Inflation has been the leading early universe scenario for two decades, and has become an accepted element of the successful `cosmic concordance' model. However, there are many puzzling features of the resulting theory. It requires both high energy and low energy inflation, with energy densities differing by a hundred orders of magnitude. The questions of why the universe started out undergoing high energy inflation, and why it will end up in low energy inflation, are unanswered. Rather than resort to anthropic arguments, we have developed an alternative cosmology, the cyclic universe, in which the universe exists in a very long-lived attractor state determined by the laws of physics. The model shares inflation's phenomenological successes <jats:italic>without</jats:italic> requiring an epoch of high energy inflation. Instead, the universe is made homogeneous and flat, and scale-invariant adiabatic perturbations are generated during an epoch of low energy acceleration like that seen today, but preceding the last big bang. Unlike inflation, the model <jats:italic>requires</jats:italic> low energy acceleration in order for a periodic attractor state to exist. The key challenge facing the scenario is that of passing through the cosmic singularity at <jats:italic>t</jats:italic> = 0. Substantial progress has been made at the level of linearised gravity, which is reviewed here. The challenge of extending this to nonlinear gravity and string theory remains.</jats:p>",

The statement does not imply non-availability of good faculties; but the available resources are very less to their commensurate requirement. Since the ‘Business Education’ has been transformed in a “dream-selling profitable business”, the proprietors of such business organizations are always effortful to maximize their profit. They avoid appointing full-time faculties. Barring a few, BEIs are not adopting any mechanism to evaluate the performances. Dynamic courses offering institutions are very few. Most of the business education institutions offer traditional courses i.e. marketing management, financial management, corporate accounting, etc. In many cases, BEIs themselves are very much reluctant in making efforts for good liaison with industries and business world in the wake of practical exposure. Placement is a crucial component of management education. The Universities do not give any consideration to placements. The AICTE recognized institutes, barring a few, toe the university line. Most of the AICTE recognized institutes are not able to offer jobs to all their students. Looking to the prevailing poor condition of the business education system, an altogether new business education system is required to be evolved.

It is suggested that despite the greater degree of volatility, both markets appear set to remain at higher price levels for the foreseeable future. While oil prices are likely to recede from the recent very high levels experienced in 2004, North American natural gas prices are likely to remain much higher than the prices experienced prior to 2000 and higher relative to oil prices. It is argued that the emerging price dynamic between oil and natural gas in North America will reshape the demand for oil and gas and potentially have an important impact on the future energy market in the USA. Implications for the agricultural industry are also briefly discussed.</p>"

Whereas the code model supplied the notion of equivalence as the standard by which a translation was evaluated, the linguistic theory supplied what was regarded as the minimal unit of translation. Accordingly, as linguistic theories were formulated to account for increasingly larger units of text, translation models were redesigned so that the notion of equivalence mirrored the size of these linguistic units. Ultimately, the notion of equivalence became so broad that attempts to achieve it were regarded as illusionary. The result was a Kuhnian revolution of sorts, with two claimants: relevance theory and cognitive linguistics. The remainder of the paper highlights how recent insights of cognitive linguistics are important in the translation praxis.</jats:p>"

This industry has long been regulated by consecutive international agreements such as Multi Fiber Arrangement (MFA), which is scheduled to be phased out by 2005. Thje dismantling of MFA (quota) regime seems to bring more threats to developing countries. Emerging issues related to environmental and social compliance (e.g. minimum legal wage, employee’s work life, health), technology requirements etc. have been brought into surface by the importing countries fiz. developed countries. Although it is too early to predict, the adverse effect has been felt by India since the beginning of MFA phase out. The aim of this study is to assess the understanding and responses of the garment exporters in India towards the emerging issues. Factor analysis was used in this analysis. Construct validity and sample adequacy were performed using KMO value. Six factors have emerged from the analysis. On the basis of these six factors, the perceptions of the importers in India were also analyzed and subsequently compared the same with the exporters’ perception. Under Radar Diagram the results of the difference have been analyzed.</jats:p>",

Assessing this environment provides insight into the unique changes, the implications these changes have on a firm's strategies, and the creation of special techniques required to understand them. One of these special techniques is scenario planning. Any study of the relationship between strategy, environment and performance must include variables that involve business scope and resource commitments.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A review of the research literature on the use and benefits of both the traditional approaches and the scenario approach to constructing the future strategy of a firm in a changing environment is undertaken.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results suggest that a better understanding of the performance of firms within a changed environment can be achieved using the combination of a PESTEL analysis, internal resource analysis and the use of scenarios.

We assume that the collapse of a massive cloud leads to the formation of first stars. Their winds and terminal supernova explosions create a standing, small radius, cold and dense shell, where the next stars form. The shell is in steady state location, which is due to a detailed balance established between the ram pressure from the collapsing cloud, the gravitational force exerted on the shell and the ram pressure of the stellar wind from the forming cluster. In this contribution we show that the standing shell remains stable against Rayleigh -Taylor instability, and discuss future prospects of this work.</jats:p>"

In this article we conduct a scenario analysis of how lifestyle changes and other major developments might affect water resources.</jats:p><jats:p>China has the longest tradition in river and water resource management in the world. Its civilization has sought to control the effects of floods and drought for thousands of years and has utilized water flows for irrigation and navigation. In the last century, competing uses such as domestic, municipal, and industrial water consumption have also become reasons for the regulation of and large‐scale abstraction of water.</jats:p><jats:p>To investigate the major changes in economy and society and their effects on the water situation in China, a set of scenarios is developed and analyzed within a structural economics framework. A hydrological model that represents water flows in the major watersheds is linked to a regional input‐output model that represents socioeconomic activities in the major economic‐administrative regions of China. The regional analysis shows that the North and Northwest regions are water‐scarce and that lifestyle changes and technical shifts are the most important factors driving future water consumption.</jats:p>",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of pulse exposures of a pyrethroid insecticide, esfenvalerate, on survival, development, and reproduction of the midge, Chironomus riparius. The first experiment was designed to simulate the exposure of settling larvae to a waterborne pulse of esfenvalerate. A second experiment simulated exposure of larvae entering a sediment that had been exposed previously to a waterborne pulse of esfenvalerate. A third experiment simulated exposure of sediment-inhabiting larval populations to a waterborne pulse of esfenvalerate and examined whether population density influenced the response of C. riparius. Our results indicate that even very brief (i.e., 1-h) exposures to environmentally realistic concentrations of esfenvalerate during early larval life can have measurable effects on larval survival and developmental rates. For those individuals that survived a pulse exposure early in life, however, there appeared to be no lasting effects of esfenvalerate on their subsequent egg laying or egg viability. Thus, brief exposure to environmentally realistic concentrations of pesticides can have measurable effects on freshwater invertebrate populations, but whether such effects occur depends on the details of the exposure regime. In addition, population density may influence the responses of life-cycle traits and, thereby, population-level impacts of pesticides.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nScenario planning was used to identify issues and drivers of change that are relevant to community efforts to improve regional prospects in the Western Australian Wheatbelt. The region, some 20 million hectares in area, is under pressure to respond to a variety of environmental (salinity, erosion, acidification, biodiversity decline), economic (declining agricultural terms of trade), and social forces (rural decline, isolation). Regional strategic plans have been increasingly seen as the means of achieving sustainability in the face of these challenges, but until recently typically had single-activity outlook and timeframes of up to a decade into the future. Systematic futures-based research has been used in various regions to avoid reliance on business-as-usual as the default strategy, and to identify opportunities and challenges not presently apparent. The Avon River Basin, the central region of the Wheatbelt, was selected as the geographic focus of the project, and the time horizon was set at 2050. The project was developed by a group of 50 stakeholders from the basin, with expertise and strategic interests across a wide range of economic, social, and environmental themes. Through a series of workshops the stakeholders identified critical issues and their attendant drivers, then documented relevant past trends. Four regional scenarios, Saline Growth, Grain and Drain, Landcare Bounty, and Harmony with Prosperity, were developed based on positive and negative combinations of 2 clusters of uncertain and important drivers: environmental change and access to new markets. Common opportunities, threats, and critical success factors for the Avon River Basin region out to 2050 were also identified. We also found that the stakeholders have a tendency to strive for positive outcomes despite negative initial conditions. This resulted in 4 scenarios that were superficially similar due to the regional scale of analysis and the continuation of agricultural industries as significant shapers of economy, society, and environment. However, each scenario represents profoundly different outcomes for the residents and communities of the Avon River Basin in 2050. The triple-bottom line outcomes for the Avon River Basin in 2050 were estimated to be in the range 4.9–9.7 Mt of wheat (currently 4.0), 46 000–66 000 people (currently 43 000), and 10–30% of farmland salinised (currently 6). The application of these results to other regions in Australia is discussed.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An attempt has been made in this study to assess drought scenario in the Vidarbha region utilizing long period (1901–1996) monsoon rainfall (June-September) data of the region. The analysis reveals that in Vidarbha drought may occur once in every six years. The probability of its occurrence for the two consecutive years is hardly 2% while that for the three consecutive years does not exist at all. During the drought years the region receives average seasonal rainfall of 64.8 cm, 30% less than the normal rainfall, while rainfall in the years prior to and succeeding the drought years is found to be 5–7% more than the normal rainfall. August is found to be the most dependable month during drought years associated with El nino as well as Enso, while September happens to be the worst month with −50% rainfall departure during the drought years associated with El nino. In good monsoon years, in spite of El nino, June happens to be the worst month with a rainfall departure of −27%. Despite reasonably high inter-annual variability, monsoon rainfall over the region has periodicities ranging from 6 to 24 years. Of great interest are the oscillations, which approximately are analogous to double sunspot cycle. Planners/farmers are interested to know the prospects of seasonal rainfall as the monsoon advances, particularly so during the initial period of the monsoon season. Study on this aspect reveals that when June rainfall is below normal there are 37% chances that the season too will receive below normal rainfall; this probability increases to 50% if cumulative rainfall till July end is below normal. Cumulative rainfall till August end generally foretells the possible seasonal rainfall pattern over the region. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\n\t\t\t\tA spatially explicit state and transition model for assessing the interactive effects of grazing, fire and climate on carbon dynamics in Australian savannas is described. The model runs on a yearly time step. It is based on a sequential treatment of events within each year, involving, in order, growth of biomass, consumption of biomass by livestock and burning of the remaining fuel (growth minus consumption). The major drivers are 113 years of annual rainfall data, annual modelled rangeland growth, synthetic fire incidence and timing data, and data describing stocking rates in dry sheep equivalents. Baseline carbon stocks are derived from pre-settlement estimates from the VAST steady-state carbon model. State and transition models for nine vegetation zones define vegetation condition and consequent carbon stock. Change is mediated by key indices of driver variables such as grazing, growth and fire, a series of parameters and default thresholds, and a set of rules. The model is run for three 113-year spin-up cycles to establish a set of initial condition grids that represent a plausible synthetic current state. Sensitivity analyses on selected parameters and index thresholds showed that fire and growth thresholds were most important for woodland zones, and utilisation rates and degradation and recovery periods were most important for grassland zones. The model was used to examine a series of scenarios involving changes to grazing pressure and suppression of fire for different climate sequences. Changes to a few parameters enabled simulation of low and high levels of encroachment of woody weeds, and hence carbon accumulation, in the Astrebla (Mitchell) grasslands; and effective capture of the climate-induced variation in grassland condition, and hence potential for soil carbon loss, within Heteropogon spp.-dominated grasslands in northern Queensland. The scenario results suggest that this simple state and transition model with an annual time step provides a potentially useful and flexible scenario model framework for exploration of vegetation and consequent carbon dynamics of the Australian tropical savanna region.\n\t\t\t</jats:p>"
