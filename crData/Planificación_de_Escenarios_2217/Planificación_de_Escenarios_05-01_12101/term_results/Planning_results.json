The chapter introduces constraint satisfaction technology with emphasis on its applications in planning and scheduling. It gives a brief survey of constraint satisfaction in general, including a description of mainstream solving techniques, that is, constraint propagation combined with search. Then, it focuses on specific time and resource constraints and on search techniques and heuristics useful in planning and scheduling. Last but not least, the basic approaches to constraint modelling for planning and scheduling problems are presented.</jats:p>"

Modern planning domain description languages are based on sentential representations. Sentential formalisms produce problem encodings that often lead the system to carry out large amounts of superfluous operations, causing a loss in performance. This chapter illustrates how techniques from the area of knowledge representation and reasoning (in particular, analogical representations) can be adopted to develop more efficient domain description languages. Although often more efficient, analogical representations are generally less expressive than sentential ones. A framework for planning with hybrid representations is thus proposed, in which sentential and analogical descriptions can be integrated and used interchangeably, thereby overcoming the limitations and exploiting the advantages of both paradigms.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter discusses the application of intelligent planning techniques to virtual agent environments as a mechanism to control and generate plausible virtual agent behaviour. The authors argue that the real world-like nature of intelligent virtual environments (IVEs) presents issues that cannot be tackled with a classic, off-line planner where planning takes place beforehand and execution is performed later, based on a set of precompiled instructions. What IVEs call for is continuous planning, a generative system that will work in parallel with execution, constantly re-evaluating world knowledge and adjusting plans according to new data. The authors argue further on the importance of incorporating the modelling of the agents’ physical, mental and emotional states as an inherent feature in a continuous planning system targeted towards IVEs, necessary to achieve plausibility in the produced plans and, consequently, in agent behaviour.</jats:p>"

It has been widely acknowledged that modern intelligent agents approaches should combine methodologies, techniques and architectures from many areas of computer science, cognitive science, operation research, cybernetics, and so forth. AI planning is an essential function of intelligence that is necessary in intelligent agents applications. This chapter presents the current state-of-the-art in the field of intelligent agents, focusing on the role of AI planning techniques. It sketches a typical classification of agents, agent theories and architectures from an AI planning perspective, it briefly introduces the reader to the basic issues of AI planning, and it presents different AI planning methodologies implemented in intelligent agents applications. The authors aim at stimulating research interest towards the integration of AI planning with intelligent agents.</jats:p>"

It presents two different adaptive systems that set the planning parameters of a highly adjustable planner based on measurable characteristics of the problem instance. The planners have acquired their knowledge from a large data set produced by results from experiments on many problems from various domains. The first planner is a rule-based system that employs propositional rule learning to induce knowledge that suggests effective configuration of planning parameters based on the problem’s characteristics. The second planner employs instance-based learning in order to find problems with similar structure and adopt the planner configuration that has proved in the past to be effective on these problems. The validity of the two adaptive systems is assessed through experimental results that demonstrate the boost in performance in problems of both known and unknown domains. Comparative experimental results for the two planning systems are presented along with a discussion of their advantages and disadvantages.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This chapter proposes to model a planning problem (e.g., the control of a satellite system) by identifying a set of relevant components in the domain (e.g., communication channels, on-board memory or batteries), which need to be controlled to obtain a desired temporal behavior. The domain model is enriched with the description of relevant constraints with respect to possible concurrency, temporal limits and scarce resource availability. The paper proposes a planning framework based on this view that relies on a formalization of the problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and defines an algorithmic template in which the integration of planning and scheduling is a fundamental feature. In addition, the paper describes the current implementation of a constraint-based planner called OMP that is grounded on these ideas and shows the role constraints have in this planner, both at domain description level and as a guide for problem solving.</jats:p>"

Techniques for multi-agent planning differ from conventional planning in that planning activities are distributed and the planning autonomy of the agents must be respected. We focus on approaches to coordinate the multi-agent planning process. While usually coordination is intertwined with the planning process, we distinguish a number of separate phases in the planning process to get a clear view on the different role(s) of coordination. In particular, we discuss the pre-planning coordination phase and post-planning coordination phase. In the pre-planning part, we view coordination as the process of managing (sub) task dependencies and we discuss a method that ensures complete planning autonomy by introducing additional (intra-agent) dependencies. In the post-planning part, we will show how agents can improve their plans through the exchange of resources. We present a plan merging algorithm that uses these resources to reduce the costs of independently developed plans. This (any-time) algorithm runs in polynomial time.</jats:p>"

Rooted in the area of Knowledge Representation &amp; Reasoning, action languages like K allow the formalization of complex planning problems involving non-determinism and incomplete knowledge in a very flexible manner. By giving an overview of existing planning languages and comparing these against our language, we aim on further promoting the applicability and usefulness of high-level action languages in the area of planning. As opposed to previously existing languages for modeling actions and change, K adopts a logic programming view where fluents representing the epistemic state of an agent might be true, false or undefined in each state. We will show that this view of knowledge states can be fruitfully applied to several well-known planning domains from the literature as well as novel planning domains. Remarkably, K often allows to model problems more concisely than previous action languages. All the examples given can be tested in an available implementation, the DLVK planning system.</jats:p>"

However, the management orientation of planned shopping centres has been described as property‐ rather than customer‐led. This article considers the role of marketing for planned shopping centres, with particular reference to regional shopping centres (RSCs). The emphasis of marketing activity in this context is primarily promotional, and the process by which promotional activities are planned and implemented by RSCs is considered and contrasted with Fill's model of the marketing communications planning process.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>Semi‐structured interviews were undertaken with marketing managers in four of the nine RSCs in the UK (two interviews were face‐to‐face, one interview was by telephone and one interview was via e‐mail). These exploratory interviews sought to identify: respondents’ perceptions of marketing and the role of the marketing function within the organisation; the nature of the marketing/promotional objectives that were set; the identity of the target audiences for marketing/promotional activity; the process by which this activity was planned; and the specific marketing/promotional tools used. All the interviews were analysed using the template analysis technique.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>Findings are reported under the following headings: role of marketing; perceptions of marketing; marketing planning; target audiences/objectives; promotional activities; and evaluation.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Research limitations/implications</jats:title><jats:p>This research is exploratory, comprising four interviews (however, there are only nine RSCs in the UK). More detailed research into the processes of marketing communications planning in this context should be implemented.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Practical implications</jats:title><jats:p>This paper shows how general models relating to theoretical aspects of marketing (in this case marketing communications planning), may need to be amended to reflect the practical reality of specific market contexts and the discussion section of the paper outlines this in more detail.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Following on from the above point, the paper provides a framework for marketing communications planning in the specific context of RSCs in the UK. As such, it has resonance for the practice of marketing in all planned retail developments.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

This reduces the distinction between the phases of planning and acting and promotes ownership and involvement in the tourism strategy. Because of this, both the ethnographic research process and the data it generates are complimentary components of community‐based tourism planning. Also discussed are some common issues that arise in heritage tourism planning, such as conflicting stakeholder desires for resources, community frustration or exhaustion with the planning process, and mixed definitions of the concept of “heritage.”</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A woman’s fertility can return quickly following an abortion or miscarriage, yet recent data show high levels of unmet need for family planning (FP) among women who have been treated for incomplete abortion. This leaves many women at risk of another unintended pregnancy and in some cases subsequent repeated abortions and abortion-related complications. It is thus vital for programs to provide a comprehensive package of postabortion care (PAC) services that includes medical treatment, FP counseling and services, and other reproductive health services such as evaluation and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, HIV counseling and/or testing, and community support and mobilization. Providing FP services within PAC benefits clients and programs. Facilities that can effectively treat women with incomplete abortions can also provide contraceptive services, including counseling and appropriate methods. As stated in this brief, any provider who can treat incomplete abortion can also provide selected FP methods. Clients, providers, and programs benefit when FP methods are provided to postabortion clients at the time of treatment.</jats:p>"

There are, however, many myths as to the extent genetic research will change medical practice and services in the near future. At present, there would appear to be little ‘on the ground’ effect by genetic research on general psychiatric services, and even less on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). The role of an evidence-based approach in CAMHS has been highlighted (Williams 2000) but the application can be difficult (Ramchandini et al. 2001; Harrington 2001).

This article presents a model reflecting the evolution of ICT planning maturity in schools and identifies the factors that influence and characterize integration between ICT planning and educational strategy. The model suggests a common evolutionary pathway for ICT planning in schools and provides a foundation on which to propose a “stages of growth” model for characterizing and evaluating ICT planning in these settings. </jats:p>"

It was the Dutch administrative court that enforced the air quality standards in the Netherlands by ruling that the limit values are absolute standards to be applied at all levels of decision-making. Faced with the consequences of this interpretation the Dutch government tried to soften the economic and social effects of the court's policy. This analysis of the debate that followed illustrates the two opposing approaches. The first approach is to interpret EC air quality standards literally, meaning that the limit values have to be applied by all competent authorities. Those supporting the second approach argue that the limit values must be attained, in the first place, by national measures dealing with the sources of pollution, making use of technical solutions. The Dutch government has shifted slightly from the first to the second approach, as is clear from the Air Quality Order of 2005. However, it remains doubtful whether this will be sufficient to lift the current deadlock on infrastructure projects and attain the environmental limit values.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Governments in developing countries recognize the need for appropriate technology for the treatment of emergencies from incomplete abortion or miscarriage. Numerous studies have investigated the appropriateness of an integrated model of postabortion care (PAC) that includes three essential elements: emergency treatment for spontaneous or induced abortion; counseling and family planning services; and links to other reproductive health services. Many integrated PAC services include replacement of the conventional clinical treatment, sharp curettage (SC), with manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). In 1997 and 1999 the Population Council supported intervention studies in Mexico and Bolivia, respectively, to assess PAC programs in terms of safety, effectiveness, quality of care, cost, and subsequent contraceptive use by clients. Both interventions introduced integrated PAC services and compared the outcomes of MVA and SC use in large public hospitals. To assess changes in service quality and costs, researchers analyzed clinical records and interviewed clients and providers before and after the interventions. As noted in this summary, SC and MVA are equally safe and effective and can be provided on an outpatient basis. Integrating clinical treatment with family planning counseling and services increased clients’ knowledge and contraceptive use.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;em&gt;Abstract.&lt;/em&gt;—The lower American River, located in Sacramento County, California, provides important habitat, a high-quality water source, a critical floodway, and a spectacular regional recreational parkway. It is also a key water source for the Central Valley Project, which provides irrigation water to 3 million acres of the country’s most productive agricultural lands. The river supports 43 species of native and nonnative fish, including fall-run Chinook salmon &lt;em&gt;Oncorhynchus tshawytscha &lt;/em&gt;and steelhead &lt;em&gt;O. mykiss&lt;/em&gt;. In the last decade, one quarter of all fall-run Chinook salmon produced in California’s Central Valley have come from the American River. The Sacramento region’s population is expected to double to more than 2 million people in the next 30 years. Water demand to meet population growth will cause additional stress on a river system that currently experiences low flow and high temperatures during critical salmonid spawning and rearing life stages. Increased demand for American River water outside the region will contribute to higher fall river water temperatures and more frequent fluctuating flows that result in stranding and/or isolation of fish. In 1993, regional stakeholders decided that new methods were needed to avoid water shortages, environmental degradation, groundwater contamination, and limits to economic prosperity. Consequently, they created the Water Forum. After 6 years of intense, interest-based negotiations, 40 stakeholder organizations approved the comprehensive Water Forum Agreement in 2000. The agreement allows the region to meet its needs in a balanced way through implementation of a comprehensive package of linked actions.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Scenario Planning methodology has been applied by national and international institutions to long term studies of possible future evolutions of primary and final energy consumption, power generation capacity, emerging power generation technologies and green house gas emissions. Power generation equipment manufacturing companies are large enough to have considerable influence on how the future of the energy world will unfold, through their investment decisions in technology development. On the other hand, their future depends on external factors, out of their control, such as economics, demographics, public opinion, government policies, availability of natural resources and competitor technologies, not all of them explicitly considered in the scenarios published by those institutions. If robust technology development strategies are to be chosen, it is essential for a manufacturer, in the first place, to have as clear as possible an understanding not only of the published long-term scenarios, but also of the certainties and uncertainties regarding the driving factors that can significantly affect its future in particular. From this understanding, it should ideally create its own set of scenarios, against which it should test its strategies. In a previous paper the author discussed external factors and aspects of published scenarios, which are relevant for manufacturers within their usual planning time scales. From that discussion, two scenarios were proposed, as alternative ‘futures’ to the scenarios published by the International Energy Agency. The study was restricted to the OECD countries. In this paper, an extension of the previous work is presented, where some non-OECD countries are included and new external factors are considered, relevant in the context of these countries, which are China, Brazil and India.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The problems of children and adolescents are of major concern to planners and providers of services within health and social care. When assuming responsibility for these services, at whatever level (policy, strategy, commissioning, or providing) they become aware of the major challenges that face them. Few people, however, are aware of the considerable amount of evidence that has already been accumulated in the last 50 years about effectiveness and the circumstances that impact on how best to deliver services. This book is the first to bring together this substantial body of evidence, disseminating in one volume information usually found scattered throughout a vast range of publications. In 38 chapters, it provides advice on: (a) The background developments in policymaking, strategic thinking, and adult education that impact on the future roles of professionals, managers, and child and adolescent health services. (b) Identifying problem populations and devising effective methods for obtaining reliable and valid measures of need that will enable service planning to take place, and which will then promote developments of commissioning strategies that make sense to practitioners. (c) Learning lessons for and from not only the UK but also North America, Australasia, developing countries, and societies that are in recovery post-conflict. (d) Understanding the evidence base for current interventions so that informed choices can be made, particularly in relation to expensive and residential provisions. (e) Understanding service networks so that children and families are directed to services that are likely to have the optimal effect in relation to their identified needs. (f) How services are currently being mapped and what recent exercise tell us about the performance of state-funded services in the UK (g) What we know from international sources about: how the impact of mental health problems and disorders on younger people translates into burden on parents, families, carers, and primary level staff; how their experiences relate to demand for and on specialist child and adolescents mental health services; and what the literature tells us about demand management. (h) Understanding the criteria for service evaluation so that reliable benchmarks and standards of effectiveness in services can be developed and applied. (i) Surveying the developments that have occurred in services in the last 15 years and future directions. Each chapter is written by an expert or team of experts in the field covered and is thoroughly referenced to enable readers to locate and refer to the original sources. This book will be the essential reference text for Directors and Managers in the NHS and Social care who have responsibility for children and adolescents with emotional or behavioural problems, as well as for clinical practitioners and those in training, or those responsible for providing training and staff development.</jats:p>",

ERP allows business to operate in a real-time, more effective and responsive manner and can facilitate better identification, storage, analysis, reuse and distribution of a company’s business intelligence (e.g., performance, productivity, customer satisfaction, availability, inventory management, communication). SAP, Oracle, and PeopleSoft are the top three ERP software vendors. ERP software installation and popularity have grown over the past decade, especially in the late 1990s (it was once thought to be the panacea for Y2K problem). The motivations for ERP use are internal business integration, best business practices, competitive advantage, and operational cost reduction. Following the market trend, a large number of ERP implementation projects were conducted, especially by large enterprises. However, multi-million dollar ERP implementation projects are not without problems. In some companies, implementation takes much longer and requires a larger budget than expected, and a large number of modifications and configurations to the software are necessary. Some businesses have to change their existing processes to adapt to the software, and thus have to deal with significant internal resistance and change management. A few companies have even been bankrupted by unsuccessful ERP implementation projects. </jats:p>"

From an operative perspective, ERP systems provide a common technological platform, unique for the entire corporation, allowing the replacement of mainframes and legacy systems. This common platform serves to process automation as well as to simplify current process either by an explicit reengineering process or by the implicit adoption of the system ‘best practices’ (Markus &amp; Tanis, 2000). Finally, the common centralized platform allows the access to data that previously were physically or logically dispersed. The automation of the processes and the access of data allows the reduction of the operating times (thus reducing operating costs) while the latter serves to better support business decisions (see, e.g., Umble, Haft &amp; Umble, 2003, for a detailed review of ERP benefits). </jats:p>"

In addition to addressing planning efficiency and plan quality, PbR offers a new anytime planning algorithm. The plan rewriting rules can be either specified by a domain expert or automatically learned. We describe a learning approach based on comparing initial and optimal plans that produce rules competitive with manually specified ones. PbR is fully implemented and has been applied to several existing domains. The experimental results show that the PbR approach provides significant savings in planning effort while generating high-quality plans.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Systems integration has been an important topic ever since businesses started using mainframes to run their back-office operations. These systems specialized in common tasks found in functional areas such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, inventory, purchasing, and ordering. However, getting information from these fragmented systems to get a whole picture view of the business was extremely difficult if not impossible. By integrating back-office operations into a single system, enterprise resource planning (ERP) was supposed to solve that problem. In reality, however, very few companies fully implement all the modules of an ERP package and most continue to rely on legacy systems and other specialized software for their processing needs Integration of ERP with various enterprise applications remains a challenge. Moreover, it is not uncommon to have ERP software from different vendors or multiple copies of ERP software from the same vendor running in the same company. Integrating multiple instances of ERP software will be the predominant ERP project in most large corporations in the next half decade. Finally, many companies pursue merger and acquisition as a major growth strategy. A critical task in merging two companies nowadays involves integrating their ERP systems. This paper addresses these integration issues involving ERP systems. Common tools for integration and success factors for integration projects are discussed. </jats:p>"

This chapter addresses the question of how to automatically dispatch a plan encoded as an STP, that is, how to determine when to perform its constituent actions so as to ensure that all of its temporal constraints are satisfied. After reviewing the theory of STPs and their use in encoding plans, we present detailed descriptions of the algorithms that have been developed to date in the literature on STP dispatch. We distinguish between off-line and online dispatch, and present both basic algorithms for dispatch and techniques for improving their efficiency in time-critical situations.</jats:p>"

The theory embedded within the matrix recommends that successful e-business transformation with ERP systems occurs when B2B value propositions are realized through integration and differentiation of technologies, used to support new business models for delivering products and services online. In addition, the management focus evolves through employee self-service and empowerment towards extensive relationship building with e-alliances. The matrix can be used by ERP business managers to guide their strategies for organisational transformation but also highlights critical stages of change.</jats:p>"

Since the late 1990s, enterprise systems have promised to seamlessly integrate information flowing through the organisation. They claim to lay redundant many of the integration problems associated with legacy systems. These promises are timely considering the current trends of globalization, virtual organisations, and constant business and technological changes, features of many strategy agendas. In an effort to better understand the nature of these packages this chapter reviews the ES evolutionary process, and generic software characteristics are also identified, followed by system benefits and limitations. A review of current approaches to ES implementation allows for a critique of system outcomes and identification of challenges facing today’s ES implementations. The chapter concludes with suggestions for overcoming some of these challenges.</jats:p>"

In addition to agile ERP deployment, the importance of process understanding and targeted agility impacts are shown to influence user SAP outcomes.</jats:p>"

Literature presents both implementation successes and failures. This chapter presents a successful SAP implementation in the WATER CORPORATION in Western Australia. A “Benefit Realization Strategy and Realization Process” was considered to be the key success factor in the implementation of SAP. The chapter describes the benefit realization structure and process and discusses how SAP was implemented successfully within this framework. The benefits realization and its impact are presented. Finally, future directions are highlighted.</jats:p>"

For a minority, defiance, disruptiveness, and aggression become so severe that they impair other aspects of functioning, compromise relationships, and risk conflict with parents, teachers, and peers. Disruptive behaviours of this kind are among the most common reasons for referral to child mental health services; they are also some of the most challenging to treat. The psychiatric classification systems define two categories of antisocial disorders in childhood: oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), marked by irritability, temper outbursts, disobedience, and negativity; and conduct disorder (CD), characterized by rule-breaking, verbal and physical aggression, lying and stealing, and violation of others’ rights. Both categories are recognized to be heterogenous, and also to shade into one another; especially among boys, the oppositional young child often develops more severe conduct problems or delinquent behaviours as time goes on.</jats:p>",

In this study, a mixed-integer, linear programming, utilizing the branch and bound algorithm was used to obtain optimal solution. Both the optimal configuration system equipment and the optimal operational mode were determined based on the annual cost method for installation of a cogeneration system to a hospital and a group of apartments in Seoul, Korea. In addition, the economic evaluation for the optimal cogeneration system depending on the fuel tariff system was calculated. A short payback period and a high internal rate of return on the initial investment were found to be essential for the adoption of cogeneration plants to hospitals and apartments.</jats:p>",

Although contraceptive services for HIV-positive women is one of the cornerstones of a comprehensive program for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT), a review of PMTCT programs found that implementers have not prioritized family planning (FP). While there is increasing awareness about the importance of FP and HIV integration, data about FP from PMTCT clients are lacking. The Horizons Program is conducting an operations research study testing several community-based strategies to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV in a densely settled urban slum in Nairobi, Kenya. Strategies being piloted include moving PMTCT services closer to the population via a mobile clinic and increasing psychosocial support for HIV-positive women. This research update presents key findings about FP at PMTCT sites, including the interaction between providers and clients as well as HIV-positive women’s fertility desires and demand for contraceptives, from the baseline cross-sectional survey and qualitative interviews with postpartum women.</jats:p>"

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.</jats:p>",

Its effects on the future organization, planning, provision, and delivery of services for children and their families was profound, as were its effects upon other agencies having responsibilities towards children. For example, the Act has had important implications for the organization of child and adolescent mental health services, and for the work of child psychiatrists (Harris-Hendricks and Black 1996).</jats:p>",

A special case of the CLIOS process is regional strategic transportation planning. New technologies, such as intelligent transportation systems, allow consideration of the planning, management, operations, and maintenance of transportation systems at the regional scale. Although the technological issues in advancing to this scale have proved tractable, the institutional issues concerned with deploying these systems across political jurisdictions with different measures of performance and different cultural perspectives has proved quite difficult. This paper explores processes for studying these institutional questions and integrating a number of concepts into the process: technological change, sustainability, real options, supply chain management, the various transport modes, and social, political, and economic factors. The paper serves as a case study of tailoring the CLIOS process into a process specifically designed to systematically address particular issues, in this case, regional strategic transportation planning. </jats:p>",

Knowledge sharing in ERP implementation is somewhat unique because ERP requires end users to have more divergent knowledge than is required in the use of traditional systems. Because of the length of time and commitment that ERP implementation requires, end users are also often more involved in ERP implementations than they are in more traditional ERP implementations. They must understand how their tasks fit into the overall process, and they must understand how their process fits with other organizational processes. Knowledge sharing among organizational members is one critical piece of ERP implementation, yet it is challenging to achieve. There is often a large gap in knowledge among ERP implementation personnel, and people do not easily share what they know. This study presents findings about organizational knowledge sharing during ERP implementation in three firms. Data were collected through interviews using a multi-site case study methodology. Findings are analyzed in an effort to provide a basis on which practitioners can more effectively facilitate knowledge sharing during ERP implementation.</jats:p>"

The Accelerated SAP implementation methodology (ASAP) is used as the SAP implementation reference method. Using Process Quality Management method, we derived a matrix of CSFs versus ASAP processes. Then, we evaluated the CSFs relevance along the five ASAP phases, specifically of those ones related with the organizational perspective. The main advantage of our approach is that we unified previous lists of CSFs for ERP implementation projects and we establish the CSFs relevance according to the implementation processes that should be made in a typical SAP implementation project. These findings will help managers to develop better strategies for supervising and controlling SAP or other similar ERP implementation projects.</jats:p>"

First steps in the application of the SEA show that the main issues are screening, scooping and decision making. According to the research results, it is suggested that extra evaluation processes should be incorporated into current assessment procedures to improve their scientific validity and integrity.</jats:p>"

These strategies have been applied to the characterization of genetic etiologies for reading disability, language disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and autism.</jats:p>",

Emergency Response Planning, combined with real time monitoring can have significant beneficial impacts on unplanned and planned outage duration’s. This paper details our company’s experience of Emergency Response Planning (ERP), giving detailed overview of how this is achieved and the benefits that can be obtained. The paper focuses on unit disaster recovery of large turbo-alternators and how the concept of Emergency Response planning can reduce unplanned outage duration’s, including the steps required to implement best practice. The paper uses a detailed a case study of a 1200MW, 4-pole generator with severe rotor winding inter-turn faults and associated vibration problems to demonstrate how a combination of condition monitoring, Emergency Response Planning, and a skilled repair team have been used to implement an effective maintenance strategy. The benefits to the customer have been detailed. The successful repair of all faults and the significant reduction in generator vibration levels without the requirement for any site balancing is illustrated on return of the unit to service. The paper details how Rotor Flux Monitoring (RFM) has been identified a series of winding faults and with ERP has mitigated areas of high risk within this turbo-generator.</jats:p>",

Companies around the world are exploring various Internet business models to evaluate their business potential and risk implications and a number of companies have realized the relatively quick gains with low associated risks that can be achieved through the business-to-employee (B2E) model. Employee Self Service (ESS) is a solution based on this model that enables employee’s access to the corporate human resource information system, and Australian companies are increasingly implementing this solution.

Indeed, the introduction of IT into work organisations is generally marred with persistent reports of underperformance and failure. This chapter critiques the nature of this dilemma and in particular explores the role of diverse occupational groups in its perpetuation over time. This dilemma is sustained over time by the behavioral patterns of diverse occupational groups that have vested but divergent, interests in exploiting IT. Executive management tend to view the introduction of IT as an economic imperative while IT specialists tend to view it as a technical imperative. The coalescent nature of these two imperatives is such that the human and organisational aspects of IT related change are frequently marginalized and ignored. Achieving a more integrated approach to the introduction of IT is inordinately difficult since the narrow perspectives embraced by the executive and IT communities do not naturally attend to change in an integrated manner.</jats:p>"

Tool accessibility plays a key role in this process. An adaptive setup planning approach for different types of multi-axis machine tools is proposed in this paper by investigating Tool Access Directions (TADs) of machining features, Tool Orientation Spaces (TOSs) of machine tools, and Primary Locating Directions (PLDs) of workpieces. In our approach, feasible TADs of a machining feature are predefined based on feature geometry and best practice knowledge, and denoted by unit vectors; The TOS of a machine tool is generated according to its configuration through kinematic analysis, and represented by a unit spherical surface patch; Primary locating directions and their priorities of a workpiece are determined based on the surface areas and the surface accuracy grades of non-machining surfaces. Starting from a 3-axis based machining feature grouping, setups for a 3-, 4- (or 3-axis with indexing table), or 5-axis machine can be achieved effectively by tool accessibility examination. A so-generated setup plan can provide not only the best coverage of machining features but the optimal orientation for each setup. Prismatic parts are considered in the proof-of-concept phase. Algorithms introduced here are implemented in MATLAB, and a case study is used to show the results.</jats:p>",

This chapter establishes some key principles and certain good practice rules and considers briefly the four aspects of strategic vision, leadership, planning, and implementation.

      "abstract": "<ja:p>The existence of multiple decision-makers and goals, spatial and  non-linear forest management objectives and the combinatorial nature of  forest planning problems are reasons that support the use of heuristic  optimisation algorithms in forest planning instead of the more  traditional LP methods. A heuristic is a search algorithm that does not  necessarily find the global optimum but it can produce relatively good  solutions within reasonable time. The performance of different  heuristics may vary depending on the complexity of the planning problem.  This study tested six heuristic optimisation techniques in five  different, increasingly difficult planning problems. The heuristics were  evaluated with respect to the objective function value that the  techniques were able to find, and the time they consumed in the  optimisation process. The tested optimisation techniques were 1) random  ascent (RA), 2) Hero sequential ascent technique (Hero), 3) simulated  annealing (SA), 4) a hybrid of SA and Hero (SA+Hero), 5) tabu search  (TS) and 6) genetic algorithm (GA). The results, calculated as averages  of 100 repeated optimisations, were very similar for all heuristics with  respect to the objective function value but the time consumption of the  heuristics varied considerably. During the time the slowest techniques  (SA or GA) required for convergence, the optimisation could have been  repeated about 200 times with the fastest technique (Hero). The SA+Hero  and SA techniques found the best solutions for non-spatial planning  problems, while GA was the best in the most difficult problems. The  results suggest that, especially in spatial planning problems, it is a  benefit if the method performs more complicated moves than selecting one  of the neighbouring solutions. It may also be beneficial to combine two  or more heuristic techniques.</ja:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper considers trajectories for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that must search an area while tracking a target. The UAV has a constrained turn rate and a constant velocity; it is assumed that there are certain areas of interest that have a higher search value than others. An algorithm is presented that seeks to maximize the value of the area searched while still maintaining the track. The problem is discretized in both time and the control; the motion of the UAV is constrained to the reachability graph, a subset of the forward reachable set. At each revisit, the target path is estimated for the next revisit. A heuristic method is used to determine the best UAV path, because the target path is not known a priori. Feasible paths are found by examining the terminating vertices of the reachability graph. A cooperative implementation, for a team of UAVs patrolling the same region, is developed. Simulation indicates the feasibility of the method for a real-time implementation. Trajectories for example scenarios are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

A key question is how a firm can provide incentives to its salesforce so that it is in their interest to truthfully disclose their information about the market and to work hard. Many people have considered this question and provided solutions. Perhaps the most well-known solution is due to Gonik (1978), who proposed and implemented a clever scheme designed to elicit market information and encourage hard work. The purpose of this paper is to study Gonik's scheme and compare it with a menu of linear contracts—a solution often used in the agency literature—in a model where the market information possessed by the salesforce is important for the firm's production and inventory-planning decisions. </jats:p>",

This chapter discusses the different ways of “going-live” of ERP systems: big-bang, small-bangs and implementation in phases, and describes their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter also presents results of an exploratory study made in 53 Brazilian companies, which implemented SAP R/3. Based on these results, influences of the companies’ characteristics and of the project on the selected method are discussed. The relation of the implementation approach and project time is also presented.</jats:p>"

With this function-based archiving system, designers can retrieve design information on existing products to assist in a new design project. The use of product families has emerged as an approach to exploit commonality for more efficient product development. However, the Design Repository does not contain explicit design information on platforms and modules. This paper describes information for the design of a platform and proposes a new data structure that organizes the information for augmenting the Design Repository. An information flow model for the development of a single product is modified to describe the flow of information needed for product platform design. The information flow model and associated data structure has been shown to be effective in representing three common product families: the Black &amp; Decker Firestorm tool set, Kodak single-use cameras, and the IceDozer family of ice scrapers. With this data structure implemented into the existing repository, designers can find useful information on how to create different products based on the a common platform.</jats:p>",

As consequence of the fall of the Berlin wall Häußermann and Kapphan (2000) observed the development of segregation. This contribution, by means of microeconomic simulations of the housing market, examines whether their findings are systematic or rather an empirical exception. Under a perfect price mechanism, segregation already arises within the divided city and remains even after the border has been opened. In case of limited pricing, segregation can be avoided as long as the city is divided but not after its unification.</jats:p>"

One set of demands has been for descriptions of the resource consequences of different illnesses, problems, or behaviours. An associated demand is for measures of the overall cost impact of a particular health problem. In the child and adolescent mental health field, for example, recognition of the often quite considerable effects of some behaviour problems of childhood and adolescence has encouraged a number of such cost studies. However, whilst service utilization descriptions can be informative, this rather reductionist focus on costs can be misleading and is unable to provide evidence upon which to base ‘best value’ assessments.</jats:p>",

The German criteria of tax division between the Federal Government, the states and the local authorities in this competition are gaining a special dynamic. The outcome of demographically determined population losses and a high proportion of fixed costs for local infrastructure is a ruinous competition. The paper analyses this competition by using data for housing spaces and local deficits in the Bremen region. It is shows that processes of suburbanisation are driven by an over-proportional supply of space in rural communities. The city as the central place and core of the region tries to counteract this development by providing spaces for housing with a lower density. Different instruments of financial compensation are tools to maintain vital infrastructure and a budgetary balance.</jats:p>"

Quality inspection has to be integrated in the production sequence in order to ensure the conformance of the products. The interactions between manufacturing processes and inspections are very complex since three aspects (quality, cost, and time) should all be considered at the same time while determining the suitable inspection strategy. Therefore, a simulation approach was introduced to solve this problem.The simulator called QUINTE [the QUINTE simulator has been developed at the University of Dortmund in the course of two research projects funded by the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Labour (BMWA: Bundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Arbeit), the Arbeitsgemeinschaft industrieller Forschungsvereinigungen (AiF), Cologne/Germany and the Forschungsgemeinschaft Qualität, Frankfurt a.M./Germany] was developed to simulate the machining as well as the inspection. It can be used to investigate and evaluate the inspection strategies in manufacturing processes. The investigation into the application of QUINTE simulator in industry was carried out at two pilot companies. The results show the validity of this simulator. An attempt to run QUINTE in a user-friendly environment, i.e., the commercial simulation software – Arena® is also described in this paper.NOTATION: QUINTE Qualität in der Teilefertigung  (Quality in  the manufacturing process)  </jats:p>"

Of the 7.5 million adolescents in the UK, 3.9 million are between the ages of 10 and 14, and a further 3.6 million are between the ages of 15 and 19 (Coleman and Schofield 2003).

These reforms recognised that the most important public objective for the Italian water services is to achieve an efficient, effective and economic management system. To reach such result, the Galli Law reunified all the different water services, such as aqueducts, purification systems and sewers in a single integrated water service based on optimum territorial domains intended to overcome the fragmentation inherent in the existing management systems. Furthermore, it made a clear distinction between the role of guiding and monitoring activities (entrusted to a domain authority) and the effective management (to be entrusted, instead, to public, private or mixed public-private companies). However, as will be noted in this paper, due to the many tensions between the national and EU rules, the transfer of the integrated water services provision to managing companies still has not been completed. Mostly for this reason, a decade after the Galli Law came into force, the reform still remains to be completed.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traditionally, for complicated systems such as a gas turbine power plant, maintenance cost and on-line availability are two of the most important concerns to the equipment owner. However, in the deregulated electric power market, cost and reliability are not the only concerns. The ultimate goal is to maximize plant profitability, and this requires the evaluation of many different factors including system performance, the aging and reliability of equipment, maintenance practices, and market dynamics accounting for the price and availability of fuel as well as the generation of revenues in competing markets. Thus, gas turbine power plant planning optimization is a complex problem, and comprehensive operational modeling and optimization methods are required. In this paper, a profit based power plant outage planning approach is presented that reflects the new challenges posed by deregulation. Specifically, particular attention is paid to modeling power plant aging, performance degradation, reliability deterioration, and, importantly, the energy market dynamics. A multiple time scale method is developed for coupled short term, long term generation scheduling and outage planning for this profit based outage planning approach. The procedure is implemented for a base load combined cycle power plant with single gas turbine with the results demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",

In this method, they are determined together with maximum contract demands of utilities such as electricity and natural gas so as to minimize the annual total cost in consideration of system’s annual operational strategies corresponding to seasonal and hourly energy demand requirements during every evaluation year considered. A numerical study is carried out for an office building with a total floor area of 15 000m2, where the system is consisted of an electric refrigerator and a steam boiler. Through the numerical calculation, the influence of the following items are clarified on the optimal renewing year and selection of renewing equipment of the system by the parametric study; (a) upgrading technology of the equipment in the future; (b) initial capital cost of equipment; (c) renewing construction cost and trade-in value rate; and (d) interest rate.</jats:p>",

These processes can play a guiding role for the general democratisation of municipalities, for a constructive collaboration with civil society, the private sector and state institutions. One condition for the effective implementation of the plans is the political will to set clear priorities for the multifunctionality of forests in order to provide appropriate financial resources for implementation together with a consistent controlling mechanism. Bilateral development cooperation between Bulgaria and Switzerland seeks to promote awareness amongst the actors, develop appropriate methodologies and educate and train stakeholders. What is still lacking in Bulgaria is the formulation of appropriate forestry legislation and guidelines for the preparation and implementation of the plans, an efficient monitoring system as well as the carefully formulated coordination with regional spatial development planning.</jats:p>",

While research addressing this issue has been conducted, few efforts have attempted to use minimum distance rates of change in motion planning. Geometric influence coefficients provide extraordinary insight into the interactions between a robot and its environment. They isolate the geometry of distance functions from system inputs and make the higher-order properties of minimum distance magnitudes directly available. Knowledge of the higher order properties of minimum distance magnitudes can be used to predict the future obstacle avoidance, path planning, and/or target acquisition state of a manipulator system and aid in making intelligent motion planning decisions. Here, first and second order geometric influence coefficients for minimum distance magnitudes are rigorously developed for several simple modeling primitives. A general method for similar derivations using new primitives and an evaluation of finite difference approximations versus analytical second order coefficient calculations are presented. Two application examples demonstrate the utility of minimum distance magnitude influence coefficients in motion planning.</jats:p>",

The chapter presents the results of a survey of 35 major Australian organisations that have implemented an ERP system. Many of these organisations have long histories of ERP usage and multiple ERP implementations and upgrades. The main findings indicate that the respondents considered change management crucial to successful ERP implementations, yet their organisations did not perform change management very well. The main success factor to change management was provision of adequate resources, with the main barrier being lack of communication up and down the organisation.</jats:p>"

This places an additional burden on designers and process engineers who already need to meet multiple objectives within tight constraints. Consequently, environmental aspects are rarely considered in their decision making process. Thus, if environmentally conscious decisions are to be made, the utilization of existing information must be maximized. In response to this problem we propose an approach for storing and reusing environmentally-related process information of similar component process plans via environmental process model templates. These templates will contain standard environmental information and models associated with manufacturing operations and thus should effectively support environmentally conscious decisions in component process planning and eventually design. We illustrate how the templates can be developed for a gear process planning example.</jats:p>",

Various authorities have argued that it needs to be expanded, since existing resources for assessment and treatment are inadequate for their task, yet are also unlikely to expand sufficiently to treat all cases.</jats:p>",

Grid cells are built while searching for the path to the goal configuration. The proposed planner acts in two modes. A depth mode, while the robot is far from obstacles, makes it evolve toward its goal. While a width search mode becomes active when the robot gets close to an obstacle. This method provides the shortest path to go around the obstacle. It also reduces the gap between pre-computed grid methods and lazy grid methods. No heuristic function is needed to guide the search process. An example dealing with a robot in a cluttered environment is presented to show the efficiency of the method.</jats:p>",

Variables are presented which can be used in the model or serve as examples for how the model is utilized once a theory of health behavior is adopted.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Results:\n           Examples of three innovative strategies designed to influence behavior change are presented so that the proposed model can be modified for use following comprehensive screening and baseline measurements. Three measurement priorities: clients, methods and agency are subjected to three phases of assessment: goals, implementation and effects.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Conclusion:\n           Lifestyles account for the majority of variability in quality-of-life and premature morbidity and mortality. Interventions designed to influence healthy behavior changes must be driven by theory and carefully planned and evaluated. The proposed model is offered as a useful tool for the behavior change strategist.</jats:p>"

The paper concludes that these urban reforms brought another image of the city, a new townscape and a different experience of living. These developments were characterised by proto-modern architecture, skyscrapers built on large avenues, distant housing with long journeys to work for the poorest, or overcrowded favelas (slum setlements) around the city centre.</jats:p>"

We will argue that this opportunity is sometimes not grasped by educators, nor supported by colleagues in the health services. When it is, improved mental health is promoted for all children and young people, including those with specific difficulties in this area. The chapter opens with a short historical account of educational interventions with pupils with EBD. Discussion then moves to contemporary issues as highlighted by recent literature (including: NHS Health Advisory Service 1995; Audit Commission 1999; Mental Health Foundation 1999) and the work of our Emotional and Behavioural Difficulties Research Team. The chapter ends with some suggestions for national, local, and institutional strategies for mental health promotion in schools.</jats:p>",

First, it inquires whether the treatment of foreign substances and foreign articles in REACH can be reconciled with one of WTO's key requirements, i.e., non-discrimination. Second, it tests specific aspects of the registration obligation established by REACH (i.e., the \"volumes-driven\" approach, the follow-up to the registration process, the underlying foundations of REACH's cost-benefit analysis) against the proportionality rule embodied in the WTO's Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade. Third, it asks whether the protection of confidential business information in REACH is compatible with the WTO rules on intellectual property protection (notably, the TRIPS Agreement). It results from the present analysis that REACH poses considerable challenges not only under EU law, but also under WTO law.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The path planning ensures safe and simultaneous arrival of the UAVs to the target while meeting curvature and safety constraints. Pythagorean Hodograph (PH) curve is used for path planning. The PH curve provides continuous curvature of the paths. The offset curves of the PH paths define safety margins around and along each flight path. The simultaneous arrival is satisfied by generation of paths of equal lengths. This paper highlights the mathematical property — changing path-shape and path-length by manipulating the curvature and utilises this to achieve the following constraints: (i) Generation of paths of equal length, (ii) Achieving maximum bound on curvature, and, (iii) Meeting the safety constraints by offset paths.</jats:p>",

It singles out eight core issues which are likely to become the subject of future litigation before the European Court of Justice. These are the Directive's scope, exceptions and defences, failures to implement associated Directives, biodiversity damage, orphan damage, prevention, remediation, and enforcement. The analysis is informed by the judicial activism employed by the Court in recent years. The Court's approach has safeguarded the effectiveness of environmental directives, and their compatibility with general principles of EC environmental law. It is argued that the Court will apply a similar teleological approach as regards the Environmental Liability Directive, which should bring about a more stringent regime than its wording at first glance might suggest.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Outcomes achieved in research-based studies of the efficacy of particular treatments show a good deal of discrepancy with the observed effectiveness of these treatments in naturalistic settings such as community clinics, health centres, or homes (Weisz et al. 1992; Weisz and Weiss 1993).</jats:p>",

The primary purpose of this research was to test the effect of ERP implementation on users. We used the implementation and performance stage model and studied issues related to adaptation, acceptance, and routinization stages. An exploratory case study was conducted to study these research issues. The case study consisted of a survey and interview of 25 employees at one organization. The results provide data analysis findings from the survey and qualitative findings from the interview. The findings of the case study point to a positive user climate during transition to SAP, increased user productivity, and improved job understanding through the use of SAP software.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One important aspect in the assembly process design is to assure that there exist a collision-free assembly path for each part and subassembly. In order to reduce the need of physical verification the automotive industry use digital mock-up tool with collision checking for this kind of geometrical assembly analysis. To manually verify assembly feasibility in a digital mock-up tool can be hard and time consuming. Therefore, the recent development of efficient and effective automatic path planning algorithm and tools are highly motivated. However, in real production, all equipment, parts and subassemblies are inflicted by geometrical variation, often resulting in conflicts and on-line adjustments of off-line generated assembly paths. To avoid problems with on-line adjustments, state-of-the-art tools for path-planning can handle tolerances by a general clearance for all geometry. This is a worst-case strategy, not taking account for how part and assembly variation propagates through the positioning systems of the assembly resulting in geometry areas of both high and low degree of variation. Since, this latter approach results in unnecessary design changes or in too tight tolerances we have developed a new algorithm and working procedure enabling and supporting a more cost effective non-nominal path planning process for assembly operations. The basic idea of the paper is to combine state of the art technology within variation simulation and automatic path planning. By integrating variation and tolerance simulation results into the path planning algorithm we can allow the assembly path going closer to areas of low variation, while avoiding areas of high variation. The benefits of the proposed approach are illustrated on an industrial case from the automotive industry.</jats:p>",

Anthro‐planning is an approach that infuses anthropological perspectives and methods into planning projects. The article starts by discussing some guiding principles for an anthro‐planning approach derived from the author's experiences in planning regional heritage tourism–education sites. The emphases are (1) taking a collaborative or partnership approach that actively seeks public participation in the planning process and (2) extensively incorporating anthropological field methods into the project design. The article then provides some concrete examples by showing how this approach was applied in planning two cultural heritage parks for an Appalachian Virginia region. One case documents the planning of an Appalachian coal‐mining heritage park while the other example focuses on development of an Appalachian farm heritage museum and park.</jats:p>",

While the overall methodology consists of two general steps: diagnosis and repair, this paper focuses on the repair step in which decomposition patterns are utilized for redesign planning. Resulting from design diagnosis, a typical decomposition pattern solution to a given redesign problem indicates the portions of the design model necessary for re-computation as well as the interaction part within the model accountable for design change propagation. Following this, this paper suggests repair actions with an approach derived from an input pattern solution, to generate a redesign roadmap allowing for taking a shortcut in the redesign solution process while scheduling re-computing tasks. To do so, a complete collection of re-computation strategies able to handle all possible decomposition patterns for any given redesign problem is introduced, and a two-stage redesign planning approach from re-computation strategy selection to redesign roadmap generation is proposed. An example problem concerning the redesign of a relief valve is used for illustration and validation.</jats:p>",

Such methods have found a receptive audience in industry, as evidenced by many academic case studies and the initiation of similar process improvement initiatives by the companies themselves. Given the ongoing ‘pull’ from a number of companies, we are interested to understand why such model-based methods have not yet impacted upon wider operational planning in industry. In this paper, based on an extended research study at a large UK aerospace company, we describe the application of the Signposting process modeling approach to the problem of developing a pragmatic method to support planning practice. The research described in the paper focuses on the elicitation, representation and manipulation of process information in a form which can inform planning and scheduling; during the study, addressing these issues was key to gaining support of the approach within the company.</jats:p>",

The writer of Proverbs 10 recognized ‘where there is no vision, the people perish’. Perhaps Noah was one of the first people recorded to have seen that strategy implementation is at least as important as strategic initiation. This early example provides another lesson as well—that it is at the least desirable, if not imperative, to develop strategy in response to need. An ark proved more useful than a camel train as the means of transport! Form must follow function.In this chapter, we will elucidate the nature of strategy, challenge often recounted conceptions of strategy as ‘academic’ or dry and impersonal, by showing how important are interpersonal skills to its formulation and implementation, and relate this to developing better child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS).We begin with the most challenging question.</jats:p>",

Assessing this environment provides insight into the unique changes, the implications these changes have on a firm's strategies, and the creation of special techniques required to understand them. One of these special techniques is scenario planning. Any study of the relationship between strategy, environment and performance must include variables that involve business scope and resource commitments.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Design/methodology/approach</jats:title><jats:p>A review of the research literature on the use and benefits of both the traditional approaches and the scenario approach to constructing the future strategy of a firm in a changing environment is undertaken.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Findings</jats:title><jats:p>The results suggest that a better understanding of the performance of firms within a changed environment can be achieved using the combination of a PESTEL analysis, internal resource analysis and the use of scenarios.

A survey was conducted of 117 ERP system project participants in five closely related state government agencies. Through a modified Delphi technique, the study inventoried, synthesized, then weighted perceived major-issues in ongoing ERP life cycle implementation, management, and support. The five agencies each implemented SAP Financials simultaneously using a common implementation partner. The three Delphi survey rounds, together with a series of interviews and domain experts’ workshops, resulted in a set of 10 major-issue categories with 38 sub-issues. Sub-issue weights are compared between strategic and operational personnel within the agencies in order to understand where the organizations should focus their resources in order to avoid, minimise, or eliminate these issues. Study findings confirm the importance of this finer partitioning of the data, and distinctions identified reflect the unique circumstances across the stakeholder groups. The study findings should be of interest to stakeholders who seek to better understand the issues surrounding ERP systems and to better realize the benefits of ERP.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>At present, coastal cities in advanced countries are losing their vitality and their sprawl has been depriving these cities of the unique attraction provided by their coastal position with seaside spaces. For the vitalization of coastal cities, it is important to increase the visiting population to seaside spaces from other areas. While the rapid development of advanced countries in the modern era has been founded on the economic order originally established by the Industrial Revolution, the phenomenon of an aging society with fewer children which is currently in progress makes such economic foundations vulnerable, constituting a social problem which must be urgently dealt with. This study features the planning of signs as a technique for the development of a universal design in consideration of the imminent increase of the number of the elderly and disabled and as a measure to increase the visiting population to vitalize coastal cities while focusing on the planning of signs as a system to assist ocean recreational activities. The underlying concept is that these activities have the potential to secure or even increase the number of visitors to seaside spaces which have a variety of resources and characteristics. As the introduction of a new strategic concept for the planning of signs as a measure to increase the number of visitors is essential, the focus is placed on pictogrammes which are visual signs with a superior information conveyance function to other types of signs. The outcomes of this study presented here are (i) techniques to configure pictogrammes which are easy to understand by all and which are capable of inducing people’s desire for actions and (ii) concrete pictogramme designs.</jats:p>",

The answer has important economic consequences, since waste management is a significant market. At the same time, environmental concerns have to be observed. The framework legislation of the European Community leaves the organisational structure of waste management to the national legislation of the Member States. However, under Community legislation waste is subject to the principle of the free movement of goods, which may be restricted on environmental grounds. Furthermore EU law draws a distinction between waste for disposal, for which shipment can be restricted more easily, and waste for recovery, which is subject to less stringent control procedures. Given the broad European framework, this article explores the national legislation in most EU countries. It aims to analyse the approach taken by the national legislators to find a way between public service and private autonomy. In conclusion, it seems clear that in the countries examined an important distinction is made between household and industrial waste. Only Germany has adopted the European distinction between waste for recovery and waste for disposal as a major criterion for the allocation of the waste streams between public and private entities, whereas in the other Member States this criterion only plays an insignificant, if any, role at all.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Late transpositions, cumbersome administrative procedures, a focus on technical standards and a policy based primarily on controlled disposal have dominated Greek waste management law until its most recent third modification which simplified and clarified procedures considerably. The legal framework in relation to recovery of packaging and packaging waste and \"other waste products\" was recently put in operation and shows some positive results. A major legislative effort is still required to update Greek waste management law at the proper legislative level.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The paper describes the results of an automated menu generator (MenuGene) of the web-based lifestyle counseling system Cordelia that provides personalized advice to prevent cardiovascular diseases.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Methods:\n           The menu generator uses genetic algorithms to prepare weekly menus for web users. The objectives are derived from personal medical data collected via forms in Cordelia, combined with general nutritional guidelines. The weekly menu is modeled as a multilevel structure.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Results:\n           Results show that the genetic algorithm-based method succeeds in planning dietary menus that satisfy strict numerical constraints on every nutritional level (meal, daily basis, weekly basis). The rule-based assessment proved capable of manipulating the mean occurrence of the nutritional components thus providing a method for adjusting the variety and harmony of the menu plans.</jats:p><jats:p>\n          \n            Conclusions:\n           By splitting the problem into well determined sub-problems, weekly menu plans that satisfy nutritional constraints and have well assorted components can be generated with the same method that is for daily and meal plan generation.</jats:p>"

The essence of this case is the analyzing of a specific organizational setting with critical software needs and the developing of the needed plans. As in many similar situations, this organization is relatively complex, and the situation is not entirely clear. By reviewing the facts of the case, collecting outside information, conducting role playing interviews, analyzing requirements, and estimating schedules and costs, one can collect the information needed to develop baseline project plans for the software development envisioned in this case.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>To ensure the safety and reliability of ship structures during their service lifetime, inspections are essential to evaluate corrosion or fatigue damage and schedule maintenance or repair. This paper aims to propose a cost-benefit model of risk based inspection and repair planning for ship structures subjected to corrosion deterioration. The models of expected costs and expected benefit are formulated. The benefit-cost ratio is adopted to select the optimal inspection and repair planning. The planning problem is formulated as an optimization problem where the total benefit-cost ratio in the expected lifetime is maximized with a constraint on the minimum acceptable reliability index. A component subjected to corrosion deterioration is presented to illustrate the proposed approach. In addition, sensitivity studies are presented to account for the effects of uncertainties in basic parameters on the benefit-cost ratio and the optimal inspection and repair planning. The results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively integrate the economy with reliability of the inspection and repair planning. Furthermore, a balance can be achieved between the risk cost and total expected inspection and repair costs, which is very effective in selecting the optimal inspection and repair planning. Parametric studies show that the benefit-cost ratio is sensitive to the time of inspection and repair, the reference period, the repair criterion and the failure criterion.</jats:p>",

This article examines contractual issues to be observed when forming and operating consortia based on the REACH Proposal. Many of those issues risk provoking conflicts with European competition law which prohibits agreements between competitors objecting to or effecting the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market. The article examines these competition law issues and demonstrates that, given the potentially great number of consortia, there is a need for guidance in the form of a notice of the Commission in order to reduce the risk of an infringement of competition law.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

It is difficult to think of a better model than that which CAMHS practitioners so often use for those in their care—child development. What are the tasks facing the developing child and what style of parenting is needed for healthy development to take place? The good enough parent, in its broadest Winnicottian sense, is one who provides a secure envelope within which a child can experiment with acceptable risks; one who patrols the boundaries within which the child is free to establish its own identity—attitudes to self, family, peer group, and community; how those attitudes are expressed; and to what lengths it is permissible to follow them in social relationships.</jats:p>",

We have developed architecture and implemented module for rule-based machining process selection of hole making operations. The architecture enables the interface from the Process Selection prototype to Math Based Manufacturing System (APPS). The prototype also includes the user interface for interaction with the process selection procedure.

However, new “high‐” and “low”‐tech calendar methods have been developed, which are easy to teach, to use, and may be useful in helping couples avoid pregnancy. The low‐tech models are based on a fixed‐day calendar system. The high‐tech models are based on monitoring urinary metabolites of female reproductive hormones. Both systems have high levels of satisfaction. This article describes these new models of family planning and the research on their effectiveness. The author proposes a new algorithm for determining the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle for either achieving or avoiding pregnancy.</jats:p>",

This chapter is not about ethics. It is about the broader concept of values. More precisely, it is about what one of us has called else-where values-based practice (Fulford 2004). Many of the problems between practitioners and managers in healthcare, we will suggest, arise from (largely unacknowledged) differences of values. Values-based practice offers practitioners and managers a set of theoretical principles and practical skills (summarized in Fig. 5.1) that allow them to build on the differences of values between them as a positive resource for healthcare decision-making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work deals with the analysis and transfer of design information, expressed in terms of features, from feature-based CAD models to CAPP systems in order to perform process planning. In this paper, we present an integrated system that retrieves design information from a feature-based CAD model, performs feature mapping, identifies interactions between features, generates alternative feature representations and feature precedence relations. The alternative feature representations provides the process planner with more flexibility in terms of process selection and are shown in the form of an AND-OR graph. The feature precedence relations, represented as a directed feature precedence network, assist the process planner in its process sequencing tasks. Feature mapping involves the mapping of design features into equivalent valid machining features. Feature interactions are identified by analyzing part geometry for face adjacency and hence feature adjacency. The interacting features are then analyzed to identify possible alternative feature representations and feature precedence relationships. Procedures for the identification of feature interactions and determination of alternative feature representations and feature precedence relationships are provided. The generated AND-OR graph and the feature precedence network seeks to aid CAPP systems in process sequence generation and serve as a vital step for the integration of design and planning systems.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nEarly identification of farmer perceptions influencing particular farm management decisions provides the opportunity to more effectively focus investment in research and extension. A survey-based study examining the adoption of integrated weed management by Western Australian grain growers was used to demonstrate how identification of key farmer perceptions can help to guide research and extension priorities. It was found that the adoption of integrated weed management practices was influenced by grower perceptions of herbicide resistance-related factors and of the efficacy and economic value of integrated weed management practices in the farming system. However, there were generally no significant differences between the perceptions of practice efficacy held by users and non-users of the integrated weed management practices. As initial perceptions of efficacy were generally consistent with local field experience, it was expected that extension would not have a major influence on this variable. Consistent with this, participation by growers in a workshop based on the bio-economic farming systems model, resistance integrated management (RIM), did not result in changes in perceptions of practice efficacy. However, changes in the perceived short-term economic value of some weed management practices did occur where the broader value of practices to the farming system, not necessarily relating to weed control, could be demonstrated. This also led to more growers deciding to adopt those practices. For example, intended wheat seeding rates were shown to increase by 5 kg/ha as a result of participation in the extension activity. Determining the perceptions influencing adoption, and then identifying the major learning opportunities can be valuable in focusing research and extension. Measures of perceptions also allow learning to be evaluated. In the case study of adoption of the integrated weed management practices in WA, it seems that emphasis on developing and extending the farming-systems impacts beyond just weed and resistance management is likely to be more effective than focusing on the efficacy of the practices for controlling major weeds.\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As British society has become increasingly multiethnic and multicultural, debate has grown regarding the advantages and disadvantages of ethnically segregated schools, with regard both to educational achievement and to multicultural accommodation. Compared with issues regarding the class composition of schools, however, little work has been done on the degree of ethnic segregation in schools, let alone its impact. The authors use a recently developed classification procedure to identify the degree of ethnic segregation in England's secondary schools in 2001, using a database that gives every student's ethnic identity. It is shown that, although there is considerable segregation for members of ethnic minority groups in London and a small number of other urban areas, elsewhere there is much more exposure of members of those groups to White students; White students are much more segregated, however. In general, the level of segregation in schools is greater than the residential segregation of the various ethnic groups. </jats:p>",

Many agencies have endeavoured to cope with the imbalance between supply and demand by directing variable amounts of additional resource to them or by altering how services respond within the same resource envelope. Inevitably, policymakers, strategic and operational managers, and practitioners discover that there is a substantial time-lag built into resolving many workforce challenges as an answer to increasing demand.</jats:p>",

This policy has been criticized for neglecting the consequences for the planning process of volatility in schools’ external environment and for replacing well-developed professional knowledge and commitment with inappropriate models from ‘for-profit’ business. We agree that the rational planning model is not an appropriate basis for school management but dispute these diagnoses of the nature of the problem. We suggest that it is uncertainty about processes internal to the school that are the problem and that an appropriate managerial response to this problem can draw upon business ideas which are not oppositional to professional expertise and values, while questioning professional self-interest. </jats:p>",

The two regression approaches used are moving window regression (MWR) and geographically weighted regression (GWR). For the first approach different window sizes are applied and changes in results assessed. For the second approach, a Gaussian kernel is used and its bandwidth varied. Seven independent variables are utilised, although a single variable (deprivation) provides the main analytical focus. Differences in results obtained with use of the two approaches are discussed. The relationship between window size or bandwidth size and observed spatial patterning is discussed and elucidated. The results support previous work that indicated severe limitations in using global regressions to examine relationships between socioeconomic variables. Also, the utility of comparing results obtained from MWR and GWR is assessed and the benefits of both approaches are outlined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In our previous work, we have treated the collision-free path-planning problem for a nonholonomic mobile robot in a cluttered environment. The method we have used is based on a representation of the obstacles in the robot’s velocity space, called Feasible Velocities Polygon (FVP). Every obstacle in the robot’s influence zone is represented by a linear constraint over the robot’s velocities such that it could not be collision between the robot and the obstacle. These constraints define a convex subset in the velocity space, the FVP. Every velocity vector of the FVP ensures a safe motion for the given obstacle configuration. The path-planning problem is solved by an optimization approach between the FVP and a reference velocity to reach the goal. In this paper, we have extended our work to an articulated mobile robot. This robot is composed of a differential mobile robot as tractor and a trailer, linked by off-center joints. We have modified the reference velocity in order to consider the constraints imposed by the trailer over the robot’s velocities. The control law is a nonlinear control law, which is asymptotically stable to the goal. We use the virtual robot concept, to solve the stability problem when the robot and its trailer move backwards. An articulated mobile robot is a strongly constrained system. Even in a free environment, under some circumstances, the robot may get blocked by its trailer in its progression towards the goal. To solve these situations, we have developed a heuristic algorithm. This algorithm is based in human experience: when a blocking situation is detected, a forward-backward maneuver is made, in order to increase the distance between the tows until a maximal value. After this maneuver, the robot takes the path to the original goal. Some numerical results show that our method leads the robot and the trailer to the final position in a stable way.</jats:p>",

With modern technical improvement the usage of complex mathematical model based on biomechanical characteristics of tissue is possible. Two and three-dimensional model, expert systems and mechanical analysis are used. In this work we tested the system for mechanical analysis in preoperative planning of a simple procedure of the Z-plastic, named the finite-element method. Computer model simulates tissue coverages. With geometrical data some physical characteristics are added. Complex surface of skin is marked by the grid divided in quadrangular elements. Mechanical consequences and definitive results of surgical procedure are analyzed during the computer simulation of the action of tension of skin and suture material. In our analysis we found the finite-element method of great usefulness and noticed that \"surgery simulators\" might be an efficient way to speed-up learning curve in reconstructive surgery.</jats:p>"

This paper reviews the problem of planning and scheduling of biopharmaceutical manufacture and presents a methodology for the planning of multiproduct biopharmaceutical manufacturing facilities. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to represent the relevant decisions required within the planning process and is tested on two typical biopharmaceutical industry planning problems. The proposed formulation is compared with an industrial rule based approach, which it outperforms in terms of profitability. The results indicate that the developed formulation offers an effective representation of the planning problem and would be a useful decision tool for manufacturers in the biopharmaceutical industry particularly at times of limited manufacturing capacity.</jats:p>",

The Commission oversees the external audit of local authorities and the National Health Service in both countries and is required by parliament to undertake audits that enable it to comment on the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of services. Its remit is thus very wide, and, over the years, it has undertaken a number of reviews of children’s services including hospital services (Audit Commission 1993), health and social services that promote the wellbeing of children (Audit Commission 1994), youth justice (Audit Commission 1996a) and various aspects of education (Audit Commission 1996b, 1999a).</jats:p>",

First, the difference between the joint velocity of original manipulator and that of reduced manipulator is defined as the sudden change in joint velocity. Then, a corresponding fault tolerant planning algorithm based on this criterion is proposed. At last, a simulation example of fault tolerant operations is implemented with two planar 3R manipulators. Simulation results show that this algorithm can effectively avoid the sudden change of joint velocity occurring in fault tolerant operation of two coordinating manipulators, strengthen their motion stability and so improve their kinematical and dynamic properties in fault tolerant operations.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Data processing for the spatial analysis of small-area social, demographic, and economic data often requires the combination of data spatially aggregated to two or more incompatible zone systems in a region, such as a set of enumeration districts that changes over time. Such situations can be addressed by areal interpolation—the transfer of data between zonal systems according to spatial algorithms. The authors test a technique of areal interpolation using geographic information systems (GIS) that employs a digital map layer representing streets and roads to derive varying density weights for small areas within aggregation zones. The technique reduces errors in estimation compared with estimates derived using the commonly applied area-weighting technique, with its assumption of uniform density. The street-weighting technique is much easier to use than other interpolation techniques that have also been shown to reduce error compared with area-based weighting. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For decades, Dutch transport policies have been dominated by two themes: congestion and environment. Extensive research has revealed planning concepts that can improve the performance of transportation networks and reduce the environmental impact of traffic and transport by using spatial planning policies. Such concepts were introduced in the Dutch policy realm with little success, and there remains a lack of cooperation between the fields of traffic and transport and spatial planning and between various levels of government–-at the cost of accessibility and the environment. The recent shift in Dutch traffic and spatial policies to decentralize power and policy implementation from the national to the regional level might encourage regional transport and spatial planners to integrate the policy realms toward cooperation or even to collaboration. This article describes the design of training for transport engineers and spatial planners to improve their abilities to cooperate successfully and to work more effectively on the regional themes of accessibility and environmental impact. The training focuses on projects that can be characterized as cross-boundary cooperation. The training is based on the theories and practices of the learning organization and on a constructivist perspective on learning. </jats:p>",

They find differences in the likelihood that service-class households are single-person households (with inner London standing apart in this regard). Findings contradict dominant messages in the literature that rural areas have fewer women with paid work and fewer with service-class jobs. Most evidently, provincial inner cities stand apart in these terms, with the position regarding paid work for adult couples in rural areas being more similar to paid work for adult couples in London than in suburban or provincial inner-city environments. </jats:p>",

However, the constant translational and rotational velocities commonly used to trigger the contact formation (CF) transitions are often not sufficiently exciting to estimate all geometrical parameters. In this paper, we focus on the calculation of a fine-motion task plan, which improves the observation of inaccurately known geometrical parameters. This is called active sensing. </jats:p><jats:p> Our approach to active sensing is to optimize the task plan (i) by minimizing an objective function, such as the expected execution time, which is an important criterion in industrial applications, and (ii) by constraining the task plans to plans which observe the geometrical parameter estimates to the required accuracy. </jats:p><jats:p> Active sensing for compliant motion is a new research area. Hence, this paper primarily aims at formulating the active sensing problem and decoupling it into smaller optimization problems. The main contributions of this paper are (i) the definition of the CF-observable parameter space, which allows us to decouple the active sensing requirement for the task plan into a requirement for the CF sequence and requirements for the active sensing motions in each CF, and (ii) the description of practical (suboptimal) solutions and heuristics, making on-line replanning feasible. </jats:p>",

As in most Western countries, mineral extraction meets with considerable societal resistance. To this end, Dutch minerals policy aims to prevent extraction by promoting economical use of materials, and the use of alternative (secondary or renewable) materials. Until recently, it also included a system of production planning to sustain supplies of regionally scarce materials. Dutch policy development is reviewed and discussed in terms of pitfalls and possibilities for mineral planning in general. Promoting secondary substitution has been quite successful, and presents an example. In contrast, the production planning system has been controversial from the start and ineffective as a result, mainly because it attempted to solve supply problems without properly addressing the underlying resistance. For this reason the system is in the process of being abandoned.</jats:p>",

When doing either, there is a great temptation to get to grips immediately with the front line of provision of services with a view to examining what is happening there and what we would prefer to happen with a view to closing the gap between the two. While we agree that no one should forget that benefits to the public are usually delivered through relationships between them and practitioners, we also believe that the context in which patients, clients, users and their carers relate to staff of services is vital to the success of the whole enterprise. The context frames not only knowledge, skill, and attitudes but, most significantly, can exhort or hold back their acquisition and application, and also shapes the wishes, expectations, and demands of the public. Therefore, we start this text from a position that is about as remote from delivering healthcare as one can get. This is because this book is about the context of practice rather than about that practice itself.</jats:p>",

Such ambiguities hamper transposition into national law, complicate implementation by the national authorities and thus give rise to considerable economic and environmental problems in the waste management sector. Prompted by the Sixth Environmental Action Programme, the European Commission has finally initiated a revision of the general legal framework for European waste management. Amendments to the Waste Shipment Regulation have already been approved at a political level and are likely to be adopted this year. Revision of the basic terms, principles and provisions of the Waste Framework Directive (WFD), however, is still at a rather early stage. Against this background, we hope to show by the following that the ambiguities in EC waste law are not just a consequence of a lack of definitions but also the result of uncertainty surrounding basic regulatory and strategic issues which must be addressed first (Part I). We will therefore submit recommendations as to how these strategic questions should be answered in the light of both the environmental risks currently faced by the waste sector and the specific potential of waste-law approaches to reduce these risks (Part II). Finally, we will show how these strategic solutions could be converted into specific provisions and amendments to the WFD (Parts III and IV). The recommendations and suggestions presented below have been generated by a study conducted by the authors at the request of the German Ministry of the Environment1.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

Econometric analysis establishes that regional inequality is explained in the different phases by three key policy variables—the ratio of heavy industry to gross output value, the degree of decentralization, and the degree of openness.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nScenario planning was used to identify issues and drivers of change that are relevant to community efforts to improve regional prospects in the Western Australian Wheatbelt. The region, some 20 million hectares in area, is under pressure to respond to a variety of environmental (salinity, erosion, acidification, biodiversity decline), economic (declining agricultural terms of trade), and social forces (rural decline, isolation). Regional strategic plans have been increasingly seen as the means of achieving sustainability in the face of these challenges, but until recently typically had single-activity outlook and timeframes of up to a decade into the future. Systematic futures-based research has been used in various regions to avoid reliance on business-as-usual as the default strategy, and to identify opportunities and challenges not presently apparent. The Avon River Basin, the central region of the Wheatbelt, was selected as the geographic focus of the project, and the time horizon was set at 2050. The project was developed by a group of 50 stakeholders from the basin, with expertise and strategic interests across a wide range of economic, social, and environmental themes. Through a series of workshops the stakeholders identified critical issues and their attendant drivers, then documented relevant past trends. Four regional scenarios, Saline Growth, Grain and Drain, Landcare Bounty, and Harmony with Prosperity, were developed based on positive and negative combinations of 2 clusters of uncertain and important drivers: environmental change and access to new markets. Common opportunities, threats, and critical success factors for the Avon River Basin region out to 2050 were also identified. We also found that the stakeholders have a tendency to strive for positive outcomes despite negative initial conditions. This resulted in 4 scenarios that were superficially similar due to the regional scale of analysis and the continuation of agricultural industries as significant shapers of economy, society, and environment. However, each scenario represents profoundly different outcomes for the residents and communities of the Avon River Basin in 2050. The triple-bottom line outcomes for the Avon River Basin in 2050 were estimated to be in the range 4.9–9.7 Mt of wheat (currently 4.0), 46 000–66 000 people (currently 43 000), and 10–30% of farmland salinised (currently 6). The application of these results to other regions in Australia is discussed.\n</jats:p>"

The company follows a deterministic replenishment‐and‐planning process despite considerable demand uncertainty. As a possible way to formally address uncertainty, we provide two risk measures, “demand‐at‐risk” (DaR) and “inventory‐at‐risk” (IaR) and two linear programming models to help manage demand uncertainty. The first model is deterministic and can be used to allocate the replenishment schedule from the plants among the customers as per the existing process. The other model is stochastic and can be used to determine the “ideal” replenishment request from the plants under demand uncertainty. The gap between the output of the two models as regards requested replenishment and the values of the risk measures can be used by the company to reallocate capacity among different products and to thus manage demand/inventory risk. </jats:p>",

To facilitate the ongoing discussions on implementation in the Member States the possible provisions are divided between (from the European perspective) the mandatory and the optional. In particular, the liability rules for farmers using GMOs, the rules safeguarding biodiversity in protected zones and the good professional practice rules are both politically and legally fiercely controversial and these topics are not only covered from the legal perspective but also the scientific, as assessed by a molecular biologist.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

In the late 199os it was realised that this network of regulations had not resulted in the provision of adequate safety information on the chemicals used everyday in the EU, and also it did not function efficiently, for example in controlling uses of problematic substances. A review was launched, which led to the creation of the REACH - Regulation, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals\"- a new integrated approach to chemical regulation in Europe. The REACH proposal obliges chemical producers to provide safety data on the substances they sell, and makes a number of other changes to chemicals management, including the creation of a new authorisation system for dealing with chemicals with properties of very high concern. The REACH proposal is now being finalised in the co-decision process, and it is currently estimated that it will enter into force in 2007.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

The German Advisory Council on the Environment (SRU) has long advocated such legal standing for NGOs2, emphasising in particular that the right to bring a representative action in no way constitutes privileged treatment of environmental interests. Rather, it redresses the inequalities of a legal system that places the interests of environment users above those of environment protection3. The representative action has to be seen as a much-needed form of legal standing for public interests that have up to now been unenforceable before the courts. The following article describes the practical experiences with legal standing for NGOs and the relevance of the judiciary, deals with the core elements of the Aarhus Convention, the Directives 2003/4/EC, 2003/35/FC and the proposal for a directive on access to justice in environmental matters and displays the respective comments and recommendations of the Council.</jats:p>\n         </jats:sec>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Operations Research/Education Laboratory (OR/Ed. lab) at the Institute for Transportation Research and Education, North Carolina State University, has a long history of providing school systems with data-driven solutions for school population forecasting, school attendance studies, and determination of new school locations. These planning processes, known as Integrated Planning for School and Community (IPSAC), provide school districts with mathematically optimal solutions that minimize transportation distance. The OR/Ed. lab works closely with school districts in politically and emotionally charged environments involving school locations and attendance district changes. The success of IPSAC lies in its approach to enumerate school planning needs and school population growth impression through the use of data. Furthermore, through the operations research optimization techniques, favorable solutions are achieved to satisfy the constraints, needs, and policies of the school district. Recent national studies in active school travel have reported that distance to school and built environment have a significant influence on how children travel to school. These research findings prompted the OR/Ed. lab to investigate ways to enhance IPSAC so that school districts may obtain solutions to include multimode school transportation as one of their considerations. This paper describes the IPSAC process, challenges faced by school districts, and areas in which the integration between school planning and transportation planning deserve explorations. </jats:p>",

Gamma Knife plans were prepared in three ways: by altering the prescription of previously published data, by hand and with the assistance of an automatic planning algorithm (wizard). The linear accelerator plans were prepared utilizing a micro-multileaf collimator in both static and dynamic modes. The dose volume histogram analyses lead to a measure of conformity and the mean and minimum target dose for each plan. Statistical significance was calculated as each planning modality was compared with every other. &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt; All Gamma Knife plans demonstrated a statistically significantly better conformity when compared with fixed field linear accelerator techniques. When compared to linear accelerator techniques the wizard-assisted Gamma Knife plans demonstrated significantly better conformity. The mean target dose for all the Gamma Knife plans was significantly higher than that of the linear accelerator plans (19.2 Gy vs. 13.4 Gy). &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt; Conformity of the prescription isodose to the target shape is of major importance in radiosurgery. The modalities compared represent commercially available and widely accepted systems. Gamma Knife plans derived using the ‘wizard’ option and finalized by hand yield the best conformity.</jats:p>"

In contrast to other models in the real options literature in which learning is viewed as a passive consequence of the delay period, this paper quantifies information acquisition by merging statistical decision theory with the real options framework. In this context, real option attributes are discussed from a Bayesian perspective, thresholds are identified for improved decision‐making, and information's impact on downstream decision‐making is discussed. Using real data provided by a firm in the aerospace maintenance, repair, and overhaul industry, the methodology is used to guide a multi‐phased irreversible investment decision involving process design and capacity planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Product Platform Planning is an emerging philosophy that calls for the planned development and deployment of families of related products. It is markedly different from the traditional product development process, which focuses on optimized designs for individual products. This is a relatively new development in engineering design, which is not typically a part of an engineer’s education. Furthermore, it is different from traditional engineering topics in that it requires an integration of principles from both management and engineering design. All this makes for a new and different topic for which educational material needs to be developed. To address these needs, an online resource has been developed. This resource includes a set of three cases, a tutorial, and a glossary in a multimedia format hosted on the Internet. The tutorial developed for the website presents the basic concepts as well as current research on planning and architecting families of products. The case study section has three cases based on a family of popular power tools. The cases present information in the form of function diagrams, assembly diagrams, customer needs and market-segment data. Links are provided to helpful sites, as well as to relevant sections in the tutorial. Although product platform planning is a relatively new development, a variety of approaches have been used by the research community and practitioners in industry. A need was felt for a comprehensive, coherent source of knowledge in this field on which to base the case studies, and also as a means to providing a single source of information to users of this resource. Accordingly, a literature review was conducted and an overall process description was developed. This paper presents and describes the online learning resource which was developed. In addition, the literature review and the process description of platform planning that were developed are also detailed.</jats:p>",

The DSS is based on the development possibilities of the agricultural sector in relation with the agricultural processing industries of the region and aims at the development of farm regions through a better utilization of available agricultural recourses and agricultural industries. The DSS uses Linear and Goal Programming models and provides for different goals alternative production plans that optimize the use of available recourses. On the other hand, the alternative plans achieve a better utilization of the existent agricultural processing industries or propose their expansion by taking into account the supply and demand of agricultural products in the region. The DSS is computerized and supported by a set of relational data bases. The corresponding software has been developed in Microsoft Windows platform, using Microsoft Visual Basic, Microsoft Access and LINDO. For demonstration reasons, the paper includes an application of the proposed DSS in the region of Servia Kozanis in Northern Greece.</jats:p>"

The authors consider three major clusters of policy and planning activity: urban renewal, high-tech R&amp;D, and tourism and entertainment. In each of these, they illuminate the values, assumptions, and institutional networks of political and business leaders as they shaped postwar industrial development. The authors demonstrate that local public officials and business leaders in St. Louis articulated a new vision for development based on an emerging metropolitan definition of problems and solutions. In effect, planners responded to inner-city industrial decline by restructuring spatial-economic relations across the metropolitan area. This metropolitan articulation of development and space guided restructuring and yielded a range of tangible yet uneven outcomes on the postwar landscape. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the past 5 years, there has been a national movement to integrate context-sensitive solutions (CSS) into transportation project planning and design. Applying CSS principles in the long-range planning process would help ensure that projects were CSS friendly from their earliest conception. This possibility has prompted CSS experts to discuss how CSS can be integrated into long-range planning. Two environmental stewardship initiatives under way at the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) provide a unique opportunity to explore this area. In the first initiative, NCDOT has a substantial CSS training program in place. To date, nearly 800 staff members and consultants have attended 3-day CSS training courses. In a separate stewardship initiative, NCDOT is redesigning the traditional thoroughfare plan process to create a new comprehensive transportation plan (CTP) process. Although these two initiatives have not been explicitly connected, this discussion examines how CSS principles are embedded in the proposed CTP process. However, substantial technical and institutional challenges must be dealt with before the CSS-based CTP process can be implemented fully. The conclusion of this discussion is that a state-of-the-practice, long-range transportation planning process should incorporate the CSS principles and decision-making characteristics that have been adopted in North Carolina. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Njord Field, situated in the Haltenbanken area, is one of the most challenging reservoirs on the Norwegian shelf. The structural complexity is high, with numerous intersecting faults compartmentalizing the reservoir. The reservoir is dominated by alternating shale and sand intervals of tidal, estuarine and deltaic depositional origin.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>One of the main segments on Njord – the Central Area – was the target for a one-year improved oil recovery study. The Central Area reservoir is produced by depletion, with a current recovery factor of only 6%, as most faults appear to seal during production. The previous drilling experience revealed quite large uncertainty with respect to both depth and missing faults due to poor seismic data quality.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>In order to plan further wells in this area a model that comprises the full uncertainty with respect to both structural components (depth uncertainty and faults) and property components (facies, permeability, porosity) was made. The model was built by combining commercial modelling software (IRAP RMS and STORM:HORIZON) with an R&amp;D tool (HAVANA) in a manner that has not been attempted previously, and 200 stochastic realizations were run. Each realization has a different structural 3D grid (depth and fault pattern) and different petrophysical properties. A streamline simulator in IRAP RMS was applied to rank the realizations and ten realizations were chosen for further well screening in the flow simulator (ECLIPSE). The model was applied to propose two new well targets that were robust economically (given all uncertainty). In addition, the model was applied in testing various unconventional well types, for example so-called ‘connector-wells’, which are open holes in the reservoir (but not connected to the surface), in order to connect fault blocks bounded by sealing faults.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Drilling and subsequent seismic interpretation after the model had been built revealed that the structural uncertainty was even greater than predicted.

After the withdrawal of the EU-Commission from the EUREK-process that was organised intergovernmentally until then the evolved organisational and procedural structures of CEMAT and the structures that were newly created by the Commission are existing side by side. The pursuit of European spatial planning interests by the member states is strengthened by the principle of subsidiarity that is included in the European treaties. With the re-organisation of the objective- and competence system of the EU, particularly through the introduction of the aspect of “territorial cohesion” that is associated with article 16 EGV (services of general economic interest), the debate on the European Constitutional Treaty raises different questions regarding the future organisation of a European spatial development policy. At any rate the existing insecurity concerning the competence of the EU in spatial planning is not removed by the constitutional treaty. Political interests that go in the same direction can be followed more effectively within the states and on the European level through the approach of spatial planning policy.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Complexities of applications implemented on embedded and programmable systems grow with the advances in capacities and capabilities of these systems. Mapping applications onto them manually is becoming a very tedious task. This draws attention to using high-level synthesis within design flows. Meanwhile, it is essential to provide a flexible formulation of optimization objectives as well as to perform efficient planning for various design objectives early on in the design flow. In this work, we address these issues in the context of data flow graph (DFG) scheduling, which is an essential element within the high-level synthesis flow. We present an algorithm that schedules a chain of operations with data dependencies among consecutive operations at a single step. This local problem is repeated to generate the schedule for the whole DFG. The local problem is formulated as a maximum weight noncrossing bipartite matching. We use a technique from the computational geometry domain to solve the matching problem. This technique provides a theoretical guarantee on the solution quality for scheduling a single chain of operations. Although still being local, this provides a relatively wider perspective on the global scheduling objectives. In our experiments we compared the latencies obtained using our algorithm with the optimal latencies given by the exact solution to the integer linear programming (ILP) formulation of the problem. In 9 out of 14 DFGs tested, our algorithm found the optimal solution, while generating latencies comparable to the optimal solution in the remaining five benchmarks. The formulation of the objective function in our algorithm provides flexibility to incorporate different optimization goals. We present examples of how to exploit the versatility of our algorithm with specific examples of objective functions and experimental results on the ability of our algorithm to capture these objectives efficiently in the final schedules.</jats:p>",

The profiles of the resulting segments are derived from a descriptive analysis of sociodemographic variables. A tailored genetic algorithm is then used to estimate the parameter of an asymmetrical utility function for each of the resulting segments. The results suggest that the utility of activity duration varies between activities and between segments, and hence sociodemographics. </jats:p>",

This framework and its formulation, once operationalized, would provide transit agencies a practical tool for determining the optimal deployment strategy or strategies given budgetary, institutional, and other types of constraints associated with the corridor for which they have decided to deploy BRT.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Shifting people from driving to using public transportation has been important in alleviating urban traffic congestion. Intelligent transportation system technologies applied to public transportation can provide useful data to system operators and users and increase the use and productivity of high-occupancy vehicles. Integration of metropolitan rapid transit, feeder buses, and taxipooling can attract more public transportation users. Advanced taxipooling transfer assignment systems, a type of advanced public transportation systems program, aims to apply advanced technologies to taxi operations, including dynamic taxi fleet management, taxipooling strategies, and safety monitoring systems. Success in using taxis as a feeder service to mass transit systems requires advanced information technologies such as the Global Positioning System, geographic information systems, wireless communications, and, most important, an efficient taxi dispatching algorithm. The objectives and background of a dedicated taxipooling fleet in a metropolitan area are given. Also, a real-time, two-step taxipooling dispatching system is presented. A case study with parameter values obtained from Taiwan is explained; the simulation result is interpreted to illustrate the feasibility of the algorithm. Sensitivity analysis proves the robustness of the dispatching algorithm and shows the flexibility decision makers can have to serve certain purposes. Assumptions and constraints of the proposed dispatching system are evaluated, and the possibility of system expansion is discussed. </jats:p>",

Preoperatively, the lesions were interpreted as calcified disc herniations. Both patients underwent surgery in which an extended transfacet pedicle-sparing approach was used. Incision of the posterior longitudinal ligament released soft degenerated material. In both cases, histological examination showed abundant degenerative debris along with CPPD crystals.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">Spinal CPPD deposition is a comparatively rare disease that almost invariably involves the posterior aspect of the spinal canal, typically the ligamentum flavum. The exceptional foraminal location of the lesions reported here, combined with the surgical findings, indicated that the CPPD crystals were deposited on a laterally herniated disc fragment. A distinctive feature in both cases was the soft consistency of the resected tissue. The consistency of the disc material and the location of the lesion in the axial plane (that is, median compared with lateral) are key factors in determining the optimal surgical approach to thoracic disc herniations. In describing consistency, terms such as “calcified” and “hard” have been used interchangeably in the literature. In the cases reported here, what appeared on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies to be densely calcified lesions were shown intraoperatively to be soft herniations.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\">The authors' experience underscores that not all densely calcified herniated discs are hard. Although detection of this discrepancy would have left surgical planning for the lateral disc herniations unchanged, it could have altered planning for centrally or centrolaterally located disc herniations.</jats:p>",

Using proximity to major highways in New York City as a case study, we review methodological issues pertinent to both fields and discuss choice and computation of exposure measures, but focus primarily on measures of inequity. We present inequity measures computed from the empirically estimated joint distribution of exposure and demographics and compare them with traditional measures such as linear regression, logistic regression, and Theil's entropy index. We find that measures computed from the full joint distribution provide more unified, transparent, and intuitive operational definitions of inequity and show how the approach can be used to structure siting and decommissioning decisions. </jats:p>",

However, the literature is not clear about the extent to which transit agencies are using planning support software programs for daily activities. To determine the state of the practice in the use of planning support software in the U.S. transit agencies, a survey was conducted. The survey found that the use of planning support software confirms the general trend in the use of information technology: that is, its use is directly related to the size of the transit agencies. Larger transit agencies tend to use more planning support software, while small agencies do not use that much. Probably one of the most important findings is that many smaller transit agencies consider the purchase and use of planning support software in transit planning, operation, and marketing as unnecessary, especially given the difficulties in obtaining funding, training staff, and hiring and retaining technical support personnel. However, those difficulties are mainly caused by constraints in budgeting and technical staffing issues rather than the undesirability of or the unproved or unrealized benefits related to the use of planning support. </jats:p>",

In the project RBI plays an important role as this quantifies the relation between the overall performances of the platforms in their present condition with their future deterioration and facilitates the identification of strategies for cost efficient condition control by means of targeted inspection and maintenance activities and if necessary repair and strengthening. For the purpose of facilitating efficient RBI for larger number of structures of more or less similar characteristics, a generic scheme for RBI is pursued. The specific aspects of the generic RBI for the considered group of structures in regard to risk acceptance criteria, modeling of inspection qualities and the probabilistic fatigue and fracture mechanical modeling are outlined. Finally also a study is reported whereby the benefit of the RBI approach is assessed as a means of risk control in comparison to standard code based requirement for inspection planning.</jats:p>",

Systems such as the da Vinci<jats:sup>TM</jats:sup> surgical system of Intuitive Surgical Inc., which facilitates minimally invasive surgery with increased dexterity, are commercially available. Preoperative simulation and planning of surgical robot setups should accompany advanced robotic surgery if their advantages are to be further pursued. Feedback from the planning system will play an essential role in computer‐aided robotic surgery in addition to preoperative detailed geometric information from patient CT/MRI images. Surgical robot setup simulation systems for appropriate trocar site placement have been developed especially for abdominal surgery. The motion of the surgical robot can be simulated and rehearsed with kinematic constraints at the trocar site, and the inverse‐kinematics of the robot. Results from simulation using clinical patient data verify the effectiveness of the proposed system. Copyright © 2005 Robotic Publications Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century requires metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to incorporate safety and security into the transportation planning process as one of the seven planning factors. The Hampton Roads Planning District Commission (HRPDC) is the designated MPO for Southeastern Virginia. In 2001, as part of its congestion management system (CMS) program, the HRPDC staff initiated a comprehensive regional safety study, which included collecting comprehensive crash data and creating a regional database for 151 Interstate segments and 13,000 intersections. The crash severity method was used to analyze, rank, and determine the top high-crash locations for Interstate segments as well as the CMS intersections. This regional safety study was designed to help local communities understand safety-related problems and issues. Congestion, failure to yield the right-of-way, following too closely, driver inattention, and disregarding traffic signals were found to be the main causes of traffic crashes in Hampton Roads between 1998 and 2000. Rear-ends and right angles were the predominant crash types during the period. The study analyzed and recommended a series of safety-related countermeasures and solutions for the top-10 high-crash locations throughout the region. Some common countermeasures that were recommended were adding roadway capacity, adding turn lanes at intersections, improving signal timing, improving signage, increasing enforcement, and providing additional driver education. </jats:p>",

A survey of practices in each of the state DOTs explored documents and synthesized both strategic planning processes and asset management. With input from an expert advisory panel, five states were the subjects of detailed analysis: Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, and Pennsylvania. Each of the states was visited by a project team that spent 2 days on-site. Information on the strategic planning and asset management process was obtained through personal interviews with DOT officials and the acquisition of materials describing these processes. Based on detailed documentation of the practices in each of these states, a synthesis of best practices of the linkage between asset management and strategic planning was developed. The resulting model process does not represent any particular state, but incorporates elements from all five states. This synthesis can provide useful guidance to states interested in augmenting their existing processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> With the objective of achieving an array of transportation, environmental, fiscal, and social benefits, state and regional agencies are increasingly undertaking initiatives to promote local comprehensive planning as well as smart growth development patterns. Numerous metropolitan planning organizations and some state transportation agencies are looking to land use strategies to help limit the growth of vehicle travel, improve mobility and accessibility, and reduce infrastructure investment needs. Yet evidence on the transportation benefits of state and regional planning initiatives is limited. Five case studies were conducted of states and regions with a history of comprehensive planning initiatives directed toward smart growth objectives. Modeling studies, empirical research, and monitoring programs were reviewed to determine how these areas measure the performance of their policies and what findings have resulted. Models and empirical evidence suggest that land use strategies, if successfully implemented, can play a role in reducing vehicle travel and associated impacts. Implementation of state and regional policies in most areas, though, has been weak because of a limited ability to affect land use decisions at the local level. Furthermore, many areas’ initiatives are too recent to observe widespread changes to land use patterns or to measure the resulting impact on transportation conditions. Improved information systems are beginning to be deployed in some areas and should provide additional insights into the effects of state and regional planning initiatives. </jats:p>",

The results revealed that on an average Bhavanisagar and Madurai receive 636 and 845 mm of rainfall annualy with a Coefficient of Variation of 35 and 21%. The average seasonal rainfall of South West Monsoon is 181 and 313 mm with a Co-efficient of Variation of 59 and 28 per cent. Both the locations are dominated by North East Monsoon season (302 and 376 mm) rainfall with more than 40% variability. North East Monsoon accounts for 48 and 45 per cent of total annual rainfall at Bhavanisagar and Madurai, respectively. The highest mean rainfall of 144 and 150 mm was recorded during the month October at Bhavanisagar and Madurai, respectively. The standard weeks 38 40 and 42nd - 47th have &gt;50% chance to get 25 mm of rainfall in Bhavanisagar. At Madurai, standard weeks from 36 to 47 had more than 50% chance to get 25 mm of rainfall. At both the locations the chance of getting sowing rain seldom exceeds the threshold level of 67%, indicating risk of dry seeding under dryland condition. However, the analysis indicated that dry seeding could be taken up under dryland condition with substantial risk both at Bhavanisagar and Madurai. At Bhavanisagar region there is more chance for intermittent dry spell and hence drought resistant short duration grain legumes and groundnut may be suggested.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditionally, estimates of the distribution and abundance of exploited groundfish species and their associated habitats are based on fishery-dependent sampling of catch and fishery-independent survey data using fishing gears such as trawls and a variety of fixed gears. Survey data are often collected as individual samples integrated over a scale of kilometers, compiled at a larger geographic scale (100 km), and extrapolated to an overall estimate of stock size. Considerations of the nonextractive effects of fishing on habitat are extremely limited. Within the past 15 years, a number of collaborations have developed among marine ecologists, fisheries scientists, and marine geologists hallmarked by an integration of sonar mapping of the seafloor with ground-truthing (verification of type of substratum) and direct observation and enumeration of fish and invertebrate populations in the context of their seafloor habitat. An example of such work, targeting a 725-km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, deepwater, rocky bank from the Oregon continental margin, Heceta Bank, is chronicled in this review. The approaches that have been applied to characterize groundfish–habitat relationships in this region have evolved from stand-alone, human-occupied submersible observations to fully interdisciplinary programs employing the most advanced technologies available to marine research. The combination of multibeam swath mapping sonars and accurate geographic positioning systems has enhanced mapping the seafloor and benthic habitats. The challenge now is to efficiently relate small-scale observations and assessments of animal–habitat associations to the large geographic scales on which fisheries operate. Large-scale benthic habitat characterization at appropriate scales is critical to the accurate assessment of fish stocks on a spatial scale pertinent to fisheries and those natural physical and biological processes and anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., fishing gear impacts) that influence them.</jats:p>"
