      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental planners must often attempt to manage participatory forums in which the policy issues pit individuals' selfinterests against the needfor collective cooperation. Psychologists investigate the nature of these social dilemmas both through formal models and in laboratory tests of individual choice behavior Planners have little empirical evidencefrom their own field on which to base assumptions about the basic processes motivating conflict or cooperation among different interests. Findings from the psychological research provide some insight into those motives and the conditions under which cooperation becomes more likely; for example, when communication about issues and knowledge about the impacts of noncooperation are both high. On the other hand, dilemmas researchers often assume away an important dimension of the problem-individual decisions to communicate about a conflict-fy treating it as an exogenously controlled factor Changing that and other aspects of their research models will improve the usefulness of the results for practice. </jats:p>",

The\nmarket intelligence practices most frequently used are observing\ncompetitors and talking with suppliers or delivery people. Small\nbusiness owners were least likely to use practices such as job\ninterviews or hiring competitors′ employees to gain information.\nRespondents perceived their competitors as being more likely to pursue\nmarket intelligence activities.

Some confusions around locality studies are also examined, in particular their incorrect equation with concrete research, description, the impact of the spatial on the social, and the postmodern. The discussion then turns to some recent arguments, especially those of Harvey, which imply that local foci are not progressive; the various strands of this position are examined and debated.

The author takes issue with that contention. The locality has usually been defined with reference to the rounds of investment and production decisions which have been central to the construction of local labour markets. This is not the level at which household arrangements can best be understood. The local labour market will be a necessary contextualising element in analysis, but household dynamics will also be affected by, for example, influences operating at national level, such as the regulation of the benefit system, influences operating at an ideological level, such as the patriarchal ordering of work and employment relations, and the more immediate social world in which the household is located. It is argued here that this world is best conceptualised with reference to social networks which often operate at neighbourhood level, rather than through ‘locality’ differences defined as local labour markets. </jats:p>",

Certain characteristics of the problem led to a new innovative approach, for example, the need for the majority of customer rolls to be splice free and a lack of homogeneity in the raw material. I based my system on a two-phase integer programming approach. At phase 1, a suite of integer models are solved using a “look-ahead” strategy to generate a set of alternatives for phase 2 to select from. Since, implementation diagramming waste has improved by over 50 percent, yielding benefits in excess of $2 million in the first year. Other benefits include increased productivity of the cutting machine, less time devoted to diagramming, an increased ability to move to a shorter planning horizon, and the capability to better match supply to demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The debate about locality studies has provided a focus for wider concerns about method and the relationship of theory and empirical research in urban and regional studies. Discussion of these issues has been plagued by conceptual confusion. Where realist philosophy has been invoked in the debate it has frequently been misunderstood. The problems derive from unexamined and inconsistent usages of a series of dualisms or binary oppositions: viz, contextualising versus nomological (law-seeking) approaches, abstract and concrete, necessity and contingency, theory and empirics, and generality and specificity. When the various uses of these terms are examined it is found that the assumed contrasts either break down or involve more complex relationships than is commonly realised. The main purpose of the paper is to deconstruct the dualisms and expose some of the confusions they generate by reference to the locality debate. A subsidiary theme concerns the way in which different conceptions of generality, specificity, and interdependence form ‘metaphysics’ which tend, unnoticed, to dominate whole research programmes. As different metaphysics may be appropriate for different objects of study it is important to demonstrate their differences and respective limitations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the recent ‘locality studies’ literature suffers from a poorly theorised conception of the cultural dimensions of social and economic change. Despite frequent references to political cultures, regional traditions, and local loyalties, the emphasis of most ‘locality studies’ has been on questions of employment, spatial divisions of labour, and the geography of production, specified in terms of local labour markets. There has been some discussion of the social definition of skill, the meaning of ‘work’, and the intersection of class and gender relations in particular places at specific times. But the significance of local cultures has been much less carefully theorised, leading to an unnecessarily truncated analysis of urban and regional change. The author suggests some alternative theorisations of ‘local culture’, drawing on concepts of cultural politics (from Stuart Hall), structures of feeling (Raymond Williams), cultural capital (Pierre Bourdieu) and local knowledge (Clifford Geertz). These notions are then applied to the process of arts-related urban reinvestment, and it is concluded that the field of urban and regional studies has much to gain from a more sophisticated understanding of cultural change. </jats:p>",

The relation of these categories to the sociocultural context and the everyday practices of individuals is discussed, and a reinterpretation of the concept of region as a sociocultural and historical category is put forward. The region is comprehended as a historically contingent process whose institutionalisation consists of four stages: the development of territorial, symbolic, and institutional shape and its establishment as an entity in the regional system and social consciousness of the society. During the institutionalisation process a region becomes an established entity—with a specific regional identity—which is acknowledged in different spheres of social action and consciousness and which is continually reproduced in individual and institutional practices. The constitution of the local or regional consciousness of individuals is interpreted through the concept of place, which refers to personal experience and meanings contained in personal life-histories. These concepts together promote an understanding of how regions can be created and reproduced as part of the regional transformation of society and how individuals are contextualised into this process by reproducing region-specific structures of expectations. Generation is suggested as a mediating category for comprehending the relations between region and place. </jats:p>",

The first is developed through linking local dependence to territorial forms of the division of labour; to enable this a new concept, ‘the scale division of labour’, is introduced. This concept describes what roles in the social division of labour exist at different scales, and hence of what social relations the localised social structure consists. The locality as agent concept is developed from the idea of locally dependent actors with interests in the same locality forming an alliance, acting together to develop and implement strategies to further their interests. This avoids spatial fetishism because locality was first defined not in physical terms, but as localised social structure. </jats:p>",

On the other hand, classical single objective planning models have usually considered only the basic aspects. This paper describes a multiobjective model to find the optimal voltage profile and to look for the least cost system expansion simultaneously. Furthermore, two multiobjective techniques for the application of the model to distribution system expansion problems are outlined. The computer results have shown that multiobjective models are able to find solutions which include multiple planning objectives simultaneously, and that these solutions are advantageous compared with the ones from classical single objective models.</jats:p>",

These recent experiences with drought have renewed concern about the inadequacy of federal and state contingency planning efforts and the lack of coordination for assessment and response efforts between these levels of government. This paper presents the results of research aimed at facilitating the preparation of drought contingency plans by state government in conjunction with a state's overall water management planning activity. The ten‐step drought plan development process reported is intended to improve mitigation efforts through more timely, effective, and efficient assessment and response activities. Officials in appropriate state agencies should examine the proposed framework and alter it to best address drought‐related concerns, adding or deleting elements as necessary.</jats:p>",

In order to clarify how continuing educational efforts can be designed and evaluated, we report on our continuing educational projects and research which culminated in research on a nationwide educational intervention about AIDS for dentists.

It is argued that the problem of structure versus agency can never be solved once and for all by philosophical arguments, but always has to be rephrased into empirically manageable terms. This is possible through use of the ‘most similar’ approach of comparative analysis. When external structural determinants of policy are kept under control, local variations can be traced back to locally specific determinants. These determinants must be examined in depth through case studies. This also paves the way for empirically based counterfactual reasoning. Thus, the extent to which local actors are not just forced by structural determinants to act in a certain way can be estimated. The general approach is illustrated by reference to a case study of local housing policies in Sweden. Some critical questions are raised. One must not forget that structures and actors, whether national or local, are inseparably bound up with processes, and that ‘structures’ are always just crystallised results of human action. </jats:p>",

It is available in two versions, and is used extensively to help interdisciplinary planning teams develop forest-wide plans as dictated by the National Forest Management Act of 1976. Nine years of experience clearly show that while the system is working in a technical sense, troublesome issues remain. This paper begins with an overview of how USDA Forest Service planning has evolved. We then give mathematical formulations for portions of FORPLAN models and examples of how the system is used to aid planners on national forests. We present an evaluation of the use of FORPLAN that addresses five criteria including, problems associated with large-scale models and systematic, comprehensive planning, Forest Service organizational issues, the role of foresters in national forest management, and conflicts over competing land uses. We then consider lessons for operations research practitioners. Finally, we discuss a number of conclusions and recommendations, the most important being the need for the Forest Service to more clearly specify the role of forest planning in the overall agency planning hierarchy and the role of FORPLAN in forest planning. </jats:p>",
