To reach this goal two ways are open: either by collecting information for each individual entering a care‐sector about one or more previous situations or by following the individuals through various situations of entering, passing through and leaving care‐sectors. This latter method, the method of the so‐called longitudinal statistics, provides greater possibilities because extrapolation is easier and one can link the different previous situations. The relevant factors can be quantified and the data for model building become available.</jats:p><jats:p>The development in registration and in automation makes the compilation of longitudinal statistics ‐far as necessary on a sample basis ‐ a practical possibility.</jats:p>",

It is proposed that efforts made in the behavioral sciences to reconcile different views of behavior change may be fruitfully applied in reconciling different methods used by juvenile court judges and other court personnel. Herbert Kelman's conceptual framework for comparing different methods of inducing change (\"compliance,\" \"identification,\" and \"internalization\") has provided a means of integrating behavioral science theories and findings. It is used here as a guide for comparing the usefulness of different influence methods in working with juvenile offenders. It is concluded that both direct efforts to influence action and indirect efforts aimed at modifying attitudes may be effective. It is suggested that the use of influence agents dissociated from the court, group settings, and work roles offers opportunities for coordinating various approaches. </jats:p>",
