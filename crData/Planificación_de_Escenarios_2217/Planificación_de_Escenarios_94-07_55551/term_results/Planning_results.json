Reform has been gradual, with changes being radical at the beginning and becoming more incremental as time passes. As responsibilities for local development are transferred to popularly- elected municipal governments, more qualified planners will be needed. Universities are now adapting to this new demand for planning professionals to respond to a new notion of planning. </jats:p>",

In search of a definition the author compares the rhetorical features of the traditional thesis to those of other kinds of culminating master's degree exercises, namely the essay, project, and evocative presentation. He then suggests that scholarly articles written for professional audiences can serve as good models for the traditional thesis. This paper presents a list of questions for guiding the critical reading of these model articles. </jats:p>",

Differences between corporate enterprises and nonprofit community organizations raise questions whether strategic planning can help the latter. This article presents a case study in strategic planning by a Jewish community federation. Religious differences led to conflicts over policy and procedures. However, planning participants had political and psychological interests in seeing the community as unified. As a result, they followed consensus procedures that let them avoid examining differences, but led to decisions that the majority did not like. Strategic planning cannot escape addressing social, cultural, and psychological differences and conflicts about them. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Globalization is resulting in an urbanizing and a ruralizing world, both with planning issues needing urgent attention. Furthermore, as city and country increasingly interact, a third phenomenon emerges—rurbanization. Globalization challenges us to address this phenomenon and both of its parents—urban and rural. Our urban bias renders us inadequate to the task. And yet with the interactions between planning and place as one of our core concerns, we should be uniquely positioned to respond. Reclaiming the rural dimension also enriches a powerful learning tool—comparing planning between contrasting places—that helps drive the development of our field. Rural areas need planners. But in turn, to achieve our full potential, we need the rural dimension. </jats:p>",

States are increasingly adopting new or strengthening existing growth management programs that mandate local governments to prepare and adopt comprehensive plans. This study examines the influence of state mandates on the content and quality of comprehensive plans from 139 local governments in five states. Three components of the plans are analyzed: fact basis, goals, and policies. This study indicates that state mandates have a clearly measurable effect in enhancing plan quality. The findings also suggest that the design of the mandate itself can be important in determining local plan quality. </jats:p>",

I assert that the language and concepts of town planning continue to take precedence in both the field of practice and in teaching and research and that this is a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. Town planners relegate urban and regional political economy to the periphery and place town planning at the centre. This is a conservative situation in that most town planning education places great emphasis on plans and very little on ‘how cities and regions work’. I recommend the abandonment of ‘planning’ education in favour of spatial political economy which might sit easiest in human geography. </jats:p>",

We compared waiting‐list lengths for seven surgical procedures to the rates of these procedures. The numbers of procedures were obtained from the 1987 Finnish Hospital Discharge Register, and the numbers of patients on the waiting lists were obtained from an inquiry made to Finnish hospitals in 1987. Correlation coefficients were calculated between population‐based waiting‐list lengths and procedure rates</jats:p><jats:p>Significant, positive correlations were found between population‐based waiting‐list lengths and rates for operations on hallux valgus, for herniorrhaphy and for hysterectomy. Rates for cholecystectomy and haemorrhoidectomy were also positively correlated with waiting‐list lengths, but these correlations were not statistically significant. There was no correlation for varicose‐vein operations, and a negative correlation for cataract extraction. These results suggest that insufficient resources are not the <jats:italic>only</jats:italic> reason for long waiting lists; but, both long waiting lists and a high rate of surgery can result from a high demand for surgery, influenced by physicians' decisions. If the waiting list is long because surgical treatment is preferred, the answer is not necessarily to increase resources, but to examine critically the indications for surgery.</jats:p>",

The Swedish health care system has no tradition of goal formulation of this type. Hence, the purpose of this article is to clarify the goal‐setting process of performance standards, and to examine whether goal setting is a relevant method within the organization of a Swedish county council. Goal setting can be seen partly as a control method and partly as an administrative process</jats:p><jats:p>The approach used is a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. Data have been collected from interviews, observations, notes taken in the field and available performance statistics. The analysis shows that working towards a goal is made easier through a common and simple concept. It ‘stands and falls’ with the management of the work and its manager. Good communications and information are important prerequisites if goal formulation, through dialogue, is to succeed, This process takes time and can be described as an iterative process, in which a common behaviour pattern develops a ‘we‐feeling’ which spreads among the staff. It is important that the goal is relevant and directly related to the basic objects of the work. It is also crucial that the goal is realistic and reflects a priority. Goal formulation relating to performance standards can be a contributing factor to staff's experience of job satisfaction through increased engagement and motivation, and to the satisfaction of patients/relatives with the care given</jats:p><jats:p>It is difficult to formulate performance standards; there are many problems and obstacles. If goal formulation as a control method within the health care system in Sweden is to work, clearer manifestations of political will are necessary and also better measuring methods in order to guage achievement.</jats:p>",

A video was used to assess mothers' recognition and interpretation of clinical signs of serious illness. Mothers were questioned about which of the locally available provider options they would choose for four different locally‐defined ARI illnesses; they were also read brief descriptions of hypothetical cases, and asked how they would recommend treating children in those situations. These results were compared with reported care‐seeking practices during past ARI episodes that occurred in their own children</jats:p><jats:p>The results indicate that mothers generally recognize rapid or difficult breathing, but do not use the recognition to take appropriate actions. The data suggest that a substantial proportion of children in the study area, who are perceived to have severe respiratory illnesses, may not be brought to the government health facilities for treatment. Implications of the findings for the training policies and strategies of the Egyptian national ARI program are considered.</jats:p>",

Given the configurations (position and direction) of two points, we search for the trajectory that minimizes the integral of acceleration (tangential and normal). The resulting trajectory should not only be smooth but also safe in order to be applicable in real-life situations. Therefore, we investigate two different obstacle-avoidance constraints that satisfy the minimization problem. Unfortunately, in this case the problem becomes more complex and not suitable for real time implementations. Therefore, we introduce two simple solutions, based on the idea of polynomial fitting, to generate safe trajectories once a collision is detected with the original smooth trajectory. Simulation results of the different algorithms are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Of major concern in fully automated computerized treatment delivery is the possibility of gantry/couch or gantry/patient collisions. In this work, software has been developed to detect collisions between gantry and couch or patient for both transaxial and noncoplanar treatment fields during the treatment planning process. The code uses the gantry angles, turntable angles, and position of the couch surface relative to the isocenter supplied by the planner for the prescribed radiation fields. In addition, the maximum patient anterior–posterior and lateral separations are entered in order to model the patient outline by a conservative cylindrical ellipse. By accessing a database containing the precise mechanical dimensions of the therapy equipment, 3D analytical geometry is used to test for collisions between gantry/patient and gantry/couch for each treatment field. When collisions are detected, the software inspects the use of an extended distance treatment, by recalculating and testing for collisions, with the couch at a greater distance from the collimator along the direction of the central axis. If a collision is avoided at extended distance, the lateral, longitudinal, and vertical motions of the couch are recorded for entry into the treatment plan, or else a warning message is printed, together with the nearest permissible collision‐free gantry angle. Upon inspection, the planner can either elect to use the calculated closest permissible gantry angle or reject the plan. The software verifies that each proposed treatment field is safe, but also that the transition between fields is collision‐free. This requires that the sequence of the treatment fields be ordered, preferably into a sequence which minimizes the delivery time compatible with patient safety. A separate program, referred to as a segment manager, has been developed to optimize the sequence of the treatment planner's radiation fields. When collisions are possible on the transition between treatment fields, intermediate couch positions are inserted into the treatment delivery procedure to ensure a continual safe distance between both the couch and patient and the moving gantry. Treatment segments are organized according to gantry angle, beginning at 180°, and sequentially stepping clockwise around the patient. The use of extended distance treatment is proposed as a means of increasing the safety zone between the patient and the gantry. As the gantry rotates, one proposal to maximize patient safety would maintain the couch at extended distance. In this case, the couch prescribes a circle around the isocenter, which is maintained at 180° out of phase with the gantry motion.</jats:p>",

At first, channel and junction are defined by using half-spaces, and free-space inside the female part is approximately decomposed by channels and junctions. Then, a simple and efficient algorithm to find the assembly path of the male part is developed, in which any path between the shortest and safest paths can be easily found by just changing the clearance gap between the male and female parts. Next, the robot arm is considered in the path planning, in which a feasible grasp angle region is obtained to avoid a collision between the robot arm and the female part during the assembly process. An optimum grasping angle can be found in the feasible grasping angle region by applying a proper performance index. Finally, a simple robotic assembly using the algorithm is numerically demonstrated.</jats:p>",

Our ‘navigator’ basically consists of two neural networks: The first one is a modified feed-forward neural network, which is used to determine the configuration space; the moving object is modelled as a configuration point in the configuration space. The second neural network is a modified bidirectional associative memory, which is used to find a path for the configuration point through the configuration space while avoiding the configuration obstacles. The basic processing unit of the neural networks may be constructed using logic gates, including AND gates, OR gates, NOT gate and flip flops. Examples of efficient solutions to difficult motion planning problems using our proposed techniques are presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Das Thema Gewalt gegen Frauen im öffentlichen Raum und die Bedrohung von Frauen durch diese Gewalt ist ein Problembereich, der nicht nur im gesamtgesellschaftlichen Kontext, sondern in der jüngsten Zeit zunehmend auch auf kommunaler Ebene diskutiert wird. Dies geschieht nicht zuletzt aus dem Grund, daß sich konkrete Verbesserungen auf dieser Ebene leichter verwirklichen lassen und verstärkt auch von den betroffenen Frauen gefordert werden. Innerhalb dieses Diskussionsstranges ist auch unsere Studie anzusiedeln. Dennoch stellt sie in mancher Hinsicht einen neuen Ansatz dar, vor allem, was die Kombination von Ansätzen aus Soziologie und Sozialgeographie sowie die inhaltlichen Schwerpunkte anbelangt. Während sich der soziologische Blickwinkel der Opferwerdung von Frauen durch Gewaltdelikte sowie die empfundene Bedrohung auf der Handlungsebene widmet, werden im geographischen Teil die angst-räumlichen Bezüge zwischen den genannten Orten, den Wohnorten und den häufig frequentierten Stellen Heidelbergs hergestellt sowie mit den aus Polizeistatistik, Lokalpresse und Frauennotruf bekannten Vorfällen in Bezug gesetzt.</jats:p>"

Dynamic movement problems are of fundamental importance to robotics, but their computational complexity has not previously been investigated.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We provide evidence that the 3-D dynamic movement problem is intractable even if B has only a constant number of degrees of freedom of movement. In particular, we prove the problem is PSPACE-hard if B is given a velocity modulus bound on its movements and is NP-hard even if B has no velocity modulus bound, where, in both cases, B has 6 degrees of freedom. To prove these results, we use a unique method of simulation of a Turing machine that uses time to encode configurations (whereas previous lower bound proofs in robotic motion planning used the system position to encode configurations and so required unbounded number of degrees of freedom).</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>\n            We also investigate a natural class of dynamic problems that we call\n            <jats:italic>asteroid avoidance problems</jats:italic>\n            : B, the object we wish to move, is a convex polyhedron that is free to move by translation with bounded velocity modulus, and the polyhedral obstacles have known translational trajectories but cannot rotate. This problem has many applications to robot, automobile, and aircraft collision avoidance. Our main positive results are polynomial time algorithms for the 2-D asteroid avoidance problem, where B is a moving polygon and we assume a constant number of obstacles, as well as single exponential time or polynomial space algorithms for the 3-D asteroid avoidance problem, where B is a convex polyhedron and there are arbitrarily many obstacles. Our techniques for solving these asteroid avoidance problems use “normal path” arguments, which are an intereting generalization of techniques previously used to solve static shortest path problems.\n          </jats:p>\n          <jats:p>We also give some additional positive results for various other dynamic movers problems, and in particular give polynomial time algorithms for the case in which B has no velocity bounds and the movements of obstacles are algebraic in space-time.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of locational avoidance is applied to the process of nonmetropolitan industrialisation by means of a periodisation involving two phases of locational avoidance. During the phase of Fordist mass production, certain labour-intensive industries decentralised to low-wage non-metropolitan areas to avoid locating close to other firms where there was a danger of wages subsequently being bid up. In the present phase, characterised by a tendency towards flexible accumulation, a new wave of more capital-intensive industries has sought out nonmetropolitan areas, again displaying a pattern of locational avoidance, but mainly in order to retain the human capital invested in their skilled labour force. This second dispersed arrangement of industry stands in stark contrast to the flexible production agglomerations that have been formed elsewhere in new industrial spaces during the same period, even though both were produced under regimes of flexible accumulation. A series of conjectures exploring these ideas is examined in light of the locational behaviour of firms locating in the Georgian Bay nonmetropolitan area north of Toronto. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the current beginnings of the mapping of the consumer society there is an evident tension between political-economic and poststructuralist accounts of consumption. It has been suggested that a philosophy of difference does nothing more than mimic a capitalist ideology of choice; that it represents a levelling of philosophy to the vulgar status of consumerism. The counterposition asserts a lack of tolerance to difference inherent in the rationalism of Marxism, which ultimately adheres to production as its central, stabilizing, metaphysical concept. In examining such ideas we seek to ground judgmental positions with respect to the political status of consumption (and of production) in notions of collectivity and action. To this end we provide a brief discussion of the history of consumer cooperation as a political force. More generally, by elucidating the political potentialities of different philosophical approaches, which present themselves as opposites, we hope to interrupt—interminably and retroactively—the development of a geography of the consumer society which is simply additive to existing geographies of the productive society. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the wake of the Möbius spiralling of relativism and reflexivity, much of the theoretically inclined literature within human geography has turned to the motifs of difference and otherness as a possible basis for fostering a coming together and rapprochement of previously incommensurate theoretical-practices. Much of this effort has been undertaken in an explicit attempt to maintain political, moral, and ethical responsibility in the face of a dangerous slide into passive nihilism and indifference. In the first half of the paper I argue that the attempt to forge a universal currency which would enable difference to circulate freely within contemporary human geography is flawed for three interrelated reasons. First, by working through a libidinal economy of negation it forces difference to conform to the Same. Specifically, difference is captured as so-many standard deviations from the Norm. Second, this apparatus of capture is predestined to yield a state of confusion, imprecision, and indistinction which can only be contained within a quotation market. Third, by dwelling upon negation and appropriation, and through capturing difference within a normalized economy of the Same, the forging of a universal currency within a quotation market deprives itself of the ability to effectively affirm difference, otherness, alterity, and singularity in and of themselves. Such an affirmation would require an act of ex-appropriation, rather than one of appropriation. Consequently, by drawing upon the liminal materialism of a deconstructive experience, in the second half of the paper I explore four movements of ex-appropriation: radical passivity, destabilization on the move, telephony, and picnolepsy. The paper concludes with a discussion of the ethics of the event. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to use the work of Derrida in order to deconstruct the justifications and techniques associated with the quantitative revolution in human geography during the 1960s. The paper is divided into four main parts. First, the idea of deconstruction as proposed by Derrida is summarized. Second, the five justifications that have been proposed for the use of mathematics by early quantitative geographers are given—universality, logicalness, objectivity, simplicity, and precision. Those justifications, it is argued, act in Derrida's terms as ‘presences’ on which the logocentric system of mathematics is founded. Third, those five justifications are then deconstructed. It is argued that each justification is beset by a contradiction that, in turn, mitigates the realization of the final logocentric system of mathematics. Fourth, by way of a case study, one particular type of mathematics is examined, inferential statistics. It is suggested that inferential statistics is based not upon some final presence, but on a metaphor taken from eugenics. That metaphor, however, clashed with several existing ones within traditional geography with the result that it ultimately failed, a fact subsequently recognized even by the geographical proponents of quantitative methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The limits of critique are politically significant. Such politics become examinable through deconstruction as a form of interested closure. To do this, however, it is first necessary to distinguish the Derridean deconstruction of writing from the purely literalist interpretations it is commonly but mistakenly given. The example subsequently used as an illustration of limited critique is a conference paper on the ‘Gulf War’ previously presented by the author in 1991. This paper drew on feminist psychoanalytic theories in order to critique the geopolitical effects of masculinist nationalism made manifest in the war. It is reprinted here and then reexamined in terms of its problematic production of truth through writing. This reexamination is pursued at three levels: by considering the conference paper's instrumentalisation of feminist theories and the questions this entails about male academics and feminism; by examining the dangers of normalisation inherent to the normative frameworks of psychoanalytic criticism; and by indicating some of the specific differences that were concealed as this form of criticism was brought to bear in an explanation of the chauvinism of the war. Although deconstruction is shown to offer a way of monitoring how critique risks erasing the heterogeneous through an inevitable essentialism, it is also argued that it is vital to come to terms with the political definition of such risks. </jats:p>",

Toxicity data were fitted with a logistic dose-effect curve. The IC10 is defined as the concentration of a toxicant inhibiting the mineralization rate for 10% The IC10 concentrations of benzene, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, pentachlorophenol, and zinc on the benzoate mineralization were 150, 0 04, 71, 6, and 842 mg/kg sediment dry weight, respectively. This latter value includes the background concentration of 800 mg Zn/kg sediment The mineralization of 4-chlorophenol and benzoate showed similarities in the sensitivity to these toxicants. 4-Chlorophenol can be degraded via benzoate, which might explain the similarities in sensitivity of both mineralization reactions. Chloroform proved to be extremely toxic to anaerobic mineralization reactions, which might be attributed to the formation of very toxic and reactive intermediates formed during the slow anaerobic degradation of the chloroform in anaerobic sediments Sediment quality criteria derived solely from standard toxicity tests using aerobic organisms may lead to complete inhibition of several important microbial processes in anaerobic sediments</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The passage of P.L. 99--457 and subsequent reauthorization (P.L. 102--119) resulted in significant changes in education and related services for young children with disabilities and their families. As a result of P.L. 99--457, transition of children and families from infant/toddler programs to preschool programs has become an area of primary concern for persons working with young children and their families. Facilitating smooth transitions depends on interagency collaboration at both state and local levels, as well as preparation of children, families, and staff. This article describes a model project for facilitating interagency collaboration at both state and local levels. Project Sequenced Transition to Education in the Public Schools (STEPS) was funded initially as a demonstration project and more recently as a national outreach project through the Early Education Program for Children with Disabilities. Four primary components of Project STEPS are (a) interagency and administrative issues, (b) staff involvement in the transition process, (c) family involvement in the transition process, and (d) child preparation for the next environment. Project STEPS incorporates a model for team training related to each of these four components, as well as overall transition system development. </jats:p>",

Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques allow detailed delineation of cardiovascular anatomy and blood flow in young infants with rapid heart rates. The present study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the role of MRI in the presurgical evaluation of patients with heterotaxy syndrome.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>METHODS AND RESULTS</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Between January 1 and December 31, 1992, 14 consecutive patients with heterotaxy syndrome and complex congenital heart disease were enrolled in a prospective protocol. After evaluation by echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, a tentative management plan was recorded. Subsequently, a MRI study was performed and surgical planning was reevaluated. MRI was found to be comparable to echocardiography in terms of length of examination and sedation requirements. Surgical planning was altered in four patients because MRI provided additional data not evident on echocardiography and catheterization. Comparison of diagnostic yield between echocardiography, catheterization, and MRI showed that MRI is superior to echocardiography and often to catheterization in delineation of systemic and pulmonary venous anatomy and their relation to mediastinal structures. When the anatomic and hemodynamic data obtained by echocardiography and MRI were considered together, cardiac catheterization data were necessary only to determination of pulmonary vascular resistance before Fontan operation.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>CONCLUSIONS</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>MRI provides excellent anatomic and functional information that in some patients was not available by echocardiography or catheterization. Combined with echocardiography, MRI provides the high-quality diagnostic information necessary for management planning in most patients with heterotaxy syndrome. Cardiac catheterization is indicated when determination of pulmonary vascular resistance is necessary for decision making or when an interventional procedures is indicated.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

They will increasingly have wide geographical and political application. The population of Israel since its establishment in 1948 has increased about sixfold. The numbers of the elderly (65+) have increased about tenfold. The current situation must be examined and estimates obtained for the next ten years. Only thus can the system be enabled to cope with the problem as it develops. The chosen method was a carefully preplanned, multisectorial workshop. Recommendations were discussed, amended and finalised. The recommendations of the workshop included: Baseline national data is urgently required. Guidelines are required for selecting specific target populations to which priority should be given. The current favourable situation of adequate oral health manpower in Israel makes it possible to encourage providers of oral health care towards treatment for the elderly. It is essential that the appropriate health authorities allocate sufficient funds for the following urgent purposes: the conduct of a national survey of the elderly population; the establishment of oral health units on a trial basis in some selected hospitals; support institutions of higher education to facilitate training in geriatric dentistry. <jats:bold>Conclusions.</jats:bold> The workshop was multidisciplinary because it was necessary to include all the expertise and experience available as vital elements of the policy making process. This type of workshop was found to be an effective tool for planning oral health services.</jats:p>",
