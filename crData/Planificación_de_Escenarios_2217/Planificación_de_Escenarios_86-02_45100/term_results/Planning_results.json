The hypotheses were that the frequency of specific contents would be related to the subject's information processing tendencies assessed in terms of the meaning system (Kreitler and Kreitler), that each content variable would be related to a pattern of meaning variables and that in some cases these patterns would resemble in structural features those related to personality traits, particularly cognitive traits. The subjects, 50 undergraduates of both genders, were administered in separate sessions a standard meaning questionnaire, assessing tendencies to use the meaning variables, and 10 planning tasks, coded in terms of eight conceptually‐based variables (categories of contents, e.g., emotional, quantitative) and five factorially‐based variables (defined on the basis of a factor‐analysis of all responses, e.g., concern for aesthetics and external appearance, formal administrative arrangements). The findings showed that each content variable was related to a particular pattern of meaning variables providing insight into its cognitive dynamics. Six conceptually‐based variables were related to patterns similar to those related to traits, not only cognitive. Discussion focuses on implications for the study of contents and of traits.</jats:p>",

When development involves large, remote, offshore gas reservoirs with high H2S and CO2 content, planning and coordination problems increase rapidly. This paper discusses the time/planning relationships in the evaluation and definition phases of a generalized major gas project typical of resources currently being evaluated in many locations. Project development planning requires an extensive drilling appraisal program to define gas in place, gas productivity, and gas quality. With program to define gas in place, gas productivity, and gas quality. With this information, marketing potentials can be established, and the interrelated planning and design steps to define commercial feasibility can be undertaken. These steps include gas process optimization studies necessary for project definition and continued reservoir assessments, progressing into early multidimensional analyses. This effort assists in progressing into early multidimensional analyses. This effort assists in establishing well count, well spacing, and platform siting to yield production performance consistent with equipment constraints and delivery production performance consistent with equipment constraints and delivery requirements. This study does not discuss the execution phase of the project, but it does stress the importance of having a qualified, multidiscipline project organization to complete the evaluation and definition phases and to serve as the basis of the fully staffed project management team necessary to complete the detailed design and construction phases of the project.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Many steps are involved in planning the development of a generalized major gas project. The following discussion is based on studies of several large projects from which a composite hypothetical reservoir was constructed to illustrate the problems typically encountered. This composite reservoir is analogous in many respects to larger structures in the Khuff formation in the Middle East. Although project activities overlap in timing and manpower requirements, overall development planning may be subdivided into six phases (also shown in Fig. 1):</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Phase 1-exploration and pre-evaluation; Phase 2-evaluation; Phase 3-definition; Phase 4-design; Phase 5-construction; and Phase 6-operations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Other groups may use different terms, but the activities are similar. This paper is concerned only with the first three phases. During the completion of these steps, a number of activities must be performed in parallel, including exploration drilling, resource evaluation, assessment of oceanographic and geotechnical factors affecting design, and environmental impact evaluation. Preliminary planning must be initiated to anticipate requirements for structures, developmental drilling, production/treating facilities, pipelines, terminals, and marketing. The ultimate objective is to generate an overall project plan applicable to a deep, high-pressure, sour-gas reservoir in an offshore environment.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Pre-Evaluation Phase Pre-Evaluation Phase Minimum time is available for this evaluation.

The system utilizes integer and linear programming and network optimization techniques and encompasses the entire scheduling process from forecasting of requirements to printing employee schedule choices. Since its implementation in 1983, it has been used to develop work schedules for 4,000 employees on a regular basis and is eventually expected to schedule 10,000 employees or 20 percent of United’s total work force. The system has produced direct labor cost savings of over $6 million annually while earning rave reviews from United upper management, operating managers, and affected employees. </jats:p>",

The fuzzy goals of the DM are quantified by eliciting the corresponding membership functions through the interaction with the DM. After determining the membership functions for each of the objective functions, in order to generate a candidate for the satisficing solution which is also a Pareto optimal, the DM selects an appropriate standing membership function and specifies his/her aspiration levels of achievement of the other membership functions, called constraint membership values. For the DM's constraint membership values, the corresponding constraint problem is solved and the DM is supplied with the Pareto optima] solution together with the trade‐off rates between a standing membership function and each of the other membership functions. Then by considering the current values of the membership functions as well as the trade‐off rates, the DM acts on this solution by updating his/her constraint membership values. In this way, the satisficing solution for the DM can be derived efficiently from among a Pareto optimal solution set by updating his/her constraint membership values. On the basis of the proposed method, a time‐sharing computer program is written and an application to regional planning is demonstrated along with the corresponding computer outputs.</jats:p>",

The intent of the model is to provide a tool to system managers and planners to support resource planning and allocation decision-making. More and more, mental health care is being delivered by a variety of community-based service agencies instead of single, comprehensive institutions. The service needs of a client population are continually changing, and depend upon the relative functioning of the population, which depends upon the efficacy of the services provided. The availability of resources is becoming scarcer, and is more closely scrutinized. Consequently, the system manager must attempt to apply the available resources as effectively as possible. </jats:p><jats:p> We develop a conceptual framework for planning that includes aggregating patients according to their functional level and service needs, and defining “service package options” for each aggregate patient group. We also estimate the effect of giving a particular service package to a patient group, in terms of functional improvement or regression. The planning problem is then to assign service packages to aggregate groups over a multi-period planning horizon to maximize some measure of system welfare within the available resources. This planning problem is a linear programming problem that we illustrate using representative data. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a method is developed for updating input — output tables using employment figures. The technique is an improvement over previous conventional adjustments because of the general availability and quality of employment data. Operating on the Leontief inverse matrix, this reformulation builds upon prior attempts to integrate employment data into the adjustment process. However, this model avoids the need to develop employment multipliers independently by using actual employment totals as the constraints. These constraints are derived in such a manner that row and column constraints each sum to the total regional employment. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The three main political groupings in Britain (the Conservative Party, the Labour Party, and the Liberal/Social Democratic Party Alliance), the two nationalist parties (Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National Party), and the Ecology Party are now unanimous in accepting conservation as a legitimate policy goal. But they are far from unanimous when it comes to proposing the means by which conservation goals should be achieved. These party divisions are particularly marked in relation to the most critical rural conservation issue of the day, that is, the extent to which agriculture and forestry should be controlled to benefit conservation interests. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper is a review of the relevant policies of the six main political parties. It identifies in particular those that advocate an extension of planning controls and whether to farming but not forestry, to forestry but not farming, or to both these activities. This produces interesting contrasts from which, by their willingness to implement controls that favour conservation, it is tempting to judge the parties' conservation credentials. But, although all six parties view conservation as a desirable goal, it is, for all but one, subordinate to more important aims and ideals. As such, it may not be surprising that conservation policies appear to reflect party ideology and interest rather than conservation commitment. </jats:p>",

An argument is made that many planners are unaware of the implications of using published unemployment rates in their planning activities. This is primarily because of a lack of understanding of the definitions used by BLS in its statistical program. Research reveals several alternative ways to view unemployment at the local level. Unique data from the Youngstown/Warren SMSA is used to illustrate the problems and prospects of concern to planners. The paper suggests the increased need for local unemployment rate studies. </jats:p>",

This study investigated the usefulness of network planning methods to streamline workflow in a blood center reference laboratory. The investigation of a patient serological problem which included a positive direct antiglobulin test was chosen for analysis. Individual steps in the resolution process were identified. All possible logical sequences of these steps were investigated to determine which steps were along the ‘critical path’, the sequence of steps which is rate‐limiting. By implementing new procedures for these steps, faster resolution of a problem should result. The Program Evaluation Review Technique predicted that altering procedures to shorten 3 steps (autoadsorp‐tion, antibody identification panel at 37°C and screening for antigen‐negative units) would result in a decrease in the time required to complete a patient problem by 29%. Time‐motion studies documented a 35% improvement in problem resolution time with the new procedures (p&gt;0.05). Utilization of the network planning techniques in an immunohematological laboratory may allow for more efficient and expedient operation.</jats:p>",
