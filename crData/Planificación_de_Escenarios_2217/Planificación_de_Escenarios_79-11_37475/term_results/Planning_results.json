      "abstract": "<jats:p> The impact of poor production and inventory planning can be significant in any manufacturing firm. On an aggregate level, excessive inventories can lead to poor cash flows necessitating financing to cover operational costs while stock outs can lead to customer service problems and the eventual loss of business. Therefore managers must utilize their aggregate resources effectively while optimizing individual item run quantities on a daily operational level. This paper presents an analytic framework for a hierarchical treatment of a multi-stage linear programming production and inventory problem. The paper is an extension of the single stage case by the author. </jats:p><jats:p> The problem we address is multi-item, capacitated, and linear. We require certain cost assumptions: monotone costs to determine an optimal aggregate plan and to establish planning horizons, and separability of costs to optimally disaggregate aggregate production. The hierarchical procedure not only makes business and organizational sense, but is also analytically feasible, computationally attractive, and reduces detailed forecasting requirements. The intent of the paper is twofold: first to present an alternative to the classical single monolithic model for the manager and analyst and second, to provide, for the researcher, a basis for a potentially fruitful area of research in hierarchical planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The notion of a mental map implies that the spatial actor possesses some kind of internal mental ordering of the external environment that he consults in the process of making movement decisions or responding to environmental stimuli. The aim of mental-map studies is to elicit information about the environment from the individual in terms of the characteristics and locational relationship of spatial forms, the qualities attributed to environmental elements, as well as the preferences for and the evaluation of spatial opportunities. This paper is concerned only with the locational aspects of mental maps. A direct mapping method was employed to extract information on the way in which the spatial actor mentally structured the environment into a coherent picture. Analysis was focussed on map styles and map sophistication and their relationships with various characteristics of the respondents. Findings indicate a strong inclination towards the sequential-type maps, which are organised around major paths. This implies that most residents conceive of the city as a set of movement experiences. Most maps produced are lacking in detail, pointing to a low legibility of environmental elements in the study area. Map styles and map sophistication show statistically significant relationships with the respondents' sex, education, occupation, and income, but not with their age, length of residence, and mode of transport. The results are generally in congruence with research findings in Western cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Retail grocery price variations in Dublin are examined with a view to confirming that systematic structural and locational variations exist at different time periods. The relevance of the price component to central-place theory, consumer shopping behaviour, and low-income consumers is briefly indicated prior to a detailed review of previous price-variation studies. Two surveys in Dublin indicate temporal consistency in certain hypotheses for different ranges of products, and more detailed analyses indicate the importance of organisational structure in accounting for retail price variations. A stepwise multiple-regression analysis is developed to determine the best predictors of price variations. The data are also examined to determine whether low-income consumers pay significantly more for their groceries than the more affluent and mobile socioeconomic groups. </jats:p>",

With regard to labour considerations in mobile firms, interest has frequently gravitated towards an analysis of the variation in managerial competence to solve labour difficulties and has largely ignored the reality that the extent of the labour problem will vary between firms. This paper, with the aid of empirical data from the scientific and industrial instruments and systems industry, will argue that the product and process technologies of individual industries dictate the complexity of the labour requirement of firms. It is concluded that the effect of labour requirements on mobile industrial firms can only be realistically examined in studies of the labour problems of mobile industry if production technology, and its influence on the subsequent labour requirement, is acknowledged and included as a key variable. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1982, the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station near Phoenix, Arizona, will begin commercial operation as one of the world's largest power facilities. Locating this multi-unit nuclear power plant in the Arizona Desert was a decision whose uniqueness was exceeded only by the magnitude of the project: Approximately $3.0 billion for three nominal 1300 MWe units needing a total of 90 million gallons of cooling water per day. To supply this resource, Phoenix city wastewater will be conveyed 38 miles to the plant site, treated, stored, used, recycled, and the residues disposed of. Wastewater has been used as cooling water for power plants before, but never in this quantity, in such a climate, and for so critical a use. </jats:p><jats:p> The overall problem of systems design was a classic unstructured and interconnected situation. Every major decision—on conveyance, treatment plant capacity, method of treatment, size of the storage reservoir, condenser tube material, use of wet/dry cooling towers, cycles of concentrations, and blowdown disposal—was linked in cost and performance with two or three others, and all were surrounded by uncertainties regarding supply, performance, and demand. To comprehensively analyze these factors, a spectrum of Management Science methods was used to develop a project plan, sort through the interconnections, assess their net effects, and select the design parameters of the system. </jats:p><jats:p> Besides providing direction for the project and comprehensiveness in the final design, the effort was directly responsible for a reduction of $20 million in capital construction costs, or a cash flow savings of $3.5 million per year for the anticipated 30-year economic life of the plant. </jats:p>",
