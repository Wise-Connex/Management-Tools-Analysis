Such an estimate is necessary in determining whether the expected results of these expenditures will conform to corporate goals and objectives. Also, the estimate will show whether the capital required for development of exploratory successes will unduly strain the company's capital structure. Described herein is a model constructed solely for the purpose of deriving such estimates. This model, entitled the Exploration Success and Production Development Model (ESM), has been used by Aminoil USA, Inc. for several years and has substantially improved our planning. It should be stressed that ESM is a planning tool, not an evaluation tool.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Before describing ESM, we should first discuss other methods of achieving the goal for which it was developed. We have reviewed industry publications, but have not discovered any articles dealing with this specific subject. Many articles have been published discussing methods of evaluating specific exploration prospects, projects, and/or geological/ prospects, projects, and/or geological/ geographical areas. None of these, however, are truly appropriate for the micro-type problem described above. Thus, other approaches need investigation. Intuitively, it would appear that the best method of deriving the required estimate would be to evaluate each extant exploratory project individually and sum the results. However, for even moderate size companies, this approach entails several problems such as (1) the process would become problems such as (1) the process would become extremely cumbersome as the number of projects increased, (2) the sum of the individual projections would likely be optimistic, (3) it would projections would likely be optimistic, (3) it would be difficult for top management to exercise effective control, (4) sensitivity analysis due to changing geopolitical conditions would be difficult, and (5) the question of unspecified future projects remains to be answered.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Methods for resolving (a) and for quantifying (b) have been developed and applied independently in the operations management literature. All current aggregate planning models are suitable only for constant productivity situations. The current research integrates (a) and (b) into a single computer-based model which permits the development of aggregate-output plans in the face of changing, productivity. </jats:p><jats:p> The model requires reformulation of traditional aggregate planning methods to incorporate changes in productivity and thereafter solves the reformulated planning problem using direct-computer search. The potential significance of the model is demonstrated by generating a series of aggregate plans for various learning rates. These plans are then used to develop manpower schedules, for cash flow analysis, and for making product pricing decisions. </jats:p>",

The simulation results disclose consistent differences between the techniques in protecting a representative part against timing and quantity uncertainty in both demand and supply for the part. The paper not only provides some initial insights into the behavior of MRP systems under uncertainty, but also establishes some guidelines for choosing between safety stock and safety lead time.</jats:p>",

The inadequacy of most descriptive entropy statistics for measuring the information in a spatially-autocorrelated map is described. The contention that entropy maximization in itself provides theoretical justification for spatial models is critically evaluated. It is concluded that entropy should, first and foremost, be regarded as a technique to expand our methods of statistical inference and hypothesis testing, rather than one of theory construction. </jats:p>",

An equilibrium (or alternatively, an optimal) distribution of urban population density is specified exogenously. The rate of change of the actual population density is then considered to be a function of the deviations between the actual and the equilibrium (or optimal) density distributions, over time. This adjustment process is interpreted as being realized by internal migration, immigration/emigration, and/or natural growth. A formal specification of the models results in integral—differential equations. A solution procedure that uses double Laplace transforms and partial Laplace transforms with respect to space and time is outlined. Properties relating to the limiting distributions are discussed. An example that makes use of exponential functions is presented; and procedures for computing explicit, and possibly heuristic, solutions are noted. </jats:p>",

It has further been proposed that territories affect humans at three levels of analysis, including interaction with social rank distinction, reduction of disorder and complexity, and chaining individual behavior acts. From a subjective point of view territories are probably connected with a personal sense of security, control, self-determination, identity, and continuity. </jats:p>",

The balance between these two sets of conditions is mediated by the cost of commuting. These three elements are formalized in terms of a mathematical-programming model that determines simultaneously the location patterns of employment, residential activity, and commuting. The solution conditions lead to a single-equation model which estimates the distances between zones in a city on the basis of their residential and employment densities. This version is fitted to data for four US cities. Estimates derived from the single-equation model can be resolved into two-dimensional maps of the zones by multidimensional scaling, and maps of the four cities, based on the estimated equations, are obtained and compared with the actual maps of the cities. The results indicate that the estimated parameters are congruent with the actual spatial arrangements of the cities. </jats:p>",

The proposed approach involves the following five steps: (1) identification of facility attributes relevant to patients in their choice of health-care facilities, (2) modeling of an individual's overall preference for alternate facilities as a weighted linear function of these facility attributes, (3) transformation of each consumer's preference model into a benefit function expressing the individual's benefit in dollars/year for an existing or potential facility, (4) provision of a method for determining the total incremental benefit to the community from a set of proposed health-care facilities, and (5) use of a heuristic procedure to determine a set of facilities that yields near-optimum total incremental benefit subject to the cost constraint. A practical application of the proposed approach reveals that the consumer preference model has substantial reliability and predictive validity. </jats:p>",

Based on earlier research efforts dealing with single‐commodity and multi‐commodity distribution system modeling and on production planning for a single‐plant commodity processing facility, a mathematical programming methodology is developed for a multiplant soybean processing network. Application of the model leads to the specification of a production plan for a multi‐period time horizon, while at the same time indicating the quantities of soybean meal and soybean oil to be supplied to various customers in various locales. Both sets of decisions are made under the general criterion of maximizing the net income produced by the soybean processing complex, subject to various production, inventory, capacity, supply and demand constraints. Test results from application of the model are presented and discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A theory of cognitive structure is presented which is potentially capable of providing a conceptual framework for the study of transport behaviour, and by making use of this theory and the models derived from it, problematic areas in attitude and attribute research in transportation are discussed. An exploratory empirical study is described which successfully tests some of the relationships inherent in the theory in a transport context. Significant correlations were observed between overall attitude towards use of a travel mode and the products of evaluation and belief strength summed over a short series of perceived outcomes of use of that mode. The content, strength, and associated evaluations of salient beliefs about use of a travel mode were monitored during a period of change in the conditions of the service. Predictable changes in belief structure were observed, demonstrating the sensitivity of the techniques used. </jats:p>",
