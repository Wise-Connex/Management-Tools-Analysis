These items were subsequently converted into shopping-dependent motive statements. 250 undergraduate college students responded on a 7-point scale to each statement as these related to the acquisition of recent personal shopping goods. An exploratory factor analysis yielded five factors, accounting for 57.7% of the variance, three of which corresponded to the Self-verification motive (five items), Self-enhancement motive (three items), and Self-improvement motive (six items). These 14 items, along with 9 reconstructed items, yielded 23 items retained and subjected to additional testing. In a final round of data collection, 169 college students provided data for exploratory factor analysis. 11 items were used in confirmatory factor analysis. Analysis indicated that the 11-item scale adequately captured measures of the three self-evaluative motives. However, further data reduction produced a 9-item scale with marked improvement in statistical fit over the 11-item scale. </jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of the use of reformulations of the gasoline-ethanol blend known as gasohol and of ethanol on the ozone formation. A three-dimensional photochemical model was employed to estimate the sensitivity of ozone and evaluate the implementation of emission scenarios, considering various fuel formulations, in the MASP. The base case ozone concentrations were consistent with the observations over six air quality monitoring stations located in the MASP, suggesting that the model can be used to evaluate the impact that various emission scenarios would have on ozone levels. Six scenarios were analyzed; scenarios 1 to 5 involved reductions in compounds found in gasohol in various proportions compared with the base emission inventory and scenario 6 specified that the entire light duty fleet would burn pure ethanol. In scenario 3 (reductions in olefins, aromatics and benzene) and scenario 5 (reductions in the five species that are associated with higher ozone sensitivity), ozone concentrations were below the national standard only at the air quality monitoring stations (not domain-wide). Our results suggest that implementing scenario 6 would improve air quality in the MASP.</jats:p>",

In a series of three papers, we investigated the chaotic domain without periodic inclusions for a map, which is considered by many authors as some kind of one-dimensional canonical form for discontinuous maps. In Part I, the basic structures in the chaotic region are explained by the bandcount increment scenario. In Part II, fine self-similar substructures nested into the bandcount increment scenario are explained by the bandcount-adding and -doubling scenarios, nested into each other ad infinitum. Hereby, we fixed in both previous parts one of the parameters to a non-generic value, and studied the remaining two-dimensional parameter subspace. In this Part III, finally we investigated the structures under variation of this third parameter. Remarkably, this step is the most important with respect to practical applications, since it cannot be expected that these operate exactly at the previously investigated specific value.</jats:p>",
