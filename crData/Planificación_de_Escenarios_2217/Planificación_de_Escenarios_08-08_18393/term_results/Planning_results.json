The analyses show that younger men are less likely than older men to actively plan for retirement, and a clearer distinction is made between financial planning and preretirement planning. The results also show that the meanings of the two phrases overlap as one ages and that financial habits change over the life course. Understanding the changes over the life course would ensure that successful programs aim at securing financial security at older ages. </jats:p>",

To account for the likelihood of embracing the two‐child ideal, the analysis adopts a framework with the acronym APA: Acceptance of the two‐child ideal, Preference for that ideal, and Achievement of that preference. The framework posits a hierarchy among the three and hypothesizes that each depends on a set of factors, including gender stratification, economic expectations, perception of the costs and benefits of having children, and the costs of fertility regulation. The results indicate that son preference and the perceived low cost of childrearing are major obstacles to the acceptance of the two‐child family. Son preference, other discriminatory gender attitudes, optimistic economic expectations, and fear of contraceptive side effects are associated with a low preference for and ambivalence about having only two children. Given a decisive preference, lower socioeconomic status and strong son preference are the major obstacles to the achievement of the two‐child ideal.</jats:p>",

The psychological approach emphasizes the cognitive processes that underlie planning while project management researchers have focused on applications of planning in organizational settings. The purpose of this study is to examine how the use of formal planning techniques influences planners' creative problem‐solving. Specifically, three planning techniques, Gantt charts, case‐based planning and critical path analysis, were examined. We attempted to ascertain the impact of using these techniques on a planner's ability to develop innovative solutions. It was found that participants demonstrated higher levels of creativity when they were encouraged to consider events that could jeopardize successful goal attainment rather than using cases from memory and planning specific tasks to be done.</jats:p>",

The framework considers the robustness and risk analysis of different plans exposed to uncertainties in the planning environment and selects the configurations that meet the objectives with the least risk exposure.

A central methodological focus of the study is the examination of retrospective and prospective measures of pregnancy unwantedness, contrasting their usefulness for specifying levels of unwanted pregnancy and its relationship with domestic violence. Data from India's 1998–99 National Family Health Survey and a 2002–03 follow‐up survey for which women in four states were reinterviewed are analyzed, and the factors associated with the intersurvey adoption of contraception and the experience of an unwanted pregnancy are examined. Women who experience physical violence from their husbands are significantly less likely to adopt contraception and more likely to experience an unwanted pregnancy. A prospectively measured indicator of unwanted pregnancy identifies a higher prevalence of unwanted pregnancies than do the traditionally employed retrospective measures and is more successful in establishing a relationship between unwanted pregnancies and domestic violence. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between a woman's experience of physical violence from her husband and her ability to achieve her fertility intentions. The need to improve the measurement of pregnancy intendedness is clear, and a move toward using prospective measures as the standard is necessary.</jats:p>",

In this study, we examine whether exclusive reliance on differentials biases this understanding, Findings based on recent data from sub‐Saharan Africa show bias. We find that historical and especially cross‐country comparisons can yield substantially different conclusions about the magnitude and even the direction of inequality patterns and trends, depending on whether differentials or fuller‐information measures are used. For instance, the fertility differentials associated with education have remained relatively stable as national fertility has fallen, but inequality (as calculated by a fuller measure) has increased. Such results underscore the value of complementing existing studies of fertility differentials with analyses based on fuller‐information measures. The analyses also show how change in differential fertility behavior and in the educational composition of national populations has shaped recent variations in reproductive inequality in the region.</jats:p>",

The analyses are based on a sample of 819 sexually experienced women. Using multivariate probit regression, we attempt to correct for possible endogeneity among campaign exposure, contraceptive ideation, and contraceptive use. Our analysis reveals that the direct effect of campaign exposure on the probability of contraceptive use is only marginally significant, but the effect of exposure on contraceptive ideation is robust, as is the effect of contraceptive ideation on contraceptive use. The findings demonstrate not only the success of the program but also the relevance of incorporating ideation into analytic models assessing the effects of communication campaigns.</jats:p>",

Because ECPs are readily available in Mexico, women who know about the therapy can obtain it easily. Do maquiladora workers know about the method? Could worksite programs help increase awareness? To investigate these questions, we conducted a five‐month intervention during which workers in three maquiladoras along the Mexico‐United States border could attend educational talks on ECPs, receive pamphlets, and obtain kits containing EC supplies. Among the workers exposed to our intervention, knowledge of ECPs increased. Reported ECP use also increased. Although our intervention apparently increased workers’ knowledge and use, the factory proved to be a difficult intervention setting. Problems we experienced included a factory closure and management/staff opposition to certain project elements. Future studies should continue to investigate work‐site interventions and other strategies to reach workers.</jats:p>",

Although much of this work has tended to focus on Foucault's mid to later projects, especially around issues of health, surveillance, governmentality, and sexuality, his earlier archaeological studies have also produced fruitful avenues of research. Concentrating on the latter, and taking up Elden's notion of Foucault's use of space as a tool of analysis, I explore how Foucault's intense study of modern literature, particularly Roussel and Blanchot, contributes to underlying modes of spatialisation that drive his study of the history of clinical medicine, as well as the complex explanation of his archaeological approach. Following Deleuze, I argue that these spatialisations are both the instrument and the object of his studies. They generate devices and tactics for dismantling established methods of analysis and manifest the powerful, multiple effects of discourse, whilst remaining meticulously at the level of description. </jats:p>",

We then faced the challenge of distributing these models to people with minimal experience with OR techniques and no resources for acquiring and learning new software. To eliminate the most significant obstacles, we decided to use spreadsheets. We created a spreadsheet application that runs Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macros to generate customized analytical models without the assistance of an OR professional; thus, users could evaluate a wide variety of plans. Developing spreadsheets for this type of application differs significantly from end-user modeling and typical spreadsheet applications.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Agile methods of software development promote the use of flexible architectures that can be rapidly refactored and rebuilt as necessary for the project. In the mechanical engineering domain, software tends to be very complex and requires the integration of several modules that result from the efforts of large numbers of programmers over several years. Such software needs to be extensible, modular, and adaptable so that a variety of algorithms can be quickly tested and deployed. This paper presents an application of the unified process (UP) to the development of a research process planning system called CyberCut. UP is used to (1) analyze and critique early versions of CyberCut and (2) to guide current and future developments of the CyberCut system. CyberCut is an integrated process planning system that converts user designs to instructions for a computer numerical control (CNC) milling machine. The conversion process involves algorithms to perform tasks such as feature extraction, fixture planning, tool selection, and tool-path planning. The UP-driven approach to the development of CyberCut involves two phases. The inception phase outlines a clear but incomplete description of the user needs. The elaboration phase involves iterative design, development, and testing using short cycles. The software makes substantial use of design patterns to promote clean and well-defined separation between and within components to enable independent development and testing. The overall development of the software tool took about two months with five programmers. It was later possible to easily integrate or substitute new algorithms into the system so that programming resources were more productively used to develop new algorithms. The experience with UP shows that methodologies such as UP are important for engineering software development where research goals, technology, algorithms, and implementations show dramatic and frequent changes.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Volume 39, issue 9, pages 2068–2085 </jats:p><jats:p> Due to the vigilance of one of our readers, an error was found in a paper recently published in this journal by Robert Cervero: “Transit-oriented development's ridership bonus” ( Environment and Planning A 2007 39 2068 – 2085). Only one inclusive term and its associated θ coefficient was presented and reported for the upper-nest model in table 3 . Two inclusive terms should have been presented, for ‘living near’ and ‘living away’ transit, respectively, as notated in equation (3) on page 2077 of the paper. It is noted that a circulated working paper by the same author (R Cervero and M Duncan, “Residential self selection and rail commuting: a nested logit analysis”, 2002, working paper, University of California Transportation Center, Berkeley) presented two inclusive terms (and their associated coefficients). However, further investigation revealed these were miscalculated and were in error. This working paper has also been corrected to be consistent with the corrected table 3 below. </jats:p><jats:p> The corrected upper-nest model has a slightly different specification than originally shown in table 3 of the paper in order to satisfy the condition that the θ values lie between 0 and 1. None of the text about the upper-nest model that appears in the first paragraph of page 2078 and on page 2080 of the paper changes nor do any of the substantive findings or conclusions of the research. The additional variables added to the upper-nest model reveal that low automobile ownership levels tended to be associated with transit-oriented living. Cervero acknowledges that automobile ownership likely both influences and is influenced by transit-oriented living; thus the coefficient on the automobile ownership variables could be subject to endogeneity bias. The revised equation also shows that, controlling for other variables in the equation, having individuals 55 years of age and above in a household reduced the likelihood of living near transit. Lastly, discussions in the last paragraph of section 6.3 regarding the θ values should now be in the plural, indicating that both θ<jats:sub>near</jats:sub> and θ<jats:sub>away</jats:sub> are within the 0–1 interval. </jats:p><jats:p> It is also noted that the estimated coefficients in the lower-nest binomial logit models for predicting rail commuting (shown in the right-hand panel of table 3 ) are unchanged from the original table 3 . The t-statistics presented in the original lower-nest models, however, were actually Wald statistics ( t-statistics squared); in the corrected model, the square roots of the Wald statistics (ie, t-statistics) are presented. None of the significance levels changes. Because a sequential approach was used to estimate the nested logit model, the coefficient estimates of the upper-level model are consistent but not asymptotically efficient, thereby underestimating standard errors and assigning more significance than is likely the case. It is also noted that coefficients in the lower-level models were not transformed using the estimated θs from the upper-level model. Because these coefficients are unchanged, none of the discussions in sections 6.4 and 6.5 (pages 2080 – 2083) of the paper is affected by the corrections made to table 3 . </jats:p><jats:p> The editors of Environment and Planning A are immensely grateful to the reader who pointed out this important error, and urge our readers to help maintain the quality of the journal by calling our attention to any other significant errors. Robert Cervero also acknowledges the helpful comments and suggestions of two anonymous referees and Kenneth Train in making corrections to the original model. We reproduce below the corrected table (to replace table 3 on page 2079). </jats:p><jats:p> [Table: see text] </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper describes the financial planning model InnoALM we developed at Innovest for the Austrian pension fund of the electronics firm Siemens. The model uses a multiperiod stochastic linear programming framework with a flexible number of time periods of varying length. Uncertainty is modeled using multiperiod discrete probability scenarios for random return and other model parameters. The correlations across asset classes, of bonds, stocks, cash, and other financial instruments, are state dependent using multiple correlation matrices that correspond to differing market conditions. This feature allows InnoALM to anticipate and react to severe as well as normal market conditions. Austrian pension law and policy considerations can be modeled as constraints in the optimization. The concave risk-averse preference function is to maximize the expected present value of terminal wealth at the specified horizon net of expected discounted convex (piecewise-linear) penalty costs for wealth and benchmark targets in each decision period. InnoALM has a user interface that provides visualization of key model outputs, the effect of input changes, growing pension benefits from increased deterministic wealth target violations, stochastic benchmark targets, security reserves, policy changes, etc. The solution process using the IBM OSL stochastic programming code is fast enough to generate virtually online decisions and results and allows for easy interaction of the user with the model to improve pension fund performance. The model has been used since 2000 for Siemens Austria, Siemens worldwide, and to evaluate possible pension fund regulation changes in Austria. </jats:p>",

For this purpose, a\nsystematic procedure is established to evaluate the mid-term competitiveness of a semiconductor\nmanufacturing factory in which the yield learning processes of all its products are considered\nsimultaneously. After that, for products that are not competitive enough but have strong demand, a\ncorrection mechanism is designed to enhance their competitiveness at the expense of the other\nproducts that are competitive but have no market. The whole process is therefore called collaborative\nyield learning planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Areas throughout the southeast and other parts of the United States faced drought conditions of increasingly catastrophic proportions during late 2007 and early 2008, and North Carolina was no exception. Traditional conservation measures and restrictions to outdoor water uses were no longer sufficient to adequately reduce demands on water systems. To facilitate interagency dialog on ways to address the drought, the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources Division of Water Resources and the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety Emergency Management Division hosted a drought tabletop exercise. Water utilities used the tabletop exercise as well as a draft drought‐response toolbox to help them decide on response actions for worsening drought conditions. The tabletop exercises described in this article can be used by state water agencies anywhere in the United States to prepare for a drought. States and water systems can create and conduct drought exercises like the ones described here, add drought factors and actions to their emergency response plans, and work with other state and local agencies to include drought scenarios in other types of security and emergency response training exercises.</jats:p>",

The paper examines and compares the protests surrounding two international summits held in Canada: the Vancouver Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (1997) and the Kananaskis G8 summit (2002). These two cases serve to demonstrate many of the important ways in which space is controlled and contested by both protesters and state actors such as the police. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Express package carrier networks have large numbers of heavily‐interconnected and tightly‐constrained resources, making the planning process difficult. A decision made in one area of the network can impact virtually any other area as well. Mathematical programming therefore seems like a logical approach to solving such problems, taking into account all of these interactions. The tight time windows and nonlinear cost functions of these systems, however, often make traditional approaches such as multicommodity flow formulations intractable. This is due to both the large number of constraints and the weakness of the linear programming (LP) relaxations arising in these formulations. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model in which variables represent combinations of loads and their corresponding routings, rather than assigning individual loads to individual arcs in the network. In doing so, we incorporate much of the problem complexity implicitly within the variable definition, rather than explicitly within the constraints. This approach enables us to linearize the cost structure, strengthen the LP relaxation of the formulation, and drastically reduce the number of constraints. In addition, it greatly facilitates the inclusion of other stages of the (typically decomposed) planning process. We show how the use of templates, in place of traditional delayed column generation, allows us to identify promising candidate variables, ensuring high‐quality solutions in reasonable run times while also enabling the inclusion of additional operational considerations that would be difficult if not impossible to capture in a traditional approach. Computational results are presented using data from a major international package carrier. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Naval Research Logistics, 2008</jats:p>",

Unlike the hard power of industry, art offers a soft branding approach to imaging the city, its people, and their goals. However, such powers are not limitless, and concerns have also been raised about their publicness and artfulness. The power and powerlessness of public art in Singapore are not unlike those encountered in other cities where artful planning has taken centre stage in contemporary urban redevelopment. </jats:p>",

Drawing from a close reading of a property-boundary dispute involving the historical movements of the Missouri River, I supplement this account by revealing the ways in which legal simplication is itself complicated: that is, both dependent on considerable amounts of practical work, and subject to breakdown, ambiguity, and contradiction. Rather than a singular river, made legible through the unfolding of a unitary legal logic, I reveal several conflicting ‘rivers’ produced through property law. I conclude by trying to make sense of property as a set of practices that serve to produce the ‘effect’ of property. These practices, while often messy and contradictory, are, nevertheless, significant in the installation of property as a powerful organizing device through which the social world is made meaningful. </jats:p>",

Do we follow Heidegger in treating the open as an enclosed space cleared from within, or Kant (and, following his lead, mainstream science) in placing the open all around on the outside? One possible solution is offered by Gibson in his ecological approach to perception. The Gibsonian perceiver is supported on the ground, with the sky above and the earth below. Yet in this view, only by being furnished with objects does the earth–sky world become habitable. To progress beyond the idea that life is played out upon the surface of a furnished world, we need to attend to those fluxes of the medium we call weather. To inhabit the open is to be immersed in these fluxes. Life is lived in a zone in which earthly substances and aerial media are brought together in the constitution of beings which, in their activity, participate in weaving the textures of the land. Here, organisms figure not as externally bounded entities but as bundles of interwoven lines of growth and movement, together constituting a meshwork in fluid space. The environment, then, comprises not the surroundings of the organism but a zone of entanglement. Life in the open, far from being contained within bounded places, threads its way along paths through the weather world. Despite human attempts to hard surface this world, and to block the intermingling of substance and medium that is essential to growth and habitation, the creeping entanglements of life will always and eventually gain the upper hand. </jats:p>",

Unfortunately, a utility's most valuable knowledge is likely not written down nor is it readily learned by new workers in a written form. Utilities need a blended approach, from structured document repositories to learning and training on the organization's best practices, in order to successfully retain valuable knowledge. The article presents information from an Awwa Research Foundation research project on retaining this valuable knowledge. Utilities that successfully address the need for knowledge retention will be better‐equipped to cope with the challenges ahead ‐ increasingly sophisticated technology, stringent regulations, higher customer expectations, aging infrastructure, technology pressures, security concerns, economic constraints, and more. With all of the other initiatives, special projects, and day‐to‐day issues facing utility leaders, a program with long‐term and sometimes hidden payback like knowledge retention is a key area that utility leaders must focus on.</jats:p>",

Public outreach and attentiveness to customer concerns generated understanding, appreciation, and goodwill that translated into acceptance of the increases. With the last major rate update in 1996, the consultant‐supported rate study team implemented technical rate‐making methods described in AWWA Manual M1 (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#awwa09694-bib-0002\">AWWA, 2000</jats:ext-link>) and an AWWA study on water rates (<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#awwa09694-bib-0001\">AWWA, 2004</jats:ext-link>).

In this paper, following the theoretical lead of ‘new materialists’ such as Bruno Latour and Daniel Miller, I argue that the physical world plays an integral role in the construction of meaning out of natural disasters. By focusing on the various cultural narratives surrounding Hurricane Katrina as well as the particular material genre of the house, I analyze the ways the human and physical worlds participate in the production of meaning. The specific materiality of the house in New Orleans is explored through three key stages of the Katrina disaster: the initial landfall and flooding, the first week of ostensible chaos, and the return of residents to their houses. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores some of the inequities in the ways in which intellectual property has been applied to agricultural plant genetic resources, focusing primarily on patents. In particular, it is concerned with the importance of what counts as ‘nature’ in making the distinction between something that is ‘invented’ and something that is merely ‘discovered’—a distinction that is at the heart of patent law (although not always made in these terms). While discoveries are understood to be mere revealings of nature, genuine inventions are considered to be human products, and therefore eligible for patent protection. What counts as nature in this discourse, and which kinds of human labour are taken to be genuinely inventive, is, therefore, a highly consequential issue. Ultimately, I argue for both the exposure of the noninnocent and highly political way in which ‘nature’ is formed, and the importance of more honest ways of characterising the coming-into-being of new plant varieties. The final section points to some existing proposals and projects that might help us to build systems of property in this area that are both more equitable and that acknowledge the contributions and needs of all of the diverse actors—human and not—involved in the ‘emergence’ of agricultural biodiversity. </jats:p>",

This work encompasses an increasingly heterodox set of approaches to regional economic activity, from innovation studies to processes of embedding to accounts of regional learning and clustering, and an increasingly broad set of empirical cases through which these issues are regularly discussed. Only recently has the literature had much to say about the relationship between scientific knowledge and regional culture, however, or about the empirical experience of non-Western regional economic activity and forms of innovation within this. This paper seeks to further develop these two recent strands by bringing them together. Firstly it transposes the study of high-technology regional cultures to a developing world and socialist country context. I examine, as a case study, Cuba's Science Pole, a biomedical growth pole on the outskirts of Havana comprising some forty-two interlinked institutions and 14 000 scientists. I show how a space for biotechnology was created and maintained outside of the capitalist milieu with which the industry has come to be associated in the West. More specifically, I reveal how the formal demands made by the Cuban state of this biotechnology endeavour paradoxically encouraged the development of a suite of informal and innovative scientific practices. To account for how this very different approach nevertheless resulted in a similar ‘regional culture’ of innovation to that found in high-technology regions in the West, I suggest we need to consider not just the structural components of regional cultures (labour mobility, attitudes to risk, etc) but also the forms of rationality that underpin such factors themselves. In order to do this I turn to some of the insights of the science-studies literature as to the epistemological foundations of processes of innovation and knowledge production, to argue that regional cultures of innovation are never just economic spaces, they are also epistemic spaces. </jats:p>",

The jurors met at 11 consecutive sessions during 2006 over a period of 16 weeks, which culminated in a written report. All the sessions were audio‐recorded, five sessions were observed and video‐recorded, and 16 jurors completed written feedback forms at the end of the jury process.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings and conclusion </jats:bold> In this article we discuss degree and timing of public involvement in the process of health research; the role of context; representation of communities; processes of deliberation and knowledge production; and how constraints of time and cost may affect public involvement. It was clear that jurors who took part in the Bristol Citizens' Jury were engaged and committed. This engagement may be related to jurors' belief in their ability to shape future research alongside concern about the relevance of the issues under discussion. Opposing emotions of tension and harmony are a crucial part of the deliberation process.</jats:p>",

Using the philosophy of Martin Heidegger allows us to see how globalization belongs to the modern calculable understanding of space, and therefore to the particular metaphysical event of technological existence. Through an acknowledgment of the metaphysics of gigantic growth and totalitarian magnitude, globalization is seen as a planetary consummation of the kind of technological disclosure of being. This is a period in which the entire globe stands at the service of complete and manipulative calculability. In this paper I argue that in globalization the world is ontologically understood as a picture in which everything becomes gathered together as a reserve to be ordered and challenged by anthropocentric will and value-creation. </jats:p>",

The case of domestic containerized freight traffic is examined because it is closely associated with contemporary forms of integration between rail shipping and trucking. With the help of a geographic information system, the potential impact of intermodalism in the United States is analyzed by mapping integral place accessibility measures of five-digit zip-code areas. The performance of the intermodal freight network is evaluated by comparing accessibility measures based on the highway network and on the intermodal network, respectively. Geographically weighted regressions are also performed to identify the variables that contribute to the improvement of accessibility due to intermodalism, while accounting for the spatial nonstationarity of relationships. </jats:p>",

While acknowledging the salience of these arguments, the author claims that examination of pictorial images that have shaped and promoted modern environmentalism complicate them. Pictorial images are less prone to dualistic interpretation than scientific and theoretical argument, and the affective responses they generate are complex. An examination of iconic images of key 20th-century environmental crises—wilderness preservation, soil erosion, urban sprawl, nuclear testing, and global environmental change—reveals both continuities in image making and presentation, and the evolving roles of physical nature itself in shaping their composition and meanings. Globalization of environmental concerns and images has shifted nature's icons from landscape towards living species, and from a temperate to a tropical and polar geography. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There has been a recent wave of political and theoretical interest in localism and relocalization as a political strategy in resistance to the hegemonic power of globalization. Some geographers and other observers of spatial politics have been skeptical of these efforts, questioning the effectiveness and the effects of relocalization movements. In response, DuPuis and Goodman have argued for a ‘reflexive localism’ that takes a more pragmatic approach, understanding the ways in which this form of politics can or cannot provide a powerful alternative to globalization. Building on current realist studies, this analysis seeks to build a more reflexive framework with which to understand the politics of localism. To do this the study draws upon the perspectives of political ecology and the politics of scale and uses a comparative historical methodology to look at one of the most effective forms of localized governance in US agriculture: the milk-market-order system. The analysis shows that market orders created economic enclaves that enabled particular agroecological practices, or ‘farming styles’. Market orders functioned as mesolevel institutions that both territorially fixed local agroecologies and mediated with institutions at other spatial scales, a process in which ‘local’, ‘state’, and ‘national’ were coproduced. </jats:p>",

Many of those lacking adequate water supply and sanitation systems can be found at the fringe of the cities in so called peri-urban areas, especially in the developing world. Planning in these areas is highly complex due to challenging environmental and physical conditions, high population density and unclear institutional boundaries. This article presents a framework aiming to support the planning process for sustainable water and sanitation systems in peri-urban areas. The suggested framework is based on different available planning approaches from a review of literature and websites of organisations and companies. It consists of a recommendation of important steps in the planning process as well as supporting tools. Further, it incorporates a set of sustainability criteria important for the peri-urban context and allows for the development of site specific systems. The framework has the aim to be flexible for different planning situations, and for suiting planners with different perspectives and amount of resources.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a critical perspective on the ‘new’ governance of science and the environment which is increasingly evident in practical attempts to build more constructive relations between science and democracy through hybrid ‘analytic–deliberative’ processes. The focus is on recent institutional and participatory experiments in the governance of nuclear waste, specifically the work of the UK Committee on Radioactive Waste Management and the trialling of a novel participatory, multicriteria, options appraisal tool called Deliberative Mapping undertaken by the authors as part of this process. Drawing on these attempts to build relations and make connections between citizens, specialists, stakeholders and policy makers, radioactive wastes, and possible courses of action for their long-term management, the methodological performance of analytic–deliberative practices and the contextual influences that frame and govern them is evaluated. The paper demonstrates powerful framing effects operated at the level of specific participatory practices, procedural politics surrounding the design of ‘new’ governance institutions, and institutional behaviour linked to wider politics of environmental risk and energy futures which narrowed down and marginalised particular discourses, knowledges, meanings, and forms of expression. Unless these often tacit power relations are acknowledged, accounted for, and exposed by all involved, but especially vested interests, analytic–deliberative institutions may well undermine public trust, credibility, and legitimacy rather than promote these democratic virtues as is widely claimed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In many discussions of how cities in the global North are changing, the growing importance of urban design is emphasised: that is, the production of visually and spatially coherent urban buildings and spaces seems to be increasingly central to urban change. To date, most attention has focused on exploring the reasons for this shift. Much less attention has been paid to the experiences of the people inhabiting and using such designed spaces. Although many authors acknowledge that, in theory, such encounters between human subjects and designed urban environments are richly various and unpredictable, few studies have examined this empirically and learnt theoretically from these encounters. Drawing on fieldwork undertaken in the British city of Milton Keynes—the centre of which is a shopping mall, a designed environment par excellence—the authors argue that understanding experiences of contemporary urban change requires a relational and performative understanding of environmental encounters, and they suggest three intertwined implications for rethinking research on urban aesthetics: first, a multimodal and sensuously embedded understanding of vision; second, a practice-centred understanding of the environment; and third, a need for self-reflexive understanding of the researchers' position in the fieldwork. </jats:p>",

A new treatment method (CADDIMA), which combines both computerized tomographic (CT) and optical laser‐scan data for planning and design of surgical guides, implant abutments, and prosthetic devices, is described. Imaging using a “NewTom 3G” cone beam CT scanner and a modified laser triangulation scanner “D200c” is discussed, as are impression and surgical guide fabrication, which allow for flapless, precise implant placement and an accurate provisional prosthesis. The new approach gives the operator full control over the design of the implant prosthesis for planning of proper occlusal relations and shows promise for further evaluation.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The geographical subdiscipline of chorography, as described by Ptolemy and as interpreted in the Renaissance, played an important philosophical and practical role in the development of landscape as a form of spatial representation. This applies both to representation in the form of pictures, as in landscape painting, and to representation through the medium of perspectival theater scenery. These pictorial and scenic forms represented a reconfiguration of Platonic binaries between celestial and terrestrial nature and between mind (intellect) and body (sense). This reconfiguration generated a characteristically ‘modern’ dichotomy between society and its natural surroundings as well as the qualitative and the quantitative. The root of chorography is choros (also spelled chora), which basically means ‘place’. Present-day philosophical explorations of the meaning of choros suggest that the Plato-inspired Renaissance artists were essentially seeking to represent that which for Plato was actually unrepresentable. This interpretation is born out by an examination of the classical Greco-Roman chorography, as well as the expression of choros through the medium of classical Greek theater. This nonrepresentational notion of choros and chorography, as interpreted in present-day philosophy, has important implications for the contemporary concern with nonrepresentational geographies, landscape, and performance. </jats:p>",

In Experiment 2, the single objects were replaced by object triplets, with the distractors being phonologically related to the first object's name. Naming latencies and gaze durations for the first object showed degradation and relatedness effects that were similar to those in single-object naming. Older participants were slower than younger participants when naming single objects and slower and less fluent on the second but not the first object when naming object triplets.

Drawing on two case studies concerning tropical forests in West Africa and the Caribbean, it explores clashes between the conceptions of social–ecological systems embedded in dominant scientific and policy practices, and the more dynamic, nonequilibrial perspectives that emerge from understandings of forest history and users' own experiences. Forest and conservation policy, I find, have persistently ignored these dynamics. Yet, as people and nature have ‘bitten back’, forest histories are revealed as mutually constituting interplays of ecological process, social practice, policy and intervention, and response. Policy makers often do not see this, and are thus surprised when their schemes fail. In this paper, I argue that alternative analytical approaches are needed that take seriously human-ecological dynamics, history, path dependency, and the ways in which different people frame or construct problems, linked with notions of Sustainability that respect diverse goals—including forest users’ own. This, in turn, suggests the need for alternative approaches to the governance of environment and development issues that are more adaptive, deliberative, and reflexive, and for politically engaged efforts to institute these in contexts where pervasive power–knowledge relations perpetuate less dynamic views. </jats:p>",

However, this paper aims to put forward a more complex explanation by pointing out that immediate care delivering is produced not only by expelling indeterminacy but also by taking advantage of it. In order to do this we will use Bachelard's concept of ex-inscription to shed light on the practices and techniques that transform events into opportunities (rather than obstacles) for delivering immediate care to home telecare service users. </jats:p>",

Combining multicriteria analysis with conservation decision‐support tools improves efficiency of conservation planning by maximizing outcomes for biodiversity while minimizing opportunity costs to society. An opportunity cost is the benefit that could have been received by taking an alternative course of action (i.e., costs to society of protecting an area for biodiversity rather than developing it for some other use). Although different ways of integrating multiple opportunity costs into conservation planning have been suggested, there have been no tests as to which method is most efficient.

We devised 14 opportunity costs and assigned these to 3 scenarios representing different conservation planning concerns: food security, macro‐economic development, and biodiversity persistence. For each scenario, we compared the efficiency of the 3 methods in terms of amount of biodiversity protected relative to total expenditure for each opportunity cost. All 3 methods captured similar amounts of biodiversity, but differed in total cost. Our method had the least overall cost and was therefore most efficient. Nevertheless, there was a high correlation and geographical concordance among all 3 methods, indicating a high degree of spatial overlap. This suggests that choosing an appropriate approach may often depend on contextual factors related to the design of the planning question, rather than efficiency alone.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper examines the problem of harvest capacity planning at a tactical level. Annual capacity planning allows planners to determine the number of contractors to hire per period throughout the year and to define the duration of their contracts. In practice, this process usually involves the analysis of historical data regarding the operational use of capacity and aggregated demand forecast, the output of which then serves to plan harvest operations. Although this form of hierarchical planning reduces the complexity of the task, the decomposition into subproblems that must be successively resolved can lead to infeasibility or poor use of harvesting capacity. The specific problem addressed here resides in how one can consider the operational impact of harvesting decisions taken at the tactical level to ensure a plan’s feasibility at the operational level. We present a tactical planning process based on Schneeweiss’ generic hierarchical modeling approach. A computational experiment demonstrates how a tactical planning process is influenced by the input of the operational level anticipation model. The anticipation approach we propose appears to be a valid method to better integrate key operational-level decisions into tactical plans. </jats:p>",

Extensive sources of information are available, such as datasets held by the British Geological Survey and the Coal Authority, but are not always used fully in planning for development and determining planning applications. Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) Note 14 on instability was published in 1990 and later augmented by a specific Annex 2 on subsidence and planning. That guidance improved the consideration given to subsidence in planning but key advances tended to be focused on specific areas selected by Government for demonstration projects and a major derelict land reclamation initiative. Elsewhere, implementation has been patchy. Although subsidence issues tended to be taken into account in areas of extensive past underground mining, appreciation of the issues has been more difficult to establish where potential subsidence relates to isolated mining or natural underground cavities. Recent reform of the planning system has led to continuing replacement of PPGs by a new series of Planning Policy Statements (PPSs). There are currently no plans to bring PPG14 or its annexes into a PPS format and, therefore, a risk that it will gradually be forgotten and that good planning responses to subsidence may decline. Sustainability appraisal of spatial plans and environmental impact assessments of development proposals could help to ensure that this important issue is not overlooked, but existing guidance on assessments does not refer explicitly to subsidence.</jats:p>",

Beyond monetary resources, leaders and senior managers must monitor and understand the external environment in order to make discerning decisions about the viability of further infrastructure investments because of changing student demographics or the complexities of personnel within the dynamic culture of social organisations.

We also compared the actual costs of providing these services ($1.4 billion) with the anticipated public-sector costs for maternity and infant care among the Medicaid-eligible women whose births were averted ($5.7 billion) to calculate net public-sector savings ($4.3 billion).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This analysis uses the case of a seemingly successful industry cluster (ie the film and TV industry in Munich) to demonstrate that deficits in the structure of social relations can impact a cluster's growth potential. In the period after World War II, Munich grew into a national centre of media industries in Germany due to the introduction of private/commercial TV, national entry barriers, and a supportive institutional infrastructure. The recent advertising crisis and the dissolution of the Kirch Group have, however, reinforced already existing internal dilemmas and contradictions. We suggest that the growth prospects of this industry are limited due to a lack of reflexive, interconnected communication and interaction patterns. In conceptual terms, we apply a model which emphasizes that local interaction or ‘buzz’ in clusters and interaction with external firms and markets through translocal or global ‘pipelines’ create reflexive dynamics. Based on this conception, participatory observation and semistructured interviews were conducted with sixty-five Munich firms, as well as with planners and media experts from the region. The results indicate that the regional, national, and occasional international project networks have had a smaller impact on the Munich film and TV industry than expected. Our investigation provides evidence that the cluster's structure of social relations is relatively weak. Internal networks which could drive creative recombination and innovation are underdeveloped, and linkages with external markets which could provide substantial growth impulses to the region are lacking.

In early 2007, Gunns Limited, the project's proponent, pulled out of the RPDC process and the government established an alternative, ‘fast‐track’ process under the Pulp Mill Assessment Act (PMAA). This article evaluates the RPDC and the PMAA assessment processes using a ‘good environmental governance’ framework composed of eight criteria – transparency, accountability, openness, balance, deliberation, efficiency, science and risk. The comparison reveals that although the RPDC process fell short of the ideal, it was markedly superior to the PMAA process that replaced it. The case highlights how political economic power can be used to the detriment of public planning and the communities and environment that rely on it</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> To develop and implement public policy requires work. In this paper, we examine some of the work involved in a pathbreaking climate change policy adopted in Portland, Oregon. Seeking to address shortcomings in existing studies of local environmental governance, we focus particular attention on how climate change became a political priority in Portland, how a particular representation of local carbon dioxide emissions was developed in the process of public consultations, and how the local state attempted to achieve its adopted policy objectives by enlisting the self-governing capacities of its residents. To carry out such an analysis, we draw on both actor-network theory (ANT) and governmentality. The first approach offers an understanding of how collective priorities emerge as different actants learn how to move toward their goals by working together, and also suggests how subjects and objects are reshaped by their enrolment in such configurations. The second approach offers a more precise understanding of how the state attempts to achieve its objectives—once they are established—by conducting the conduct of its citizens. Brought together, we argue, ANT and governmentality provide an incisive approach to questions of local environmental governance, and to broader political concerns as well. As each approach addresses well-cited shortcomings of the other, the combined approach developed in this paper could be deployed in many studies that examine the emergence of political priorities and the capacity to achieve them. </jats:p>",

The schools were reportedly achieving high levels of computer integration as reflected in a nationwide questionnaire survey. Out of the 18 lessons that we observed, 14 lessons have incorporated some elements of constructivist teaching. However, closer examination revealed that the underlying orientation of the lessons was inclined towards information acquisition and regurgitation. Five out of the six teachers we interviewed were reportedly inclined towards constructivist notion of teaching. The teachers accounted for the inconsistency between their espoused beliefs and the teacher‐centric teaching practice as due to contextual constraints. The teachers expressed that the need to complete the syllabi according to stipulated schedules so as to get the students ready for examination was the main barriers that prevented them from engaging in more constructivist teaching. This case study therefore highlights that although it is necessary for teachers to hold pedagogical beliefs that are compatible with the constructivist notion of teaching and learning, this is an insufficient condition to shift traditional teaching practice. Changes in assessment systems and substantial professional development are further conditions that have to be addressed.</jats:p>",

In such criticism he aims neither to dismiss the dangers of global climate change nor to derogate the findings of ongoing scientific research, like that done by the co-awardees of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, namely, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Rather, it is meant to begin a more pointed reassessment of how today's global climate-change debates are too entwined in the reproduction of most existing power relations and global market exchange. At best, Gore's work seems essentially to ‘greenwash’ existing networks of corporate organization and expert technocracy with renewed institutional legitimacy that only rinses today's unsustainable economic status quo in the refreshing, but not fully cleansing, waters of sustainable development ideology. While there is a need for systemic reforms in economic production, government regulation, technological innovation, and social distribution to mitigate climate change, Gore's many engagements with big business, venture capital, and global media do not appear to offer such a radical transformation. Instead, his basic project of decarbonizing the commodity chain mainly would appear to be a new program for further economic development that might not even retard, much less fully reverse, current climate-change trends. </jats:p>",

The process requires digital elevation models (DEMs) and hydrographic data, and also portrays the likely depth to surface water across forested terrains away from any nearest surface-water features such as streams, rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Map applications involve layout of roads and trails, automated selection of best road–stream crossings, minimizing earth-moving operations during road construction, detailing in-block plans for temporary roads and channel crossings, and delineating habitats, machine-free zones and blocks for harvesting, tree planting, site preparation, and stand thinning. Map verifications centre on visual comparisons of map features with land-surface images, and these can be coupled with GPS tracking of wetland and wet-area borders, stream channels, and road-stream crossings. Further developments involve increasing the wet-areas map resolution and accuracy with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) bare-ground DEMs and other fine-gridded DEMs, and expanding the applications to mapping of soils, soil properties and tree and crop productivity, to watershed and road-network management, to off-road trafficability, and to impact evaluations dealing with hydrological sensitivities and risks. Key words: forest operations planning, geographic information systems, digital elevation models, flow-channels, wet areas and depth-to-water maps, hydrological risks </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Organizations commonly make use of focus groups for planning purposes while giving little thought to the dimensions on which those groups are formed. This paper argues that the dimensions of group formation have a significant effect on the ultimate success of any planning exercise. This is because in all organizations people necessarily self‐categorize as members of groups that shape the way they think and act at work. However, there is often a lack of fit between the way organizations categorize employees and the way those employees categorize themselves. To the extent that there is a lack of fit between imposed and self‐identified categories, we argue that organizations will fail to effectively harness group resources. Any planning strategy that makes use of groups should organize people in terms of identities that are most relevant to their work in order (a) to have an impact on the way people think and act and (b) to ensure that people have (and feel that they have) the opportunity to provide input that is relevant, useful and important for the organization. The paper discusses a technique, AIRing, that allows organizations to address this issue effectively.

In 2006 the decision was made at the Peter MacCallum Caner Centre (Peter Mac) to plan for and implement this process as standard clinical practice for radical dose prostate treatments (74–78 Gy). Before this, programme verification of field placement for prostate cancer radiation treatment was routinely carried out using regular off‐line electronic portal imaging with matching of bony anatomy. A small multidisciplinary team investigated and assisted in the implementation of this new practice across the Peter Mac sites at East Melbourne and our three satellite centres. Issues considered included seed size, number and position in the prostate, implant equipment, imaging equipment and procedure and consent and information forms. The use of a custom made fiducial pack, comprehensive patient information and a daily on‐line imaging process was implemented. The experience of the first 28 patients at Peter Mac from January 2007 to May 2007 inclusive is reported on.</jats:p>",

The first component in the DFMP was landscape projection, whereby cumulative impacts of key natural and anthropogenic disturbance agents were modelled under current and altered climate conditions. The second component addressed two types of impact assessment. The Biodiversity Assessment Project (BAP) modelled ecosystem diversity at landscape and habitat levels, as well as developed habitat supply models, relative to changing vegetation composition, management practices, and stand age. Models were used during the development of a preferred forest management strategy to address undesirable ecological predictions. In the Forest Watershed and Riparian Disturbance (FORWARD) project, a variant of the soil and water assessment tool was developed to model the impacts of watershed disturbance on streamflow. In the third component of the DFMP, timber supply scenarios were devised based on maximizing annual allowable harvest in a sustained yield fashion, while incorporating elements of the BAP and FORWARD project as constraints in harvest sequence optimization. This initiative is an example of an industry-led effort to manage forests using a system that is regionally centered, science based, peer reviewed, and considers multiple activities and their cumulative environmental effects. </jats:p>",

To reduce respiration imaging artifacts in planning CT scans, 4D imaging techniques are used. Currently, we use a single (midventilation) frame of the 4D data set for clinical delineation of structures and radiotherapy planning. A single frame, however, often contains artifacts due to breathing irregularities, and is noisier than a conventional CT scan since the exposure per frame is lower. Moreover, the tumor may be displaced from the mean tumor position due to hysteresis. The aim of this work is to develop a framework for the acquisition of a good quality scan representing all scanned anatomy in the mean position by averaging transformed (deformed) CT frames, i.e., canceling out motion. A nonrigid registration method is necessary since motion varies over the lung. Methods and Materials: 4D and inspiration breath‐hold (BH) CT scans were acquired for 13 patients. An iterative multiscale motion estimation technique was applied to the 4D CT scan, similar to optical flow but using image phase (gray‐value transitions from bright to dark and vice versa) instead. From the (4D) deformation vector field (DVF) derived, the local mean position in the respiratory cycle was computed and the 4D DVF was modified to deform all structures of the original 4D CT scan to this mean position. A 3D midposition (MidP) CT scan was then obtained by (arithmetic or median) averaging of the deformed 4D CT scan. Image registration accuracy, tumor shape deviation with respect to the BH CT scan, and noise were determined to evaluate the image fidelity of the MidP CT scan and the performance of the technique. Results: Accuracy of the used deformable image registration method was comparable to established automated locally rigid registration and to manual landmark registration (average difference to both methods <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp6347-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp6347:mp6347-math-0002\" /> for all directions) for the tumor region. From visual assessment, the registration was good for the clearly visible features (e.g., tumor and diaphragm). The shape of the tumor, with respect to that of the BH CT scan, was better represented by the MidP reconstructions than any of the 4D CT frames (including MidV; reduction of “shape differences” was 66%). The MidP scans contained about one‐third the noise of individual 4D CT scan frames. Conclusions: We implemented an accurate method to estimate the motion of structures in a 4D CT scan. Subsequently, a novel method to create a midposition CT scan (time‐weighted average of the anatomy) for treatment planning with reduced noise and artifacts was introduced. Tumor shape and position in the MidP CT scan represents that of the BH CT scan better than MidV CT scan and, therefore, was found to be appropriate for treatment planning.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In common with many countries of the world, there are concerns within planning and regeneration circles regarding the very slow progress towards sustainable development and a realization that for progress to be achieved there is a need for government to act. Consequently, the UK government is seeking, through a variety of instruments, including the land use planning system, to mitigate the environmental impact of development. Indeed the overarching aim of the extant land use legislation (in particular, the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 and the Sustainable Communities Act 2007) is the promotion of sustainable communities, across the so-called ‘triple bottom line’ of economic well-being, social justice and environmental protection. This paper discusses geo-political developments in the approach to funding local and regional government and how the UK is affected by these. The paper considers research in Britain into the potential for using aggregated property valuations as a method of monitoring economic health at a national and local scale, by applying geo-spatial modelling and display techniques. Given advances in the application of modern information systems (including the capture, management and display of geo-spatial data), the authors assess the potential of such systems for the status of relevant datasets in the UK. </jats:p>",
