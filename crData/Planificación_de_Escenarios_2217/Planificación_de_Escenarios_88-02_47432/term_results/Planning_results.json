A well thought out Contingency Plan will not only eliminate or minimise the sense of panic, normally associated with oil spill emergency, but also can minimise damage and cost involved.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Simply put, oil spill contingency planning is a process of predetermining a response to an oil spill emergency. The process of preparing a contingency plan varies but the final plan is normally produced into a document, to be followed in an oil spill emergency. With this document prepared and agreed by all concerned parties, the approach and response to an oil spill should be more organised. It is also generally accepted that an organisation with the necessary contingency plan in place is better prepared to handle an emergency that one without a contingency plan.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Oil spill contingency planning is a feature of Shell Group policy. Sarawak Shell Berhad (SSB)/Sabah Shell Petroleum Company Limited (SSPC) produced an Oil Spill Contingency Plan in 1978 which has undergone a number of modifications and updates. Drills and exercises are also conducted with a view to improve the company preparedness to tackle oil spill emergencies.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we describe production planning and scheduling models for a semiconductor company manufacturing specialty wafers. The production of specialty wafers involves processing a large number of low volume, customer-specific orders which can be classified into a number of product groups. Typically, the literature on scheduling deals with one product and a single objective. In contrast, we propose and test several heuristics for scheduling jobs in a multiproduct parallel reactor (machine) shop with different criteria. We introduce a set of indices to measure the degree of homogeneity in the product set. Based on the results of the computational experiments, we recommend that the choice of the heuristic should be guided by the homogeneity of the product set and the chosen objective criterion. The planning problem relates to the assignment of reactors to the product groups to obtain homogeneous product sets, and can be viewed as an effort to define smaller, independent shops. The significance of the planning exercise is due to the fact that a homogeneous product set enables the use of a simpler heuristic and reduces the complexity of the scheduling system. We examine two variants of the planning model and briefly comment on their application to the design and layout of the facility. Since one of the variants of the problem is difficult to solve, we present a method to obtain an approximate solution. We provide bounds on the performance of this approximate solution and demonstrate that it is asymptotically optimal. </jats:p>",

This article compares the official health planning system with the actual planning process as experienced within one Finnish central hospital district. The official planning system seeks to integrate national strategic goals with local municipal ownership, administration, and funding of service delivery. The actual planning process within the studied district suggests that technically oriented civil servants at the regional level may be at least as important in the overall decisionmaking structure. The article concludes with a brief exploration of this finding's potential consequences for the long-term development of the Finnish health care system and for national health planning efforts generally.</jats:p>",

Interregional problems with precise objectives and precise constraints, with fuzzy objectives and precise constraints, and with fuzzy objectives and fuzzy constraints are individually examined. Properties of the equilibrium solution and of the associated dual optimal problem are investigated. The present framework comprises ordinary multiobjective interregional equilibrium problems as a special case. A variety of interregional optimization problems can be effectively solved through the use of fuzzy linear programming, as discussed in this two-part series of papers. </jats:p>",

The various activities carried out by the personnel function, such as selection, recruitment, development and assessment have a far greater impact on organisational excellence if they are part of a thought‐out human resources plan, rather than piecemeal, and perhaps disconnected outputs of the personnel department. Because of the realisation of the need for integrated planning, human resources planning (HRP) has become increasingly well accepted, but there is still a large gap between theory and practice in HRP. There is considerable lip‐service to the need for sophisticated HRP, but many practitioners continue to use simple HRP techniques and less frequently use the more powerful techniques that are available. This may be a function of the gap between theory and practice as practitioners are likely to prefer to work with the techniques that they understand and which they control, rather than having to make use of what they see as “sophisticated” planning models which typically require the help of a head office planning or computer department.</jats:p>",

In the spirit of furthering this endeavour within the field of economic geography, I identify a number of key problems which I contend must be addressed to make an adequate treatment of time possible. These concern the infatuation with static equilibrium, common presumptions of inevitability, caricatures of fixed capital and technological change, and a general failure to incorporate uncertainty and adjustment strategies into spatial analysis. Discussion of these problems is followed by an attempt to offer a revised notion of tradition, as an important element in a truly dynamic economic geography. </jats:p>",

The main result of the paper is to show that those interaction flows determined by entropy-smoothing techniques correspond (for large flows) to the most probable flow patterns consistent with cost-efficient spatial-interaction behavior. In addition, it is shown that under very general conditions, these flow patterns are indeed overwhelmingly most probable. Thus, these results establish a clear behavioral foundation for entropy-smoothing techniques in terms of the cost-efficiency theory.

Specifically, conventional \"cut-and-skid\" harvesting, with maximum skidding distances of 180 m, resulted in 13.3 km of production road within the study area over and above that obtained with a fully mechanical-to-roadside system (360-m maximum skidding distance). Furthermore, the mechanical system reduced fragmentation of the cutting pattern and established relatively long leave strips, factors that should reduce volume losses from windfall and mortality. The step-by-step procedures for operational planning, layout and harvest of this proposed modified cut study area are examined and described. </jats:p>",

These models are, by virtue of their deep logic, timeless. Most of the recent attempts in social theory to avoid the functionalism and determinism of timeless models have introduced contingency into the structure—events relationship. In this paper I argue, by contrast, that one needs theoretical apparatuses to explain ‘paths taken’ and ‘paths foreclosed’ in concrete events in social life. Small events have a certain theoretical ‘agency’ in the construction of large social processes and the latter, in turn, are the stuff out of which social structures are ultimately made or broken. The case of technological change and industry location is used to illustrate this logic, and its implications for theories of urbanisation are suggested. </jats:p>",

The algorithm plans parallel- jaw grasping motions for arbitrary two-dimensional polygo nal objects, which need not be of uniform density. Grasping motions are viewed as parameterized operations, where the parameter values that describe an individual operation define an operation space of all possible operations. By combining an analysis of object geometry and the physics of friction, the planning algorithm divides the operation space into regions, where all operations within a given region produce the same final grasping configuration. Task uncertainties are then included by shrinking these regions by the amount of uncer tainty present. The smaller regions that remain after shrink ing indicate all those operations that will successfully result in a given grasping configuration, even if the worst-case combination of errors occurs. </jats:p><jats:p> Moreover, the grasping operations presented in this paper intrinsically reduce task uncertainty. If an operation is cho sen from a region and executed, then two degrees of uncer tainty will be removed from the object's position when the operation is completed. </jats:p><jats:p> It is shown that simple squeeze-grasp operations are not sufficient for grasping all possible objects, and offset-grasp and push-grasp operations are added to increase the scope of the planner.

It is argued that the present government have taken a number of measures to control the NHS (National Health Service) wages bill. These are outlined and it is shown that the major impact of these changes is qualitative, rather than quantitative: the key issue is less the impact on the total number of jobs available, but rather on the terms and conditions on which those jobs are offered. </jats:p>",

It is argued that, although the issues facing us are complex and conflicts are inevitable, choices still exist; however, if the necessary strategic discussions are not forthcoming, existing choices will disappear and changes will occur through necessity (because of eventual technological domination and subordination). </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper, it is argued that the major underlying problem is to make our R and D more effective by more directional management and targetting. The roles of higher education institutions, Government, and industry are considered, and the separate, albeit linked, stages of R and D are highlighted. Illustration of some of the ideas is given by reference to R and D associated with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Importantly, priorities must be established. </jats:p>",

The algorithms utilize the SCS TR‐55 method for calculating runoff hydrographs for a single storm event and a first order pollutant washoff equation to generate pollutographs. Sensitivity analyses based on different policy scenarios is performed on a hypothetical watershed for the purpose of illustration. Three types of BMP measures, namely detention ponds (dry, wet, and extended wet ponds), infiltration trenches, and porous pavements are considered. It is found that the extended wet ponds have the best cost effective performance of the measures evaluated.</jats:p>",

Whilst attempts are made to ensure that AIDS data are as complete as possible, numbers of reports fluctuate from month to month for reasons which are described. In 1986 there was an increase in death certificates naming AIDS as a cause of death in patients who were not identifiable in the surveillance data. More active surveillance is now undertaken in order to minimize this and other possible discrepancies.</jats:p><jats:p>It is probable that most cases of AIDS are reported and therefore these data can be used to describe trends in the epidemic by ‘risk group’. Laboratory reports of HIV antibody-positive tests could give an earlier indication of trends because of the long incubation period of AIDS. But these laboratory data are difficult to interpret because they represent an incomplete and biased sample of all positive persons.</jats:p><jats:p>AIDS cases are still being reported at a rate which is increasing approximately exponentially. Short-term predictions are presented showing a growth in the epidemic which is consistent with previously published predictions. Most cases are in the homosexual risk group. New asymptomatic homosexual patients with HIV antibody are still being identified.</jats:p><jats:p>The epidemic of AIDS in haemophilia patients should be of finite size although new cases of AIDS are likely to continue to be diagnosed for several years. AIDS due to blood transfusion given in the UK before donor screening appears to be a much smaller epidemic. The epidemic in drug abusers is increasing. Heterosexually acquired AIDS and HIV infections are being reported in small but increasing numbers.</jats:p>",
