It will have significant impact on natural systems so that most of the habitat of living organism is directly influenced moreover the human being (which is heterotrophic in nature) and their roles to sustain the development and earth at summary are being vulnerable. This literature review article tries to summarize some climate change scenario and its increasing impact over the livelihood assets and their direct/indirect influence to development fronts. Nepal a developing country having more than 70% of mountainous regions with agriculture based economy is more susceptible to climate change impacts. Planning of development activities remarked with increasing trend of climate change impact with pivotal theme should make the development more sustainable and long living. Existing initiatives to make adaptation options are insufficient to halt the expected danger and redesigning the module of development is urgent in Nepal. On adaptation and vulnerability, a continuing effort must take place to exchange experiences and look for emerging best practices and frameworks. The urgency of the issue requires planners, policy makers, evaluators, practitioners and researchers to become involved in designing and in empowering communities and government as well.

It also reviews the status of PA management plan and legal provisions related to management plan. Management plan is the road map to guide conservation efforts and sets out the desired future of protected area. Five-year management plan of protected areas have been prepared and implemented. Although park management plans were formulated for most of the parks and reserves, there remained wide gaps during its timely and effective implementation. The aim of this paper is to answer the question \"what are the issues in management planning process and implementation\". Building on the strength of the past and keeping the existing weaknesses in mind, the management effectiveness should be evaluated and improved.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/init.v4i0.5538The Initiation Vol.4 2011 69-81</jats:p>"

Selain itu, KB dicurigai karena berasal dari negara asing yang (mayoritas non - Muslim ) dengan agenda yang tersembunyi untuk melemahkan umat Islam. Jadi, apa substansi keluarga berencana? Apakah metode dalam melakukannya? Apa tujuan melakukannya? Lalu, bagaimana jika hal ini dikaitkan dengan ekonomi dan ekosistem? Siapa yang berhak untuk menentukan pelaksanaan keluarga berencana? Apa keluarga berencana dalam hukum Islam? Tulisan ini akan membahas hal-hal tersebut dengan menggunakan metode deskriptif dan analisis terhadap argumen yang diajukan oleh kedua kalangan baik yang menerima maupun yang menolak. Penulis berpendapat bahwa dalam kondisi yag sangat tidak seimbangan antara pertumbuhan populasi manusia dan ekosistem, keluarga berencana tidak hanya diperbolehkan tetapi dapat diwajibkan oleh Pemerintah sebagai wakil dari masyarakat.</jats:p>"

Seventeen percent of all married women would prefer to avoid pregnancy but are not using any form of family planning. In less developed countries, about one forth of pregnancies is unintended. Objective: To determine the level of unmet need for family planning and evaluate the factors that influences the unmet needs in Married Women of Reproductive Age (MRWA). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 410 women attending the immunization clinic of B.P.Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, a teaching hospital in Dharan was carried out over 3 months. Results: MRWA had 22%, 15% and 8% unmet needs for family planning, spacing and limiting births respectively. Health concerns and side effects (30.5%), husband and family opposition (14%), uncertainty about child bearing (12.2%) and inconvenience (10%) were among the major constraints to the use of contraception. Unmet need has significant association between parity &amp; education. Age and family type had no significant effect on unmet needs. Conclusion: In spite of high level of awareness about family planning method, a significant level of unmet need exists among women of reproductive age.

The data on project management activities were collected in order to measure the amount of work completed, compliance with the release and iteration plans, and ability of effort estimation, thus contributing to evidence-based assessment of the typical Scrum processes. It was found that the initial plans and effort estimates were over-optimistic, but the abilities of estimating and planning improved from Sprint to Sprint. Most teams were able to define almost accurate Sprint plans after three Sprints. In the third Sprint the velocity stabilized and the actual achievement almost completely matched the plan.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest average fertility rate in the world. In 2009, the average number of births per woman was 5.1—more than twice as many as in South Asia (2.8) or Latin America and the Caribbean (2.2). More than 100 million women in less developed countries, or about 17 percent of all married women, would prefer to avoid a pregnancy but are not using any form of family planning. Currently, approximately 24.8 percent of African women have unmet needs for family planning; this simply means 24.8 million women of reproductive age who prefer to avoid or postpone childbearing are not using any method of contraception.  Objective: To make a review of trends of family planning practice in Sub Saharan Africa from 1980 to 2010 among women of reproductive age. Methodology: Meta-analysis of detailed literature by authors of articles published since 1980 from various sources, including Demographic Health Survey (DHS) of 1990 to 1995,  2000 to 2005, and of 2005-2010 from Sub-Saharan Africa such as South Africa Demographic Health Survey (SADHS) and Tanzania (TDHS); and observation on the relationship between family planning use and fertility in Africa. Findings: An analysis of fertility trends in 23 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa from 1980 to 1995 showed that in two-thirds of the countries there was evidence of fertility decline, with a particularly rapid decline in Kenya and Zimbabwe. Furthermore 2010 statistics show the African total fertility rate to be standing at 4.7. These rates reflect contraceptive prevalence of these specific regions.Generally in all world regions, contraceptive use corresponds with fertility patterns. In regions where contraceptive use is widespread, fertility is low but in regions where contraceptive use is uncommon, fertility is high. Conclusion: The paper has shown that the high fertility pattern in Africa is among others, a result of the ineffectiveness of family planning programs. Recommendation: The overall low rate of contraceptive prevalence and high unmet need for family planning suggests the need for African national governments and population policy makers to rethink access to contraceptives.

Not only were councils empowered to promote social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being, in contrast with previous more prescriptive legislation, but citizens were empowered to engage in community-led strategic planning. In many respects the new statute reflected contemporary international public management trends in which governance is increasingly being conducted via networks of public and private actors. However, with the change of government from a centre-left Labour-led coalition to a centre-right National-led government following the November 2008 general election, it is less certain that local government and communities will continue to experience a strengthening of the pluralisation of governance that has been a feature of the past decade. This article argues that the potential disempowerment of local government, and possible attenuation of community-led strategic planning in New Zealand, comes at a time when the momentum for devolution to local government and other communities is increasing elsewhere.</jats:p>"

In this area there are tidal flows of traffic of relatively high density and there is inevitably a need to reduce separations as much as possible, consistent with safety, to ensure operating costs are reduced, or at least kept in bounds with anticipated increases in traffic. This requires a much more precise definition of an acceptable separation standard, and for future planning the establishment of a relationship between separation standards and navigational capability.</jats:p>",

Tujuan dari penelitian ini adalah untuk menganalisis faktor internal dan eksternal yang dapat mempengaruhi pengembangan Agrowisata Belimbing Karangsari serta mengidentifikasi strategi yang tepat untuk mengembangkannya dalam rangka meningkatkan perekonomian masyarakat. Penelitian ini menggunakan metode penelitian kualitatif deskriptif menggunakan analisis SWOT. Berdasarkan hasil penelitian dapat disimpulkan bahwa kekuatan internal utama Agrowisata Belimbing Karangsari adalah aspek sarana dan prasarana yang memadahi sedangkan kelemahan internalnya adalah kurangnya kebersihan dan mahalnya harga belimbing. Faktor peluang eksternal utamanya adalah adanya dukungan dari pemerintah dan terkenalnya buah belimbing yang berasal dari Blitar sedangkan ancaman eksternalnya adalah pohon belimbing yang hanya berbuah 3 tahun sekali. Hasil analisis IE menunjukkan bahwa Agrowisata Belimbing Karangsari berada pada kuadran II yang tepat untuk menerapkan strategi stability. Hasil analisis SWOT menghasilkan 14 alternatif strategi. Strategi yang menjadi prioritas utama berdasarkan analisis QSPM adalah strategi menyediakan fasilitas petik buah yang memadahi agar dapat bersaing dengan tempat wisata lain.</jats:p>"

Cities and their regions thus diversely play important roles in national and international contexts. City provides opportunities for economic growth and development and quality life for its population and services to its outside areas, sometimes exceeding the national boundaries. Globalization has, however, created both opportunities and threats for the survival of cities. To become an active partner in the process of globalization, cities with their regional economic strengths require preparing them with their potentials and removing weaknesses. As a capital city, Dhaka has potentials for becoming a global city with its geopolitical location and economic prospects. It has political and administrative advantages in the national context and scope for utilizing the benefits of urban economics, especially agglomerations, concentration of labor and financial institutions, and business services. The physical growth of the city is, however, associated with many-faceted problems which has to be addressed in its planning and development processes in order to bring functional efficiency of a modern city. The city must be developed in a planned manner to benefit from global market and international investment. The research recommends that Dhaka and its city region should overcome the current weaknesses to utilize its full potential to attract businesses and investments in the future. Dhaka’s physical development and economic growth management must be considered together in order to becoming a global city playing dynamic role in the global market in future.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbip.v2i0.9552Journal of Bangladesh Institute of Planners Vol. 2, December 2009, pp. 1-12</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Karachi is a relatively young metropolis. The city is about three centuries old, founded as a port by local Hindu merchants and traders. The British conquered the city in 1839, occupied the entire principality of Sindh in 1843 and designated Karachi as headquarters of the territory. The city experienced different phases of growth. When Pakistan came into being in 1947, a large number of refugees entered the city and the population jumped from 435,000 in 1947 to 1,050,000 in 1951. Karachi has remained the primate city of Pakistan, with a high annual growth rate of 5-7 percent per annum (Ahmed 1998). Current estimates suggest that the city has about 17 million inhabitants.Karachi houses 7 per cent of the total population and 23 per cent of the urban population of Pakistan. Its current rate of growth is estimated at around 5 per cent, of which 3 per cent is due to natural increase and 2 per cent to migration from the other parts of the country. Karachi provides 25 per cent of federal revenue and 15 per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, 50 per cent of the country’s bank deposits and 72 per cent of all issued capital is contributed by the city (Hasan 2010; CDGK 2008). It houses the country’s largest stock market and about 26 per cent of the total national industrial establishments.</jats:p>"

This contention ( which is being supported by Unesco) is illustrated by reference to the potential role of library services in contributing to the quality of education, particularly in developing countries. There is need for more systematic and informed dialogue between librarians and those professionally concerned with national educational, social, cultural, scientific and economic objectives. This can lead to greater priority being given to the development of appropriate library services. The likelihood that such develop ment will involve greater co-ordination between the services offered by libraries of various kinds is exemplified by reference to recent trends both in developing and in industrialized countries. </jats:p>",

It provides an understanding of how community strategic planning has evolved over the past few decades to embody these influences. The paper concludes with reflections on some common challenges and opportunities experienced by local councils in NSW that have undertaken voluntary community strategic planning or are in the process of developing community strategic plans. Given underlying similarities in the emergence of participatory long-term strategic planning in local government around the world, many of the experiences associated with the preparation of community strategic plans in the NSW context are likely to be of relevance to those undertaking similar processes in other jurisdictions.</jats:p>"

The purpose of the study was to examine the Dagomba traditional knowledge of RH practices and beliefs, and their relevance in the context of modern health practices. Data for this study was gathered through qualitative methods, including individual in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, and the use of a qualitative questionnaire among 37 participants. Thematic analysis was undertaken. In examining the Dagomba traditional knowledge of RH practices, it was recognized that the concept of RH extends across the life continuum, reaching beyond the sexually active adult population. The RH practices are based on the Dagomba health beliefs and value systems regarding sexuality and the body's functioning. The Dagomba’s health philosophies and practices regarding pregnancy, delivery, breastfeeding, and sexuality have public and preventive health functions, including conflicting positions. The typical traditional RH and FP practices include abstinence, rhythm, prolonged breastfeeding, and postpartum abstinence. Conclusion: We posit that when traditional knowledge of RH is examined critically by modern health experts, it could help us understand why people from different cultures have varying interpretations and uptake of modern RH practices. Thus, we invite biomedical practitioners to be culturally sensitive and incorporate relevant knowledge of traditional RH practices into their current health education efforts.</jats:p>"

Nomination committees should thus give due consideration to current and required human capital needs of boards when conducting succession planning, as their decisions have substantial implications for stakeholders.Research purpose: To investigate board succession planning practices and policies at selected companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange.Motivation for the study: There is an evident need for proactive succession planning that accounts for prudent board renewal and director development to ensure business continuity.Research design, approach and method: Given the well-developed corporate governance framework in South Africa, the views of eight selected directors were gauged on succession planning by conducting semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis was conducted to derive themes from the qualitative data.Main findings: Nomination committees increasingly account for board composition concerns raised by prominent shareholders. The interviewees suggested that board succession planning is often not formalised. They mentioned that succession policies should be flexible to account for rapid change. Furthermore, the board development mechanisms applicable to executive and non-executive directors differ substantially. Proactive development of the talent pipeline is thus essential.Practical/managerial implications: As heterogeneous boards offer several benefits to companies and their stakeholders, nomination committees should account for diversity considerations when conducting succession planning. Policies pertaining to tenure, diversity and independence should be formalised and annually evaluated and reported on.Contribution/value-add: Several recommendations are offered to enhance board succession planning, based on the lived experiences of directors in an emerging market.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The article discusses the content of the concepts “human environment”, “social environment”, “space” as a component of the architectural platform. It analyzes the understanding of space from the point of view of philosophy, physics and mathematics, describes an approach to the consideration of the content of the psychological space of a person. A model of the psychological space of a person as a mental space, a space of stay and a space of action is considered. It is noted that the urban environment is the middle between a person and his physical environment, between the inner world, human consciousness and the world of things and objects, while a person in the environment is under the influence of a semantic field, and the environment acts as a means of identifying a person with its place stay and livelihood, has semantics. It is noted that the house is the main living environment of a person, determines his personality, social interaction and life success. Architecture meets not only the utilitarian needs of society, but also solves ideological, social and aesthetic tasks. Architecture is a frozen past, present and future, it is a reflection of social ideals, historical events and the culture of the time that is constantly present with a person at any time in his life. A person, as it were, breathes life into his created creation with the help of matter, space and design, reviving. Paul Goldberger describes that architecture is capable of exerting an emotional and intellectual effect on a person, - “there are no two people in the world, who can react equally to this or that architectural space. According to Jeffrey Scott, an architect sculpts from space, like a sculptor from clay. He works on space, as on a work of art, that is, he seeks to use it to create a certain mood for someone who enters there. The influence of architectural space on a person is great - this is a “powerful language” that expresses the social structure of all times and peoples, creates a certain background for the main life events of a person, his basic feelings, sometimes being the reason for their motivation. It is noted that architecture for man is a long process, and we would compare it with the process of human development with its various abilities, abilities, and skills to adapt in society. According to Paul Goldberger, - the quality of architectural space is never accidental - space is shaped. An analysis of this article says that the most complex system of being is architecture, having the social, psychological, spiritual needs of a person, and in modern times we consider it as a means of satisfying a particular need, in our opinion it is regarded as the frozen harmony of our cultural heritage, it is a combination of material and spiritual values created by mankind during its history, having historically acquired rules, knowledge and experience in the middle of society for its preservation and harmonization.</jats:p>"

Because they are often not the owners of their firms, their objectives may not be the maximum profit goal envisioned by classical economics. A more likely objective may involve a combination of profit and personal power. It is thus likely that some profits will be sacrificed to excess staff expenditures. For a large, decentralized firm such as a conglomerate, the adverse effect on profits caused by such motives in the subunit managers may be severe. However, direct intervention in subunit management may cause other deleterious effects. This paper utilizes the assignment of central office overhead as a motivating force and develops a formula for the optimal allocation of this overhead. Thus, direct intervention is minimized and the goals of subunit managers are utilized to achieve the desired result of higher profits.</jats:p>",

This is consequent to the misuse and mismanagement of the common property land resources by villagers in Himalayan region. This paper attempts to evolve an optimal wasteland use framework for the Ramgad catchment situated in the Lesser Himalayan ranges of district Nainital located in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand. Recognizing the drastic changes that have taken place in traditional common property wasteland use, the watershed area has been proposed to be marked for fodder development, horticultural development and medicinal plant conservation.

The district assemblies, which are the designated planning authorities, are commonly blamed for this failure, yet little attention has been given to district assemblies’ perspectives of what factors lead to failures in planning. This paper attempts to fill this gap. Drawing on fieldwork in Ghana, it argues that, from the perspective of district assemblies, five major challenges inhibit planning, namely: an inflexible land ownership system, an unresponsive legislative framework, undue political interference, an acute human resource shortage, and the lack of a sustainable funding strategy. The paper concludes with proposals for reforming the planning system in Ghana.</jats:p>"

An agent employs OWL-S API to extract web service metadata, and applies a DL inference engine, called Racer, for reasoning with the metadata with respect to given background knowledge.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In contemporary world, community participation is considered as the prerequisite of sustainable urban development. It ranges from just informing people about the plan or development projects by the people. However, public participation in local government’s led programs is still limited in Bangladesh. Considering the importance of community participation, this paper explores the level of public participation in spatial planning practices in Khulna city based on the citizen’s responses. The study suggests that existing legislative arrangement is not supportive for participatory urban development at all levels and a little provision is made in this respect by laws. Most of the respondents in the field survey suggested that political problem and weak communication mechanism are mainly responsible for unsuccessful implementation of the Master Plan of Khulna city. The study may help related authorities to understand the citizen’s expectations in designing strategies for performing better role in city development in Bangladesh.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbip.v2i0.9567Journal of Bangladesh Institute of Planners Vol. 2, December 2009, pp. 61-70</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many developing countries do not focus on land use planning in hydropower development. As a result hydropower projects are not sustainable. The aim of the study is to analyze the cause and effects of land use planning in hydropower development. The primary and secondary data were collected in a case study site at the Upper Tamakoshi Hydroelectric Project (UTHEP) in Dolakha district of Nepal. Household questionnaire, key informants? interviews and field observation were conducted to collect primary data while the relevant documents such as detailed feasibility report, property valuation report and spatial data (cadastral data, image etc.) were also collected for the study. The primary and secondary data reveals that Land use changes involved in the UTHEP implementation is basically due to the permanent and temporary land acquisition for project structures, facilities and reservoir area. The total land acquired for various project components like access road, powerhouse, desanding basin, reservoir as well as construction borrow pits and quarries, temporary and permanent work camps and construction of access road is estimated to be 182 ha. The secondary data reveals that 66 ha are allocated in agricultural land, 78 ha in forest land and 38 ha in the barren and cliff land. The results from secondary data and interviews confirm that UTHEP has planned to distribute 10% share to the residents of Dolakha district to promote local level investment. Finally, the study finds that land use planning has very important role for minimizing negative social and environmental effects thus create sustainability of the hydropower projects. It is also found that overall environmental impacts are limited because of technological development such as tunnel and underground powerhouse in UTHEP. The land tenure, Land use planning stakeholders and their role, Governance, policy, social structure etc. are the basic requirements of land use planning for sustainable development of hydropower projects.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Availability of different types of public facilities within an urban area is required to achieve specific objectives in urban planning. Planning standards are necessary in such cases to help achieve the adequacy and quality in services and facilities. To improve the situation in rapid and unplanned growth of Dhaka city both in terms of population and size, it demands a large amount of public facilities such as open spaces, playgrounds, schools, hospitals etc. School is an important public facility that requires setting standards and choosing appropriate locations. Standard of school facilities in an area depends upon factors such as, density of population, number of per family school going children, road network etc. This paper explores the existing facilities of primary and secondary schools for school going children in Ward 50 of Dhaka City Corporation. A series of field survey were conducted in order to collect information from primary sources, and standards on school facilities were collected from secondary sources. Based on the findings, suggestions on future planning of school facilities have been made in this paper. Finally, to justify the standards for schools facilities, DMDP planning standards are followed.  DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbip.v2i0.9577Journal of Bangladesh Institute of Planners Vol. 2, December 2009, pp. 169-178</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Collective Housing districts of Lublin Cooperative Housing (LSM) were the example of model multifamily developments of the second half of the twentieth century, conceptually designed by Roman Dylewski (architect and urban planner) in the years 1956−1977. They were built in the southern part of the city, on the hills cut by dry valleys and ravines, which significantly influenced the form of the buildings and the way of shaping the architectural and landscape enclosures. The Housing district named after polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, designed by Felix Haczewski was based on the garden city concept. Famous visionary architect Oskar Hansen implemented his idea of a linear system and the principle of “absorbent background” into design of Juliusz Słowacki`s district. LSM housing districts were planned in detail, starting from the urban plan of the entire area, through architecture and meticulous arrangement of public spaces. Particular emphasis has been put on the nature of public and social activity spaces, as well as the surrounding greenery. Various species of trees, shrubs and perennials were planted as a complementary element of social space in the district, which was also a part of the city’s greenery system. Different elements of small architecture, such as: sculptures, ponds, and “rockeries” were placed there. The article aims to characterize the principles of landscape and greenery design, as an inseparable element of LSM district and its current condition. It is also interesting to study the transformation of the city sections deriving not only from the changing needs of users, but also from aesthetic preferences and the desire to follow a widely understood design trends.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>For quite some time, professional planning is being practiced in our cities. Unfortunately, drainage planning is the most neglected component of our city planning and management activities. Drainage engineering is done mostly on an ad hoc basis, often overtaking drainage planning. To understand the drainage problem of our cities, Chittagong in particular, Chaktai Commercial Area was identified as the case study area for further exploration and analysis. This case study examines the existing situation, assessing causes behind the problems, inquiring about the likings and disliking of the stakeholders, and identifying possible solutions as an essential input towards arriving at appropriate planning decisions. It identifies the guiding principles relating to the effective integration of a drainage network in the land use plan for the city. Considering physical characteristics, topography, catchment area and the routes of existing drainage channels, the urban area has been divided into 10 drainage areas. The Master plan sets out a staged development program of storm water, drainage and flood control works of the above drainage area up to the year 2015 to meet the Storm Water Drainage and Flood Control problems. Chaktai is the major seat of trade and commerce in Chittagong. It is observed that though Chaktai has lost its past glory as a national business centre controlling food business in the whole country, still it has retained its importance as a regional business hub and is continuing to contribute significantly to the national economy. The study thus helps us understand the nature, type and magnitude of the drainage and water logging problems faced by the city dwellers. The policy proposals and recommendations that are provided in the paper could be considered while preparing a land use plan for a city.DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/jbip.v2i0.9556  Journal of Bangladesh Institute of Planners Vol. 2, December 2009, pp. 49-60</jats:p>"

This study was designed to determine the responsible factors role on KAP of users for receiving family planning services from rural setting of Bangladesh. Methods: Qualitative descriptive analytical study was employed to follow a structured questionnaire format. A total 420 users were interviewed from two unions. Relevant literatures were reviewed to enhance our understanding of the issue in question. The questionnaires were pretest before finalization and it's has both open and close-ended questions. Results: The knowledge of users (87%) was mostly universal, while community women were more advanced than men. The unmet need for contraception's remains about 16% and 40% of mothers to have unintended births. Of all users, Pill was most known methods (68%), although IUCD (18%) and condom (14%) methods were common at community. Side effect (69%) and husband disapproval (31%) was barrier of practice of FPMs, although space for child bear (37%), health problems (30%), financial problems (25%) and education (8%) were push factors to users. Approximately 40% respondents travelled more than 4 kilometer to getting services. Factors were found to be significantly associated with KAP of users were: education (X2=29.73; p&lt;0.001), occupation (X2=16.67; p&lt;0.001) income (X2=17.61; p&lt;0.011) family size (X2=25.44; p&lt;0.022) distance(X2=18.75; p&lt;0.013) cultural beliefs (X2=23.84; p&lt;0.001, and accessibility (X2=23.67; p&lt;0.00). Poor practice (44%) associated with schooling of users. Conclusion: Regular yard meeting with users' community and services allied persons may be arranged at community levels for upgrading the existing KAP. Stakeholders' from different ages, genders, and socioeconomic groups have to be engaged to promote evidence-based services. Extensive education and communication programs are needed to address family planning methods and services.</jats:p>"

So far, many researchers have reported about shape control and fabrication of AAO films. However, they have reported on the shape control with different diameter and length of anodic aluminum oxide mainly. We present a combined mild-hard (or hard-mild) anodization to prepare shape-controlled AAO films. Two main parameters which are combination mild-hard (or hard-mild) anodization and run-time of voltage control are applied in this work. The voltages of mild and hard anodization are respectively 40 and 80 V. Anodization was conducted on the aluminum sheet in 0.3 mole oxalic acid at 4°C. AAO films with morphologies of varying interpore distance, branch-shaped pore, diameter-modulated pore and long funnel-shaped pore were fabricated. Those shapes will be able to apply to fabricate novel nano-materials with potential application which is especially a support to prevent volume expansion of inserted active materials, such as metal silicon or tin powder, in lithium ion battery. The silicon powder electrode using an AAO as a support shows outstanding cycle performance as 1003 mAh/g up to 200 cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",

This process first involves a leaching of spent Ni-MH powders with sulfuric acid at 90°C, resulting in rare earth precipitates (i.e., NaRE(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, RE = La, Ce, Nd), which are converted into rare earth oxides via two different approaches: i) simple heat treatment in air, and ii) metathesis reaction with NaOH at 70°C. Not only the morphological features but also the crystallographic structures of all products are systematically investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD); their thermal behaviors are also analyzed. In particular, XRD results show that some of the rare earth precipitates are converted into oxide form (such as La&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, Ce&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with heat treatment at 1200°C; however, secondary peaks are also observed. On the other hand, rare earth oxides, Re&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; can be successfully obtained after metathesis of rare earth precipitates, followed by heat treatment at 1000°C in air, along with a change of crystallographic structures, i.e., NaRE(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → RE(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; →Re&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;We report the feasibility of TaC production via self-propagating high temperature synthesis, and the influence of the initial green compact density on the final composite particle size. Experiments are carried out from a minimum pressure of 0.3 MPa, the pressure at which the initial green body becomes self-standing, up to 3 MPa, the point at which no further combustion occurs. The green density of the pellets varies from 29.99% to 42.97%, as compared with the theoretical density. The increase in green density decreases the powder size of TaC, and the smallest particle size is observed with 1.5 MPa, at 10.36 μm. Phase analysis results confirm the presence of the TaC phase only. In the range of 0.3-0.5 MPa, traces of unreacted Ta and C residues are detected. However, results also show the presence of only C residue in the matrix within the pressure range of 0.6-3.0 MPa.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",
