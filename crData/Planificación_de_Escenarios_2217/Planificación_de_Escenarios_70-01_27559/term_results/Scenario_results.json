      "abstract": "<jats:p>China undoubtedly has had always the world’s attention, ranging from the issues of governmental and economic control to its increasing rates of production. Termed to be the world’s production capital, this oriental country has an ever evolving capital markets structure that is often categorized as merely governmental control. The past few years has essentially witnessed a metamorphosis of this myth as Chinese capital markets are undergoing a change in terms of both their structure and the substantive law governing the same. China has opened its gates to foreign investors and has endeavoured to attain a more transparent procedure to attract investment in the country by permitting their entry the capital markets structure. However, this privatization and entry of foreign players in the Chinese capital markets is dampened by the vigorous control of the Chinese government, thereby leading to questions regarding the legitimacy of an open capital market structure. Further, China’s association with Hong Kong through its stock exchange has gained relevance in the past few years, drawing the attention of global investors. This paper attempts to analyse the past, the present and the future potential of one of Asia’s leading economies as it could hold the key to transformation of global economics and trade. The researcher has adopted a comprehensive method by focusing primarily on the securities market in China, along with drawing light on the status quo and the challenges in other tools of capital markets like the bonds and sovereign funds. This method of analysis leads the researcher to promulgate the view that China has taken initiative to open its capital markets structure and is committed to become a global player but remains reticent due to the massive governmental control at each level of regulation in the capital markets structure.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Karnataka, which ranks 2nd in installation of drip irrigation, has vast potential for growth and export of horticulture crops of different variety. Horticulture in Karnataka contributes 40 per cent of the combined income from agricultural sector and its share in state GDP is about 17 per cent, both of which are significant for the growth of Karnataka economy in general and its agricultural sector in particular. This paper therefore, tries to revisit the domain of Karnataka horticulture in order to examine its growth and development in terms of area, productivity, output, export potential and income derived.Â  The primary objective of the authors herein is to highlight the horticultural development experience of the state in terms of the above mentioned variables so as to draw lessons for further progress of horticulture both in Karnataka and the rest of India. Such a study when viewed in a macro perspective is of immense value in todayâ€™s need for a globally integrated and locally sustainable agriculture.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This article aims to discuss some of the major challenges emerged recently in the muItilingual classes in higher education of Nepal. For this, I sampled 20 teachers from four campuses of Kathmandu valley. Similarly, 30 students were selected from those campuses. A set of separate questionnaires was distributed for both teachers and students and at the same time the classes of the teachers were observed. I conducted focus group discussions to elicit the real information from the informants. Major findings show that in the classes of higher education, neither the teachers nor the students are satisfied with the use of medium of instruction. There are communication problems, content delivery problems, comprehension related problems because of language gaps. Finally, in this article, some suggestions are made to make English language teaching in the multilingual settings more effective.Key words: Multilingual classroom; Multiculturalism; Medium of instruction; Multilingual educationJournal of NELTA Vol. 15 No. 1-2 December 2010Page: 121-133Uploaded date: 4 May, 2011DOI: 10.3126/nelta.v15i1-2.4618</jats:p>"

I found that the public wrote about internal politics, citizen´s affairs, the daily production, international politics and 26 other subtopics. The interpretation of the meanings and patterns within the topics of greatest interest, showed a strong sense of community, feelings of frustration and uncertainty about some aspects of national life as well as noticeable differences in the narrative and the emotions expressed by the public of the two dailies.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Logistic regression is one of the powerful analytical techniques for use when the outcome variable is dichotomous and the coefficients derived from logistic regression can be interpreted as odds ratio. The analysis under logistic regression gives the β coefficient along with the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for odds ratio. Since the β coefficients are the natural logarithm of the risk, we have to exponentiate them to get the estimate of risk (odds ratio). Currently, the most widely used statistical methodology for reporting dichotomous data in developed countries is logistic regression analysis. But in developing countries, several research studies with dichotomous data are reported using percentages or cross tabulation method because of the ignorance of the application and knowledge of this methodology among the authors, readers, reviewers and editors.  This trend in developing countries should be changed through the use of appropriate statistical methods with the help of professional data analysts, otherwise research cannot investigate vital findings.  http://dx.doi.org/10.3126/nje.v1i4.5752 Nepal Journal of Epidemiology 2011;1(4):111-113</jats:p>"

Total 110912 local residents who depend on the wetland for their survival are poor, with an annual average per capita income Tk 3175, a literacy rate is 20.5%.Total cultivable land 17912.75 hectares, fallow land 1007.59 hectares; single crop 79.32% and double crop land 20.68%; land under irrigation 90%.This paper also sheds light on the status of livelihood using resources and face problems are barriers to sustainable livelihood development. There haor based alternative activity is fishing (20%) followed by duck rearing (3%), Beef fating (6.6%), The study find 71% households were found effectively landless of which about 55% were absolutely landless and 17% households were migrated and 78.9% haor households are suffered from food insecurity mainly because of landlessness, mono-crop cultivation, seasonal unemployment and natural calamities. The study suggests that the avenues for prospective coping strategies are to put a stop to existing leasing system of haor water bodies, making proper arrangements for creating alternative income generating activities throughout the year. Change the money lending system and taking preventives and curative measures for natural calamities.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>According to Michael Bergmann, Skeptical Theism consists of two components: firstly, the belief that there is an all-powerful, all-knowing and perfectly good immaterial person who created the world, and secondly, the skeptical claim that we have no reason to believe that the possible goods and evils we know of are representative of the goods and evils that exist. According to the Global Skepticism Objection, Skeptical Theism entails that we should not be surprised if we are radically deceived by God: there just might be a greater good that can figure in a reason God has for deceiving us about reality. In support of this objection, Stephen Law presents an amusing analogy involving Olly and his reality-projector. In this paper, I outline the Global Skepticism Objection and Law’s case in support of it. I then respond by arguing that the scope of Skeptical Theism should be restricted, and seek to justify this through a narrower construal of Theism and an appeal to common sense.</jats:p>",

Due to non-availability of healthy cornea, many people continue to live in a dark world.Objectives: To assess the awareness and perception of undergraduate medical students towards eye donation.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among undergraduate medical students of Kolkata on August 2010 using a pre-designed, pre-tested, semi-structured, self-administered questionnaire. The data were analyzed using Epi-info software package version 6.04.Results: Almost all (98.9%) participants knew that eyes can be donated and 70.8% were aware at the time of eye collection. However, only 43.7% respondents knew whom to approach for pledging their eyes for donation; 80.7% were either willing (76.0%) or had already pledged (4.7%) to donate their eyes. Television was the major source (78.1%) of information on eye donation. Nobility was the main motivation (87.7%) and 75.5% felt the need for helping the blind. Of these medical students, 19.3% were unaware and did not pledge eye donation due to objection by family members and dislike of the idea of separating their eyes.Conclusion: The present study revealed that medical students were well aware of eye donation with a favorable attitude towards it and most of them were inclined to pledge for eye donation. The perceived reasons for not donating eyes need to be considered while creating awareness about eye donation in the community. Students can be actively involved as volunteers in eye donation campaigns and after proper training in counselling techniques, they can act as counsellors for eye donation activities.</jats:p>"

Total 5991 pregnant mothers with eclampsia admitted in the inpatient department of the tertiary care teaching hospital were recruited for the study, irrespective of their previous antenatal check up history. Subjects with known seizure disorders were excluded from the study. The subjects were managed according to standard regimens (Menon, Ph-sodium, diazepam &amp; magnesium sulphate) and results were documented in standardised format. Case fatality rate, mean induction delivery time &amp; birth-weight, perinatal mortality rates were recorded. Study reveals that the incidence of eclampsia &lt;20 years was 6.97% and majority (5.41%) came from rural areas. Eclampsia was noted primarily in primigravida (7.43%) and unbooked (6.41%) mothers. Ante partum eclampsia predominated (64%) and incidence of caesarean section was 22.25%.The overall case fatality rate was 6.05% and eclampsia contributed 27.85% of all maternal deaths during the last two years of the study period. The overall incidence of low birth weight baby was 26.96% and perinatal mortality was 30.33% (1411/4651).The incidence of perinatal mortality and low birth weight babies are lower in the last 4 years when compared to earlier studies. Proper socio-demographic assessment of pregnancy with eclampsia, planned delivery, shorter induction delivery interval, good control of convulsion by magnesium sulphate, intensive intranatal monitoring causes less maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.
