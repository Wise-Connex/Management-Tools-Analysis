Study conclusions are that planning activities are dominated by ‘agingspecific’ organizations and their members. Planning activities are characterized by organizational and interorganizational conflicts in which the organizations and professionals involvcd attempt to legitimate and ‘professionalize’ their work in aging, partially as a means of dealing with their lack of rcsourccs and threatened organizational survival. The data indicate that both the nature and task of planning (conceptualized in broad and ambiguous terms) and the structure of the planning organizations (essentially federative) combined to prevent: (1) the objective identification of gaps and needs in the field of aging as a basis for ‘planning’; (2) the inclusion of members representing multiple professions, community organizations or institutions, or the elderly themselves, or (3) social action. Thus, in the politics of planning the planning organizations become a vehicle for relatively weak organizations to deal with their basic survival needs. Major implications of study findings in the light of present national legislation and policy in aging are discussed.</jats:p>",

After a brief introduction which explains the basic ideas behind SDM, the structure of the model is developed and described and the results of a hypothetical example analysed. This is followed by some comments on practical aspects of implementing the model in real life and its potential for cash flow planning and control.</jats:p>",

Sir James Graham was an exception; he had a first class mind and only narrowly missed being prime minister. He was also never governor general, although he must have been offered the post more frequently than any other man of his time! Given the dangerous international situation at the beginning of Lord Aberdeen's ministry, and the importance of naval preparedness and planning, it was plain that an experienced man was needed to head the Admiralty. Sir James was the natural choice. He had, after all, been first lord before, from 1830 to 1834, and while there he had been responsible for radical changes in naval administration. It so happened that his reforms were not subjected to the stresses of a large-scale European war until after their originator had returned to the post of his youth, and it will be the main aim of this paper to study how the reformed Admiralty tackled some of the problems of major warfare, and the way in which Sir James interpreted his powers and duties.</jats:p>",

The model includes faculty staffing goals, career constraints, teaching and course loads, tenure constraints and budget constraints. A weighted sum of the deviations from the staffing goals make up the objective function of the prototype model considered. Several methods of estimating the various parameters of the model are discussed, and the results of a small example are also discussed. </jats:p>",

The product can be manufactured in several producing regions and is required in a number of markets. The demands for each of the markets are non‐decreasing over time and must be met exactly during each time period (i.e., no backlogging or inventorying for future periods is permitted). Each region is assumed to have an initial production capacity, which may be increased at a given cost in any period. The demand in a market can be satisfied by production and shipment from any of the regions. The problem is to find a schedule of capacity expansions for the regions and a schedule of shipments from the regions to the markets so as to minimize the discounted capacity expansion and shipment costs. The problem is formulated as a linear programming model, and solved by an efficient algorithm using the operator theory of parametric programming for the transporation problem. Extensions to the infinite horizon case are also provided.</jats:p>",

The two essentially different philosophical approaches are brought out in their conversation which is concerned with a proposed traffic noise survey. Harry has been commissioned to design a survey to evaluate the effect of various sources of traffic noise on people for future planning purposes, the underlying theme of the paper is the concept of the population for which inferences are required and the different approaches which the two statisticians take to achieving this.</jats:p>",
