      "abstract": "<jats:p>“Traditional” methods of family planning (FP) generally are methods such as withdrawal and periodic abstinence that do not require contraceptive substances or devices, or clinical procedures. In 1991, approximately 38 million couples worldwide relied on withdrawal to prevent pregnancy, and 30-35 million relied on periodic abstinence. Together, these constituted one-quarter of all users of temporary methods of FP worldwide. In Bangladesh, the proportion using periodic abstinence or withdrawal was more than 20 percent of users of temporary methods. The reasons for use of traditional methods have not been investigated in Bangladesh, because of overriding attention to modern methods. Given that the use of traditional methods is widespread, what is the level of knowledge among Bangladeshi users about the safe periods of the monthly cycle for the most effective use of periodic abstinence? What factors cause higher socioeconomic groups to be the main users of traditional methods? Why do some people switch between traditional and modern methods? This report investigates these questions, and others, but is aimed at determining the main policy issues and the policy implications of findings.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Abandoned mines and mining-related activities typically cause environmental problems related to erosion and pollutant transport. Traditional methods of smelter reclamation plan design are hampered by the lack of data integration and by time-consuming analysis. The proposed spatial decision-support system will minimize these problems as data integration and analysis are offered within one computerized environment. A geographical information system (GIS), remotely sensed data, erosion modeling, and multicriteria decisionmaking (MCDM) methods have been integrated to support reclamation procedures better. Integration of the digital data sources and analysis will produce more realistic, up-to-date models of damaged lands. This methodology is applicable to any number of damaged sites, including mine sites, smelter sites, widespread hazardous-waste sites, and areas negatively impacted by intense agriculture or forestry. </jats:p><jats:p> The system has been tested at the Anaconda smelter site, an Environmental Protection Agency superfund site near Butte, Montana. The primary surficial problems are related to metal toxicity and transport. In addition to producing a description of the physical conditions at the entire site, the system provides spatial decision-support capabilities for generating and evaluating revegetation strategies for the site with the use of different priority schemes. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to assess the role of CBD programs in terms of providing information and services, to learn more about the determinants of program effectiveness, and to attempt to compare the programs’ cost-effectiveness. Fieldwork was undertaken in mid-1995 when data were collected from seven of the major CBD programs in Kenya. Four rural and three urban programs were included, as were programs that remunerated their agents and those that did not, and programs that had full-time agents and those that had part-time agents. Data on the programs themselves were collected from records and from interviews with managers and staff, as well as from a sample of CBD agents. Data were also collected from representative samples of the population living in the agents’ catchment areas. Key findings and programmatic recommendations are provided in this report.</jats:p>"

The large number of articles on this subject and growing number of conferences, research projects, and debates are testimonies to the importance of the issue, both from the programmatic point of view and as a process for bringing about a gender balance in men's and women's reproductive rights and responsibility. This paper addresses the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices of rural males toward various aspects of family formation including reproduction and contraceptive use. The study was undertaken in the rural areas of Agra district, in Uttar Pradesh. To assess the knowledge and attitudes of males, 517 currently married males were interviewed. Out of those interviewed, 317 of their wives were also interviewed. The two sets of data provide an opportunity to compare the attitudes of males and females on issues related to family formation.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I argue that contemporary processes of telecommunications-based urban development provide challenges to how urban space is conceptualised and planned within advanced industrial cities. The paper has four parts. First, I briefly review the loosely integrated body of research on city—telecommunications relations and highlight the tendency of much contemporary research to adopt futuristic metaphors for explaining such relations at a general level. In part two, the argument that the current explosion of telecommunications applications across all aspects of urban development challenges old urban paradigms, for understanding and planning urban space, is developed. Four challenges are identified and explored: the challenge of invisibility, the conceptual challenge, the challenge to urban planning, and the challenge of containment. Given this context, the third part of the paper builds on recent insights in cultural studies to explore the potential for new conceptual frameworks which help explain the new relations between telecommunications, time, space, and advanced industrial cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1987, the Family Planning Association of Kenya (FPAK) has operated two youth centers, one in Nairobi and the other in Mombasa. The centers target unmarried youth aged 10–24 and their primary objective is reduction in incidence of sexual and reproductive-health-related problems. These centers offer recreational and sports facilities, counseling services, including reproductive health (RH) information, limited RH services, and referrals. In 1996, FPAK undertook a systematic evaluation of its youth-center program including a situation analysis of the centers, a survey in their catchment areas, and an analysis of program costs. The main strength of the program was found to be its network of youth promoters and coordinators, who reached large numbers of youth through educational activities. A negative attitude toward adolescent sexual activity was found to be pervasive among youth center staff, however if retrained they could be an inexpensive and effective means of delivering nonprescriptive contraceptives. Investing in staff would reduce high rates of attrition among volunteers and cost of recruitment and training. As noted in this report, there is need for improvement in the youth centers, however FPAK has shown considerable commitment to meeting RH needs of adolescents in Kenya.</jats:p>"

Subjected to a heavy frequency of tourist visits (800 000 p.a.) for many years, the absence of any management has led to serious degradation. The need to reorganise and rehabilitate the site has been apparent for a long time, although not uniformly recognised. In 1977, the site was already included in an initial operation as a \"grand site national\" (important national site). The \"direction départementale de l’Equipement\" proposed a rehabilitation project which was unanimously rejected by local representatives. In 1989, the site was again identified as one of the \"important national sites\" which should receive priority in the rehabilitation programmes. A new project was prepared with the agreement of local representatives. Why this change ? During these twelve years, what changes had taken place in the general environmental context, in the local context, among the relevant actors, and in the project itself ? The present project envisages some major improvements on the classified site (loi du 2 mai 1930) and in the sensitive coastal zone (Littoral law, 1986). It heavily involves the state through the Ministry of the Environment and the Conservation agency for the coastal zone (Conservatoire du littoral). The examplarity of this action, is it really what the relevant actors claim ?</jats:p>"

The approaches developed can be used to prioritize different pipeline segments for maintenance and to select the optimal combination of integrity maintenance actions for high priority segments. The maintenance decisions considered for a given pipeline segment include the maintenance method, the time interval between maintenance events, and the repair criteria for damage detected by inspection.</jats:p>"

Data on the functioning of program subsystems and the quality of care provided were collected in May 1995 from 254 maternal and child health/family planning (MCH/FP) facilities throughout the country using a situation analysis approach. The study sample included a representative sample of facilities from the MOH and NGO sectors. It also included a census of all facilities operated by the Nairobi City Council so that comparisons could be made with the situation analysis study undertaken in 1991. Data were collected through an inventory of facility infrastructure and equipment, staff interviews, observations of FP client-provider consultations, and exit interviews with FP and MCH staff. This is the second time that a national situation analysis study was undertaken in Kenya, and a comparison was made with the results from the first study, which was undertaken in 1989.</jats:p>"

Planners are involved in a continual process of constructing and deconstructing planning activities, reflecting upon these activities, and renegotiating and analyzing these activities. The praxis model presented in this paper fosters a spirit of critical reflection and action in the planning process. It also recognizes that those involved in program planning come to appreciate that values, beliefs, ideologies, and contextual factors are not only constructed, but are also culturally transmitted, provisional, and relative. This awareness facilitates their challenge of the taken-for-grantedness of institutional settings within which program planning is practised, relationships are mediated, and political and economic agendas dominate.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) requires metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to develop financially constrained metropolitan transportation plans and programs. FHWA officials believed that independent studies were needed if problems with the requirement were to be understood. A summary of findings of those studies along with an analysis by an FHWA official are presented. Financial planning requirements were found to be generally well received. Fiscal constraint requirements can be traumatic, but there is agreement that realistic programs are worth having. Reconciling costs with revenues was found to present MPOs with the most severe difficulties. Allowing contingency projects and revenue sources and smoothing the transportation improvement program amendment process can retain fiscal realism while diminishing the trauma of cost-revenue reconciliation. Underestimation of capital and operating and maintenance costs to balance a plan were found to be probable. Dissemination of “best practice” examples by FHWA and FTA and MPO self-policing appear to be the most likely corrective actions. It was found that few MPOs considered technologies to reduce operations and maintenance costs. Placement of such technologies will be slow. MPO personnel were found to have encountered more constraints than expected in using the modal flexibility provisions of ISTEA. More MPO regional coalition building will be needed to meet flexibility expectations. Despite availability, it was found that FHWA and FTA information, reports, and software concerning nonfederal sources of revenue were not obtained by officials desiring them. MPOs are encouraged to rely more on expert assistance to implement local funding sources. </jats:p>",

Multiple training programs to introduce a standardized clinical evaluation for the detection, treatment, and management of RTI/STDs were conducted. Prior and subsequent to training, observations of health care provider (HCP) and client interactions were conducted to evaluate behavior changes among HCPs. Each consenting client received a standardized reproductive health history, a pelvic exam, and provided specimens for laboratory testing to detect RTIs. Through universal screening of the participants by an STD referral laboratory, 25 percent were confirmed to have one or more RTIs while 14 percent had one or more STDs. HCPs were observed by trained research assistants who recorded an itemized evaluation of HCP behavioral components. As noted in this report, the 70-item observation tool showed a preference for performing physical examinations, and a reluctance to perform history taking, education, partner treatment plans, and prevention counseling.</jats:p>"

Research work is aimed at the elaboration of suitable collaborative remote working structures for research and project transactions, including study projects, within the context of spatial planning on the basis of ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode: a technology of broad band telecommunications). The generation and manipulation of digital spatial models and their virtual transportation within large spatial distances represent main objectives. The current subjects in urban and regional planning and in architecture act as test projects to be defined in the course of the research project in their contents and spatial context and to be represented as digital spatial working models.</jats:p>"

In den letzten fünfzig Jahren hat man sich im Westen über das, was eine monistische Betrachtungs-weise Indiens Sprachenwirrwarr nennt, lustig gemacht. Hierauf hat es Reaktionen indischer Wissenschaftier gegeben, die das Gerücht, Indien sei sprachlich einmalig, übernehmen und diese Einmaligkeit als etwas Wertvolles hegen und pflegen. Dies wird besonders deutlich, wo die These aufgestellt wird, die indische Mehrsprachigkeit sei im Grunde konkurrenz- und konfliktfrei.\n\t\tIndische Wissenschaftier haben das Konfliktpotential der soziolinguistischen Vielfalt beschrieben, die Szene dabei jedoch als im ganzen harmonisch und friedlich dargestellt. Neuere Arbeiten zeigen demgegenüber, daß es beispielsweise durchaus eine Tendenz zur Aufgabe schwacherer Sprachen gibt. Die Vorstellungen in den Arbeiten mancher Autoren geben den Wunsch nach analytischer Homogenitat und ein Denken in gesamtstaatlichen Kategorien wieder. Ein echter Fortschritt läßt sich nur durch eine entschieden realistischen Analyseansatz erreichen, der genialen Verallgemeinerungen, Klischees und Stereotypen Einhalt gebietet und statt dessen von den Grundtatsachen ausgeht.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tKio estas hinda pri la hinda plurlingveco?\n\t\tČi tio estas kontribuo al la debato pri la unikeco de la hinda plurlingveco. Dum la pasinta duonjarcento la okcidenta moko pri tio kion monistoj perceptas kiel lingvan fatrason de Hindio, instigis reagojn de hindaj sciencistoj kiuj emas akcepti la onidiron pri tio, ke Hindio estas lingve unika, sed flegas tiun unikecon kiel valorajon. Tio farigas aparte evidenta en iuj tezoj, ke la hinda plurlingveco estas esence senkonkura kaj senkonflikta.\n\t\tMontrigas, ke hindaj sciencistoj verkis pri la konflikteco de la socia-lingva diverseco preferante bildigi la scenon harmonia kaj paca. Lastatempaj studoj tamen montras, ke ekzemple ekzistas tendenco cesi uzi kelkajn malfortajn lingvojn. La misperceptoj en la verkoj de kelkaj aŭtoroj reflektas deziron pri analiza unuececo en tutstataj kategorioj. Veran progreson eblas atingi nur per decide realisma analiza sinteno, kiu baras glorajn generaligojn, klisojn kaj stereotipajojn, kaj kiu kontraŭe respektas la bazajn faktojn.</jats:p>",

Esperanto-Weltkongreß stattfand. Initiativen beim Völker-bund, den Vereinten Nationen und der Unesco haben wenig mehr erbracht als die Anerkennung der Tatsache, daB es Esperanto gibt. Die Möglichkeit, Esperanto für diese Organisationen selbst in Erwägung zu ziehen, wird vor allem wohl durch einflußreiche nationalistische und internationalistische Vorstellungen verhindert, was in instrumentalistischen Argumentationen oft übersehen wird. Im Bereich der Bildung scheint die mangelnde Bereitschaft, Esperanto einzu-beziehen, eher eine grundlegendere Zersplitterung der Konzeptionsbildung beim Thema Sprache widerzuspiegeln. In beiden Fallen bietet ein zur Zeit entstehendes ökologisches Paradigma in Sprachenpolitik und Sprachplanung Lösungsmöglichkeiten.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tEsperanto kaj lingvopolitiko: Esplorado de kelkaj ideoj\n\t\tLa aŭtoro priesploras kelkajn ideojn el la diskutoj ce la Nitobe-Simpozio pri lingvopolitiko, organizita lige kun la 8l-a Universala Kongreso de Esperanto en 1996. Esperanto-premkampanjoj ĉe Ligo de Nacioj, Unuigintaj Nacioj kaj Unesko alportis pli-malpli nur la agnoskon, ke la lingvo ekzistas. En la organizajoj mem, la konsideradon de Esperanto eble malhelpas fortaj naciismaj aŭ internaciismaj diskursoj, kies ekziston ignoras instrumentismaj argumentoj. Sur la kampo de edukado, la neglekto de Esperanto sajne spegulas pli generalan malkoheron en la prilingva konceptado.

This algorithm may be based upon the use of an inverse infinitesimal kinematic analysis for the majority of the path with a finite inverse analysis used to provide an initial joint configuration and periodically to correct for any joint errors that may have accumulated. Here, it is assumed that there is complete correlation and coherence of solutions between these analyses, otherwise problems, such as a lack of repeatability may occur. This may be accomplished by modelling the manipulator as an elastic system which permits the development of a task planning method by using analyses which are all mutually coherent. In this paper, the method is developed and demonstrated using a redundant manipulator that simultaneously avoids obstables, singularities and joint motion limitations. The task planning method and associated analyses are applicable to the general serial redundant manipulator with an arbitrary degree of redundancy.</jats:p>",

The books here reviewed are but two recent examples of this exceptional activity. They are considered together because they complement each other: one documents the state of the art for the numerous immigrant languages, the other the official language policies that have accompanied their arrival since World War II.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tPlurlingvismo aŭstralie:\n\t\tInter rigora dokumentado kaj pasia defendo\n\t\tAŭstralio estas nekutima lando, ne nur pro sia abundo da lingva krudmaterialo, sed ankaŭ pro la rigoreco per kiu gi provas dokumenti gin kaj pro la politika pasieco per kiu gi provas konservi gin. La recenzataj libroj estas nur du lastatempaj specimenoj el tiu escepta agado. Ili estas traktataj kune, car ili komplementas unu la alian: unu dokumentas la aktualan nivelon de scio pri la multnombraj lingvoj de enmigrintoj kaj la alia la oficialajn lingvopolitikojn, kiuj de la dua mondmilito akompanis ilian alvenadon.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>ZUSAMMENFASSUNG\n\t\tEinheit und Zwietracht in der niederländischen Rechtschreibungsdebatte\n\t\t1989 setzten die Regierungen der Niederlande und Belgiens einen geheimen LinguistenausschuB ein, der die Aufgabe erhielt, das inkonsistente Rechtschreibsystem der niederlandischen Sprache zu vereinheitlichen. 1994 lehnten den Minister die Vorschläge des Ausschusses vor dem Hinter-grund einer hitzigen offentlichen Debatte über die Rechtschreibreform ab. Die Untersuchung beschreibt den Umschwung von absichtlicher Geheimhaltung, die die Diskussion auf eine \"bloße\" akademische Debatte begrenzen sollte, zu einer emontionalen öffentlichen Kontroverse. Der Beitrag untersucht, wie es dazu kam, daß der Kampf um Rechtschreibungsfragen gar nicht so sehr eine Diskussion über zweckmäßige Änderungen der Rechtschreibung war, sondern sich vor allem um die Fragen drehte, wie legitime Rechtschreibreformen festgelegt zu werden hätten und wer hierfür verantwortlich sei. Es war daher nicht nur eine Sachdiskussion, sondern ebenso ein soziopolitisches Ereignis. Die Untersuchung ist von Callon und Latours Soziologie der Über-setzung inspiriert.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tUnueco kaj kverelo en la nederlanda ortografia debato\n\t\tEn 1989 la registaroj de Nederlando kaj Belgio installs sekretan komisionon de lingvistoj kun la tasko unuecigi la malkoheran ortografian sistemon de la nederlanda lingvo. En 1994 la ministroj malaprobis la proponojn de la komisiono meze de vigla publika debato pri problemoj de literumado. La studo priskribas la turnigon de intenca sekreteco, kiu devis limigi la diskuton al \"nura\" akademia debato, al emocia publika kverelo. La artikolo esploras, kiel la batalo pri ortografio montriĝis esti ne tiom debato pri utilaj sangoj de literumo, kiom problemo pri kiel atingi legitimitajn ortografiajn reformojn kaj kiu respondecu pri ili. Temis do ne nur pri argumenta batalo, sed ne malpli pri socipolitika evento. La studo estas inspirita de la traduka sociologio de Callon kaj Latour.</jats:p>",

Une autre loi obligeait, dès 1988, les commerçants à avoir des affiches extérieures seulement en français. Le ton s'élève encore alors que le Parti Québecois convoque deux referendums sur la \"souveraineté\" (1980 et 1995). Ce texte dresse le bilan des vingt ans de legislation linguistique \"musclée,\" et de la \"referendomanie\" qui domine, parfois, le discours sur l'aménagement linguistique. Quel que soit le résultat du prochain referendum, le gouvernement québecois devra attaquer lés problèmes économiques, démographiques, urbanistiques, et ceux de l'immigration. Ce texte défend l'hypothèse que, paradoxalement, le Québec a besoin des Anglophones québecois pour que le français survive dans la province (et dans le Canada).\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tSendependeco kaj lingva politiko en Kebekio\n\t\tEkde la jaro 1961, la parlamento de Kebekio komencis akcepti daŭre pli fortajn lingvajn leĝojn favore al la franca. Ĝis 1977 ĝi aprobis lingvajn leĝojn senegalajn en la libera mondo. Akto 101 konsiderinde limigas la nombron de studentoj, kiuj povas frekventi anglalingvajn lernejojn, dum ĝi klopodas starigi la francan kiel la lingvon de la laborejoj de Kebekio. Akto 178 (1988) malpermesis utiligon de lingvoj aliaj ol la franca sur eksteraj komercaj sildoj. Ĝis 1995 la Parti Québecois, kiu favoras sendependecon, dufoje postulis (kaj perdis) referendumojn pri \"suvereneca asociiĝo\" kun Kanado. Tiu ĉi teksto donas superrigardon al dudek jaroj da fortika lingvoplanado en Kebekio kaj ekzamenas la efikon de la institucia nestabileco de la provinco je la ekonomio, je lingvoplanado, kaj je rilatoj inter etnolingvaj grupoj. Ĝi ankaŭ klarigas kial Kebekio tiel forte elpasis por ŝirmi siajn lingvon kaj kulturon. La nuna studo konkludas, paradokse, ke Kebekio bezonas sian anglalingvan logantaron por garantii, ke la franca pluvivu.</jats:p>",

Der ständige Auslandsaufenthalt der 86 Versuchspersonen in beiden Studien betrug durchschnittlich 16 Jahre in Australien.

Der ständige Auslandsaufenthalt der 86 Versuchspersonen in beiden Studien betrug durchschnittlich 16 Jahre in Australien. In beiden Fällen wurde das Vermischen von Deutsch und Englisch abschatzig beurteilt. Der Grad der Sprachbeherrschung hatte sich zugunsten der Zweitsprache verschoben. Die Ansatzpunkte der Zwischenstudie wurden von der Hauptstudie nicht nur bestätigt, sondern verstärkt zum Ausdruck gebracht.Die Merkmale der vier Gruppenzugehörigkeitsunterschiede traten gleichfalls stark hervor und wurden erneut bestâtigt. Die Gruppenzugehorigkeit bezieht sich auf Versuchspersonen, die in Australien Verbindungen mit anderen Auslandsdeutschsprachigen aufrechterhalten (ea), und auf diejenigen, die dies nicht wünschen (ena); weiter diejenigen, die ihren ständigen Wohnsitz in Australien haben (PR) und auf diejenigen, die die australische Staatsbürgerschaft angenommen haben (NC). In bezug auf Erstsprachverlust ist besonders die NCena Gruppe gefährdet, am zweitstärksten betroffen sind diejenigen, die zwar ihren Reisepaß beibehielten, aber Verbindungen mit anderen Auslandsdeutschsprachigen nicht aufrechterhielten (PRena).\n\t\tReflexausdruck, Schlagfertigkeit und Lautmalerei bestimmen einen wichtigen Teil des täglichen Sprachgebrauchs. Diesen Ausdriicken von Wortgewandtheit kommt besondere Bedeutung zu, da sie vom prompten Einsatz abhängen und der Konversationszeitdruck wenig Spielraum fiir Fehler erlaubt. Daher tritt Sprachverlust besonders bei der Sprachproduktion auf, vor allem beim Sprechen, weshalb ein GroBteil des Unvermögens, sich in der Erstsprache auszudriicken, durch Spontaneitatsverlust verursacht wird.\n\t\tDie Studien zeigten, daB nach einer Einwanderungs- und Assimilationszeit von 10 bis 20 Jahren die Sprechweise der Versuchspersonen merklich beeintrachtigt war. Einstellung und Motivations-faktoren zum Zweitsprachraum beeinfluBten stark die Erstspracherhaltung oder den -verlust einer Generation. Das Konversationstempo überforderte oft die Geistesgegenwärtigkeit des Erinnerungs-vermögens (\"the presence of mind to remember\", Pyles und Algeo 1982: 262), sich des richtigen Ausdrucks zu bemächtigen oder bedienen zu können. Direktiibersetzungen aus der Zweitsprache wurden häufig angewandt und von den Versuchspersonen oft als einzige Ausdrucksmöglichkeit eingesetzt. Nicht nur war in der vorliegenden Studie Lautmalerei in der Erstsprache unter-repräsentiert, auch die Reflexausdrucksfähigkeit hatte sich durch den Erstsprachverlust zurück-gebildet. Reflexausdruck, Schlagfertigkeit und Lautmalerei stehen im Zusammenhang mit Konversationsgewandtheit und üben dadurch auch EinfluB auf das Ausdrucksvermögen (word-power) aus. Demzufolge waren gezielte Studien zu diesen Sprachformen von Bedeutung fiir die weitere Sprachverlustforschung.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tPerdo de la unua lingvo: refleksa respondo, rapidspriteco kaj sonimitado\n\t\tKaj en la intertempa studo {LPLP 17/3: 225-237) kaj en la cefa studo ni konstatis, ke german-lingvaj studitoj ne kapablis trapasi intervjuon sen uzi sian duan lingvon. La 86 studitoj en ambau studoj restadis en Aûstralio seninterrompan periodon de mezume 16 jaroj. En amba kazoj ili jugis negativa la miksadon de la germana kaj la angla. La grado de lingvoscipovo sovigis favore al la dua lingvo. La cefa studo ne nur konfirmis, sed pli emfaze reliefigis la tezojn de la intertempa studo.\n\t\tLa trajtoj de la kvar distingiloj de grupaparteno denove montrigis klare kaj denove konfirmigis. Temas pri studitoj, kiuj en Aûstralio tenas kontaktojn kun aliaj eksterlandaj germanlingvanoj (ea), kaj tiuj, kiuj tion ne deziras (ena); krome pri tiuj, kiuj establis sian konstatan loglokon en Aŭstralio* (PR), kaj tiuj, kiuj akiris la aŭstralian ŝtatanecon (NC). La dangero de perdo de la unua lingvo estas plej granda ĉe la grupo NCena, duagrade ce tiuj, kiuj ja retenas sian pasporton sed ne restis en kontakto kun aliaj eksterlandaj germanlingvanoj (PRena).\n\t\tRefleksa respondo, rapidspriteco kaj sonimitado estas gravaj elementoj de la ciutaga lingvouzo. Tiu fenomenoj de lingva lerteco aparte gravas, ĉar ili postulas tujecon kaj car la tempopremo de la fluanta konversacio ne permesas multe da eraroj. Tial la lingvoperdo okazas unuavice en la aktiva lingvouzo, precipe en parolado, pro kio esencan parton de la malkapablo sin esprimi en la unua lingvo kaŭzas perdo de spontaneeco.\n\t\tLa studoj montris, ke post periodo de enmigro kaj asimiligo de dek ĝis dudek jaroj la parolo de la studitoj estis senteble malevoluinta. Faktoroj de sinteno kaj motiviĝo rilate al la regiono de la dua lingvo forte influas la perdon au retenon de la unua lingvo en certa generacio. La rapideco de la konversacio transiris la limojn de la tuja disponebleco de la memorkapablo (\"the presence of mind to remember\"; Pyles kaj Algeo 1982: 262), de la povo trovi kaj uzi la ĝustan esprimon. La studitoj ofte uzis rektajn paŭstradukojn el la dua lingvo, kiuj ofte estis iliaj solaj esprimiloj. Sonimitado en la unua lingvo estas submezume malofta, kaj same la kapablo respondi reflekse malevoluis pro la perdo de la unua lingvo. Refleksa respondo, rapidspriteco kaj sonimitado estas ligitaj kun konversacia lerteco kaj per tio influas la esprimivon. Pro tio detalaj studoj pri tiuj formoj de lingvajo estus gravaj kontribuajoj al la estonta esplorado pri lingvoperdo.</jats:p>",

The study area is the Alpine arc of the province of Turin, la « Cornice Montana », providing a rich diversity of valley landscapes thanks to a mix of environmental, historical, cultural and economic characteristics. The paper first reviews the policies relating to tourism and infrastructures which have been followed up until now and underlines their important environmental impact, particularly the economic effects. Over a long period of time, such effects have generally been negative or only marginally positive. The paper then raises a few central theoretical questions relating to development, and particularly the active role of local inhabitants in transforming the potential of their region into a resource by becoming actors in the design and management of the development process. The experiment underlines the shift in planning towards a more interactive approach based on greater consultation between government departments and the local population. From a technical point of view, pluridisciplinary analyses are required if the project is to meet the stated objectives of choosing, supporting and directing the intrinsic energy of the local area. From a procedural point of view, it is vital that the local communities are consulted and that there is coordination in the decision-making process between the different levels and sectors of government involved in environmental planning. In the study area, an infrastructure of diverse physical, historical and cultural characteristics is providing support for the development of various forms of tourism which draw on the specific character and potential of each region, and are integrated with local, ecologically- oriented production activitites.</jats:p>"

Les usages relevés étaient majoritairement métaphoriques: positifs pour la plupart dans les contextes artistiques ou techniques, négatifs pour la plupart dans les contextes politiques. La moitié de toutes les mentions de la langue elle-même la présentaient négativement. Aucune mention du mot n'était à signaler dans le seul tabloïd étudié. Le mouvement espérantiste se trouve donc face à un défi de taille s'il veut influer sur les usages du mot qui prévalent actuellement.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tMiksaj metaforoj: La vorto Esperanto en ĵurnalisma tekstado\n\t\tLa aŭtoro studis la uzadon de la vorto Esperanto en elektitaj anglaj, francaj kaj germanaj ĵurnaloj tra 18-monata periodo. La plej multaj uzoj estis metaforaj: plejparte pozitivaj, kiam ternis pri arto aŭ tekniko , plejparte negativaj, kiam temis pri politiko. Duono el ĉiuj konkretaj aludoj al la lingvo prezentis ĝin negative. Neniu mencio troviĝis en la sola populara bulvarda gazeto pristudita. La Esperanto-movadon frontas granda defio, se ĝi volas ŝanĝi tiujn tekstadajn kutimojn.</jats:p>",

The purpose of strategic planning is to achieve a sustainable long-term fit of the farm business with its physical, social and financial environment. In pastoral farming, this essentially means developing plans that maximise and best match pasture growth with animal demand, while generating sufficient income to maintain or enhance farm resources and improvements, and attain personal and financial goals. Strategic plans relate to the whole farm business and are focused on the means to achieve future needs. They should be routinely (at least annually) reviewed and monitored for effectiveness through key performance indicators (e.g., Economic Farm Surplus) that enable progress toward goals to be measured in a timely and cost-effective manner. Failure to link strategy with control is likely to result in unfulfilled plans. Keywords: management, performance</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Urban quality is a concept that plays a central role in the debate about planning. A theory of urban quality should give a scientific interpretation of it, clarifying its possible role in the decision-making process and helping to define the tools for making it a working reality. A definition of “ quality ” can result only from multidisciplinary confrontation of different approaches. Quantitative approach, as expression of scientific and technical culture, and qualitative approach, more related to human science, can be integrated into a complex view of the problem. In this paper a set of performances is proposed to drive urban changes towards qualities of the city that can be considered satisfactory by the local communities involved in planning process. Furthermore, the relationship between this set of performances and the tools that decisors, technicians and citizens use to modify the form and organisation of the city is investigated. This allows a definition of the twofold role that social communication networks play : </jats:p>\n     <jats:p>-to support communication from decisors to users to the purpose of user requirements elicitation and of broadcasting the outcomes of urban policies ; </jats:p>\n     <jats:p>-to support participation of urban communities to the decision-making process, that means communication from users to decisors, in order to define priorities in urban policies and to verify consensus around their outcomes.</jats:p>"

The genesis of the first statutory nature conservation organisation in the UK and its historical link with local authority planners is described. The idea behind this link was to ensure that sites important for nature conservation were protected from development. In the late 1970s, the first systematic surveys of urban areas began and the data used to inform strategic and development planning. By the early 1980s the Urban Wildlife Groups which had arisen, generated new levels of political support and direct action by local people. Emphasis on the human part of the equation meant that site provision and evaluation had to involve additional criteria to those which looked solely at the natural history values. The statutory nature conservation organisation, English Nature, has sought to clarify some of the key factors these new approaches raised. Links to current global initiatives are outlined and future directions suggested.</jats:p>"

Esta oferta ha sido desarrollada a través del llamado Programa d'Educació Compensatòria. En mi análisis, identifico los supuestos en que se basan dichos documentos de política educativa, y las concepciones de la diversidad cultural y lingüística implícitas en ellos. Mis principales hallazgos son los siguientes: en primer lugar, la política está formulada de una manera bastante vaga en estos documentos; en segundo lugar, la política incorpora discursos contradictorios (por un lado, pluralismo cultural y, por el otro, asimilacionismo); y, en tercer lugar, hay un obvio descuido de las lenguas maternas de los alumnos. Mi conclusión es que se necesita más investigación interdisciplinaria sobre este tema, teniendo en cuenta factores sociopolíticos y culturales, así como una colaboración más estrecha entre investigadores y políticos, con el objetivo de mejorar los niveles educativos para todos los alumnos.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tEduka politiko, miksitaj idearoj: Reagoj al minoritatanaj lernantoj en Katalunio\n\t\tMi kritike analizas du dokumentojn pri eduka politiko, kiuj prezentas parton de la rezonado, sur kiu bazigas la edukaj ofertoj al lernantoj apartenantaj al etno-lingvaj au soci-ekonomiaj minoritatoj en Katalunio. Tiu oferto estis evoluigita pere de la t.n. Programa d'Educació Compensatôria. Mia analizo identigas la premisojn sur kiuj bazigas tiuj politikaj tezoj kaj la konceptojn de lingva kaj kultura diverseco, kiujn ili implicas. Miaj ĉefaj konkludoj estas: Unue, la dokumentoj vortumas la politikon sufiĉe malprecize. Due, la politiko enhavas kontraŭdirajn idearojn (unuflanke kulturan plurismon kaj aliflanke asimilismon). Kaj trie, troveblas evidenta ignoro de la denaska lingvo de la lernantoj. Mi konkludas, ke necesas plua esplorado de la temo kun konsidero al socipolitikaj kaj kulturaj faktoroj, samkiel necesas pli rekta kunlaboro inter sciencistoj kaj politikistoj por plibonigi la nivelon de edukado por êiuj.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>RESUMEN\n\t\tEducación en lengua materna en Etiopia: De una política a la implementación\n\t\tA pesar de los limitados recursos financieros y humanos, Etiopia esta avanzando rápidamente en la implementación de una política de educación en lengua materna para todos sus ciudadanos en un corto periodo de tiempo. Este artículo es el reporte de un observador participe de los tres primeros años de un ambicioso programa de educación en lengua materna, enfocado en el proceso de creación de materiales en lenguaje materno y en la efectividad del programa.\n\t\tPor décadas las minorías étnicas etíopes fueron dominadas por la política de usar solamente el idioma del emperador en la educación elemental. Luego durante los siguientes 17 años de socialismo el uso de la lengua materna fue permitido solamente en la alfabetización de adultos. Sin embargo desde 1991 el gobierno ha gastado una buena cantidad de recursos para facilitar la educación en lengua materna a los grupos étnicos que asi lo deseen.\n\t\tDiseñar un programa y producir sus materiales es uno de los mayores obstáculos para los paises que tienen varios idiomas y que desean ofrecer un programa universal de educación en lengua madré. En asociación con los grupos locales de individuos y las organizaciones no gubernamentales, el gobierno de Etiopia ha juntado cientos de maestros de escuela para producir materiales en idioma materno en cada una de las areas de estudio, del primero al sexto grado, en los ocho primeros idiomas de los cincuenta hablados en el pais. La estandarización del idioma y el desarrollo de una ortografía han ido de la mano en una forma acelerada.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tEdukado en gepatra lingvo en Etiopio: De politiko gis realigo\n\t\tSpite limigitajn financajn kaj homajn rimedojn, Etiopio rapide transiras el formulado de politiko al ties realigado por liveri al sia tuta popolo edukadon en la gepatra lingvo ene de mallonga tempoperiodo. En tiu ĉi artikolo, partoprenanta observante priskribas la unuajn tri jarojn de la aŭdaca etiopia programo por edukado en la gepatra lingvo, kun fokuso je la procedo por evoluigi materialojn en gepatraj lingvoj, kaj je la efikeco de la programo.\n\t\tDum jardekoj, la etnaj minoritatoj de Etiopio estis regataj de la politikoj de la Imperiestroj koncerne ekskluzivan utiligon de la amhara lingvo en elementa edukado. Dum la postaj dek sep jaroj da socialismo, la gepatran lingvon oni permesis nur por plenaĝula alfabetigo. Tamen, depost 1991, la Transira Registaro de Etiopio permesas al etnaj grupoj la rajton antaŭenigi la proprajn kulturojn kaj evoluigi siajn lingvojn por elementa edukado. Preterirante politikon al efektiva agado, la registaro elspezas signifajn rimedojn por faciligi edukadon en la gepatra lingvo por ĉiuj etnaj grupoj, kiuj tion deziras.\n\t\tGranda barilo por multlingvaj nacioj, kiuj deziras proponi universalan edukadon en gepatraj lingvoj, estas la kreado de taŭgaj studprogramoj kaj materialoj. Kunlabore kun lokaj enlogantoj kaj neregistaraj organizaĵoj, la registaro de Etiopio jam kunvenigis centojn da instruistoj por krei materialojn por ciu studtemo en la unua gis la sesa klaso, por la unuaj ok el la pli ol kvindek etiopiaj lingvoj. Lingva normigo kaj evoluigo de ortografio okazadas samtempe, ĉiam je granda rapideco.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Most Asian countries have consistently invested heavily in education over the last three decades. Access, participation, and achievement have reached unprecedented levels throughout the region, albeit large differences remain between the more developed and less developed systems. It is widely believed that economic growth in the 21st century will depend on the deployment of the intellectual capital that is developed by effective education systems. The educational challenge this presents is to find ways to continue raising the levels of educational endowments at sustainable levels of cost, especially where austerity creates short-term constraints on public finance. This paper locates recent educational development in an international context and profiles the current status of educational investment in different groups of Asian countries. It explores the issues that are likely to shape how systems will evolve in the first part of the 21st century, and provides analyses of the impact of demographic trends, and of the factors that will influence public financing, patterns of resource allocation, and internal efficiency. The results of these analyses are translated into future scenarios for different groups of countries. The paper concludes with a series of policy-oriented conclusions that identify priorities for governments and donors. </jats:p>",

Serum iodine levels were analysed from a sample of\n29 foxes shot on two baited sites and a nil-treatment site. The mean\npercentage of foxes with elevated seral iodine, indicating the consumption of\nat least one bait, was 58·3%. This rate of bait uptake would not\nconsistently deliver reductions in fox densities or immunisation levels\nconsidered necessary for the control of rabies enzootics in Europe and North\nAmerica. The minimum number known to be alive (MNA) method overestimated\npopulation reduction and underestimated abundance. Indirect estimators of\npopulation abundance, such as bait-station indices, are of more use in rabies\ncontingency planning and modelling. This is because they are more reliable,\nare likely to overestimate abundance, and are more precautionary. Shooting of\nfoxes at night was an inefficient method of reducing fox populations.</jats:p>"

Un accord signé entre l'Université Autonome et la Diputación de Barcelona a permis de mettre en place une équipe de chercheurs qui travaille sur le terrain et collabore avec les différentes administrations, les associations locales et les habitants pour arriver à définir, aménager et gérer certains espaces littoraux. Il s'agit d'un projet qui demande une étroite collaboration tout au long du processus de travail entre l'équipe de recherche, les habitants et leurs représentants. Les méthodes de recherche sont discutées entre tous les acteurs impliqués et se construisent de façon ouverte et démocratique. Cela oblige à des réflexions partagées et continuelles sur l'aménagement intégré et le développement durable que nous voulons présenter et débattre dans ce colloque. L'expérience est la première de ce type en Catalogne et peut, dans la mesure où elle est réussie, avoir force d'exemple.</jats:p>"

While much of this work has consisted of policy reports highlighting the plight of low-incomed, predominantly younger members of rural society in their search for affordable housing opportunities, in two recent publications Shucksmith has attempted to introduce elements of Weberian housing theory into rural housing research. In this paper, based on research in rural Wales in the early 1990s, I examine such a theoretical approach to the study of rural housing. I explore Saunders's notion of domestic property classes in a rural context and those conflicts surrounding additional housing development in the countryside. I suggest that, although housing tenure plays an important part in influencing residents' opposition to further housing and perceptions of housing need in the local area, other factors including occupational class, stage in the life cycle, and lifestyle are also worthy of consideration. Moreover, it is argued that interests within the private capital class would appear to be more complicated than previously outlined. </jats:p>",

Promotores del idioma vasco asocian el euskara con la identidad vasca. No obstante, investigaciones etnográficas revelaron ciertos efectos desiguales de dichas medidas enfocadas a restaurar el euskara en la Rioja Alavesa, zona fronteriza de la provincia vasca de Alava, donde dicha lengua no había sido hablaba desde hacía varios siglos. Además de acentuar la barrera que sépara las provincias vascas del resto del territorio español, estas políticas de idioma han reforzado simultaneamente cierta percepción de marginación étnica para muchos habitantes de la Rioja Alavesa que no conocen el euskara, a la vez que provoca el rechazo de la asociación del euskara a la identidad del pueblo vasco por otros. Este caso particular demuestra que el contexte fronterizo, donde son imprecisas las identidades, puede ser muy útil para así explorar la construcción de barreras étnicas y lingüísticas.\n\t\tRESUMO\n\t\tKonstrui lingvajn kaj etnajn limojn en eŭska limregiono:\n\t\tNegoci identecon en Rioja Alavesa, Hispanio\n\t\tEn 1982 gvidantoj de la regiona eŭska registaro en Hispanio realigis politikojn, kiuj celis repuŝi la malfortiĝon de la eŭska lingvo kaj restarigi ĝian uzon tra la tuta eŭska komunumo. Lingvaj planistoj konsideris la eŭskan unu el la ĉefaj markiloj de eŭska identeco. Tamen, etnografaj èsploroj montris malebenajn efikojn de politikoj por restarigi la eŭskan en Rioja Alavesa, lima zono de la eŭska provinco Alava, kie oni ne parolis la lingvon jam jarcentojn. La lingvaj politikoj, kiuj émis emfazi la limon dividantan la eŭskajn provincojn de la cetera neeŭska Hispanio, samtempe fortigis perceptojn de etna marĝeneco ĉe multaj neparolantoj de la eŭska en Rioja Alavesa, kaj igis aliajn malakcepti la asociiĝon de la eŭska lingvo kun eŭska identeco. La kazo montras la utilecon de limregiona medio, kie identecoj estas neklaraj, por esplorado de la konstruo de etnaj kaj lingvaj limoj.</jats:p>",

But, in an effort to remain adaptable and efficient in the labor market, employers today are making fewer paternalistic promises; e.g., they are telling employees not to expect long-term employment nor to rely on benefits that depend on long-term service. Large employers have tried to encourage employees to protect themselves by giving them more control over-and responsibility for-planning and saving through workplace benefit programs. For employees, benefits they once took for granted may no longer be available. This article concludes with a sober look at employers' future role in offering benefits. </jats:p>",

This feature highlights the positive role of the spatial organization of production in preserving the social structure of the kibbutz. Specifically, the distinct spatial structure of the kibbutz facilitates the articulation of the kibbutz's ideological values and thereby provides an appropriate framework to contain the advancement both of the social and of the technical divisions of labor. I contend that the social and economic attributes of the kibbutz are embedded in a spatial configuration that unites work and home. The factory is part of the kibbutz home. In other words, there is both a spatial and a social unification of home and work. An understanding of the performance of kibbutz industry, and its commitment to the community, cannot be appreciated without recognizing the contributions both of the spatial and of the social structures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large amounts of time and money are currently being expended in \"restoring\" damaged bushland in many parts of Australia, particularly those remnants in or near large centres of population such as Sydney. This paper argues that it is time to critically examine policies and practices of bushland conservation for the range of bushland values they are serving. Since the introduction of minimum intervention \"bush regeneration\" in Sydney in the 1960s \"restoration\" has developed to encompass a much broader range of disturbed areas from lightly weed invaded bush to totally cleared sites, and there has been a blurring of distinctions between regeneration and other restoration practices. In particular, both restoration and regeneration now include planting as widely accepted practice. Focusing on New South Wales, particularly the Sydney region, this paper reviews the role of values in current conservation planning and bushland management in New South Wales, the development of \"regeneration\", and \"restoration\" and the nature of scientific and educational values of remnant bushland, and examines how the practice of planting in bushland is degrading those values. Alternative methods to achieve natural regeneration, particularly the use of fire, are discussed. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the importance of developing a planning process for bushland conservation and management which establishes significance based on its specific values, and adopts integrated objectives and strategies, policies and practices, to protect that significance and ensure that restoration does not degrade the values for which the bushland is being preserved and restored.</jats:p>"

This paper uses secondary data to analyze trends in access to family planning services, with a particular focus on poor women and young women. Trends from the 1980s showed a small decline in family planning visits and an upsurge in the percentage of births that were unwanted at the time of conception. These changes were particularly marked for poor women. Over the same decade, public expenditures for contraceptive services declined dramatically. The health insurance system with respect to family planning must be modernized to meet the needs of women and couples today. Future improvements in infant health and survival will depend in large part on ensuring that pregnancies are intended and not the result of lack of access to effective family planning services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The provision of national planning guidance from central government to local authorities and property developers to shape urban land-use policy and practice has been a feature of the planning system in Britain since the 1940s. This guidance, however, has not been released in any consistent form and has occasionally been subject to criticism by commentators. While the original role of national planning advice was to provide strategic direction, central government has modified its planning remit and has recently utilised its land-use obligation to set parameters on detailed planning control and policy matters at the local level. The nature of central government intervention in local land-use matters has therefore changed over time. The current form of national advice in England and Wales is contained within the series of Planning Policy Guidance Notes (PPGs). This research paper considers the role and significance of PPGs in planning practice at the local district authority level of policy-making and determination, particularly in relation to the introduction of recent planning legislation. It will show that the government's use of PPGs to provide strategic national direction in planning has been widely accepted by professional officers throughout the country. But there still remains uncertainty over the government's reliance on PPGs to intervene in detailed local planning issues. </jats:p>",

A preliminary step in the project was the formation of focus groups consisting of professionals and paraprofessionals serving in a variety of assignments throughout the state. Through these groups, project coordinators conducted a needs assessment to identify important issues in the staff development and use of paraprofessional personnel. Focus group discussions revealed several issues that require systemic change efforts at the state, regional, and local levels. This article describes how the focus group assessment approach can be used to gather important information for designing job-relevant personnel development programs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The challenges facing public health professionals in the twenty first century are likely to encompass a pressing need to address effectively new health dilemmas posed by rapid urbanisation, environmental degradation, massive social change and economic instability. The Healthy Cities movement was initiated in 1986 to implement the health promotion action areas of the Ottawa Charter in local settings. It offers a meaningful framework and set of principles to construct a socio-ecological approach to the planning for future healthy and sustainable communities. The parameters of a socio-ecological approach to health and its congruence with the philosophy and principles of the Healthy Cities movement are described. The application of this approach to health planning in nine local communities in Queensland is illustrated through the development of local government facilitated Municipal Public Health Plans (MPHPs). An overview of the seven stages of the planning process underpinned by Healthy Cities principles, reveals the specific tasks of working 'with' communities as opposed to working 'on' them. These stages are identified as: (i) doing the groundwork, (ii) managing the project, (iii) community needs assessment, (iv) setting priorities, (v) developing strategies, (vi) writing the draft plan, and (vii) monitoring and reviewing the plan. Specific difficulties encountered by the projects during the process are identified, as well as achievements. The challenges faced by those intending to formulate similar plans are listed, and how primary health care professionals can have a significant partnership in the design and implementation of locally relevant Municipal Public Health Plans is discussed.</jats:p>"

Nowadays a new railway improves a part of the trip, but the bioclimatic environment remains hostile. A part of the forest has been the subject of a scientific survey by UNESCO in order to built a biosphere natural reserve.</jats:p>"

These changes have influenced urban land, and housing policies. In a context of rapid change scholars are faced with problems of selection, interpretation, and critical evaluation. Information and interpretations can be dated and have omissions. It is argued in this paper that such has been the case in the programme of urban research carried out by Peter Ward and some of his research team. In this paper the aim is to correct, reinterpret, and then develop ideas which are more appropriate in a period of fundamental change, relying upon principles from political science, and institutional and public policy economics. </jats:p>",

This retrieve-and-write process minimizes the role of reflection and planning in the composing process. In the current study, we taught three students with learning difficulties a strategy designed to help them become more reflective when writing opinion essays. Following instruction in the strategy, students wrote essays that were longer, provided more support for their premise, and were qualitatively better. Two of the students also changed their approach to writing, developing an initial plan prior to writing that they continued to elaborate and refine as they wrote. Changes in both writing performance and behavior were maintained over time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the world moves towards increasing rather than reducing inequality, the question of justice forces itself on to the political agenda. But that agenda is also shaped today by people's growing fears for the future of the planetary environment. In this paper we explore the connection between just distributions of environmental values—justice in the environment—and the just relationship between humanity and nature—justice to the environment. We discuss current uncertainties about ‘justice’ as an ethical category. We conclude that justice cannot be dispensed with. But, in the face of postmodernist critique of ‘totalising discourse’, how can universal principles be reasserted? There is a continuing and healthy debate about ‘human rights’ which is focused upon all human beings on the planet. The debate is about the principles which apply to this population, and not to any culturally circumscribed space. It is in this sense ‘universal’. Turning to the relationship between humanity and nature we ask whether an ethic of justice applies to this relationship. Early green utopias which suggest authoritarian solutions are rejected as politically unsustainable, but institutional forms based on an ecological rather than a purely anthropocentric perspective are required to ensure future survival. We conclude that, in the interests of justice, a global nexus of institutional forms is required which is capable of reconciling the universal with the particular and which embodies a recovery of the progressive elements in social and environmental discourse. </jats:p>",

Given that appropriate sex education may increase the probability of successful adult adjustment of students with disabilities, efforts must be made to address socio-sexual issues. A particularly appropriate time to address such concerns is during transition planning when educators are preparing students with disabilities to undertake adult roles. The purpose of the current study was to examine educators' perceptions of sex education curricula for students with moderate to severe disabilities and apply these findings to create a strategy for infusing socio-sexual issues into existing curricula and individualized transition plans. The inclusion of socio-sexual concerns in transition encompassed strategies for assuring success of a sex education program, identification of curricular components, methods of modifying the curriculum, and team members involved in programming.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper presents the work done toward developing a computerized heavy lift planning system (HELPS) for planning crane lifts. Initially, a survey of the industry was carried out to define the heavy lift planning process and identify the developments necessary to improve the process. This survey identified eight tasks in the lift planning process. Based on these tasks, a logical framework representing the planning process was developed. The scope of the current work was limited to developing a tool for planning three of these tasks. A visualization environment—Walkthru—was selected to implement the heavy lift planning system. Although Walkthru provided many of the features required for the system, critical functions had to be added. The developmental work for this study focused on (1) developing a shell that could control the visualization environment and related files to provide seamless access to the library of cranes and (2) providing features to perform critical lift planning functions. The resulting prototype system was tested on sample lifts, and all the functions worked as designed.</jats:p>",

Although regional models have the scope to model the interaction of demand and congestion, they lack spatial detail. Local-area analysis typically does not consider the feedback between new project loadings and existing levels of traffic. A windowed model, which retains regional trip distribution information and the consistency between travel demand and congestion, permits the use of a complete transportation network and block-level traffic zones while retaining computational feasibility. By combining the two methods a number of important policy issues can be addressed, including the implications of traffic calming, changes in flow due to alternative traffic operation schemes, the influence of microscale zoning changes on nearby intersections, and the impact of travel demand management on traffic congestion. </jats:p>",

The apical pathology was curetted, the tooth root resected and a root‐end filling placed. The possible reasons for failure of the initial orthograde root canal therapy are discussed with the conclusion that the cause may not have been addressed fully by surgical intervention. The case highlights the challenge facing clinicians when assessing failed root fillings, not only in determining the exact cause of failure but deciding the appropriate treatment for the individual tooth and patient.</jats:p>",

It is shown that, in addition to their highly regressive social impact, the 1988 tax cuts favoured the South East where the concentration of high income earners is most marked.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Transportation facility and system options for the greater Vancouver region are evaluated using the provincial guidelines for full-cost accounting. The impact of the monetized environmental accounts on the overall evaluation is presented, using facility, system option, and pricing examples from the regional plan. Within project options that are homogeneous with respect to travel demand management or modal split, environmental account values do not differ much, just as in the user cost accounts. Monetized environmental account values are two to three times smaller than the user cost in project-level cases. At the system level, in which travel demand management and modal choice are among the principal objectives, environmental benefits are decisive, whereas user benefits may be inconclusive. The estimated monetized subsidy to full costs of the automobile underpricing of personal transport has increased from 20 percent to more than 50 percent with analytical advances since 1993. Serious intangible externalities remain unmonetized, but should nevertheless be considered. Limitations of transportation demand model and data (peak spreading, 24-hr operation, and determination of vehicle speeds) require remediation for accurate environmental accounting. Fuel consumption and vehicle operating costs at low levels of service, and impacts of travel demand management on travel behavior, are decisive for system appraisals. At the project level, queueing data, level of service, and capacity must be available. Speed-and vehicle-specific emission rates are also necessary for accurate accounting at the project and system levels. </jats:p>",

La Lituanie, dont la ligne de rivage est la plus courte de tous les Etats baltiques, a un choix très limité pour satisfaire ses besoins économiques tout en préservant la stabilité de son système naturel côtier. Actuellement, en raison des phénomènes globaux et locaux qui se sont manifestés durant les dernières décennies, l'état du littoral lituanien est considéré comme complexe et présentant des signes de dégradation. C'est pourquoi une stratégie de conservation du système naturel du littoral est mise en place simultanément à la construction et à la reconstruction des infrastructures industrielles.

In this paper we seek to review and attempt to sophisticate the debate over saturation by providing a detailed discussion and spatial analysis of current levels of retail provision. This analysis, in itself, offers a view of the potential for future retail expansion. We argue here, however, that spatial patterns of retail provision must be interpreted carefully, particularly given the profoundly different competitive conditions that characterise British grocery retailing in the 1990s as compared with the 1980s. In considering both the spatial patterns of, and competitive processes underlying, British food retailing, we offer an account of recent retail geography in a way that synthesises approaches that are all too frequently presented as antagonistic. </jats:p>",

Outcome measures reflect an agency’s success in meeting its stated goals and objectives; they typically relate the effect of agency activities and programs on people and the environment, as well as customer satisfaction. This broad, qualitative information is not provided by traditional output measures, which reflect the quantity of resources used, activities performed by an organization, and efficiency in converting resources to products. Output measures are very important for many management and planning activities, and can be used for assessing program outcomes. However, outcome measures are the best tool for assessing the effectiveness of transportation programs and funding decisions in meeting the broad goals frequently found in transportation plans. Examples are provided of how both transportation and nontransportation organizations are using outcome measures to directly address the six trends. Strategies used by the public and private sector to transition to outcome measurement are also highlighted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) determined that a collaborative approach would be most effective for compliance with Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) requirements for the development and implementation of its Statewide Transportation Policy Plan. The process for developing and adopting the plan, along with its companion document, the Performance Report, included cooperative efforts among PennDOT and its transportation partners. Both documents were developed within the contexts of current and future planning initiatives and tailored to fit PennDOT’s overall business strategy, mission statement, and vision for the 21st century. Plan development activities included data collection, cooperative and coordinated planning efforts with metropolitan planning organizations and local development districts, consideration of ISTEA’s 23 planning factors, coordination with private and public transportation interests, and extensive outreach and consensus-building programs. The performance report was conceived as part of the policy plan to measure the status of the transportation system and answer the question, “What difference did it make to have the policy plan?” The report adopted an economic approach to performance, measuring supply, usage, and condition. The report was used to articulate a “maintenance first” philosophy, highlighting PennDOT’s continuing struggle to fund transportation programs and dispelling public myths and misconceptions about transportation in the commonwealth. Lessons learned during development, data collection, and outreach activities are applicable to other states still developing or refining their plans. Discussions of these activities, future endeavors, and the path forward are critical, especially in light of ISTEA reauthorization and the trend toward a more fiscally and, perhaps, politically constrained national transportation context. </jats:p>",

It is a tool that translates problems and goals to performance measures, examines possible competing and complementary transportation improvement actions, systematically evaluates the impacts of actions using models and knowledge, and supports human interactions between stakeholders. The PLANiTS methodology is nonincremental because it integrates existing knowledge about transportation with analysis using models with deliberation and issue resolution. To link planning and modeling, PLANiTS has a policy base that contains contemporary performance measures, an action base containing conventional and Intelligent Transportation Systems actions, a methods base that facilitates modeling, a case that has qualitative and quantitative information about historical cases, and a set of computer-based communications tools. This comprehensive methodology will likely expedite the implementation of intelligent technologies by systematically examining their trade-offs with more conventional transportation improvement actions. PLANiTS’s structure, functionality, and application are described. Transportation improvement projects are represented as planning vectors in PLANiTS. A vector permits users to examine the effects of chosen transportation actions in terms of performance measures within an environment. Users must specify the actions, performance measures, and the environment, each in terms of their spatial, temporal, and user dimensions. Then they can analyze the planning vector with models and case-based reasoning. During the process of planning vector specification and analysis, stakeholders at different locations can communicate by sending and receiving messages and sharing the planning vector. Users at different locations can examine and review the results and iterate in an open and deliberative planning environment. Overall, PLANiTS facilitates transportation planning processes by combining analysis and deliberation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The recent history of planning for the transport sector in New Zealand offers interesting comparisons with parallel developments in the United States under the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991. Over the past decade, both nations have undergone a major reconstruction of the legal and political apparatus of transportation planning. In each case, this restructuring reflected two potentially contradictory sets of goals: (a) to rationalize and improve the efficiency of transportation planning, thereby enhancing economic development and (b) to systematically mitigate transport-related externalities and formally recognize environmental and fiscal limits to the expansion of transportation infrastructure. New Zealand is described from a historical and geopolitical perspective and the legislative and political framework of transport is outlined, focusing on key changes in the regulatory regime. New Zealand is shown to have followed policies that strongly favor privatization and market-style means and measures, with central government moving from an operational to a strategic stance. Examples of deregulation and privatization programs are discussed, including ports, safety regulation, and environmental regulation. The future requirements of transport policy planning are speculated on. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In our response to Pugh's critique of our work which he rather grandiosely describes as ‘Cambridge studies’, we take major issue with his arguments on three principal fronts. First, he is very selective in his review of our publications, and in seeking to defend the position of the World Bank, UNDP, and UNCHS, he fails to acknowledge an extensive debate in which we have already engaged with senior analysts from those institutions. Moreover, his reading of what we do and do not say about World Bank leadership in the housing and land management policy fields is partial and erroneous. Second, his critique that our methodology lacks a strong theoretical and empirical grounding is at best distorted and at worst quite wrong. The methodology has been widely used and applauded, and if it has been criticized in the past it is for being too empirical and overly focused upon household interviews and surveys. He also ignores the context in which several of the methods he criticizes were published: namely in a collection of essays on Methodology for Land and Housing Market Analysis, the express purpose of which was to contrast different approaches. Third, he mistakenly assumes that because we do not cite certain authors we are ignorant of their work, and further, that our analysis fails to privilege neoclassical land economics. This latter point at least is true, but not because we are ignorant of the approach, but because the theoretical aims of our work required that we experiment with other methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent trends in federal laws and regulations have indicated the need to develop tools for multimodal transportation planning to replace “highway-only” techniques. The Vermont Agency of Transportation, as part of its Long Range Transportation Plan, initiated a study to develop Multimodal System Classification (MSC). The MSC approach considers both highway- and nonhighway-based modes of transportation, intermodal connectivity, and transportation and land use relationships. As a basis for this approach, broad-band corridors are defined that include all modes, including pedestrian and bicycle transport. In addition to corridors, urban, town, village, and other growth centers are defined as high-accessibility subareas where transit- and pedestrian-oriented development may be given priority. Five classes have been defined that reflect corridor and subarea needs: Class 1, major multi-modal corridors and transport centers; Class 2, other major routes and facilities; Class 3, minor routes and collectors; Class 4, local ways; and Class 5, town, village, and urban centers. Early consideration of social, environmental, and economic factors is achieved through definition of a series of land use overlays—scenic and aesthetic resources, historical and cultural resources, natural resources, and air- and noise-sensitive areas. As part of the development effort, the MSC concept was applied in two planning regions in Vermont. Not only did the concept of MSC prove useful, but the process was invaluable as a basis for public outreach and consensus building. Regional professional staff found MSC to be useful in development of regional transportation and land use plans. </jats:p>",

In light of increasingly scarce planning, operating, and capital resources, as well as high expectations for the expansion of rail services, transit operators and other decision makers need a tool to priority rank the preservation of abandoned rail corridors. The NJ Transit rail ROW study responded to a state legislative mandate to identify, analyze, and priority rank abandoned rail corridors for preservation and possible service expansion. A methodology to screen out unusable rail ROW is developed, and the remaining ROW is ranked in terms of its initial potential to generate transit ridership. NJ Transit staff completed an inventory of all active and known abandoned rail lines within New Jersey. The ROW was passed through successive screens that eliminated ROW with “fatal flaws” (environmental sensitivity, major development encroachments, etc.) and ROW that would provide redundant transit service. The remaining ROW was ranked in terms of the number of journey-to-work (JTW) trips to likely rail destinations, JTW trips per mile, and household density in communities that the ROW serves. This preliminary investigation of ROW identified its potential suitability for various modes of transportation as well as intermodal opportunities. </jats:p>",

The model is being used to develop ridership forecasts for the WSF Long-Range System Plan and other project planning efforts. The WSF model covers a 12-county ferry system service area, including the four counties within the central Puget Sound region. The model was designed to be sensitive to policy variables and to produce detailed ridership forecasts on each ferry route by ( a) boarding methods, ( b) mode of access and egress combinations for walk-on passengers, and ( c) vehicle occupancy for those persons boarding by vehicle. The model is fully incremental and uses observed travel patterns from a comprehensive on-board origin-destination survey of ferry riders conducted in 1993 for the afternoon peak period. Choice of terminal is an intermediate destination choice for walk-on ferry riders and is a prime example of trip chaining between an origin and destination. A new method involving matrix algebra has been used to formulate choice of terminal in terms of matrix products. This method estimates demand matrices corresponding to individual legs of the trip chain for each access and egress mode combination. The modeling system was validated for replication of ridership on each route by boarding methods and by mode of access and egress combinations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A method combining machine learning and regression analysis to automatically and intelligently update predictive models used in the Kansas Department of Transportation’s (KDOT’s) internal management system is presented. The predictive models used by KDOT consist of planning factors (mathematical functions) and base quantities (constants). The duration of a functional unit (defined as a subactivity) is determined by the product of a planning factor and its base quantity. The availability of a large data base on projects executed over the past decade provided the opportunity to develop an automated process updating predictive models based on extracting information from historical data through machine learning. To perform the entire task of updating the predictive models, the learning process consists of three stages. The first stage derives the numerical relationship between the duration of a functional unit and the project attributes recorded in the data base. The second stage finds the functional units with similar behavior—that is, identifies functional units that can be described by the same shared planning factor scaled in terms of their own base quantities. The third stage generates new planning factors and base quantities. A system called PFactor built on the basis of the three-stage learning process shows good performance in updating KDOT’s predictive models. </jats:p>",

The model and processes draw from functional theories and methods within the areas of business, education, evaluation, and organization.

The processes and models presented offer creative responses to pertinent issues in this area. Strategic planning principles based on Bryson’s model for public and nonprofit organizations, coupled with network-based decision-making software used by the Pennsylvania LTAP center, are described. Strategic objectives common to other key organizations were identified to arrive at a partnering scheme that penetrates three organizational functions: strategic operations, product/service development, and implementation/marketing. Central to this partnering scheme is a new T<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> integration model.

PTMS organizes pertinent information of physical assets (condition, performance, financial, functional, and descriptive) to assist decision makers; select cost-effective programs and projects; improve efficiency, serviceability, and safety of the infrastructure of NJ TRANSIT; and protect prior federal investments. Implementation of PTMS is now a voluntary program under the ISTEA. However, NJ TRANSIT remains committed to completion of the New Jersey PTMS. A team approach was used (design working group) to identify the specifications for the PTMS. The team participated in all phases of project development and implementation. The system is being tested with the introduction of the fiscal year 1998 capital program cycle. A problem analysis relating to the design and development of the New Jersey PTMS is presented.

The analysis of route data provides useful insight for understanding factors affecting travel behavior and in this case provides quantitative support for many existing assumptions regarding commuter cyclist behavior. Most commuters divert very little from their minimum path (0.4 km on average) and are found to use major road routes. The cyclists tend to avoid grades, grade-separated railway crossings, and high-activity areas, but not road (as opposed to pedestrian) bridges. Cyclists use traffic signals especially for crossing major roadways and turning. The high-quality direct off-road paths are used only infrequently by the commuter cyclists and the lower quality ones even less. The results of this analysis suggest that efforts to accommodate current commuter cyclists should be focused on improving cycling conditions on the road network, such as providing wider curb lanes, or actuated traffic signal detectors that recognize the presence of bicycles. If potential new commuters are similar to the minority of current commuter cyclists in this study who use mainly local roads, paths or trails, then projects that make the network of local roads and pathways more connective and direct may encourage a higher level of commuter cycling. </jats:p>",

The model is designed to evaluate possible incentive tolls for their effects on congestion delays at the six bridges and tunnels the authority operates between New Jersey and New York. The study used a stated preference survey administered to bridge and tunnel users, econometric choice models, and plaza volume-delay relationships as a basis for simulating the effects of changes in toll structure. The survey identified characteristics of trips, feasible alternatives for the trips, and the trip makers. A stated preference choice exercise was included to reveal trade-offs among toll, plaza delay, facility choice, and time period when the crossing would be made. Responses to the exercise were combined with other survey data, and econometric models of choice were estimated. The models associate the probability of travel choices with the conditions faced at the alternatives. The policy evaluation planning model combined choice model results, survey responses from individual respondents, and data on facility conditions, volumes, and capacities. As input it accepts a user-specified menu of tolls and discounts, potentially varying both by hour and by facility. As output it predicts automobile volumes, average delays, total delays, and toll revenue by hour and facility. The model is constructed to achieve equilibrium among tolls, delays, and volumes. Application of the model indicates considerable potential for reducing plaza delays. </jats:p>",

The Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC), the metropolitan planning organization for the region, is responsible for coordinating transportation for the nine-county region and has a sophisticated set of travel-demand models. California established county-level congestion management programs in 1990, including a requirement for travel-demand model consistency with the regional model. Coordination of the multiple travel-demand model systems that proliferated in the region thus became a significant issue. The cooperative planning approach promoted by MTC through the Bay Area Partnership, and the passage of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, gave additional impetus to integrating transportation information from multiple agencies, including travel-demand model information. The development of an approach to establishing consistency between the travel-demand model systems in the San Francisco Bay Area is described, as are the immediate and subsequent strategies undertaken. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In traditional travel forecasting models, a limited set of attributes are used to describe transit utility. The transit access environment is one of the characteristics of the travel experience often ignored by the models in use today. A quantitative approach to incorporating the effects of the transit access environment into transportation planning models is presented. A measure called the transit friendliness factor, which is defined as a function of the characteristics of the area surrounding a transit stop, is proposed. These characteristics include the quality of the pedestrian facilities, the character of nearby streets, the presence of amenities at the stop, and the proximity to potential destinations. A method for evaluating both the existing and the future value of the transit friendliness factor is described. Application of the proposed approach is illustrated by its successful implementation in the mode choice model used in a study for the Triangle Transit Authority in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. In conclusion, the lessons learned and suggested future applications are discussed. </jats:p>",
