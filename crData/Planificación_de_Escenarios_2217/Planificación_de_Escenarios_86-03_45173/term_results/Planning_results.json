Consideration is given to present deficiencies in our understanding and their consequences. There then follows a review of recent developments within political economy and their significance for understanding land-use policy programmes and outcomes. The potential of the approach for addressing methodological issues in the field is then examined, with a particular focus on the importance of a process emphasis, on identifying choices within structural limitations, and on evaluating outcomes. </jats:p>",

A review of the literature indicates that much effort has been undertaken in the states to institutionalize public participation in the siting process. However, informal public participation such as public pressure on local elected officials and active passive civil disobedience has been most influential in the denigration of siting proposals. Current state siting procedures suffer from numerous critical flaws: facility needs assessments are rarely performed, and there is much elasticity in the demand for off-site facilities since alternative management options are available; serious and credible environmental sensitivity studies tend to be site specific, but no corresponding regional reference studies indicate that the proposed site is relatively advantageous; and early and meaningful public participation in the siting process has not achieved socially acceptable proposals. These flaws must be addressed effectively in order to provide for safe facilities when they will be needed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. </jats:p>",

Viewed over a short period of time such changes may seem insignificant; viewed historically, however, veritable leaps can be discerned. This study is an analysis of changes in product design from 1950 to 1980 as well as parallel changes in product perception. The products analysed reveal clear design and functional or technical changes in the time period in question. Whereas in the 1950s prewar designs were to a great extent still being produced, the early 1960s were marked by American tastes in design. At present, technical–functional design considerations are predominant. The findings show that perception of ‘stylistic leaps’ in historical retrospect is not explicable by changes in product, but by changes in perception. Products have various emotive connotations. ‘Old’ products are judged negatively, ‘new’ products positively. </jats:p>",

In this paper abstraction is pointed out as an important conceptual tool of this field. A critical discussion of existing plan-design methods leads to the conclusion that the potentials of abstraction as a tool have not yet been fully recognized. The rest of the paper is an attempt to improve this situation by suggesting a new approach to automated floor-plan design. Theoretically, design is viewed as a one-to-many relation; a tree whose lines are directed from the root (the problem) towards the leaves (the solutions). Abstraction is viewed as the inverse many-to-one relation. A particular relation of abstraction is defined, such that the intermediate nodes of the tree (between root and leaves) are themselves floor plans, but are less detailed than the solutions. From the study of this concept of abstraction it is concluded that a design algorithm based on it is likely to have certain useful properties. </jats:p>",

Because orthogonal construction systems are used most frequently, consideration is confined to these.

Unfortunately many firms are still grappling with the concept of strategy and do not fully understand the concept of strategic management. As a result, many managers are being encouraged by the reward and compensation system to act in their own interests and not in the company's interests. Poorly designed measurement and compensation systems tend to reward short-term thinking and do not recognize the value of strategic compensation systems. Managers must be made partners in a firm's success by linking compensation to the strategic variables of success.</jats:p>"

In this, the key to evaluating the power and politics of marketing is marketing information — as a source of formal organisational power and as a resource which can be manipulated politically to gain desired outcomes. This article examines briefly the basis for this style of analysis, but focuses mainly on the implications for the management of marketing in organisations, where a political analysis suggests that the management of marketing should concentrate not on techniques — of marketing research, or of rational, scientific decision making — but on structure and process, i.e. on power and political systems, to influence and control outcomes. To the familiar risks of “marketing myopia” may be added the danger of “political myopia”.</jats:p>",

The objective of this paper is not to provide a panacea to the afore-said problem; it is rather an attempt to examine the occupational training needs of Nigerian youths and some of the  obstacles to vocational education programmes. Some planning and management issues that may have to be considered if such vocational needs are to be met are also analysed. The technicalities and other modalities involved in technical and vocational education do not fall within the realm of this paper and are therefore left for the experts to tackle.</jats:p>"

Der vorliegende Aufsatz beschäftigt sich mit den Erfolgsaussichten einer solchen Schwerpunktbildung in der praktischen Regionalpolitik. Zunächst wird kurz geprüft, ob sich empirische Befunde für regionale Innovationsunterschiede finden lassen. Dabei wird festgestellt, daß die sektoralen und betriebsgrößenspezifischen Defizienzen bedeutsamer sind als ihre regionalen Pendants. Des weiteren werden die wichtigsten Determinanten regionaler Innovationsunterschiede und ihre empirische Gewichtigkeit diskutiert. Darauf aufbauend werden die neuen innovationsorientierten Instrumente der GRW sowie eine mögliche Alternativstrategie der Innovationsförderung kritisch beleuchtet. In einem weiteren Schritt werden mögliche räumliche Konsequenzen einer innovationsorientierten Regionalpolitik untersucht, wobei der Schwerpunkt der Betrachtung auf die Mikroelektronik und die Telekommunikation gelegt wird. Wir schließen uns dabei der These an, daß die neuen Kommunikationstechnologien Trendverstärker und nicht Trendsetter sind. Abschließend wird festgestellt, daß sich eine innovationsorientierte Regionalpolitik nicht auf die Bereitstellung der einschlägigen (materiellen) Infrastruktur beschränken kann, sondern vielmehr zu ihrem Erfolg die Koordination verschiedener raumrelevanter Politikbereiche braucht. Daraus folgt, daß eine innovationsorientierte Regionalpolitik nicht mit kurzfristigen Problemlösungen wird aufwarten können.</jats:p>"

Various aspects of gravity model misspecification resulting from hierarchical destination choice are investigated and an empirical example is given in terms of US migrants. A discussion is presented of several destination choice models that are more accurately specified than the gravity formulation when destination choice is hierarchical. The recently derived competing destinations formulation is shown to be amongst the most useful in this respect. The discussion is framed in the context of discrete choice theory. </jats:p>",

This practice has surfaced again in the recent attempts to apply notions from catastrophe theory to the study of regional development. This paper is an examination of one such application to the modeling of interregional capital flows and critically evaluates it from a number of perspectives. On empirical grounds, there is little evidence that ‘catastrophic’ shifts in the geography of US manufacturing capital have indeed occurred. The presumption of a catastrophic shift is shown to be based on poor empirical indicators of capital mobility or on an incomplete understanding of the process of interregional investment decisions. The paper offers an alternative conception of this process in which the Kaldorian principles of scale economies, specialization, and division of labour are shown to be in continuing operation, albeit now in a spatially discontinuous manner. </jats:p>",

The decision maker's dilemma is that on the average, the accuracy of forecasts increases with time, but the benefit from the supply allocation decreases as the commitment is delayed. This planning problem is modeled as a Markovian stopping process with maximization of the expected utility of outcomes as the planning criterion. The optimal decision strategy, obtained via dynamic programming, prescribes the timing of the commitment and volume of the planned supply as a function of forecasts. The strategy takes explicitly into account uncertainties in the forecasts, value of water (economic or subjective), risk attitude of the decision maker, and utility reduction factor caused by delaying the commitment. An extensive numerical example illustrates the capabilities of the model as an aid to real‐time decision making and evaluation of the economic worth of forecasts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>India and the island world of Southeast Asia were in close cultural andcommercial contact for many centuries before both came under the influence, and ultimately the domination, of the European colonial powers. In spite ofthe fact that the Indian subcontinent and the Indonesian archipelago were the chief colonial possessions of two of the most advanced and wealthiest countries in West Europe, both emerged into independence in the aftermath of the second world war as extremely poor, technologically backward countries.But in both countries an indigenous political leadership had assumed power, which was determined to accelerate the pace of economic progress, and achieve a high level of development, in the shortest possible time. It is thus interesting to make a pairwise comparison of these two countries, both in respect of the colonial legacy they inherited, and in respect of their post-independence economic policy-making, in order to indicate the specific contributions of two different colonial systems to subsequent economic policy efforts and achievements. We begin with a brief discussion of the economic legacy bequeathed by the two colonial powers to independent India and Indonesia.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning languages and spreadsheet systems are very popular, and the number of new users is increasing dramatically. On larger computers, IFPS, System W, and FCS-EPS are among the most widely used systems; while on personal computers, Multiplan and 1-2-3 enjoy great popularity. Currently, such languages operate mainly as simulators, evaluating specific cases. In this paper, we propose methodology which is useful in designing an optimization capability for these languages. This capability permits the user to designate certain model variables as decisions, constraints, and the objective. Upper and lower limits on the decisions and constraints are also specified. The optimization interface then diagnoses the problem as linear or nonlinear, computes first partial derivatives needed by the solution algorithms, and invokes the appropriate “solver.” Information regarding the optimal solution is obtained using the reporting and graphics capabilities of the planning language. Sensitivity analysis and “what if” features permit easy modification of the problem for further analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> These ideas have been implemented in a system called IFPS/OPTIMUM, which provides an optimization capability to users of the widely-used planning language IFPS. A simple IFPS/OPTIMUM example is presented, and two applications are described. </jats:p><jats:p> Endowing planning languages with an optimization capability promises to increase dramatically the use of optimization. There are already hundreds of thousands of users of planning languages and spreadsheet systems, most of whom are unfamiliar with optimization models or methods. Making optimization a natural extension of systems they understand and find very useful holds great promise, both for applications and for teaching optimization concepts. </jats:p>",

It is shown that the larger share of monetary growth in Latin America has been due to changes in the monetary base. Changes in the money multiplier due to changes in reserve requirements were also significant in some cases.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines a method for planning motions in the presence of uncertainty. Tasks are modeled as geometrical goals in configuration space. The planning process consists of determining regions from which particular motions are guar anteed to reach a desired goal successfully. An algorithm is presented for backprojecting from desired goal states. The backprojection regions are computed by erecting constraints that geometrically capture the uncertainty in motion. The relationship of backprojections to goal recognizability is discussed within the formal framework of preimages. This relationship suggests a partitioning of desired goal states into recognizable goal states. Backprojections are actually per formed from this partitioning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The optimality of parameter estimates is commonly justified on the basis of their sampling properties in parameter space (e.g., minimum mean square error, unbiasedness). However, these criteria may not be necessarily appropriate within the small sample size environment and the management rather than inferential focus of water resource planning decisions. Using two general cases, it is shown that in the presence of parameter uncertainty, “optimal” parameters, selected on the basis of their sampling properties in parameter space, can instead lead to nonoptimal decisions relative to planning objectives. In either case, alternative (informative and noninformative) Bayesian estimators are presented which, by incorporating parameter uncertainty, lead to uniform improvements in efficiency in action space over the traditional estimators. Incorporation of parameter uncertainty will not necessarily lead to uniform improvements, however. A counterexample is presented which shows that the use of noninformative priors, while optimal in the first case, can instead result in uniformly poorer decisions relative to the traditional estimators in the second case. The potential inefficiencies due to the use of noninformative measures of uncertainty and/or the misspecification of the prior in Bayesian estimators, provide a motivation for the consideration instead of empirical Bayes methods of estimation.</jats:p>",

By 1984 the inflow from Asia had increased dramatically to 40% or $A4155 million per annum. Over the past ten years an increasing proportion of the Asian investment inflow has been directed to the capital city property markets—particularly Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, and the Gold Coast. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper the reasons for these changes, and in particular the deregulation of the Australian finance sector and the underdeveloped conservative nature of Australian property markets, are analysed. It is argued that the changing nature of the capital city property markets is part of the process of integration into a world property market dominated by finance, corporate, and service linkages, and between the larger global cities, of which Sydney is one. </jats:p><jats:p> Comparisons are made between the investment philosophies and behaviours of the Asian property investors active in Australia and those of their Australian and European counterparts. The paper focuses on the risk philosophies of the Asian investors and the degree to which they are providing a vital injection of funds for previously underdeveloped market opportunities. </jats:p><jats:p> A critique is made of the existing Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines as they apply to equity investment by foreigners in Australian urban real estate. It is concluded that the guidelines have become an anachronism, and rather than protect the interest of Australia they have contributed to the growth in overseas indebtedness and are detrimental to sustained economic growth. </jats:p>",

A 24‐item multiple choice Sexual Knowledge Inventory was therefore developed by the author and administered in group form to 447 teenagers sampled from six private schools in the Brisbane Statistical Division. Data indicated that the family unit has failed to provide many young persons with reliable information about family planning matters. Multiple regression analysis revealed exposure to a formal school‐based sex education program to be the most powerful predictor of awareness, with birth order, family size and social status background also emerging as significant predictors of family planning knowledge.</jats:p>",

Such a role was referred to in pioneer geographical studies, but has largely been ignored since, apparently because it does not readily fit into the spatial science paradigm.

The focus here is on an application of the theory to analyze the “ghettoization” of ex-psychiatric patients in the City of Hamilton. First, methodologies are developed for institutional analysis and for the analysis of strategic conduct, utilizing the concept of bracketing. Secondly, a structuration analysis is undertaken of the ex-patient ghetto. This requires an institutional analysis of the deinstitutionalization policy and of the process of ghettoization, and a focus on strategic conduct to explain local outcomes in the built environment. The empirical application of structuration theory provided methodological and practical insights, as well as requiring a substantial development of some theoretical constructs. We are satisfied that structuration theory has sufficient merit for empirical work to warrant continued development and assessment. </jats:p>",

Water pricing relevant to these water environmental systems is examined. An area model is first constructed. Instead of an effluent fee (or charge), consumers of water resources should pay a consumption tax which reflects the shadow prices of both the quantity and the quality of water resources. The model is extended to the regional model which can be applied to a region including several cities located along a river. Since there are interarea spillovers, the price of water reflects the shadow prices both of water resources and of the spillovers. </jats:p>",

Government levies a tax at a flat rate and spends the proceeds on public consumption and public investment. Factor income and capital gains on land, diminished by taxation, form disposable income. Households save a fixed share of disposable income. Savings, in turn, serve to finance both private investment and capital gains on land. This gives rise to a portfolio made up of two assets: Land and capital. Land income consists of land rents and capital gains, whereas capital income consists of interest payments. In equilibrium, land and capital yield the same rate of return after tax. Under the restrictive income tax (excluding capital gains), a tax increase generally raises the land price. Under the comprehensive income tax (including capital gains), a tax increase has no bearing on the land price. Under special land taxes, however, a tax increase lowers the land price. </jats:p>",

The faculty plans to identify the sources of this stress and eliminate them whenever possible. One guess is that most of the stress results from the students striving to do well for their peers and the attending faculty; this will be difficult to eliminate. The use of videotape as a medium for displaying the patient interview and intraoral conditions has been proven and is well supported by student evaluation.

There is then an examination of the contribution of the industrial development (ID) programme to employment change in Northern Ireland since 1945. Particular attention is given to the employment performance of various age cohorts of project openings and to the impact of country of ownership and industrial structure on the pattern of employment change. The impact of the ID programme on, and implications for, the region's growth performance are then drawn out, and the paper concludes with some suggestions for the development of ID policies in the 1980s. </jats:p>",

In this paper some methodological and operational problems which arise when a model of this kind, namely the Harris and Wilson model, is calibrated are dealt with. The main aspect of the calibration dealt with here is the problem of the separability of dynamics with different speeds (such as dynamics of stocks and dynamics of activities) when suitable data are lacking. It is shown, among other things, that a fundamental role is played by the intrinsic stability (or instability) of the equilibria of the model. The argument is illustrated by a set of simulations carried out on the Rome metropolitan area, relating to the retailing sector. </jats:p>",

It is argued that there is nothing about the technical features of electricity generation and supply that does not translate into costs and benefits (which can be subsequently paid, enjoyed or ignored by decision‐makers). Instead a Galbraithian thesis of technocracy is examined, but this is found to be insufficient to explain fully the electricity planning process in Australia and New Zealand and the relationship of that process to electricity‐intensive industry. After examining cases of forecasting and planning in New Zealand and Tasmania (both predominantly reliant on intensive hydro‐electric systems), it is concluded that a full appreciation requires an understanding of the relationship between government and business, a relationship which is rooted long ago in the colonial origins of both countries.</jats:p>",

Using a monthly times-series for Essen, Sweden, and France for 1952–1982 of immigration by different nationalities, a specific hypothesis derived from the neoclassical view, relating immigration to economic growth and stagnation, was tested using the Box—Jenkins ARIMA modelling approach. The local labour market of Essen provided the only consistent support for the hypothesis. Most migration flows are described by complex ARIMA models. Immigration legislation had a stronger and more direct effect on the strength and timing of flows than economic trends. Predictions based on univariate and bivariate models are not very useful: immigration trends over the past decade are significantly different from earlier flows. </jats:p>",

A major tool in this regard has been the delivery of public educational services. This paper is an attempt first to provide a theoretical framework of the spatial, social, and cultural manipulation of pastoral nomads through the process of delivering educational services. The case is then examined of delivering these services to the Israeli Negev Bedouin who, unlike other nomadic societies, have been undergoing processes of sedentarization and social modernization within a modern Jewish state. </jats:p>",
