      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Metazoan parasites of mammals (helminths) belong to highly divergent animal groups and yet induce a stereotypical host response: Th2‐type immunity. It has long been debated whether this response benefits the host or the parasite. We review the current literature and suggest that Th2 immunity is an evolutionarily appropriate response to metazoan invaders both in terms of controlling parasites and repairing the damage they inflict. However, successful parasites induce regulatory responses, which become superimposed with, and control, Th2 responses. Beyond helminth infection, this superimposition of response profiles may be the norm: both Th1 and Th2 responses coexist with regulatory responses or, on the contrary, with the inflammatory Th17 responses. Thus, typical responses to helminth infections may differ from Th2‐dominated allergic reactions in featuring not only a stronger regulatory component but also a weaker Th17 component. The similarity of immune response profiles to phylogenetically distinct helminths probably arises from mammalian evolution having hard‐wired diverse worm molecules, plus tissue‐damage signals, to the beneficial Th2 response, and from the convergent evolution of different helminths to elicit regulatory responses. We speculate that initiation of both Th2 and regulatory responses involves combinatorial signaling, whereby TLR‐mediated signals are modulated by signals from other innate receptors, including lectins.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents vulnerability maps for reinforced concrete moment frames (RCMFs) in Mexico City's Metropolitan Area (MCMA) for a <jats:sub> Ms</jats:sub>=8.1 earthquake scenario assessing peak nonlinear dynamic responses using the concept of displacement ductility demand spectra (DDDS). The considered earthquake scenario is the 1985 Michoacán Earthquake. Artificial and recorded ground motions were used. Takeda model was used to simulate nonlinear behavior of RCMFs. Seismic strength for existing RCMFs structures was estimated according to the nominal strength required by versions of Mexico's Federal District Code (MFDC) that were effective before the 1985 earthquake. Overstrength sources for RCMFs were also evaluated. With all of this information, DDDS were obtained for different sites in MCMA. Later, vulnerability maps based on contours of equal displacement ductility demands and nonlinear displacements for a given structural period and a version of MFDC were defined. These vulnerability maps were compared with the geographic area of severe structural damage and collapses mapped during the 1985 earthquake. Based on the results of this study, it is believed that this procedure can be useful to forecast demands for different structural systems for a given earthquake scenario, being therefore potentially useful for urban planning of cities located in zones of high seismic risk. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Rivers in developed regions are under significant stress due to nutrient enrichment generated mainly by human activities. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus emissions are the product of complex dynamic systems influenced by various factors such as demographic, socio-economic and technological development. Using a Catalan river catchment, La Tordera (North-East of Spain), as a case study of an integrated and interdisciplinary environmental assessment of nutrient flows, we present and discuss the development of narrative socio-economic scenarios through a participatory process for the sustainable management of the anthropogenic sources of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus. In this context, scenarios are an appropriate tool to assist nutrient emissions modelling, and to assess impacts, possible pathways for socio-economic development and associated uncertainties. Evaluated against the 1993–2003 baseline period, scenarios target the 2030 horizon, i.e. through the implementation process of the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). After a critical examination of the methodology used in the participatory development of socio-economic scenarios, we present four possible futures (or perspectives) for the Catalan river catchment conceived by stakeholders invited to a workshop. Keys to the success of such a participatory process were trust, which enhanced openness, and disagreements, which fostered the group's creativity for scenario development. The translation of narrative socio-economic scenarios into meaningful nutrient emission scenarios is also discussed. By integrating findings of natural sciences and socio-economic analysis, we aim to assist decision makers and stakeholders in evaluating optimal management strategies for the anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and phosphorus.\n                    </jats:p>"
