      "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay proposes to frame the persistent scientific/literary genre known as `planning theory' as a peculiar meta-narrative whose ideological underpinnings are seldom faced even by its critics in the discursive field. Although self-referred to as theory, its consistent ignoring of the material and concrete in planning practice on the one hand, and the subservience to the political role of the state by unquestioned professionalism, makes its complicity with power obvious. This kind of theory or theorizing, in spite of its negation of practice as object for analysis, is therefore to be seen as praxis itself. The proposed re-evaluation of this meta-narrative restates past critiques and reviews the historical and material genealogy of planning as a spatial apparatus of the modern state. A critical deconstruction of the dominant discourse of planning suggests challenging its foundational traits: authoritarianism, hierarchy, anonymity and time/space absolutism. Finally, the essay calls for a re-imagining of planning as a counter-hegemonic project. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this article is to expose the concept of collaborative planning to the reality of planning, thereby assessing its efficacy for informing and explaining what planners `really' do and can do. In this systematic appraisal, we begin by disaggregating collaborative planning into four elements that can enlighten such conceptual frameworks: ontology, epistemology, ideology and methodology. These four lenses help delimit and clarify the object of our examination and provide transparent criteria that guide our examination of collaborative planning's strengths and weaknesses. The second part of this article comprises an empirical investigation of planning processes in Northern Ireland, ranging from region-wide to local and from statutory to visionary. Planning efforts in this province make suitable test cases because special care has been invested in participatory deliberation processes to compensate for the democratic deficits in its mainstream political system. Such efforts have sought to ensure a maximally inclusive planning process. And indeed, the consultation process leading to the Regional Development Strategy, for example, has earned plaudits from leading exponents of collaborative planning. The final analysis provides a systematic gauge of collaborative planning in light of our empirical evidence, deploying the four conceptual dimensions introduced in the first part. This exposes a range of problems not only with the concept itself but also regarding its affinity with the uncollaborative world within which it has to operate. The former shed light on those aspects where collaborative planning as a conceptual tool for practitioners needs to be renovated, while the latter highlight inconsistencies in a political framework that struggles to accommodate both global competitiveness and local democratic collaboration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the relevance of the concept of autopoiesis for public participation in spatial planning. The concept of autopoiesis within social science, as advanced by Niklas Luhmann (1995) argues for a systemic, consistent and sophisticated theory of society based on a systems view, as opposed to more familiar action-based theories (for instance as in the case of the Habermasian tradition). By examining the relevance of the concept for public participation in spatial planning, this article highlights specific aspects of public participation that draw attention to dimensions of planning that are not currently explicitly highlighted within mainstream discourses in planning.<jats:sup>1</jats:sup> </jats:p>",

When is the megaregion a useful scale for policy and planning? </jats:p>",

The notion of the `representational logics of urban intervention' captures this idea that urban branding interventions are guided by certain representations and embedded in certain norms and values. The analytical framework is applied to a case study of cultural urban branding, the harbour front in Aalborg, Denmark, where a number of flagship architecture projects and cultural institutions are planned. It illustrates the competing stories told by proponents and opponents of the interventions, and also shows how the relation to place in the stories differs radically according to their allegiances. The article aims to throwing light on the complex relationship between story and place. </jats:p>",

In this article I tell a story about the transformation of Louisville, Kentucky, a city of approximately 700,000 people located in the middle of the United States. The story begins in the early 1950s with a youth named Cassius Marcellus Clay, moves through space and time, weaves together a series of locally grounded common urban narratives, and ends at a new Center in Louisville named after Muhammad Ali. By weaving these tales together, I seek to demonstrate how narrative might be used to generate a more capacious approach to planning, but also to indicate how the physical design of the city-region has to be changed to make space for diverse common urban narratives. I end by suggesting that such an approach might help increase the sustainability of Louisville and other city-regions. </jats:p>",

The design of the tomb for Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the author of the city's original plan, however, has not received similar attention. Disguising twentieth-century advocacy as nineteenth-century homage, L'Enfant's belated commemorators shaped the memorial as propaganda supporting their quest to imprint the McMillan Plan on L'Enfant's city. The intimate connection between monument making and planning history has remained previously unrecognized by historians because the tomb's principal designers so carefully concealed their involvement. This article not only probes the authorship of the memorial and the deployment of public art to support professional ambitions but also sheds new light on the birth of the planning profession. </jats:p>",

First, recent policy innovations have spurred cleanup and redevelopment on many of the counties' least contaminated sites and those located in the strongest markets. Second, brownfield remediation is a necessary but not sufficient precursor to redevelopment and job creation. Many of the U.S. brownfield sites are located in weak land markets; thus, cleanup does not necessarily result in follow-on private investment. Third, brownfield redevelopment is complicated by the fact that many of the most seriously contaminated sites are located in the most distressed neighborhoods. Redevelopment and job creation, therefore, are likely to require substantial government investment. Finally, experiments that tie job creation to local residents have received little study but show promise as the best way to avoid displacement when remediation and redevelopment are successful. </jats:p>",

The history of ideas that supported this establishment has been investigated, but no research has examined the implementation of the 1930s' greenbelt. The objective of this article is to investigate why the greenbelt was successfully established in the 1930s, despite the United Kingdom's weak planning system and the unprecedented urban growth at the time. In particular, the authors highlight the role of landowners and county council members in establishing the greenbelt. Finally, they discuss how the history of the greenbelt has to be reassessed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>To determine, from the perspective of providers, community leaders and users of health services, equity, governance and health financing outcomes of the Mexican health system reform.Cross‐sectional study oriented towards the qualitative analysis of financing, governance and equity indicators for the uninsured population. Taking into account feasibility, as well as political and technical criteria, six Mexican states were selected as study populations and a qualitative research was conducted during 2004–2006. Two hundred and forty in‐depth interviews were applied, in all selected states, to 60 decision‐makers, including medical and administrative personnel; 60 service providers at health centres; 60 representatives of civil organizations, including municipal representatives and, finally, 60 members of health committees and users of services at second and first levels of care units. The analysis of interviews was performed using ATLAS‐Ti software. An outcome mapping of health reform was developed.For political actors, Mexican health system reform has not modified dependence on the central level; ignorance about reform strategies and lack of participation in the search for financial resources to finance health systems were evidenced. Also, in all states under study, community leaders and users of services reported the need to improve an effective accountability system at both municipal and state levels. Health strategies for equity, governance and financing do not have adequate mechanisms to promote participation from all social actors. Improving this situation is a very important goal in the Mexican health democratization process, in the context of health care reform. There are relevant positive and negative effects of the reform on equity, governance and financing in health. Special emphasis is placed on the analysis of lessons learned in Mexico and the usefulness of the main strengths and weaknesses, as relevant evidences for other middle‐income countries which are designing, implementing and evaluating reform strategies in order to achieve equity in resource allocation, good levels of governance and a greater financial protection in health.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The present work analyzed the association between hospital costs and patient admission characteristics in a general public hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The unit costs method was used to estimate inpatient day costs associated to specific hospital clinics. With this aim, three “cost centers” were defined in order to group direct and indirect expenses pertaining to the clinics. After the costs were estimated, a standard linear regression model was developed for correlating cost units and their putative predictors (the patients <jats:italic>gender</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>age</jats:italic>, the <jats:italic>admission type</jats:italic> (urgency/elective), <jats:italic>ICU admission</jats:italic> (yes/no), <jats:italic>blood transfusion</jats:italic> (yes/no), the <jats:italic>admission outcome</jats:italic> (death/no death), the <jats:italic>complexity</jats:italic> of the medical procedures performed, and a <jats:italic>risk‐adjustment index</jats:italic>). Data were collected for 3100 patients, January 2001–January 2003. Average inpatient costs across clinics ranged from (US$) 1135 [Orthopedics] to 3101 [Cardiology]. Costs increased according to increases in the risk‐adjustment index in all clinics, and the index was statistically significant in all clinics except <jats:italic>Urology, General surgery,</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Clinical medicine</jats:italic>. The occupation rate was inversely correlated to costs, and <jats:italic>age</jats:italic> had no association with costs. The (adjusted) per cent of explained variance varied between 36.3% [<jats:italic>Clinical medicine</jats:italic>] and 55.1% [<jats:italic>Thoracic surgery</jats:italic> clinic]. The estimates are an important step towards the standardization of hospital costs calculation, especially for countries that lack formal hospital accounting systems.

Outstanding employees expect their effort to be acknowledged by the organization. However, the variety of rewards and recognitions systems used by organizations may be perceived differently by different employees. The diverse workforce structure in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) poses various challenges for organization managers. Managers need to implement the shrewd RR system which best fits their diverse workforce. This research studied how medical sector employees in the private and public health sector view the RR systems in the UAE. Two lists, comprising 26 major approaches to RR, were prepared and its items prioritized by taking inputs from 250 employees working in more than 30 varied public and private health care organizations in the UAE. The findings of the research are expected to provide guidelines for developing appropriate RR systems for organizations in general, and UAE health care organizations in particular.

Part II describes the results on geometrical constructions that imitate well-known constructions from classical approximation theory.

Based on a case study of Orang Asli Temiar communities of Kampung Perjek and Kuala Mu, the study evaluated the level of sustainability of the community's base on the indicators formulated. Forty-five (45) indicators were finalized in a comprehensive 1nanner covering economic, social and physical dimensions. These indicators were then categorized into behaviour, system and situational components. Fieldworks were conducted and the level of sustainability of each indicator was analyzed based on the information collected and index was used to measure the overall sustainability. This study shows variability of sustainability levels of each indicator. Findings from the first part of the analysis (sustainability level for each indicator) showed that only nine of the 16 behaviour indicators have achieved sustainability level. Under system category, only two out of 10 indicators achieved the level of sustainability and for indicators under state category, seven out of 19 indicators achieved the sustainability level. Meanwhile, for the index analysis (overall sustainability level of each dimension) it showed that the levels of sustainability were moderate for the social and physical/ecological indicators (42.1 % and 60.0%) and low for the economic indicators (25.0%). Based on the findings and discussions with the local community, this study suggests a framework for the sustainable development strategy which includes; (1) conserve or encourage continuation of current sustainable practices, (2) improve or change the unsustainable or low level of sustainable practices and (3) develop the potential of the area in a sustainable manner.  </jats:p>"

However, the issue of how individuals and groups can influence the process and outcomes of organizational IS planning with their own concerns still needs further attention. This paper presents an approach to IS planning that facilitates inclusion and participation of people. The focus of planning remains the organization, but critical thinking is developed through reflection on wider (e.g. individual and societal) concerns. Using Critical Systems Thinking (CST) and the theories of boundary critique and autopoiesis, the approach in this paper emphasizes continuous inclusion of, and reflection on, different issues of concern, values and interests that groups of stakeholders have about their situation prior to the selection, design and implementation of planning methods. Reflections from practice can lead practitioners to consider the importance of ethics in information systems planning. </jats:p>",

A planner system, based on mixed integer linear programming techniques, which implements the model, is also presented. The planner is able to reason about the dynamic features of the environment and to produce solution plans, which take into account reactive devices and their causal relations with agent's goals by exploitation and avoidance techniques, to reach a given goal state. The introduction of reactive domains in planning poses some issues concerning reasoning patterns which are briefly depicted. Experiments of planning in reactive domains are also discussed.</jats:p>",

Like with other attractions, commonly comprising permanent built infrastructure, changing patterns of size and catchment areas are evident. Most strikingly those changes are identifiable, concerning financial inputs. Frequently, events are important means for city and regional marketing activities. Especially in cases, where public funds are used, evidence is to be provided on whether the money was well spent. The paper shows, which impacts events might have and how they can be measured. The BUGA 2005 in Munich is used to implement and discuss the methods. Concerning this case study a net impact effect for the tourism sector is calculated.</jats:p>"

Free-form surface polishing processes as a finishing process are\nused to reduce the roughness of surfaces and smooth the surface form by eliminating the surface\nwaviness left by tool marks, EDM spark erosion and so on. In the interest of realizing this aim\nwithout introducing undesirable surface waviness and time efficiency, a tool-path should provide\neven coverage of free-form surface during polishing. A fractal curve is suitable to cover the\nfree-form surface uniformly at any complexity due to its plane-filling and self-similar\ncharacteristics. A method of generating the fractal path for free-form surface polishing is presented,\nand also an automatic polishing system is installed to confirm the path planning method’s validity.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the biggest challenges in the development and deployment of spoken dialogue systems is the design of the spoken language generation module. This challenge arises from the need for the generator to adapt to many features of the dialogue domain, user population, and dialogue context.  A promising approach is trainable generation, which uses general-purpose linguistic knowledge that is automatically adapted to the features of interest, such as the application domain, individual user, or user group.  In this paper we present and evaluate a trainable sentence planner for providing restaurant information in the MATCH dialogue system.  We show that trainable sentence planning can produce complex information presentations whose quality is comparable to the output of a template-based generator tuned to this domain.  We also show that our method easily supports adapting the sentence planner to individuals, and that the individualized sentence planners generally perform better than models trained and tested on a population of individuals. Previous work has documented and utilized individual preferences for content selection, but to our knowledge, these results provide the first demonstration of individual preferences for sentence planning operations, affecting the content order, discourse structure and sentence structure of system responses. Finally, we evaluate the contribution of different feature sets, and show that, in our application, n-gram features often do as well as features based on higher-level linguistic representations.</jats:p>"

The mass transportation system in the city is mainly based on rickshaws and bicycles (50% of total trips). This study reports existing transport system of the city and identifies possible public bus routes and stops using GIS through field survey. The trip generation and distribution behaviour and modal choice behavior of the city dwellers are also analyzed. A total of 35 bus stops were proposed for developing bus service in the city.  Three routes have been proposed through analysis of alternatives considering mainly traffic flow characteristics. The service area of each bus stop was identified by generating buffers in a GIS. Then the possible number of trips from each stop to all other stops was estimated. This study reveals that public bus service is feasible for the city from technical, financial and socio-economic perspectives. This study recommends the construction of passenger sheds, terminal facilities and other facilities for the proposed bus services.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the increasing dependence on optimization algorithms in track generation in the presence of variable or uncertain environments, the desire for a more environmentally-sensitive metric of sensor performance has arisen. A measure of performance based upon acoustic coverage area has shown promise as a basis for sensor utilization and optimized track generation applications, and is presented here for the case of a bi-static, active sensor used in the search for stationary bottom targets (e.g., wrecks). Coverage can be defined as the areas throughout which a sensor has a sufficiently high signal-to-noise ratio or alternatively, probability, of making positive observations of objects on the seafloor. For the purposes of determining optimal sensor placement and track generation, the area of interest is divided into a sufficiently sampled grid of calculation points. Computing and compiling acoustic sensor coverage area information for grid points throughout the area of interest into an acoustic coverage map gives immediate visual feedback on locations of optimal performance for a specific sensor in the current ocean environment.

The first concerns the politics of the alter-globalisation movements—what they demand and how they practise their aims. The second concerns the potential of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to provide a space within which to build a radical politics. Several dilemmas facing Indymedia and alter-globalisation movements emerge from this analysis. First, there remain many limitations of using ICTs as a space for the constitution of a radical politics. Second, Indymedia collectives have had success in aligning their aims to their practices; however, informal hierarchies did form around editorial decisions and technical skills. Third, there is continued potential for these movements to appear exclusive. In this respect, simply being ‘open’ is not enough to widen these spaces of resistance. Fourth, there is the continued importance of structure to strengthen the ability of groups to operate non-hierarchically Despite these dilemmas, many of the alter-globalisation movements' practices are proving workable. It is the ability of participants to acknowledge these dilemmas and to continue to be reflexive about their practices that is one of the greatest strengths of these emerging movements. </jats:p>",

The Northern Ireland Family Support Research Project was undertaken between 1995 and 1999. It is argued that research project did make a contribution to the refocusing work of the time by promoting a conceptual model that has helped clarify what is meant by family support; identifying needs-based planning as the pivotal task for promoting the new direction; and validating Children's Services Planning as the leading mechanism for change. It is further argued that the research impact achieved did not come through a direct cause-and-effect relationship between research and planning, but rather through the planners' use of aspects of the research for their own problem-solving requirements.</jats:p>",

It traces the political genealogies of a recent strand of radical queer activism that is broadly aligned with the anarchist and anticapitalist wings of the global justice movement. In line with the usage of the term ‘queer’ by these activists themselves, to refer to a variety of states of being that challenge both homonormativity and heteronormativity, this paper utilises a definition of ‘queer’ that moves beyond the ways in which it has been mobilised by many sexual geographers. The ethnography poses questions about the ‘queer’ in ‘queer geography’ and what it means to be an ‘activist’. This work considers the importance (as well as the limits) of these autonomous queer spaces. It suggests that the process of collective experimentation to build autonomous queer spaces is ultimately more transformative and empowering than the resulting structures. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A hierarchical optimization framework is developed to analyze spatially complex watersheds and to support spatial decision making for land management practices. A watershed is subdivided into smaller spatial units according to its hierarchy, and a three‐level optimization approach determines optimal land allocations at the subarea, catchment, and 30 m cell levels. A storm water runoff simulation model is used to generate peak discharge pseudo data, under different land use patterns. The results are inputs to regression analyses, and the functional relationships between peak discharges and land use variables are estimated as quadratic functions (r<jats:sup>2</jats:sup>&gt; 0.90). These functions are used in the optimization models to allocate future land uses to minimize peak discharges at the watershed and subarea outlets. The integrated hydrological land use optimization (IHLUO) model is next used to allocate land uses at the cell level. The results are promising, with a 46% reduction of the peak discharge rate as compared to the rate generated by the current land use pattern. The results provide site‐specific guidelines for land use management and practices at a high spatial resolution (30 m). The proposed methodology is applied to the Old Woman Creek watershed, located in the southwestern basin of Lake Erie (Ohio).</jats:p>",

We also devised two tests (Composite Benefit and Row Dominance tests) to determine whether subjects’ performance met necessary conditions for optimality (defined as maximizing expected gain).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The complexity of the discharge planning process is such that it is often difficult to achieve in a totally efficient and effective manner. In this paper a systems approach is adopted in analysing the discharge planning process in a general surgical ward in order to understand better the nature of this complexity. Adopting a soft systems methodology it is shown that the major issues to be addressed relate to the need for a more seamless service provision and more effective utilisation of resources. Conceptual models are formulated which enable comparison to be made between current provision and the issues that need to be addressed. This in turn results in the creation of an agenda of items for change, from cultural, organisational and technological perspectives, which can be considered in terms of their feasibility and desirability. Key proposals highlighted, so as to improve discharge planning, include: the need for greater co-operation between the many healthcare professions involved; the adoption, particularly on the part of nursing staff, of a more holistic approach with regard to the needs of their patients; enhancing the utilisation of nursing staff; and moving towards a greater adoption of information and communication technologies as a means of achieving more effective communication. More generally, the paper provides an example of the role that soft systems analysis can play as an aid in dealing with the complexities of healthcare processes and their management. </jats:p>",

We compared their mandatory provisions for the protection of heritage assets with an‘Ideal Heritage Disaster Plan', containing a series of non‐negotiable elements. The examined plans fell well short of the ideal. Preparedness Plans generally lacked a discussion of suppression techniques (for historic heritage), prevention, prescribed drills and communication procedures. None of the Response Plans or Recovery Plans contained any of the required core elements, such as rapid suppression techniques and stabilisation procedures. Where aspects were covered, they were addressed in an inadequate level of detail. The overall quality of the cultural heritage components of the plans is judged to be poor. Suggestions are made on how to improve the situation if heritage assets are to have a future following bushfire events.</jats:p>",

The software package, called<jats:sc>DOSCTP</jats:sc>, provides a user‐friendly platform for DICOM computed tomography‐based Monte Carlo dose calculation using the EGSnrcMP‐based DOSXYZnrc code.

A treatment plan for a mouse based on a CT image set by a 360‐deg photon arc is demonstrated. It is shown that it is possible to create 3D conformal treatment plans for small animals with consideration of inhomogeneities using small photon beam field sizes in the diameter range of 0.5–5 cm, with conformal dose covering the target volume while sparing the surrounding critical tissue. It is also found that Monte Carlo simulation is suitable to carry out treatment planning dose calculation for small animal anatomy with voxel size about one order of magnitude smaller than that of the human.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study presents an optimization method based on cellular automaton (CA) for solving spatial forest planning problems. The CA maximizes stand-level and neighbourhood objectives locally, i.e., separately for different stands or raster cells. Global objectives are dealt with by adding a global part to the objective function and gradually increasing its weight until the global targets are met to a required degree. The method was tested in an area that consisted of 2500 (50 × 50) hexagons 1 ha in size. The CA was used with both parallel and sequential state-updating rules. The method was compared with linear programming (LP) in four nonspatial forest planning problems where net present value (NPV) was maximized subject to harvest constraints. The CA solutions were within 99.6% of the LP solutions in three problems and 97.9% in the fourth problem. The CA was compared with simulated annealing (SA) in three spatial problems where a multiobjective utility function was maximized subject to periodical harvest and ending volume constraints. The nonspatial goal was the NPV and the spatial goals were old forest and cutting area aggregation as well as dispersion of regeneration cuttings. The CA produced higher objective function values than SA in all problems. Especially, the spatial objective variables were better in the CA solutions, whereas differences in NPV were small. There were no major differences in the performance of the parallel and sequential cell state-updating modes of the CA. </jats:p>",

Other important variables that are assumed to influence the quality of the process are the care culture and professional knowledge. The conceptual model was developed as a system dynamics causal loop diagram as a first essential step towards a computed model.

Despite its relative scarcity and absolute importance to life on earth, fresh water resources are often used inefficiently or polluted unnecessarily. Policymakers must work towards developing approaches to balance human demands for water with the water requirements of ecosystems. The European Water Framework Directive, which aims to encourage the sustainable management and protection of freshwater resources, brings this agenda into sharp focus in Europe. Land use change and environmental quality are closely related, and the nature and location of development can significantly influence both the generation and resolution of environmental problems. This places spatial planning, which provides a framework for regulating the development and use of land, in a strong position to affect water quantity and quality issues and thus to aid the achievement of the Directive's goals. In particular, spatial planning has an important function in integrating the use and management of land and water more closely than is presently the case. This paper explores the potential and actual role of spatial planning in addressing challenges associated with the water environment. This enables an assessment to be made of the extent to which spatial planning can help to meet the goals of the Water Framework Directive.</jats:p>",

It uses a geodemographic classification system to produce a generalised socioeconomic profile for a particular initiative. This profile can be used to examine the targeting of the initiative in different localities, in order to assess whether targeting has been inefficient (the targeted areas have been defined so that many of the people they contain are in fact not those for whom the initiative is intended) or incomplete (deserving cases have been missed because the initiative's boundaries have been drawn too tightly).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on recent political theory that examines the relationship between inclusive deliberation and oppositional activism in processes of democratisation, we develop a case study of environmental justice mobilisation in post-apartheid South Africa. We focus on the emergence of a network of social movement organisations embedded in particular localities in the city of Durban, connected into national and transnational campaigns, and centred on grievances around industrial air pollution. We analyse how the geographies of uneven industrial and urban development in Durban combine with sedimented place-based histories of activism to make particular locations spaces of democratic contention, in which the scope and operation of formal democratic procedures are challenged and transformed. We examine the range of strategic engagements adopted by social movement organisations in pursuing their objectives, looking in particular at the dynamic interaction between inclusion in deliberative forums and more adversarial, activist strategies of legal challenge and dramaturgical protest. We identify the key organisational features of groups involved in this environmental justice network, which both enable and constrain particular patterns of democratic engagement with the state and capital. We also identify a disjuncture between the interpretative frames of different actors involved in participatory policy making. These factors help to explain the difficulties faced by social movement organisations in opening up the space for legitimate nonparliamentary opposition in a political culture shaped by norms of conciliation and consensus. </jats:p>",

Building upon Hochschild's work on the commercialization of intimate life, this article explores the relationship of feminism to the commercial spirit of intimate life to understand wedding planning as a commodified domestic service designed to meet the competing demands of work and home for women. In its marketing, the industry makes use of feminism, harnessing liberal feminist ideals of “having it all”: The solution for busy, engaged career women is to outsource their wedding planning. Thus, both the problem and the answer are rooted in a capitalist version of liberal feminism. Based on interviews with six wedding planners, an analysis of the online advertising of 280 planning businesses, and an examination of the industry, this case study of wedding planning illuminates the connections between liberal feminism and the commodification of family life. </jats:p>",

As a result, a framework of integration in IWRM is set out. This is then used to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the new spatial planning system in England, and its potential to contribute to IWRM activities that are being developed, partly in response to the European Union Water Framework Directive. From this analysis it is argued that, taken overall, spatial planning is well placed to meet these challenges and it could in fact play a much more central role than is currently envisaged. An alternative model for IWRM in England is set out which sees the new river basin management plans as integral, rather than parallel, to the spatial planning system.</jats:p>",

To improve their efficiency and simplify the planning we have developed and tested a decision support system at a major Swedish forest company. The system is based on a combination of a geographic information system (GIS), global positioning system (GPS), and optimization routines to solve the underlying vehicle routing problem. The routes for the forwarders are found by using a repeated matching algorithm. The solution time is short, and it is possible to find routes dynamically in a real-time environment. The geographic information required is found by using a GPS together with data obtained from the bucking software in the harvesters. To show the routes and location of the forwarder, we make use of a GIS that is connected to the GPS. We report on a study with savings in the distance travelled of 8% and numerical tests on the solution methodology. We also compare the proposed solution method with some well-known routing methods. </jats:p>",

In this study, the results from recently developed imputation techniques using laser scanner and satellite data were evaluated as input in a timber-oriented forestry planning context. Evaluation comprised a cost plus loss analysis in which the data cost for a specific method is added to the expected loss arising from nonoptimal forestry activities caused by erroneous forest descriptions. Forest data from sample plot imputations based on laser scanner data, satellite data, or a combination of both were available for 64 stands in southern Sweden. For comparison, sample plot field inventories of 5 and 10 plots were simulated for each stand. Different stand areas and real interest rates were tested. The best performing imputation method, using both laser scanner and satellite data, produced the lowest total cost plus loss in the smallest stands when using the highest interest rate. In all other cases, the sample plot methods performed better. Operative phase considerations, altering the original plan, would likely mitigate the effect of nonoptimal forest-management decisions, improving the competitiveness of the imputation methods. Further analysis should include such owner-specific considerations. </jats:p>",

In many cases the time to success is crucial, and opportunity costs may be greater than direct costs of implementation. We analyse the problem of how to choose between options when risks of failure vary systematically.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Ecological uncertainty propagates through to uncertainty about economic outcomes. We used an ecological model of tree recruitment that accounted for uncertainty surrounding the effects of climate and seed fall, coupled with a farm economics model, to examine how a land manager should act when deciding between active and passive revegetation (planting seed/seedlings or relying on natural recruitment, respectively) for restoration purposes on a farm managed for livestock production.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The outcome of the analysis was driven by the relative sizes of up‐front costs and opportunity costs, which were a function of potential productivity and the time until successful revegetation was achieved. Active revegetation was less costly than passive revegetation in high‐productivity situations, because there was less risk of long periods without production and the associated opportunity costs. At low productivity, passive revegetation was less costly than active revegetation. However, because the probability of a successful outcome increased over time, passive revegetation is only likely to be preferred over medium time‐frames (&gt; 5 years) and the strategy may not be chosen by risk‐averse farmers.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p> <jats:italic>Synthesis and applications.</jats:italic> This analysis has implications for (i) decision‐making by individual land managers and regional planners and (ii) the design of policies for delivery of incentive schemes targeted at revegetation. Risk‐averse individual land managers are likely to select active regeneration scenarios, particularly when costs of capital works are shared with the community. For a regional planner, the analysis aids thinking about the probable balance of financial assistance schemes for attaining regional objectives: over high‐productivity areas, capital works programmes and short‐term opportunity cost incentives (&lt; 5 years) are cheaper; at low productivity, incentive schemes for medium‐ to long‐term land retirement will be cheaper. This analysis provides a starting point for devising the mix of approaches required to achieve broad‐scale revegetation targets, which would include greater investment in uncertain, long‐term strategies.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

I argue that the first of these bodies of literature is often trapped in an unhelpful public–private divide, which reflects the inability of mainstream crime prevention to include violence committed within families and households as a central focus of concern. I further argue that the question of how urban space can become more egalitarian needs to be concerned with violence and fear in the private realm as well as the public realm. Although the paper is primarily a review of recent academic and policy-oriented literature, my arguments are illustrated by a research project on how grassroots organizations serving new-arrival women in the outer suburbs of Melbourne and Toronto, as well as their funders, are redefining violence and safer space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores space as the object of mobilization (rather than focusing on space as resource or constraint, or on the spatial configuration of actors within the organizational structure of a movement). In the context of state-restructuring processes, it is argued that new political spaces result not only from social movement activities (as in the drive for ‘free spaces’), but also in a dynamic interaction between state and civil society actors. The author asks what it takes to create a new, effective, and significant political space. Three elements are explored empirically and theoretically: the production of allegiance and legitimacy through spatial imaginaries, the instrumentalization of spatial practices and of the political culture, and the strategic use of spatial tools. In light of the case of Toronto, where a new regional political space eased the normalization of neoliberalism, it is concluded that new political spaces create the conditions for political exchange, but do not guarantee emancipation, democracy, and justice. Overall, the author's aim is to discuss the concept of political space and the analytical advantages provided by its openness to fluidity, uncertainties, uninstitutionalized interactions, and various forms of rationalities (imaginaries, everyday practices, as well as strategic calculation) in the state-restructuring and rescaling debate. </jats:p>",

Authorities want to determine where to locate the facilities of a social infrastructure network and what should be the capacity of these facilities. Each user must be assigned to its closest facility and, to be economically viable, each facility must serve at least a pre‐specified level of demand. The objective is to maximize the accessibility to facilities (i.e., to minimize the distance traveled by users to reach the facilities). A location model that captures the above features is formulated and different solution methods are tested. Among the methods tested, tabu search and a specialized local search heuristic provided the best solutions. The application of the model is illustrated through a case study involving the location of preschools in the municipality of Miranda do Corvo, Portugal.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Yet this work has not focused sufficiently on national urban politics for understanding the legacies of division and circumscription that may shape the city as a terrain of conflict. Reconsidering two classic treatments of fragmentation in the work of Katznelson and Castells, I contend that the historically racialized and politically decentralized institutional patterns characteristic of US urban governance continue to hamper urban social-justice mobilizations that seek to grapple with sectoral and scalar cleavages. Drawing on recent work in urban history, labor sociology, and urban politics, my discussion acknowledges the emerging potential of certain kinds of cross-sectoral and multiscalar efforts—such as labor–community coalitions and translocally supported multilocal campaigns—while also emphasizing that these mobilizations take shape within urban political arenas that, in the United States, are notoriously divisive and ‘sticky’. The paper illustrates these points through a brief case example involving the anti-Wal-Mart movement in Chicago. </jats:p>",

In their wider national and international frameworks movements in both countries continue to contest unjust forms of urbanization characterized by neoliberal initiatives that undermine the socioeconomic status of low-income residents. These movements are constituted by relations that stretch across several geographical levels. There remain, however, significant differences in their spatial organizational form: Rotterdam is characterized by loose networks of local associations which relate to constellations of nationally based Christian churches, unions, and humanist organizations, whereas networks between associations, unions, and university activists in Los Angeles have undergone institutionalization at the urban level. We show that movement territorialization is particularly evident at the urban level in Los Angeles while embedded at the national level in the shadow of state–corporatist institutional legacies and power relations in Rotterdam. By drawing upon important insights from several economic geographers, we develop a conceptual framework for explaining the spatialities of contention and contribute to contemporary controversies over relationality, territoriality, and political action at a variety of scales. A normative implication of the paper concerns the learning capacities of contesting actors to forge alliances and achieve their ambitions within path-dependent institutional frameworks. </jats:p>",

Having set out the problem, the author proceeds through a set of hypotheses concerning why parties are such elusive characters on the urban-studies stage. These involve, in turn: the characteristics of the literature on parties; the treatment of ‘change’ as a theme in human geography and urban studies; the effects of the dominance of the United States in the theoretical literature on urban politics; the characterisation of political ‘actors’ in this literature; and related issues surrounding the challenges which parties pose to research at a normative–democratic level. In the process it is cautiously suggested that parties be reinserted as forming part of an array of urban collective forms which repay attention in accounting for urban political transformation and, of course, inertia. The usefulness of parties as a space within which to think through problems of agency and democracy in the city and beyond, is also emphasised. </jats:p>",

This report clarifies the concept of IWM, and reviews the major social, environmental and economic problems caused by dams in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Dams are planned from a top‐down perspective in Ethiopia, some people are relocated against their will, haphazard land‐use changes can occur, and soil erosion and reservoir sedimentation can increase. Many communities affected by dam constructions have not been sufficiently recognized or compensated, and environmental protection measures such as land‐use planning and soil and water conservation have not been adopted in watersheds in which construction of dams is occurring. Furthermore, revenues generated from hydropower and water supplies often benefit urban dwellers, or the national economy, at the expense of rural inhabitants in watersheds. Creation of a multistakeholder platform, integration of soft system methodology with hard system tools, and completion of environmental protection measures should be among the major components of an improved planning methodology for construction of new dams in Ethiopia. This translates into an environment wherein science and knowledge can help watershed inhabitants create a diversity of locally appropriate resource management solutions. Effective implementation of environmental policies and strategies could improve the quality of watershed‐based developments. The conclusion is that the IWM approach is a good alternative to effectively address the social, environmental and economic problems associated with planning and constructing new dams in Ethiopia.</jats:p>",

The article discusses an Italian case study in the Lombardia region. It covers the development of a so‐called Local Operating Manual for external industrial emergency management as well as a so‐called Technical Study for land use control around hazardous plants. After these documents were revised, a real accident occurred, showing the limitations of planning. The lessons learnt from this experience suggested some multi‐organizational directions and methodological procedures for further research on risk management and communication.</jats:p>",

Results were aggregated and a chi square analysis identified factors associated with stronger linkages.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Overall performance on study-defined indicators of strong linkages was low: 34% had completed a hazard vulnerability analysis in collaboration with the community emergency management agency, 30% had their role documented in the community plan, and 24% participated in community-wide exercises. Stronger linkages were associated with experience responding to a disaster and a perception of high risk for experiencing a disaster.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> The potential for health centers to participate in an integrated response is not fully realized, and their absence from community-based planning leaves an already vulnerable population at greater risk. Community planners should be encouraged to include health centers in planning and response and centers should receive more targeted resources for community integration.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Debate continues with regard to the possibility of inferring an offender's characteristic features from crime scene details (the process of so‐called “offender profiling”). We argue that psychology generally has benefited from appreciating context in predicting behavior. In the same way, profiling would benefit from an appreciation of context in predicting characteristics. This “reverse” process is contingent on various “if…then” relationships. As one example, this paper demonstrates how profiling offender age from victim age is contingent on (i) the level of planning and (ii) the level of aggression displayed during the offense. Eighty‐five stranger rape case records formed the data set. Moderated regression analysis revealed that victim age is a significant predictor of offender age only in cases where the offender has (i) shown evidence of planning the attack and/or (ii) acts in a gratuitously aggressive manner. The theoretical bases for these findings may lie in the extent to which offenders disparately plan and target victims and how extreme aggressiveness in stranger rapes may relate to a near‐peer proxy for an offender's anger. The implications of the results for the processes and methods involved in offender profiling suggest that certain crime scene factors can have differential moderating effects on predictive outcomes.

This paper addresses this impact, while controlling for the impact of household structure, life cycle, employment status and hours, access to transport systems, and interactions among activities in persons' activity schedules. Path models for male–female couples in the Amsterdam–Utrecht corridor, the Netherlands, show that land use and accessibility influence between-partner interactions in maintenance activity participation, although their role appears to be smaller than that of sociodemographics and access to transport systems. While women perform the bulk of out-of-home household tasks, men are responsible for a larger share of out-of-home household duties in neighbourhoods characterised by a higher population density and/or more diversity of land uses than they are in lower density and/or less diverse neighbourhoods. However, women's responsibilities are not reduced to the same extent, because spouses' joint participation is also somewhat larger in higher density, more diverse neighbourhoods and because part of men's participation in these neighbourhoods reflects household activities not undertaken elsewhere. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Careful planning is critical to ensure blood availability during times of reduced supply and/or increased demand, such as infectious pandemic, act of terrorism or natural disaster. Possible strategies include triaging of supply to prioritize support where transfusion cannot be deferred. However, few data concerning urgency of transfusion are available to inform planning. We designed a random sample survey to assess urgency of clinical need, and hence potential utility of triaging red cells (RC) in an emergency through restricting use only to urgent indications, for a regional population of approximately 5 million. An audit based on random sampling of units at point of distribution was used to assess state-wide RC use over time, and capture data in proportion to actual usage over both rural and metropolitan centers. Randomly selected RC units were tagged with a case-report form during production. Tagged units were distributed to hospital laboratories with routine supply. At time of issue for transfusion, the institutional laboratory completed and returned case report forms from the tagged units. Information regarding recipient demographics, indication for transfusion, urgency of supply, and (where issued to support surgery) urgency of surgery were obtained. Following an initial pilot study to refine the model, approximately 1000 tagged RC units (46% group O, 36% A, 13% B, and 4% AB; RhD positive 85% / negative 15%) of a planned 5000 total have been introduced to the state inventory. Three percent of units were not transfused. Major clinical categories of use included hematology (17% of overall use), gastroenterology (11%), orthopedic surgery (9%), non-hematological oncology (6%), gastrointestinal surgery (6%), cardiothoracic surgery (5%), obstetrics/gynecology (5%), urology (3%), trauma (3%) and pediatrics (2%); miscellaneous indications and anemia not otherwise specified constituted 10% and 22% of transfusions respectively. 18% of units were used in acute transfusion episodes (needed within 1h), 43% for urgent indications (1–24h), 33% semi-urgent (24h - 1 week) and 4% non-urgent. Of the 34% units allocated to support perioperative bleeding; only a quarter of procedures were elective. In 15% of cases the urgency of surgery was not stated. Thus, reporting institutions indicated that only 38% transfused units could have been deferred for more than 24h, and only 9% of total RCs were allocated to support potentially deferrable elective surgery. These early results suggest that triaging of RC supply in an acute shortage would only have a very short term impact on actual RC use, as the majority of RC use is already relatively urgent. Additional strategies for emergency blood contingency planning are required to meet priority clinical needs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The modeling of respiratory motion is important for a more accurate understanding and accounting of its effect on dose to cancers in the thorax and abdomen by radiotherapy. We have developed a model of respiration‐induced organ motion in the thorax without the commonly adopted assumption of repeatable breath cycles. The model describes the motion of a volume of interest within the patient based on a reference three‐dimensional (3D) image (at end expiration) and the diaphragm positions at different time points. The input data are respiration‐correlated CT (RCCT) images of patients treated for non‐small‐ cell lung cancer, consisting of 3D images, including the diaphragm positions, at ten phases of the respiratory cycle. A deformable image registration algorithm calculates the deformation field that maps each 3D image to the reference 3D image. A principal component analysis is performed to parameterize the 3D deformation field in terms of the diaphragm motion. We show that the first two principal components are adequate to accurately and completely describe the organ motion in the data of four patients. Artifacts in the RCCT images that commonly occur at the mid‐respiration states are reduced in the model‐generated images. Further validation of the model is demonstrated in the successful application of the parameterized 3D deformation field to RCCT data of the same patient but acquired several days later. We have developed a method for predicting respiration‐induced organ motion in patients that has potential for improving the accuracy of dose calculation in radiotherapy. Possible limitations of the model are cases where the correlation between lung tumor and diaphragm position is less reliable such as superiorly situated tumors and interfraction changes in tumor‐diaphragm correlation. The limited number of clinical cases examined suggests, but does not confirm, the model's applicability to a wide range of patients.</jats:p>",

Appropriate targets can be determined by identifying thresholds in the amount of habitat, below which persistence, abundance or occupancy declines rapidly. Although some studies have identified habitat thresholds, we currently have little understanding of the extent to which thresholds vary spatially. This is important for establishing whether we can apply the same planning targets across broad geographical regions.</jats:p></jats:list-item><jats:list-item><jats:p>We quantified habitat–occupancy relationships for the koala<jats:italic>Phascolarctos cinereus</jats:italic>(Goldfuss) in three study regions that span much of its geographical range. Standard and piecewise (broken‐stick/segmented) logistic regression were used to model linear and threshold habitat–occupancy relationships.

Variation in threshold points among study regions suggests that we should be wary of using thresholds derived in one region for setting conservation planning targets in another. Rather, we should aim to set specific targets for individual locations (and species), while acknowledging the inherent uncertainties in these targets. This has implications for our ability to make general conservation prescriptions for widely distributed species. Future research should aim to develop generic models capable of predicting threshold responses across different landscapes and life‐history characteristics.</jats:p></jats:list-item></jats:list></jats:p>",

The velocity obstacle method is utilized to determine the imminent collision obstacle. Subsequently, PFIN is implemented to guide robots to avoid collision with the most dangerous objects at every time instant. The overall response of the immune network is calculated with the aid of fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed architecture in dynamic environments with single and multiple fixed/moving obstacles.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The Monte Carlo (MC) method has been shown through many research studies to calculate accurate dose distributions for clinical radiotherapy, particularly in heterogeneous patient tissues where the effects of electron transport cannot be accurately handled with conventional, deterministic dose algorithms. Despite its proven accuracy and the potential for improved dose distributions to influence treatment outcomes, the long calculation times previously associated with MC simulation rendered this method impractical for routine clinical treatment planning. However, the development of faster codes optimized for radiotherapy calculations and improvements in computer processor technology have substantially reduced calculation times to, in some instances, within minutes on a single processor. These advances have motivated several major treatment planning system vendors to embark upon the path of MC techniques. Several commercial vendors have already released or are currently in the process of releasing MC algorithms for photon and/or electron beam treatment planning. Consequently, the accessibility and use of MC treatment planning algorithms may well become widespread in the radiotherapy community. With MC simulation, dose is computed stochastically using first principles; this method is therefore quite different from conventional dose algorithms. Issues such as statistical uncertainties, the use of variance reduction techniques, theability to account for geometric details in the accelerator treatment head simulation, and other features, are all unique components of a MC treatment planning algorithm. Successful implementation by the clinical physicist of such a system will require an understanding of the basic principles of MC techniques. The purpose of this report, while providing education and review on the use of MC simulation in radiotherapy planning, is to set out, for both users and developers, the salient issues associated with clinical implementation and experimental verification of MC dose algorithms. As the MC method is an emerging technology, this report is not meant to be prescriptive. Rather, it is intended as a preliminary report to review the tenets of the MC method and to provide the framework upon which to build a comprehensive program for commissioning and routine quality assurance of MC‐based treatment planning systems.</jats:p>",
