It quantifies speech intelligibility in terms of the S/N ratio on a scale extending from 0 to 1. While more experimentation is required to verify the subjective equivalent of any given AI, the AI itself can be calculated and hence predicted. It has been found that in buildings without complete floor-to-ceiling partitions, the AI changes drastically with the following variables: speech effort, speaker orientation, background noise, speaker-to-listener distance, and barrier attenuation (if present and unflanked). This paper discusses the relative effect of these variables on the AI, and thus demonstrates the importance of each parameter when designing open-plan facilities.</jats:p>",

This paper illustrates the workings of such a planning system and, at the same time, explores some of the problems connected with its actual implementation. The planning system under the study is called the decomposed planning system in order to distinguish it from either the centralized planning or the decentralized planning.</jats:p>",

Decisions are required sooner, in more detail, with some background—and yet cost more to evolve. One potential method to arrive at solutions at least more rapidly and in more detail is via simu‐ lation. A manager may evaluate many alternative solutions to his problem—provided an evaluated simulation system is at his disposal.</jats:p><jats:p>One such system under development is a highly flexible computerized model system for evaluating real economic/technical applicability of desalting to a selected area. The Economic Evaluation Model System (EEMS) was initially conceived during 1968 and the first version was completed in 1969.</jats:p><jats:p>This system represents the combination of technical, environmental and economic functions into an interrelated system, which allows the user to examine a broad range of water related problems—oriented toward the applicability of desalting as an additional or alternative source of water.</jats:p><jats:p>The major thrust of the development of the system thus far, however, has been with the methodology involved and further refinements and extensions of the system are recognized and planned for in future research and development.</jats:p>",
