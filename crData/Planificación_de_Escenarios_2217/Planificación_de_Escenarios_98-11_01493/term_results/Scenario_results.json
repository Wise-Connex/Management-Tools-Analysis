      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Kettering University (formerly GMI Engineering &amp; Management Institute) has had a strong link with industry due to its co-op approach to engineering education. This paper presents an extension of this link by collaborating with industry under two different programs: The Ford University Research Program (URP) and the Sloan Faculty Co-op Program. This paper describes the two programs and the various reasons for interaction, documents the nature of the collaborations, outlines potential benefits, and describes the manner by which the relationships were initiated. The paper focuses on the outcomes, makes recommendations towards successful and mutually beneficial relationships, and exhibits conditions for a continuing partnership. It concludes with an outline for a successful collaboration, its implications, and proposes ideas to other institutions for developing similar programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Abstract: </jats:bold> There has been a remarkable change in the scenario of therapeutic apheresis in the last 14 years in India. The crude method of manual removal of blood followed by separation of plasma by gravity, keeping it in the bottle for a long time, has now been totally replaced by plasmapheresis, centrifugation, membrane filtration, and immu‐noadsorption techniques. The indiciations for use have also changed from a list of limited indications in the beginning to include all immune complex disorders. The clinical beneficiaries have also increased from blood bankers to nephrologists and immunologists in addition to on cologists. Efforts are now underway with the help of the Indian Society for Apheresis (founded in 1985) to popularize the newer methods of cryofiltration, photopheresis and heparin extracorporeal low‐density lipoprotein (HELP) and DALI apheresis systems besides the specialized techniques of immunoadsorption using filters, columns, or ligands. This is suggestive of a positive trend for the treatment of immune complex disorders.</jats:p>",
