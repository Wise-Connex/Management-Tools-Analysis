Market forces and existing local economic development practices can reduce, but not eliminate, these disparities in economic status. Local interventions are needed to effect greater economic equality between the sexes, particularly in light of changes in national policy and the devolution of spending priorities from the federal government to states and localities. </jats:p>",

This article examines one aspect of the debate, the thread of research that surrounds the suburban dependence hypothesis. Since its proposal, the suburban dependence hypothesis has been criticized for its lack of a theoretical framework and for model misspecification. Variant hypotheses have been developed that acknowledge the limitations of the suburban dependence hypothesis but also recognize its conceptual appeal. These include the tight labor market, elasticity, downtown dependence, and interdependence hypotheses. A review of the literature indicates that the suburban dependence, downtown dependence, and elasticity hypotheses are wedded to a narrow interpretation of the traditional monocentric model. This narrow interpretation, in turn, does not specify the relationship between cities and suburbs given a multinucleated or polycentric urban structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> What has becomes known in recent years as communicative or collaborative planning has forged a new hegemony in planning theory. Described by some as the paradigm of the 1990s, it proposes a fundamental challenge to the practice of planning that seeks both to explain where planning has gone wrong and (more controversially) to identify ways forward. The broad approach itself and advocates of it have lacked the advantage of any critique. This paper provides such an opportunity. Following a brief outline of communicative action, we identify three broad areas of concern that militate against the option of a collaborative planning approach. More specifically, we identify problematic assumptions in Habermas's original theoretical distinction of communicative action as a fourth separate concept of sociological action. Although we accept its useful dissection of planning and the role of values and consensus-building in decision-settings, we consider that collaborative planning theory fails to incorporate adequately the peculiar political and professional nuances that exist in planning practice. We conclude our critique by raising programmatic points for planning theory and practice in general. </jats:p>",

Often, applying these projects creates significant risks, particularly if the project is unsuccessful or requires a new technology that has not been widely applied. Therefore, plant managers need a method of identifying the risks such that contingency plans can be drafted. In this paper, a method for identifying potential environmental states in light of improvement projects is illustrated.</jats:p>",

The assembly planning is related to results available from the product’s designer and suitable computer tools provide support for each task. There are 5 major groups of input information that is needed for the various tasks of assembly planning. Data created during planning are stored in an object-oriented database to avoid conversion and can even be re-used directly for start-up or production. Therefore the communication between the computer tools themselves and between the tools and the real automated devices has been standardized according to MMS and implemented as CORBA-objects. An equally important system characteristic is represented by the analyses based on the planning status; they can be applied throughout the planning process. Increasingly detailed and realistic analyses are thus possible during the whole planning process.</jats:p>",

Most of the proposed planners for coordinated control have been based on ad-hoc approaches using search strategies embedded within various search trees. What has been lacking in these algorithms is a formal framework for analysis, synthesis and evaluation of their performances. This paper presents an overview of application of such possible controlled planner architecture for manipulating objects using multiple agents. The controller is based on discrete-event control theory. The paper extends the application of such theory to the case of multiple agents manipulating a common object. Here for example, a set of events for lifting and rotating an object is described as labeled alphabets. Then it is shown how the manipulation of object can be described as finite-state automaton. The set of uncontrollable events is constructed. The supervisor (planner) can then be constructed by first defining the details of its legal behaviors.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The objective of this paper is to provide a non‐technical introduction to the science of memetics and to suggest how this new discipline may be applied to the design and development of effective marketing campaigns. The technique is based on a neo‐Darwinian evolutionary model of information transmission that may be used to explain and predict the “infectiousness” of certain ideas and behaviours. It is argued that traditional marketing theories based on rational choice theory may rely on an impossible homuncular psychology and it is suggested that a viable alternative would be to understand customer behaviour from a memetic perspective ‐ the result of contagion rather than conscious choice. From the memetic paradigm the role of marketing communications becomes one of designing and engineering infectious “mind viruses” that will influence customer perceptions and behaviour. Whilst memetics is still in its infancy, it is suggested that memetic engineering may provide a viable and effective complementary framework to standard techniques for developing successful marketing strategies.</jats:p>",

The quality, clarity and format of this documentation rely largely on planning engineers’ experience and expertise. Inconsistencies can occur from planner to planner or across project departments which effect product quality. This paper presents a novel structured approach to assembly planning for initial application in the small batch, high technology, precision products sector (eg avionics, mechatronics, electronics). The structured approach capturing best practice is designed to assist experienced planners as well as providing a mechanism for training new planners. The common and variable requirements of assembly planning and information delivery systems in the application sector have been researched and defined.</jats:p>",

The debate is framed by the options for each—in housing, high-rise versus mixed-height building ; for the proposed National Highway, its desirability and, if implemented, the route. The author urges a judicious mix of low- and medium-rise housing channelled toward the periphery of the country, rather than the high-rise, high-density concentration that government policy currently encourages. Closely tied to planning for housing, is the strategy to be used in timing the construction of the Highway segments and locating their interchanges. Changing the sequencing of construction of the proposed National Highway to begin in the periphery instead of in the densely populated centre, would encourage development in areas of greater land availability. </jats:p>",

The coordinators were appointed to work with the multidisciplinary teams to improve trustwide discharge planning practice. The team focused on six core objectives: central coordination, open interagency communication, continuing education, patient advocacy, information resource and audit of discharges. Despite the ward staff's early difficulties regarding the nature of the role, the team did begin to collaborate effectively when working alongside all members of the multidisciplinary team and with patients and families. </jats:p>",

Firstly, an understanding of environmental education as a primary source of information was gained through a questionnaire survey mailed to schoolteachers in the South‐West of England. Secondly, questionnaires were distributed to equal numbers of boys and girls aged 7‐11 years at three case schools in the South‐West of England. The sample was asked open‐ended questions about their knowledge of several fundamental environment concerns: the ozone layer; river pollution; recycling; and how they think the environment can be protected. The exploratory study confirms that levels of environmental understanding amongst children are high and provides a full break‐ down of the results.</jats:p>",

Given the press (both practitioner and academic) coverage concerning integrated marketing communications, it may seem self‐evident that the latter alternative is preferred, but a rationale behind this preferstment is advanced. Notably, the shared conventions of the two communications activities constitute the text of their interactions. This sharing, or as we have termed it, a symbiotic relationship, leads in turn to the what can be described as the unity of a marketing communications culture, or its objective (managerial) mind.</jats:p>",

This situation is unlikely to continue; it is becoming increasingly essential for women to make provision for their own post‐retirement income. However available evidence suggests that women are not effectively planning for their retirement and are increasingly at risk of facing a life of poverty in their old age. This research project examines some of the factors that impact on women's capacity to effectively plan their retirement.

To examine cultural differences in planning processes, two instruments are used both with Brazilian and German university students ( n = 38 each) as participants: the Planning Inventory, which consists of everyday problem scenarios, and the Coldstorage, which is a computer-simulated dynamic problem. In the Planning Inventory, Brazilian participants accept the given descriptions and are more optimistic about the results of their efforts. German participants tend to inquire more about the background of the problems and take a more active approach but are less optimistic. In the Coldstorage simulation, the Brazilian participants have more difficulties in controlling the system. This is attributed to their presence orientation, which makes it difficult to detect developmental patterns. The results are discussed following a functional perspective that interprets cognitive processes within their ecocultural context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There is now wide agreement that to develop effective simulations of urban structure, urban models must be explicitly dynamic and must contain mechanisms for linking macrostructure to micro-behaviour. In this paper, the author poses the need to develop simple simulations which emphasise the conditions under which spontaneous growth, such as that which characterises the regeneration of inner cities and the location of edge cities, can be modelled. The model that is presented is based on the integration of positive feedback with the effects of local interaction, all set within a context in which innovations are produced randomly as spatial noise. The framework adopted to make this model operational is based on an extended cellular automaton in which demand for location, conceived of as potential for development, drives the system which responds through the supply of actual development. Various structures for such models are considered. The simulations are set up within a desktop environment by using the package StarLogo as the simulator, DataDesk as the means for exploring model results graphically and statistically, and Avid VideoShop as the moviemaker for simulating the dynamics of locational change. Experiments are conducted which involve systematically varying the weights or parameters of the feedback, interaction, and innovation effects, and then examining how the growth rate of the system interacts with locational change. The model is generalised to other situations where the growth of systems of cities are simulated and where the effects of self-organisation within the simulated patterns of locational change are examined. In essence, the model is able to predict the spontaneous growth of centres but under conditions where there is a high degree of noise or innovation in the system and where the growth rate is also high. </jats:p>",

Also, the overall total of all matrix entries may not be known. This results in a situation in which the generally used RAS method cannot be applied to update the SAM, as the outcomes become unreliable with unknown totals. In this paper a generalised version of the RAS method is developed, based on information theory. This method, which incorporates the RAS method as a special case, is more flexible with respect to necessary information and improves the accuracy of the updated SAMs. In addition to developing a generalised RAS method, we present an easily applied procedure for building SAMs which reduces the time needed to update them. The generalised RAS method and the SAM building procedure are applied to a 1991–92 SAM for Egypt. </jats:p>",

Both of these fields already have a range of standard classification tools which are applied in such situations, but these are hindered by the aggregate nature of the input data. An approach to ‘unmixing’ aggregate data, and thus to revealing the nature of the subunit variation masked by aggregation, is introduced. This approach has already shown considerable success in Earth Observation applications, and in this paper the authors present the adaptation and application of the approach to Census small area statistics data for Southampton, Hants, revealing something of the social composition of Southampton's enumeration districts.

During two months in 1996, planting and pruning programs were also evaluated. We observed an absence of planning and a failure to employ technical approaches in species selection, installation, and pruning. We identified such problems as planting trees of medium size under power lines, use of saplings of poor form, insufficient space for the growth of the trees, lack of fertilization and other cultural treatments, inadequate pruning, and inefficient systems for follow-up monitoring and evaluation. An urban forest management plan was recommended to the city.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The provision of adequate primary health care in developing countries is often troublesome. The problem is to provide a sufficient number of facilities to be geographically accessible, yet few enough to be properly stocked and staffed. In many less developed countries accessibility problems are exacerbated by extensive rainy seasons in which travel is only possible on paved roads. Using the covering tour model we investigate the use of mobile facilities to resolve this dilemma in Suhum District, Ghana. The model minimizes a mobile facility&amp;apos;s travel while serving all population centers within range of a feasible stop. Computational results show that in the rainy season the model cannot provide full coverage; over six percent of the population is beyond a covering distance of eight kilometers. In the dry season, 99 percent of the population can be served by a tour at a covering distance of seven kilometers.Beyond a distance of four kilometers, the dry season problem becomes a trade‐off between the distance traveled by healthcare patrons and mobile facilities. These results illustrate the importance of flexibility of mobile systems: if accessibility cannot be provided in all seasons it may still be provided at favorable times of the year.</jats:p>",

Through the examination of the agents active in that market, and of the economic, social, and institutional frameworks within which these agents operated, the author aims to provide a coherent account of how global economic processes impacting the city interacted with locally specific circumstances to produce a cycle of ‘boom and bust’ which, if it is similar and coterminous with other such cycles elsewhere, is also firmly grounded on social, economic, and spatial processes at national and local levels. Thus, an interpretation is provided of how the growth of the share of services in the city's economy was combined with the high levels of instability of the Brazilian economy to generate a development boom and to produce significant changes in the urban fabric. The author's chief concern is with the nature of the actions of users, investors, and developers, with the sets of social practices shaping their response to market conditions, and with the interactions among wider economic processes, agents' actions, evolving social practices, and the city's spatial structure. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In two of the three experiments that are reported subjects were trained in either a blocked or a random practice schedule and allowed to self-select the amount of time they used to plan an upcoming movement. According to the reconstruction hypothesis (Lee &amp; Magill, 1985) random practice participants engage greater movement planning processes (i.e. action plan re-construction) during acquisition than do their blocked practice counterparts. It was predicted that such reconstructive activity would be manifest as greater study time being used by random practice subjects as they readied themselves for an imminent response. Data from Experiments 1 and 2 supported this study time prediction while also revealing the typical retention benefit associated with random practice. Interestingly, the acquisition benefit often apparent with blocked practice was not evident when the random practice participants were given sufficient time to plan the upcoming response. These conclusions were supported by data from Experiment 3 that involved a direct manipulation of the amount of study time afforded random and blocked practice participants. Taken together, these data are consistent with the suggestion from the reconstruction hypothesis that more time is necessary for intratrial planning processes during random practice formats. Furthermore, acquisition differences that are commonly observed between high and low contextual interference practice conditions may, at least in part, be associated with the completion of the extra planning processes entertained by random practice participants as the movement is being executed. </jats:p>",

The reintroductions rely on local breeding‐cores that are at their holding capacity of 150 deer and 80 oryx. The approach is based on three elements: (1) maximizing the number of animals that can be withdrawn from a permanent breeding core for the purpose of reintroduction using ‘maximum sustained yield’ (MSY) techniques; (2) determining <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic>, using rules‐of‐thumb (such as IUCN Red List Categories), preliminary criteria for project completion; and (3) estimating the time it would take the reintroduced populations to meet the criteria for project completion. I used Monte Carlo Leslie matrix growth models to determine MSY and to project the growth of the reintroduced population. Based on these simulations, the MSY for the fallow deer breeding‐core is 15 adult females in the first year and 12 adult females/year thereafter. The oryx breeding‐core can yield 12 adult females during the first year and 16 adult females every third year thereafter. Project completion was preliminarily set to a wild population of 250 adult deer and 100 adult oryx. The simulations predict that it will take 8–11 years to complete the fallow deer reintroduction and 6–10 years to complete the oryx reintroduction. Post‐release monitoring will help improve the data used in the model and permit re‐assessment of the criteria for project completion.</jats:p>",

The research adds constructively to the large literature on producer services by providing detailed empirical evidence on the key regional variations within a leading growth sector. First, analysis of the survey data illustrates that new-firm formation processes, which vary both quantitatively and qualitatively across Great Britain, underlie the highly uneven spatial distribution of computer service employment. In particular, rates of entrepreneurship, the sector of origin, and the mode of start-up appear to vary regionally, with growth becoming relatively self-generating in the South East where the computer industry as a whole has traditionally been well represented. Second, through an examination of the backward (supplier), horizontal (joint venture), and in particular the market linkages of the surveyed computer service firms, the evidence gained suggests that, although regional, status, and subsectoral variations in the nature of market linkages both are indicative of, and contribute to, uneven development in this sector, backward and horizontal linkages are of less importance. </jats:p>",

There is no ‘natural’ classification of what constitutes ‘rural’ or ‘remote’, and precise definition of what is meant by the term ‘rural’ has proved to be an elusive goal. Nonetheless, it is recognised that the differentiation of rural areas has important implications for healthcare planning and the research that underpins it. Whether it be the development of resource allocation formulae that determine the provision, location and type of rural health services, measuring service utilisation rates as an indicator of need for services or health outcome measures, the way in which populations and communities are delimited as urban, rural and remote will always influence and sometimes may even determine the assessment.

A hierarchical integration scheme that pre serves the modularities of the human interfaces, the motion planners, and the controller has been the key for the successful integration.

The performance of the AMP CT was compared to that of cell culture for endocervical swab and urine specimens from women and urethral and urine specimens from men. Analysis of specimens with discrepant results was performed by a combination of reculture, direct fluorescent-antibody (DFA) staining of specimen sediment, and amplification which targeted a different chlamydial rRNA. A total of 800 urine samples were tested by the AMP CT (607 from women and 193 from men), and 7.1% were positive for\n            <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic>\n            , with a sensitivity of 91.2% and a specificity of 99.6% upon discrepant analysis. A total of 926 swab specimens were tested by culture and AMP CT (717 endocervical swab specimens and 209 urethral swab specimens from men), and 7.7% were positive for\n            <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic>\n            , with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% upon discrepant analysis. The AMP CT is a sensitive and specific nucleic acid hybridization assay for the detection of\n            <jats:italic>C. trachomatis</jats:italic>\n            in endocervical swab specimens from women, urethral swab specimens from men, and urine specimens from men and women.\n          </jats:p>",
