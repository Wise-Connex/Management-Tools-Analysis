      "abstract": "<jats:p> A consistent finding from recent work on the evaluation of planning outcomes has been that local commitment to planning plays a vital role in explaining those outcomes, especially when planning is promoted as a way to address regional development management concerns. While the importance of local commitment is not surprising, many questions remain, such as what “local commitment” means, what motivates it, and how it operates to affect local planning efforts and outcomes. This article presents results from a study of state-mandated local planning in coastal North Carolina during the mid-1990s, focusing on the factors that appear to motivate local elected officials’ commitment to planning and the influence of their commitment on planning outcomes. Taken altogether, coastal localities generally failed to address coastal resource protection through their local planning beyond complying with minimum state resource protection rules. This was largely because of resistance to the imposition of state-level policies through local planning requirements. State mandates appeared to foster local commitment to planning but not the state’s development management goals. Within that context, local elected officials’ commitment to planning played an important role in enhancing both plan quality and plan implementation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents the concept of a spatial landscape grammar. The concept formally draws parallels between the structures of linguistics and the character of real-world landscapes. Landscape grammar can be used to define a landscape's character by using a vocabulary of landscape object types and spatial syntax rules, and these can be used to generate landscape scenes rendered in two or three dimensions through the use of a generative and interpretive production system and modern computing technology. The spatial counterparts of the linguistic concepts of vocabulary and grammar rules are formalized and the basis of the landscape production system is presented. The paper concludes with a short discussion of actual landscape scene generation as a prelude to a companion paper that describes a full implementation of the grammar and interpreter for a residential neighbourhood in Bermuda. </jats:p>",

In recent decades, indigenous claims for land justice and resource sovereignty have posed considerable legal and political challenges for postsettler states. Planning offers an indispensable conceptual and operational lens through which to examine state responses to indigenous claims. The authors use case studies to explore the utility, contribution, and key features of planning undertaken as a means of resolving resource conflicts, enhancing indigenous capacity to regain and manage custodial lands, and developing community autonomy. </jats:p>",

His plans tried to configure environmentally sensitive areas into a green regional infrastructure, directing the desired development to take place within the confines of a “conservative” framework. This ambition reflected a keen awareness of the need to cross the distance between legitimate conservation concerns and the constructive development of future opportunities, trying to make use of the growing public consensus regarding rural conservation as a concrete force within the planning process. </jats:p>",

It is evident that not enough planning has been done. There are various reasons for this, such as the low ethnic and linguistic consciousness of the speakers (particularly in the Veneto region) and the lack of both adequate funding and of a policy that takes economic development seriously into account. Considering the size of the speaking community, its socio-economic situation, the invasive presence of Italian and the lack of resources, the chances for the survival of Cimbrian are not high, particularly in the Veneto region. However, language planning is worth attempting anyway, not only to preserve Italy’s (and the world’s) rich diversity, but particularly for the cultural, social and economic benefits that reversing language shift always entails.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent urban development along the US coasts has negatively impacted the local environment, and these impacts will only increase thanks to rapid regional population growth. Empirical spatially disaggregate land-use models provide a way to explore future conditions and environmental impacts before irreversible changes occur. An assumption of many models is that access to urban-employment centers is the major factor locating urban uses within a region, the opposite of the pattern seen in most natural amenity rich areas. As a result, it is unclear whether models focusing on center accessibility can be used to predict future land-use patterns in urbanizing coastal regions. In this paper the relationship between accessibility and the location of urban development was examined for coastal New Jersey, USA. Two questions were addressed through the analysis: (1) Is accessibility to urban or employment centers correlated with the location of urban conversions? (2) If accessibility is correlated with the location of urban conversion, does the inclusion of such variables into a land-use-change model improve the ability of the model to locate future urban development? Results from the analysis indicate that traditional accessibility relationships can be used to explain the location of urban conversions in New Jersey's coastal region, but inclusion of accessibility and other locating factors does not necessarily improve the predictive ability of a model. The accessibility relationship is contrary to findings in many other high-amenity areas, because, in part, of the importance of access to the region's transportation network. </jats:p>",

The goal was to combine such data with expert knowledge, a set of analytic results, and dynamic modeling approaches to describe, explain, and explore the causes and consequences of land use and cover change (LUCC) in the northern Oriente region of the Ecuadorian Amazon. First, a cellular automaton (CA) model representing LUCC was developed using a time series of remotely sensed Landsat TM images for a 90 000-ha intensive study area within the region and calibrated using alternative images from the time series. The classified images were linked to spatially referenced biophysical and socioeconomic coverages used as input data, and then combined with ‘rules’ derived from empirical analyses. Second, the CA model was used in dynamic simulations to explore LUCC as both causes and consequences of (a) road development, (b) agricultural extensification and land abandonment, (c) major shifts in world markets and crop prices, and (d) urban expansion of the central city within the region. Finally, complexity theory was explored within the spatial and temporal dynamics associated with population – environment interactions, particularly, deforestation, urbanization, and subsistence and commercial cultivation of agricultural crops on lands made accessible by petroleum-company-built roads and the corresponding in-migration of spontaneous colonists beginning in the late 1960s. This research contributes to the study of population – environment interactions in a frontier environment, and examines how dynamic and complex systems can be modeled using CA-based spatial simulations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Self-organization is a prominent theme of complexity studies that has been applied in studies of urban evolution and land-cover change. Little work has investigated the potential of self-organization to describe and explain landscape dynamics in frontier settings. The principal aims of this paper are: (a) to present a general theoretical framework of landscape dynamics for a frontier setting in Rondônia, Brazil based on a specific theory of self-organization known as self-organized criticality (SOC), (b) to describe the settlement pattern of a recently settled landscape by focusing on spatial fluctuations of landscape metrics as signatures, and (c) to discuss how plausible mechanisms with clear links to SOC may be considered by investigators of landscape evolution. A general SOC framework is situated within prevailing frameworks that feature proximate and distant drivers of land-cover change. Fourier techniques are used to assess spatial fluctuations of pattern metrics in multiple directions as landscape signatures. Periodicity and 1/ f signatures consistent with SOC are simultaneously present dependent on directional orientation. Settings where SOC may serve as an important yet ultimately partial framework for pattern-oriented description and process-oriented explanation are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The paper expounds on the challenges confronting institutions of higher agricultural education (HAE) in the context of the significant role of education in alleviating poverty, especially in rural areas, and in light of the changing needs of rural areas and economies. Specifically, HAE institutions are called upon to initiate and lead in articulating a vision for the future that serves the needs not only of agriculture but also of all who inhabit the rural areas. They can step beyond their traditional role by merging forces with other stakeholders to enrich and support other levels of education with critical knowledge and information on agriculture and natural resources management (NRM), the latter being crucial in the pursuit of rural development, poverty reduction, and food security.  To perform an active and constructive role in rural development, agricultural universities need to adjust their programs to accommodate new topics, as well as teaching and learning models; forge new partnerships with schools, academia and rural space stakeholders; expand its representation in governance; and hold continuous dialogue with policymakers. Their extension services could include support to education for rural people that encompasses primary, secondary, vocational, and adult education. University-school linkages are perceived to be illustrative of a decentralized, democratic, and community-based response to rural development problems. It is noted that universities can potentially become showcases of local traditions and knowledge, reflecting the regional, cultural, and ethical traditions of their society, as well as global movements and forces. In reinforcing their roles as contributors to a culture of learning and rural development, it is emphasized that HAE institutions need to engage more directly and more effectively in partnerships and dialogue with other local educational institutions and their surrounding communities. Findings of the ongoing IIEP-UNESCO/FAO program of research on HAE institutions in Asia are expected to provide information on how higher education institutions contribute to learning and rural development, and insights on how their strategic role in this field could be strengthened and further developed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Powerful computational tools are becoming available to represent the behavior of complex systems. Agent-based modeling, in particular, facilitates an examination of the system-level outcomes of the heterogeneous actions of a set of heterogeneous agents: for example, patterns of land-use and land-cover change, such as urban sprawl as a result of residential location decisions. These new tools create new demands for data, and empirical studies of the selection behavior of residents. Using resident responses from the 2001 Detroit Area Study survey, we compared two alternative approaches to characterizing the heterogeneous preferences of agents; both based on a factor analysis of resident responses to questions about their reasons for moving to their current location. We used cluster analysis to identify how many and what types of residents there are, grouped by similar preferences. We also evaluated the relationships between socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and location preferences using regression trees, and evaluated the fit of the relationship to determine the degree to which socioeconomic characteristics predict preferences. The results showed that the preferences of resident exurbans of single-family homes in the Detroit metropolitan area were heterogeneous and that distinct preference groups do exist in resident populations, but are not well characterized on the basis of simple socioeconomic and demographic variables. We conclude that, given the heterogeneous nature of preferences and a relatively limited number of preference groupings observed in the survey respondents, agent-based models simulating resident behavior should reflect this diversity in the population and incorporate distinct agent classes of empirically derived preference distributions. </jats:p>",

The complexity arises from an interplay of several factors, as explained by Herbert Simon's model of bounded rationality, the theory of diffusion of innovations through spatial contagion, the role of personal environmental values and local culture, and simple historical momentum. This complexity can be captured using ‘artificial life agents’ that model land-use choice for individual parcels by considering characteristics and personal beliefs of the owner or operator, physical traits of the land, and information obtained via social networks. Agents are therefore able to consider holistically a large number of factors affecting land-use choice. The creation of agent-based models of human behavior described herein is based upon empirical data on the acceptance of Conservation Reserve Program for the Cache River watershed of southern Illinois (USA). These models are interfaced with a geographic information system to produce a spatial decision support system capable of anticipating the effects of policies that affect land-use decisionmaking on a real landscape and their economic performance. </jats:p>",

The third period (1946–1974), while beset with difficulties, continued the development started in the second period and made some new innovations, especially in poetry. The fourth period (since 1975) has so far been a period in which the novel and experimental poetry have flourished.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The provision of adequate environmental sanitation services to all inhabitants of urban areas in developing countries will not be achieved by the market or “self-help” action alone. There is a need for planning but this planning must be strategic in nature, focusing on the most important issues and allowing for the many uncertainties that are inherent in the current situation. The paper describes the field testing of a strategic planning process in India and subsequent efforts to explore ways of institutionalising the lessons learnt from this experience. It reveals some of the key problems encountered during these activities, in particular the lack of a planning culture among local stakeholders and the consequent tendency to respond to problems in ad hoc ways. Analysis of workshops and training courses suggests that there is a need to develop a more integrated approach to capacity building, with a strong emphasis on the way in which individual activities fit into overall planning and development processes. International development agencies could do more to encourage such an integrated approach to capacity building, planning and implementation. In doing so, they should recognise that, in the absence of a strong planning culture, informed decision making is often constrained by a lack of information. Where this is the case, it is critically important to extend the preparation stage of the project cycle to enable local stakeholders time gather the information required to develop a full understanding of problems and possibilities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper makes the case that customer feedback is a valuable input to a company’s strategy development. The paper also suggests a process for capturing and using this input. By following this process, a company is more likely to identify a strategy in sync with customer and market demands. Closer relationships will also grow between the supplier and customer as a result of the consultative approach to collecting feedback from the customer. The article is based on the author’s experience working with companies to develop fresh information about their businesses before undertaking strategy development. Customers of a company are involved in the market every day and have a different point of view than the company itself. Their observations on issues including new technologies, offerings by competitors, and market demands can help a company prepare for the next threat, or exploit a developing opportunity. The article describes in steps the path to follow if management decides to seek out customers’ views to obtain fresh information for strategic development. By introducing the concept and benefits of strategic customer conversations, and by outlining the steps to take to implement such a system, the reader can now embark on a process of extracting fresh information from customers in order to build or fine‐tune their own strategy. This will help the CEO, VP strategy, head of marketing, or business development head as they plan product, market or service strategies.</jats:p>",

A la vez se exploran las múltiples reacciones a esta negociación por parte de los tejanos locales por un lado y por los gobernantes mexicanos por otro; sucesos que al final estallarían en la revolución tejana.

In doing so, I refer to two periods in time in St Lucia's history. The first is between 1840 and 1957, when the agricultural system of metayage dominated. This example will be used to illustrate a period of time when social transformation was driven by the peasant classes, acting against the power of the plantocracy, giving the peasant class greater control over the means of agricultural production and land. The second period of time I focus upon is the post‐independence period, after 1979, when participatory planning techniques are used by a narrow group of environmentalist elites in order to attempt to implement their vision for sustainable development. The difference illustrates the substantial material and social aspirations within the population, on the one hand, and the narrow concerns of a group of elites on the other.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

A common response to drought in many jurisdictions has been crisis management, especially involving drought relief during or after a drought event. Proactive drought contingency planning, which takes a risk management approach to reduce vulnerability, is much more appropriate. Unfortunately, the extent to which local communities have the capacity to participate effectively in this activity is highly variable. This paper explores factors that facilitate and constrain locally led drought contingency planning and highlights several that relate to management capacity, or the ability of local actors to accomplish their objectives and participate effectively in implementing appropriate drought responses. Drought planning experiences in Australia and the United States are used to frame an evaluation of Ontario's new drought contingency planning approach. We conclude that while Ontario's approach has many desirable features (e.g. organized around watersheds; locally driven), it also has several shortcomings, relating especially to the way in which droughts are understood, coordination of roles and responsibilities and community disempowerment during severe droughts.</jats:p>",

Often, debates on language policy in education suffer from a restricted perspective that elevates socio-political considerations above all others. Assigning secondary importance to language learning constraints and developmental principles of second language learning renders the discussion incomplete and incoherent. Bilingual instructional models need to be based on current research findings that prioritize both an early introduction of content-based second language instruction (immersion), and the development of higher-order language abilities through a language that children understand.</jats:p>",

For the sevenmost frequent words ending in the adjectival suffix -lijk, 40 occurrences were ran-domlyselected from a large database of face-to-face conversations. Analysis ofthe selected tokens showed that the degree of articulatory reduction (as measuredby duration and number of realized segments) was affected by repetition, pre-dictabilityfrom the previous word and predictability from the following word.Interestingly, not all of these effects were significant across morphemes and tar-getwords. Repetition effects were limited to suffixes, while effects of predictabil-ityfrom the previous word were restricted to the stems of two of the seven targetwords. Predictability from the following word affected the stems of all targetwords equally, but not all suffixes. The implications of these findings for models ofspeech production are discussed.</jats:p>",

To evaluate success, we need more comprehensive and case‐specific information on how conservation decisions are made. I report on a database that synthesizes information on 27 marine conservation planning cases from around the world. I collected data on each case's geographic scale, primary planning objective and outcome, legal and institutional context, degree of stakeholder involvement, and the ecological criteria and tools used to facilitate conservation decisions. The majority of cases were located in North and Central America, were regional in nature, and had biodiversity conservation as the primary planning objectives. Outcomes included priority‐setting plans and implementation of marine reserves and other types of marine protected areas. Governments and local nongovernmental organizations led more participatory processes than national and international nongovernmental organizations. Eleven cases considered ecological criteria first, whereas 16 relied on integrated criteria (ecological plus socioeconomic data and other pragmatic considerations) to select priority areas for conservation and management action. Key tools for data integration and synthesis were expert workshops, maps, and reserve‐selection algorithms (i.e., computer‐based tools for priority setting and reserve design). To facilitate evaluation of success, future documentation of marine conservation planning cases should include a standard set of ecological, social, economic, and institutional elements. To develop standards for effective marine conservation, a more diverse set of documented cases is needed; for example, those that failed were located outside North and Central America, focused on the local geographic scale, or were motivated by objectives other than biodiversity conservation.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Michel Foucault’s focus on power relationships has drawn political scientists, political philosophers,and feminists to his texts. His argument which analyses power and discourse takes political analysts beyondstate as the locus of power. In general, his work is important for feminist analyses, especially the threevolumeof historical account of sexuality, because it shares with feminists and intense and critical gaze atsexuality, ‘power and knowledge.’ However, Foucault’s politics of Western sexuality leaves female sexualityinvisible. To complete this historical account of sexuality requires feminist critiques which extend and alterthe analysis to include female sexuality. Thus, the question is not if, but how Foucault should be situated intocontemporary feminist theory. This paper examines four major criticisms that traditional feminists haveargued against Foucault’s understanding of theory-justification, power relations, collective politics, and genderneutrality. We argue that the first three criticisms are undiscovered, but offer an important set of political toolto feminism. For the gender neutrality criticism, we argue that Foucault’s neglect of gender difference in hishistory of sexuality falls short of feminist goals. Finally, feminists should approbate only the aspects ofFoucauldian philosophy that are conductive to gender analysis and move beyond Foucault’s androcentrism tocreate alternative histories of sexuality and opportunities for resistance.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The UK construction industry faces unprecedented skills demands which have been fuelled by sustained sectoral growth and a concurrent downturn in the number of young people entering the industry. However, patterns of supply and demand are not uniform across the country, with regional and local skills shortages being determined by the specific socio‐economic context of the area under consideration. Thus, developing effective labour market policy demands spatially‐oriented labour market information which can be reconciled against industry growth forecasts within a particular region or locality. This paper explores the potential of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in providing such a mechanism for enhancing the labour market planning process. The paper details how GIS can aid construction labour market planning through its ability to integrate disparate labour market information efficiently, thereby placing analysts in a better position to understand specific spatial patterns. A range of datasets were strategically combined in order to reveal regional nuances in labour demand and supply which would be difficult to discern without the use of such a tool. Although the GIS output would need to be considered in combination with a range of other forecasting techniques if robust projects of labour demand and shortage are to be generated, it nevertheless offers an effective decision‐support tool for informing labour market policy in the future.</jats:p>",

Strategic plans were created usually in such a way that everyone understood, not paying attention to quality and real destination. Most of investors choosing places for their investments usually analyse strategic plans and this is one of the critical factors for choosing the place for investments or at least choosing possible variants. At present Lithuanians are starting to understand the importance of sustainable development and the principles of sustainability are being implemented realistically. During this process a lot of obscurities were observed which have conditioned the problematic of the article: misunderstandings of cities’ sustainable development strategic planning principles, in the appreciation of community's involvement importance into strategic management processes, the absence of the united methodology for sustainable development strategic planning processes. Therefore the principles of sustainable development and possibilities for their use in the development processes of cities’ communities are analyzed in this article.\n\n\nSummarizing the principles of sustainable development of cities it is possible to separate three basic stages of strategic planning, which are (1) creation of vision, (2) strategic planning, and (3) implementation of the plan. In every stage there is a management process which is adjusted to new conditions, changed tactics, but doesn't go far from the vision which was formulated by authorities and inhabitants.</jats:p>",

The first is that states should not seek to promote border changes or secessionist movements within other states, or attempt to seize territory by force. The second meaning is the standard idea that within its own borders, within its territory, a state is sovereign. The second of these two meanings has come under increased pressure in recent years, in part in relation to international intervention for ‘humanitarian’ reasons, and even more so since September 11 2001. And yet the other meaning is being stressed even more explicitly, often at the same time and in the same places that the second meaning is being challenged. This paper considers various historical and contemporary examples, and suggests that the two meanings of territorial integrity are increasingly in tension. </jats:p>",

Usually the decision space is not clearly depicted and then systematically explored. Often stakeholders are involved too late and many objectives are neglected. An adaptive DSS is being developed to help overcoming these problems. Core of the DSS is a “decision matrix”, which has been implemented as a web based application (www.wsm300.de). The management objectives are represented by the indicators labelling the rows. They will be the result of a discussion of the objectives and problems in the specific sub-basin, which is supported by the catalogue of indicators. The columns of the matrix are specified by the scenarios whose development is supported by the database of measures and a Geographical Information System (GIS). The matrix, once the labels are defined, serves as a plot for the planning process, defining clearly which objectives have to be considered and which indicator-values have to be calculated. The DSS further includes a concept and tools for the combination of existing software components and supports the processing of model-outputs to indicator-values. Filled with the indicator-values the matrix allows a comparison of the scenarios and provides a good base for a decision. Multi-criteria decision aid methods can (if desired) further help to find the optimal scenario and to mediate between stakeholders. Finding the optimal scenario will likely be an iterative process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper studies the interaction between commuting, job mobility, and housing mobility. Many conventional models assume that the employment location has priority over the residential location and that the latter is adapted to the former. This implies that commutes which start with a job change will often be short lived because of a change in residential location that soon follows. It is also often supposed that the change in residential location is made with the intention to avoid long commutes. In this paper we test the empirical validity of these hypotheses. Our data are a sample of Dutch workers who report changes on the housing and labor market between 1990 and 1998. It appears from these data that both job mobility and housing mobility are often followed by repeat mobility on the same market, but also on the other market. Job mobility indeed triggers residential mobility, but the effect of residential mobility on job changes is of comparable magnitude. Moreover, both types of mobility lead to substantial repeat mobility. We specify duration models that focus on the time during which employment–housing arrangements (hence, commutes) remain unchanged. Estimation results for these models confirm that commutes which start with housing mobility and those which start with job mobility have similar characteristics with respect to induced future mobility. We are unable to find evidence supporting the hypothesis that long commutes resulting from a job change induce additional residential mobility. Another result of the analysis is that workers belonging to dual-earner households are more mobile on both markets than other workers. </jats:p>",

Highlighting the wider figurational contingencies that hinder community attempts to attract mainstream resources through Local Strategic Partnerships, the author concludes by stressing the continued importance of developing inclusive governance structures. </jats:p>",

Using a mail-back questionnaire, the lead planners of state forestry agencies provided information on the types of planning processes undertaken, organizational capacity for planning, perceptions of planning effectiveness, planner training needs, adequacy of federal support for state planning efforts, and important barriers to more effective planning programs. Survey results indicate that state forest resource planning continues to evolve in response to important organizational and economic changes, as well as important changes to the state's forest resource base. Each state's forest resource planning program is unique and influenced by such factors as statutory authority and direction, available resources, and political support for planning. Opportunities to improve state forest resource planning include designing more effective and useful planning processes, increasing the visibility of planning efforts and resultant benefits among decisionmakers and interest groups, strengthening the professional capacity of planners to effectively carry out planning processes, and integrating state planning efforts with federal planning initiatives and programs.North.

The core of the process is a demand planning tool, which allows the combination of quantitative, causal and judgmental forecasting. Finally, some thoughts are given on how SMEs can develop their current forecasting practice when implementing demand planning as a strategic and tactical tool. </jats:p>",

The Roosevelt administration's ‘New Deal’ included government‐sponsored interventions in soil erosion and water management and sophisticated regional development agendas. Reviewing samples of the latter areas of concern, this article explores the proposition that, although the British Empire was scarcely bereft of comparable interwar programmes and was becoming somewhat preoccupied with centrifugal tendencies, persistent porosity, exhausting struggles with postwar reconstruction, and comprehensive economic depression, New Deal evangelism was in fact variously anticipated, harnessed, challenged and ignored.</jats:p><jats:p>A discussion of widely separated national and regional examples locates a layered interplay between uneven imperial and US pulsations, independent local manoeuvres, and critical inputs from key individual agents. The most important filters included the presence of comparatively robust bureaucratic infrastructures and the cultivation of international relationships by scientists and technologists. Encounters with convergent revisionism suggest cautionary leads for students, researchers and teachers alike. Reconstructions of selected contexts underline the presence of familiar posturing, opportunism, and astute patriotic deployment during the emergence of modern styles of globalization.</jats:p>",

This emotiospatial hermeneutic has particular resonance for understanding informal carers' experiences of transitions in the place of care. Yet little work has explicitly addressed the link between emotions, care, and place. That which has focuses largely on community and the home, and largely ignores the transition of care from the home to care-home settings. Drawing on carer narratives from New Zealand, this paper examines how emotion and the affective entity of informal caregiving for frail older people is manifest and experienced as the site of care shifts from the private space of the home to the semipublic space of the residential care home. In doing so, the paper contributes, first, to conceptual debates around the geography of emotions, and, second, to a deeper understanding of how informal carers seek to create new identities for themselves as carers in the new place of care. Finally, drawing on debates around the meaning of home, I consider the extent to which informal carers can feel ‘at home’ caring for their spouse or close family member within care-home settings. </jats:p>",

This rethinking is one of the key themes discussed, along with the political and geographical implications of Heidegger's notion of calculation. In order to situate these insights, I first provide a discussion of the context within which Heidegger wrote the work. After outlining this biographical, intellectual, and political situation, I move to the geographical contributions, suggesting ways in which Heidegger's thought can impact on our thinking of environment, nature, globalisation, and measurement. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we use research into ecotouristic activities in Kaikoura, New Zealand, to discuss how the nonhuman agency of nature is implicated in the performance and meaning of place. Kaikoura has recently boomed as an ecotourist destination, and its changing nature has been coconstituted by the networked agency of whales and dolphins, whose charismatic animal appeal is a magnet for tourists. We discuss the power of representation to conjure up anticipatory ideas about place practices, the influence of mediating and staging tourist performances, and the importance of unconsidered habits and practices in prompting distinctive performances in particular places. Some tourists leave Kaikoura disappointed because the unpredictability of nature can disrupt anticipated experience. Others, however, in partaking in whale watching and swimming with dolphins, are presented with both educational experience and opportunities for relationally achieved connections with cetaceans which can result in intense experiences of immanence and unreflexive glee. This research poses significant questions about the ability of actor networks and relational assemblages to capture fully the power of the nonhuman to evoke sublime emotional and aesthetic relations with humans. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we present a detailed examination of identification codes, their embeddedness in everyday life, and how recent trends are qualitatively altering their nature and power. Developing a Foucaultian analysis we argue that identification codes are key components of governmentality and capitalism. They provide a means of representing, collating, sorting, categorising, matching, profiling, regulating, of generating information, knowledge, and control through processes of abstraction, computation, modeling, and classification. Identification codes now provide a means of uniquely addressing all the entities and processes that make up everyday life—people, material objects, information, transactions, and territories. Moreover, they provide a means of linking these entities and processes together in complex ways to form dense rhizomic assemblages of power/knowledge. At present, however, the information that identification codes provide access to are, at best, oligopticon in nature—that is, they afford only partial and selective views. In the latter part of the paper we outline four trends—wide-scale trawling for data, increased granularity, forever storage, and enhanced processing and analysis—that seek to convert these partial oligopticons into more panoptic arrangements. In turn, we contend that these trends are part of a larger metatrend—the creation of a machine-readable world in which identification codes can be systematically and automatically ‘read’ and acted on by software independent of human control. This metatrend is supported by interlocking discourses such as safety, security, efficiency, antifraud, citizenship and consumer empowerment, productivity, reliability, flexibility, economic rationality, and competitive advantage to construct powerful, supportive discursive regimes. </jats:p>",

Such criticism overlooks how clusters are sometimes a mode of inquiry rather than a specific pattern of industrial location. The desire to promote business clusters is connected to a real phenomenon, but policy needs to acknowledge that exemplar clusters do not provide a role model for how other local economies may develop and that industry and market characteristics affect the significance of clustering. Efforts to promote business clusters in New Zealand show how the perceptions of cluster opportunities by business managers differ from those expected by policymakers. A review of twenty-five cluster initiatives identifies six ways that the projects question widespread opportunity to benefit from encouraging localised business collaboration: (1) value-chain division, (2) conditions on cooperation, (3) the need to go national, (4) facilitator dependence, (5) need for a leader, and (6) missing clusters. Policy intervention should be based on determining how best to work with groups of variable significance and character rather than being driven by idealised interpretations of cluster development. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two‐dimensional (2D) electrical resistivity tomography measurements were conducted with the Iris Syscal R2 resistivity instrument to map the ground resistivity in advance of gas‐pipeline construction in the Risha area, north‐east Jordan. The cost of pipeline construction is strongly dependent on the ground conditions encountered. Accurate prediction of these conditions can reduce the planning risk considerably. The determination of ground conditions reduced the time and cost associated with gaining land access and permission for trenching. It is also served to detect areas of high ground conductivity due to clays or saline soils, which can create conditions in which pipeline corrosion is accelerated. Resistivity measurements were carried out utilizing a Wenner‐array with 1‐m electrode spacing along approximately 52 km of the proposed gas‐pipeline lane. The survey took six days to complete, providing a map of the resistivity of the surficial deposits and the bedrock. The results obtained, based on 2D inversion of field data and borehole information, were interpreted to determine the extent of shallow bedrock, which would require blasting, and deeper overburden, which could be trenched down to the depth necessary for the pipeline. The thickness of the overburden layer along the gas‐pipeline lane in the north‐eastern Jordanian plateau was found to be relatively thin: in the range 0.5– 8 m. The largest values are observed over topographic lows because of the tectonic uplift of the area which leads to fast erosion. Correlation between the field results obtained shows that the overburden depth is the main factor controlling the electrical resistivity of the near‐surface material.</jats:p>",

In equipment intensive industries, these decisions usually need to be made in the presence of both highly volatile demand and long capacity installation lead times. For a multiple product case, we present a continuous‐time capacity planning model that addresses problems of realistic size and complexity found in current practice. Each product requires specific operations that can be performed by one or more tool groups. We consider a number of capacity allocation policies. We allow tool retirements in addition to purchases because the stochastic demand forecast for each product can be decreasing. We present a cluster‐based heuristic algorithm that can incorporate both variance reduction techniques from the simulation literature and the principles of a generalized maximum flow algorithm from the network optimization literature. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this paper I attempt to contribute to the literature through the case of Hong Kong (HK) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in China. I argue that a pattern of MLG has been emerging since the early 2000s in this subnational-level cross-boundary region, accompanied by the gradual institutionalization of economic integration between Hong Kong and the PRD. Decisionmaking competencies in the HK–PRD cross-boundary region have tended to disperse across multiple levels of governments ranging from the central, Guangdong Provincial, HK Special Administrative Region, to municipal, city, and county level of the PRD, as well as businesses and residents on both sides of the boundary. In response to the lack of an effective regional authority and the unique political framework of ‘one country, two systems’, central government has played a somewhat backstage coordinator role in the transition of the integration mechanism and cross-boundary governance. Previous explanations of the integration and governance of the HK–PRD cross-boundary region need to be reevaluated. A regional level authority, similar to the supranational institutions in the EU, is urgently required to foster and upgrade cross-boundary cooperation. </jats:p>",

In this study, as in conventional ones, I treat housing demand and tenure choice as a joint decision. Unlike in conventional studies, however, I argue that some life stages are endogenous and that an individual chooses to opt in or out of some of these stages—to stay single or form a couple, or to raise children. These decisions are correlated with tenure choice and housing demand. I use the census microdata file and set up a system of nine equations: six regimes of housing demand, an equation to explain tenure choice, and two equations to describe life-stage decisions. The result shows that housing consumption is less sensitive to permanent income once the endogeneity of life stages has been accounted for—that is, part of the income effect on housing consumption is due to life-stage decisions. </jats:p>",

Though civil service dispersal has helped ameliorate regional disparities, this has been a secondary objective of relocation programmes. The authors highlight the interconnections between public sector relocation and civil service (re)organisation. In the 1960s and 1970s, relocation formed part of a national programme to accommodate the geographical consequences of the hierarchical and spatially centralised public sector by relocating routine functions from the capital. Today, relocation is part of a coordinated programme of public sector reform which seeks to slim down the central headquarters of the civil service—so that only strategic aspects of policy and management are concentrated in London. In the Lyons review regional development is taken more seriously than in previous programmes of relocation; however, the links between the Lyons review and Gershon's review of public sector efficiency suggests that, in the short term at least, the primary emphasis remains on reducing costs and achieving efficiency savings. </jats:p>",

The architecture of King’s Cross and Piccadilly Circus Underground stations in London is used as the laboratory in which a theoretical discussion on movement and dimensional relations in architectural space is conducted. The two stations are among the most well-known and used in the London Underground system. Observations were made at these highly-used stations in order to establish an overall understanding of the spatial mechanism through social and natural movement. Considering the case studies as both texts and experiences, the article shows that spatial analysis and bodily movement can be explained, compared and put into sets of relations that can be pre-established or scripted during architects’ design activities. It is argued that the concept of ‘script’ [2] can be used bi-directionally in both the design and analysis of architecture. The research and arguments presented in this paper are being developed to form the basis of an application tool. Based on the theory of Relational Syntax, this application tool can be used to process building requirements generated from the design or analysis of a piece of architecture into scripts in order to systematically and aesthetically describe and generate spatial relations in buildings.</jats:p>"

This problem of mix product selection is considered because all the coefficients such as objective, technical and resource variables are fuzzy. This is considered as one of the sufficiently large problem involving 29 constraints and 8 variables. A decision maker can identify which vagueness (α) is suitable for achieving satisfactory optimal revenue. The decision maker can also suggest to the analyst some possible and practicable changes in fuzzy intervals for improving the satisfactory revenue. This interactive process has to go on among the analyst, the decision maker and the implementer until an optimum satisfactory solution is achieved and implemented. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine intertwined modes of bodily evaluation and genetic understanding evident in relation to ‘modernising’ tendencies in contemporary agriculture, using a case study of pedigree cattle breeding. These modes afford different perspectives on the same bodies. Visual evaluation is associated with aesthetic appreciation of physically present animal bodies, and takes on a particular intensity in the ritual of judging during agricultural shows. Statistical techniques of genetic evaluation are concerned to construct numerical estimates of the genetic ‘worth’ or ‘potential’ of an animal, which can stand for the animal and be transported over space and time. In both instances, animals become understood through a series of relationships between material bodies, semiotic practices, social institutions, and spatialities, and both constitute different sorts of assessment of something of the interiority of animal bodies from the outside. Both draw on different practical understandings of bodies and of bodily quality, which are directly related to breeding practices and the production and constitution of new animal bodies. I explore the production of different knowledge practices associated with these modes of evaluation, and examine the interplay and tensions between them. Simultaneously taking into account aesthetic and technical knowledge practices is suggested to be valuable in considerations of the constitution of bodies embedded in specific nature–society relations. Finally, it is suggested that there is evidence for an intensification of genetic discourse in livestock breeding, implying continuing processes of change in the knowledge practices of breeding and in the locus of decisionmaking and relations of power in agriculture. </jats:p>",

The first part comprises a discussion of issues on the need for separating planning and attention and provides evidential validity by reviewing some selected studies. The second part reexamines a factor-analytic study that has questioned the separation of planning and attention processes. The reexamination showed a negligible statistical difference between the proposed three-factor model and the previously established four-factor model. Because the evidential validity of the four-factor model seems reasonably strong, the authors conclude by suggesting that there is little reason to choose the three-factor model that combines attention with planning. </jats:p>",

This paper develops a theoretical distinction between cross‐functional integration and cross‐functionality as it raises people's awareness of the transverse and coupled nature of work process across different organizational units. It aims to test and discuss the impact of ERP implementation strategy (organizational vision, process re‐engineering, the scope of the ERP modules implemented and speed) on cross‐functionality. The methodology is basically based on a survey of 100 French companies, of which the results are further discussed in five case studies. The results show that all previously mentioned factors play significant roles. These roles should be addressed in future research.</jats:p>",

A key assumption of this approach is that estimates of compositional similarity derived from models of similarity in species composition can be used as effective surrogates for real similarity data. We used data on snail distribution in Israel to test this assumption. We used two types of models to analyze patterns of similarity in species composition: one based on presence/absence data and the second based on abundance data. Both models accounted for large amounts of the observed variation in compositional similarity. Variation‐partitioning analysis indicated that a considerable amount of the variation in compositional similarity could be separated into “pure” geographical versus “pure” environmental components, indicating that reserve selection procedures should take into account spatial considerations in determining priorities for conservation. The relative effects of geographical versus environmental factors varied between the two types of models, indicating that different indices of similarity should be used if one wishes to represent species composition per se or ecological communities including their relative species abundances. A comparison of distribution patterns of land snails and land birds in a subset of the study sites revealed a high degree of congruence in compositional similarity between the two groups. Moreover, compositional similarity in snails was a better predictor of compositional similarity in birds compared with all environmental and geographical distances taken together. Models calibrated based on data collected in small plots explained a considerable amount of the variation observed at larger scales, suggesting that sampling efforts required for conservation planning might be lower (and thus, more feasible) than assumed previously. Models of similarity in species composition may serve as an important tool for conservation planning.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Among respondents, 78.7% agree or strongly agree that coordination with other jurisdictions and organizations is important in solving complex community problems. The perceived effectiveness of other jurisdictions and the presence of a revitalized management work culture are important factors associated with the increased use of such planning. </jats:p>",

The combination of the interview content with background information on each of the organisations has highlighted various issues such as the need for greater exposure of enterprises to business opportunities through the promotion of role-model businesses, the need to respond to the specific needs of enterprises in terms of skills and knowledge, and the need for a wider access through a better sectoral and regional coverage. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the analysis to date on the topic of excess commuting and jobs–housing balance deals with total commuting flow, undifferentiated with respect to worker and job characteristics. In this paper we explicitly address the disaggregation issue in terms of job and worker heterogeneity and show how to incorporate such details into the analysis of excess commuting. The objectives of this paper are (1) to develop a trip-distribution model disaggregating journey-to-work data according to type of occupation in order to estimate actual commutes; (2) to develop a disaggregated version of a linear program to measure theoretical minimum and maximum commutes; and, (3) to verify variations in excess commuting and jobs–housing balance according to type of occupation. Results of actual trip-length distributions for each occupation vary from 3.72 to 5 miles for Boise, Idaho, and from 4.27 to 7.78 miles for Wichita, Kansas. Minimum commutes vary from 0.95 to 3.58 miles and from 1.5 to 3.79 miles for Boise and Wichita, respectively. These results imply nonuniform levels of excess commuting and jobs/workers ratios. The proposed models are expected to have a wide range of uses in measurement and assessment of empirical patterns of commuting. The scope of the disaggregation can be extended to other targets, such as different types of industry, household structure, income level, ethnic background, education level, transportation mode, and gender. Further dimensions of disaggregation can address spatial interactions of different socioeconomic groups in urban areas, and, more generally, contribute to exploring urban sprawl according to job characteristics and industries. </jats:p>",

The ability of industrial districts to diffuse knowledge quickly and effectively is frequently mentioned as their major advantage, but the actual process has still to be explored. Issues such as the characteristics of localised economies and the relationship between information flow and knowledge diffusion are discussed. A sample of thirty entrepreneurs was contacted and interviewed in Kastoria, a major furcoat production area and Greece's only authentic industrial district. Major findings suggest that the information needs of SMEs have changed in favour of more external and formal information. The role of various local socioeconomic organisations is subsequently becoming more important in the diffusion and creation of knowledge. Policy implications include the creation of a regional network between all the local actors in the form of a discussion forum, the development of an information centre, the increased use of information technologies, the employment of a specialised workforce from outside the district, and the introduction of training programmes. </jats:p>",

It aims to investigate the degree to which family planning programs enable Africans to shift to western contraceptive use from traditional and null contraceptive practices. It also examines the impact of the programs for both men and women. Data from the 1988 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, the 1988–99 Ghana Living Standards Survey, and the 1988 Ghana Population Census are used. Categorical data analysis techniques are used to analyze these data. This study finds that access to family planning services is associated with reduced family size preferences, increased approval of family planning, and knowledge of, and desire to use, contraception among both men and women in rural Ghana. As Ghana, like many parts of rural Africa, is a highly underdeveloped and pro-natalist area, this article concludes that family planning programs have the ability to influence reproductive attitudes and behavior, even under conditions of limited development. </jats:p>",

Incredulous opponents assert that it does not improve the position of poor people and that it distracts attention from structural inequalities, whereas sceptical believers hold that it boosts social cohesion, and improves the position of powerless groups. The authors provide a framework for understanding these conflicting accounts of the processes and impact of community involvement in area-based initiatives (ABIs). They draw on a review of the relevant literature commissioned by the Home Office. The work is grounded in theories of democracy that claim both developmental and instrumental benefits for participants. A third rationale is found in ‘due process' claims for involvement as a fundamental right. This framework suggests that answering questions about what works in community involvement in ABIs requires an empirical focus on aims, processes, and effects. The evidence shows that believers are justified in being sceptical but optimistic, and that opponents will remain incredulous in the light of weaknesses in the practice and outcomes of community involvement in ABIs. The authors conclude by discussing the implications for policy and future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper considers how national libraries, faced with the new opportunities for access to information provided by the Internet, are having to reassess the audiences they are serving and the way in which they serve those audiences. The historical role of national libraries is being challenged by both new and traditional users who have expectations of fast access to information in their own homes and workplaces. In addition, governments worldwide are under severe financial pressures and expect there to be clear demonstrable returns from the institutions they fund. At the same time, the growth of digital material poses a significant challenge for collection policies. The paper argues that national libraries must set strategic directions that take account of this changing environment, and suggests that seeing strategic development in terms of a series of strategy waves can aid understanding of where resources are being allocated. The author describes the ‘value innovation’ approach to assessing how well an organization matches its capabilities and performance against the needs of its chosen user groups. The importance of developing key performance indicators is stressed, and the use of the ‘balanced scorecard’ methodology for managing strategy implementation is described. </jats:p>",

Literature relating to industry clusters and Internet portals is examined to identify the beneficial features associated with portals and clusters. The paper makes a link between portal benefits and those typically associated with industry clusters, with the subsequent implications for policy. The study found that the winery business experience after portal implementation enhanced relationships between small wine producers, resulting in outcomes that included resource sharing, informal knowledge exchanges, and innovative practices that resulted in new product development. Indeed, these types of benefits tend also to be reported in successful clusters. Moreover, the authors argue that government policy may achieve more favourable outcomes in promoting e-commerce and Internet adoption in regional areas by identifying established business clusters (more so than ad hoc related groups) that can use their already established relationships quickly and appropriately to leverage the business benefits associated with new technologies. </jats:p>",

Each patient first underwent whole‐brain axial fluid‐attenuated‐inversion‐recovery (FLAIR) MRI (3 mm slice thickness, no spacing), followed by three‐dimensional (3D) MRSI measurements (TE/TR: <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8497-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8497:mp8497-math-0002\" />) of a user‐specified volume encompassing the extent of the tumor. The nominal voxel size of MRSI ranged from <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8497-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8497:mp8497-math-0003\" /> to <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8497-math-0004.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:0094-2405:media:mp8497:mp8497-math-0004\" />. A system was developed to grade the tumor using the choline‐to‐creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios from each MRSI voxel. The merged MRSI images were then generated by replacing the Cho/Cr value of each MRSI voxel with intensities according to the Cho/Cr grades, and resampling the poorer‐resolution Cho/Cr map into the higher‐resolution FLAIR image space. The <jats:sc>FUNCTOOL</jats:sc> processing software was also used to create the screen‐dumped MRSI images in which these data were overlaid with each FLAIR MRI image. The screen‐dumped MRSI images were manually translated and fused with the FLAIR MRI images. Since the merged MRSI images were intrinsically fused with the FLAIR MRI images, they were also registered with the screen‐dumped MRSI images. The position of the MRSI volume on the merged MRSI images was compared with that of the screen‐dumped MRSI images and was shifted until agreement was within a predetermined tolerance. Three clinical target volumes (CTVs) were then contoured on the FLAIR MRI images corresponding to the Cho/Cr grades. Finally, the FLAIR MRI images were fused with the simulation CT images using a mutual‐information algorithm, yielding an IMRT plan that simultaneously delivers three different dose levels to the three CTVs. The image‐fusion protocol was tested on 12 (six high‐grade and six low‐grade) glioma patients. The average agreement of the MRSI volume position on the screen‐dumped MRSI images and the merged MRSI images was 0.29 mm with a standard deviation of 0.07 mm. Of all the voxels with Cho/Cr grade one or above, the distribution of Cho/Cr grade was found to correlate with the glioma grade from pathologic finding and is consistent with literature results indicating Cho/Cr elevation as a marker for malignancy. In conclusion, an image‐fusion protocol was developed that successfully incorporates MRSI information into the IMRT treatment plan for glioma.</jats:p>",

However, their repeated examination is intricate because of methodological constraints such as practice effects and loss of novelty. We investigated to what extent the circadian timing system and the sleep homeostat influence PFC‐related performance in differently difficult versions of a single task. Parallel versions of a planning task combined with a control group investigation were used to control for practice effects. Thirteen healthy volunteers (five women and eight men, range 57–74 years) completed a 40‐h sleep deprivation (SD) and a 40‐h multiple nap protocol (NAP) under constant routine conditions. Each participant performed 11 easy and 11 difficult task versions under either SD or NAP conditions. The cognitive and motor components of performance could be distinguished and analysed separately. Only by thoroughly controlling for superimposed secondary factors such as practice or sequence effects, could a significant influence of circadian timing and sleep pressure be clearly detected in planning performance in the more difficult, but not easier maze tasks. These results indicate that sleep loss‐related decrements in planning performance depend on difficulty level, and that apparently insensitive tasks can turn out to be sensitive to sleep loss and circadian variation.</jats:p>",

This case is notable as an illustration of the capacity of natural resource management planning, through negotiation within a formal process, to extinguish native title. Importantly, the personal experiences of two senior Aboriginal people provide an insight into a situation designed to enhance interactions between government and community, with the overt intention of improving natural resource management. However, the record of this personal experience indicates that the communication was less than satisfactory and that the outcomes, at least in terms of the experiences recorded here, of the individual senior Aboriginal community members, was less than satisfactory. We conclude that, despite best intentions, there is an important lack of provision for community influence or power, including any legal or administrative institutional framework. We also conclude that there are important institutional and social processes of engagement still to be developed, including ways of engaging the community more widely that has conventionally been the case.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors use international business strategy and regional development literature to inform a set of propositions about the links between direct employment by foreign-owned subsidiaries in the manufacturing sector and the development of embeddedness and autonomy in these subsidiaries. A large-scale survey of French, German, and US manufacturing subsidiaries in the United Kingdom is used to test the importance of embeddedness (host-country sourcing and use of networks) and autonomy (decisionmaking and operational autonomy) for the growth of employment by foreign-owned subsidiaries and the growth of skilled jobs in such subsidiaries. The results indicate that growth of embeddedness and autonomy factors are important, especially for the growth of skilled jobs, but those subsidiaries that have this attribute are a minority of foreign-owned subsidiaries. In the light of these results, the authors argue that policies need to be geared towards developing embeddedness and encouraging the growth of autonomy in subsidiaries that are likely to be regarded as central to the overall objectives of multinational corporations (MNCs). This requires policymakers to be aware of the internationalisation strategies used by MNCs, particularly in the light of the emergence of new, low-cost, countries which can easily provide high-quality but low-cost manufacturing operations. An important conclusion is that simple promotion of networking among firms and supporting agencies, and attempts to improve the local asset pool are unlikely to be effective in most cases. </jats:p>",
