The planning project, electrical self-sufficiency in harmony with community values on the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i, is then described. The educational format is discussed as a practicum incorporating the assistance of expert consultants, commu nity residents, and statewide agencies and organizations. The methodological approaches of multidimensional scaling and time series are explained, followed by data analysis and presentation instruction Finally, applications to planning for this community as well as implications for the future of social impact assessment are discussed </jats:p>",

The findings indicate that property tax rates and the existence of a local tax abatement program do not influence the generation or location of new firms within the region Instead, there is evidence that wage rates, the size of the pool of potential entrepreneurs, localiza tion economies, distance from a labor force, and urbanization economies in a county influence where new firm births will occur </jats:p>",

However, the small order placed by retailers makes the difference between the sale to retailers and the sale to consumers (the retail) trivial. Hence, sellers (manufacturers or wholesalers) wish to receive retailer information of the sale to consumers. On the other hand, the small order increases physical distribution costs. In an attempt to avoid these increased distribution costs, manufacturers use wholesalers who deal with many kinds of commodities. In this case, manufacturers, who still expect to have retailer information, should also be connected on‐line by electronic computer systems with the wholesalers, who record sales of commodity items to each and every individual retailer. This is the practice of a Japanese butter‐processing manufacturer.</jats:p>",

Adverse reservoir waterflood characteristics were identified before unitization, and laboratory work was undertaken to demonstrate the benefits of reducing water mobility by increasing water viscosity with polyacrylamide polymers. Computer simulations polyacrylamide polymers. Computer simulations incorporating polymer properties from laboratory work and known Caddo waterflood performance were used to design the polymer flood slug size and polymer concentration. Three injection tests were conducted to determine polymer injectivity. Pressure transient tests were used to polymer injectivity. Pressure transient tests were used to measure the in-situ polymer viscosity. One of the injection tests included an off-pattern producing well that permitted an estimation of polymer retention and incremental permitted an estimation of polymer retention and incremental oil recovery in a short time. On the basis of injection tests and simulation work, a large-scale polymer project was implemented. The optimum slug size required 30 million lbm [0.17 kg] of emulsion polymer. Facilities used to mix and feed this large amount of polymer are described. A low-shear polymer flow control method was developed to ensure maximum fluid viscosity at the formation perforations. Product specifications were verified before accepting delivery, and injection fluid quality was monitored in laboratories constructed for the project. Early production response to field-wide polymer injection is comparable to that observed at the off-pattern producing well during the injection test. While the early field producing well during the injection test. While the early field response is encouraging, the effects of saltwater injection on slug integrity and increased pattern size on oil recovery are still to be determined.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The 3,900-acre [15 782 805-m 2 ] Eliasville Caddo Unit, operated by Sun E and P Co., is a Caddo reef pool in the Stephens County regular field in Stephens County, TX (Fig. 1). The field was discovered during Jan. 1920 and produced 7,459,000 bbl [118 590 m3] of solution gas- produced 7,459,000 bbl [118 590 m3] of solution gas- drive primary oil through 1975. Caddo waterflood operations in Stephens County were initially undertaken during the 1960's but high water-cut oil production in the absence of a stabilized oil bank was disappointing. Mobil Oil Corp. was the first to attempt to improve Caddo waterflood performance with polymer. Mobil conducted an unpublished pilot polymer flood in the Curry Unit during 1969. The pilot was expanded to the majority of the unit in 1973. During 1973, Texaco conducted pilot Caddo waterflood and polymer flood tests in the Parks Ranch Unit; neither test was expanded. The Mobil and Texaco tests were conducted before the advent of government-sponsored EOR incentive programs. A decision to form the Eliasville Caddo Unit was reached, and water injection began March 1977. A study undertaken in 1976 indicated that increasing the displacing fluid viscosity would improve the pore-to-pore, areal, and vertical sweep efficiencies.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Reservoir Description</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Caddo lime is a lower Pennsylvanian age reef formation found at 3,200 ft 1975 ml at Eliasville. Lithologically the rock is described as a randomly fractured, finely crystalline, styolitic tan limestone with vugular and in tergranular porosity. Oil is trapped by the overlying Strawn shale. Porosity determined by log analyses averaged 13.2%, air permeability averaged 11 md, varying from 0.1 to 234 md. Typical Caddo development is illustrated in Fig. 2 by the interpretation of the logging response for Well 132. Currently, production is confined to the upper interval. Oil/water relative permeability curves depicted in Fig. 3 represent the two-phase flow characteristics. Notice that small increases in water saturation can result in rapid increases in water mobility and accompanying decreases in oil mobility. Oil moves very slowly once water breaks through in this rock. The family of representative capillary pressure curves in Fig. 4 have been converted from an pressure curves in Fig. 4 have been converted from an air/brine system to a reservoir oil/water system at room temperature. The 39 degrees API [0.83 g/cm3] paraffinic crude has a dead oil viscosity of 3 cp at 115 degrees F [0.003 Pas at 46 degrees C]. Oil/water interfacial tension is 15 dynes/cm [0.000002 N/m] and the advancing contact angle on glass is about 112 degrees, indicative of the wettability found in many carbonate reservoirs.

The fascination stems from the idea that rent holds the key to urban spatial structures and distributional conflicts. The repulsion is based on bemusement at the complexity and jargon of the rent literature and rejection of rent's assumed centrality. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper the author surveys the urban rent literature and presents an alternative interpretation of the role of urban rent. It is suggested that the ambiguous theoretical status of urban land rent stems from an overemphasis in the rent literature on the distributional implications of rent mechanisms at the expense of their potential influence on the social relations of building provision. </jats:p><jats:p> The neoclassical economics model of urban rent and land use is critically evaluated and the extensive attempts to apply Marx's theory of rent to the urban situation are questioned. The ability to revive Marxist urban rent theory through the treatment of rent as a component of structures of building provision is then elaborated by reference to housing provision and office development. When placed in such a historical context, it is suggested, rent takes on a more meaningful, if less messianic, role. </jats:p>",

Research conducted around five advertisements (each different) in four cities (Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow and Newcastle‐upon‐Tyne) indicates that a minimum campaign weight of 15 per cent is necessary to ensure adequate repetition across all population sectors for an eight‐week duration. Bus sides require their own creative treatment, the characteristics of the medium (moving display, size limitations and, possibly, bus colour) must be considered. No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding effectiveness of the three different types of bus‐side advertising (side, superside and T‐shape) but advertisers should beware of “losing” elements presented on the stalk of the T. Buses are effective as a solus medium and as part of a multi‐media campaign; they can act as “reminder” advertising, carry emotive messages, link product and retail outlets in the city in which they operate, and they can also brand.</jats:p>",

After a slow initial start-up cycle, 19 Noise Exposure Maps or Noise Compatibility Programs have now been submitted, and 11 maps and 5 programs have received approval. Federal grants have been issued to 19 airports to develop noise compatibility programs or to implement approved programs. Some 22 programs are expected to be submitted during fiscal year 1985.

An example of such a contextual adjustment is the duration difference in CVC syllables, where the voiced portion of the syllable is longer if the final C is voiced, and shorter if the final C is voiceless. In an error-elicitation experiment using tongue twisters, ten instances were observed where final consonants exchanged, e.g., “dig duck”→“dick dug,” “pack pig”→“pag pick” etc. When these 20 syllables were compared with correct control utterances produced by the same speakers, 19 showed durations of voicing appropriate to the segment that was introduced by error, and one was equivocal. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that segmental interaction errors occur earlier in production planning than at least some phonetic processes, and that these processes then apply to error segments and correct target segments alike.

The argument presented in this paper is that the process cannot adequately be understood in such terms. Some recipient locations are not especially environmentally attractive, and in other cases decentralisation has been to sizeable urban as well as rural locations. Three European regions, South Wales (United Kingdom), Emilia—Romagna (Italy), and Aveiro (Portugal), are chosen as representative of the different kinds of area to which industry has been decentralising. In each case, metals-based (often engineering) industry has been a prime decentraliser. The reasons for this include technical change enabling economies of scale to be achieved in small productive units, the search for lower production costs, social characteristics of the work force, and product-market factors. </jats:p>",

It is shown how a determinate pattern of industrial organization grows out of the labor process. The problem of the integration and disintegration of productive activities is dealt with. Functional disintegration is shown to lead to the formation of polarized complexes of productive activity. The human consequences of the emergence of such complexes are described. In particular, brief discussions are presented of (1) local labor markets, (2) the reproduction of the labor force, and (3) the development and meaning of a local political culture. The inner decay of productive complexes is then shown to proceed on the basis of internal changes within the industrial system. These same changes lead to a decentralization of units of capital and to the emergence of a new spatial/international division of labor. The paper concludes with a brief allusion to the historical emergence of the global city. </jats:p>",

By analyzing staff time across the components of an early childhood program, one can analyze both program operations and their costs.

By mid 1983, six such programmes were operational, each supported by a foreign donor and implemented by the Government of Kenya. Six years after the detailed planning of the first programme began, the record looks patchy. District level planning and co‐ordination hold promise, and some programme activities are going well. However, problems of slow and cumbersome planning and mobilization, a lack of community involvement in planning, too few technical successes, and remote prospects for institutionalizing the programmes if and when expatriate support is withdrawn are apparent. Behind these problems lie a number of basic obstacles, including the structure and orientation of the government's lack of support for the drylands among politicians, and the technical difficulties of raising dryland production. Faced with these obstacles, the ASAL programmes look set to run into continuing problems. Overcoming them will depend on both the success of recent government moves to deconcentrate, and patient support from both the government and the donors. Historically the prospects for such support are poor.</jats:p>",

Agencies seeking to abate it face the prospect of dealing with hundreds of potential abatement projects, stretching decades into the future. A systematic regional analysis is necessary to establish locations, objectives, priorities, and phasing of such projects. The U.S. Bureau of Mines developed a novel procedure for abatement planning in the 420 square mile Blacklick Creek Watershed in Pennsylvania. The plan sought to direct abatement projects toward pollution sources where degradation was worst and adverse effects greatest. It established abatement priorities by comparing the “supply” of sources to be reclaimed (the degrees of old mines' water quality degradation) with the “demand” for abatement to be done (the natural and cultural values represented by the region's demography, land use and other non‐mining characteristics). Matrices were used to define the relationships among mining and non‐mining factors; maps were developed to show the geographic distribution of the conclusions. The locations, priorities, and phasing of abatement objectives shown on the maps should provide guidance for any abatement effort, no matter what type of technology is applied to achieve the objectives. Over the many years in which abatement projects are to be performed in the Watershed, the plan can be used to define, coordinate, and establish priorities for the projects in a manner that can result in maximum abatement benefits from the application of limited funds.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent research has indicated that production system models of sequential decision-making can be both highly predictive of behavior in computer-simulated environments and related to cognitive knowledge structures. The authors present evidence from a study of housing market search indicating that ‘real-world’ behavior is related to behavior in computer-simulated environments and to the behavior predicted by production system models. Hence the use of computers to infer models of decisionmaking from behavior in computer-simulated environments promises to offer valuable insights into real-world decisionmaking behavior. </jats:p>",

Quabbin Reservoir, located in central Massachusetts, served as a case study for the model. An interdisciplinary research team was formed to study the impact of selected recreation activities on water quality, public demand and willingness to pay for selected recreation activities, carrying capacity constraints, and the economic cost/benefits associated with increases in recreation at the Quabbin Reservation. Study variables were integrated into a quadratic programming model, producing the number of participants that corresponds to maximum net benefits for specific development packages on design days.</jats:p><jats:p>The recreation mix associated with maximum net economic benefits was found to be cost‐effective (assuming the use of reasonable entrance fees) and not deleterious to water quality. However, as a result of the findings of a related study, it was recommended that nutrients, particularly from wastewater, not be permitted to enter the reservoir, since the current phosphorous level may be at a critical point. Management techniques that would safeguard against this occurrence were recommended. The model was sensitive to management objectives; recommendations were limited to activities that would not lower the existing high quality of Quabbin water.</jats:p>",

Water resources <jats:italic>policies</jats:italic> not only distribute <jats:italic>social, economic, and physical benefits</jats:italic>, they also have <jats:italic>redistributive, regulatory, and social effects. The federal government</jats:italic> is not capable of leadership in all four policy areas. Neither, however, are <jats:italic>localities or the states.</jats:italic> Planners, therefore, need to develop a viable mix of policy responsibilities so that each level has primary authority over the type of policy it is best suited to develop and implement. Analysis of the capacities of each level of government indicates that the federal government should provide regulatory objectives through such legislation as the <jats:italic>Clean Water Act</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Safe Drinking Water Act</jats:italic>, and provide support for state redistributive efforts through a restructuring of water resources <jats:italic>grants‐in‐aid</jats:italic> to reward states that improve their policy planning capabilities.
