For the ever-pregnant women who intended no more children, 32 percent of the exposed were number failures and 62 percent of the rest were timing failures. For the ever-pregnant women who intended more children, 67 percent of the exposed were timing failures. Women not exposed to the risk of timing failure because they claimed to want all of their pregnancies as soon as possible had similar characteristics to women reporting failures; accordingly the reliability of their reports is suspect. The probabilities of failure are well-patterned by race, religion and education: higher for Blacks than for Whites; within the latter, higher for Catholics than for Non-Catholics; and inversely related to education, except among White Catholics. Although uniformly high, the proportions classified as failures are probably under-estimates of the true values for completed families, because of misreporting and continuing exposure to risk, subsequent to interview.</jats:p>",

Moreover, it provides a fairly consistent baseline with which to allocate and redeploy the hospital staff for the purpose of strengthening existing hospital programs and establishing new ones such as direct‐care services, physical therapy, geriatric social services, social remotivation, and community placement. Since its introduction, 30 per cent of our geriatric inpatient population have been returned to the community. 3) The GPI brings professional roles into sharper focus and delineates professional responsibility more clearly. It enhances communication between staff members at all levels because it lessens the use of professional jargon by providing a clear and concise nontechnical summary of the patient's situation, thereby minimizing the communication impediments often found in large organizations. It has antedated, and thus placed the hospital in early compliance with the Utilization and Review requirements of Medicare, Title XVIII. Its predictive quality has facilitated the development of new programs addressed to the needs of the elderly patient (Title XIX). It has also tended to refine staff thinking, in that it makes practitioners defend their diagnostic positions and clarify their concepts of practice.</jats:p>",
