A substantial increase in political turmoil could lead to Chun's refusal to leave office or a military coup. It could also threaten the staging of the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, which in turn would reverse the country's current economic trend. If open elections were held, the DJP and the NKDP would have about the same chance of winning. An NKDP regime, however, would be more restrictive toward international business and trade than the current government.</jats:p>",

Among them was Jon Nixon, currently research fellow in the Division of Education at Sheffield University, who now continues the debate with an article in which he provides a broader perspective, presenting a functional rather than theoretical model of classroom practice. This, he suggests, takes a three-dimensional form: drama as social interaction, as discourse, and as a mode of cognition – or what he calls the ‘depth dimension’ which ‘complements our various ways of knowing’. He concludes that drama should not by necessity be consigned to the margins of ‘the arts’, but be recognized for the vital role it can play not only in the whole humanities cirriculum but, crucially, in the cross-curricular development of communication and expressive skills.</jats:p>",

The main features of the Tinbergen model, including the balance-of-payments equilibrium, are then applied to an urban system with a fundamentally different spatial structure and distinct pattern of trade flows. It is demonstrated that the size distribution of centres within this alternative model can also be derived in terms of an export-base formulation. After a discussion of trade flows and trade balances among the hierarchical levels of the alternative model, several extensions are introduced. These extensions, which deal with specialised (noncentral) goods and with extraregional trade, are examined individually and their collective impact is then considered. Finally, consideration is given to the possibilities for further development of the approach. </jats:p>",

The discussion will first focus upon the relevant changes in the world economy in the postwar period, their spatial ramifications, and the theoretical constructs which have arisen out of this new economic and industrial geography. The paper will then proceed to an outline of the effects of these changes on Wales in the form of the foreign investment in the region and the attendant industrial restructuring which has occurred. The central theme of the paper is a plant-based qualitative analysis of the effects of this new spatial division of labour in Wales. The final section is a discussion of the creation and reproduction of uneven development that such a spatial division of labour can create. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A welfare-maximization framework for the allocation of a given housing supply to urban submarkets is formulated. The approach is founded on a stochastic equilibrium model for the housing submarkets, the demands of which are based on generalized extreme value choice models. This allows the random utilities associated with different submarkets to be statistically dependent. The deterministic part of the utilities includes the submarket rent levels together with disutility measures related to the local population densities. This latter aspect can be regarded as a kind of spatial externality usually neglected in urban modelling. The optimization is performed with respect to a welfare criterion derived as the aggregated expected utility accruing to utility-maximizing households at normalized equilibrium rents. Since these rents are implicit functions of the policy variables, that is, the submarket housing supplies, the welfare maximization is not straightforward. However, as a main result it is shown that if the population density disutilities satisfy a convexity condition, the unique welfare-maximizing housing allocation can be found by solving a dual unconstrained convex minimization problem. Finally, the relationship with entropy maximization is clarified and the applicability of the framework to the joint choice of residential location and travel mode is demonstrated. Two examples of nested multinomial logit models illustrate the potential use of the approach. </jats:p>",

This problem has been exacerbated where improvements to the model have involved extra parameters to be estimated. In this paper it is shown that calibration of quite complex models can be achieved through modification of the conventional ‘gravity’ model to a generalised linear model with Poisson error structure and logarithmic link function. Data on observed trips between fifteen residential zones and eighty-three shopping destinations in Cardiff are used to test several models through application of the GLIM computing package. Models involving extra explanatory variables, origin-specific distance-decay parameters, and competing-destinations terms are all shown to offer worthwhile improvements in performance over the conventional singly-constrained model. An individual-specific model is also tested for a small sample of shoppers. Finally, some comments are made concerning the relevance of the Cardiff findings and the wider significance of these methodological advances. </jats:p>",

The Canadian example indicates that even where these factors do not exist, policy is not necessarily more enlightened. The one exception is within Quebec, where an alternative perspective is operative which questions just how abundant the province’s food resources really are. Quebec’s experience illustrates that North America’s poor record on land use planning is not due mainly to legal concepts and structures, but rather to more traditional weaknesses of planning policy — the absence of nerve, vision, and commitment. </jats:p>",

Recent shifts towards a world-economy perspective have helped to reorientate our sights beyond the Straits of Dover, but have tended to concentrate on the more obviously relevant countries such as the United States of America, the European Economic Community, and Japan. Meanwhile, the amount of work on other, poorer, parts of the world seems to be decreasing. This is unfortunate partly because there are important issues concerned with development and poverty which need to be studied and about which we can perhaps contribute solutions. But, still more vital is the perspective that historical and international comparisons provide; perspective that is often lacking in work that is currently relevant. Sometimes the experiences of very different societies offer warnings about how to tackle a current problem at home. We need more, theoretically informed, work on the great overseas.

The issue here concerns the electoral performance of two unions, the United Auto Workers union and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union, over the period 1970–82. Relevant descriptive variables include location, scale, sector, state right-to-work legislation, and local economic variables. Two arguments are advanced. First, there are parallels between the electoral performance of US unions, and the partisan political process. Forces of electoral fragmentation evident in the partisan political process are mediated, however, by institutional factors relating to the organizing strategies of unions. Second, it is observed that there are significant differences between the unions, especially with respect to the patterns of their electoral successes and failures. These patterns, and their associations with local economic factors, are illustrated through a series of multivariate analyses of variance. Definitive tests of hypothesized causal relationships are left to a subsequent paper. </jats:p>",
