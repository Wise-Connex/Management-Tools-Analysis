Building on a pair of seminal papers by Krueckeberg (1984, 1985) and recent literature on academic unit leadership, this paper presents a descriptive and analytic overview of the planning academy and compares and contrasts leadership in planning education units against a situational model of academic leadership. The paper concludes with an agenda of possible research and programmatic directions designed to advance the intellectual field of planning thereby enhancing its institutional maturity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mainstream local development policy in the 1980s is moving towards practices that are undemocratic and rest on an inadequate theoretical base. The increasingly popular concept of a public-private partnership is institutionalizing corporate domination over local government policy. This corporate domination is reflected in local policy trends towards reduced government regulation of business, antiunion practices, and efforts to transform the urban environment to meet the needs of corporate accumulation. These problems are compounded by the inadequate theoretical basis of mainstream policies, which are based on neoclassical theories of location and comparative advantage and on a revival of uneven development and growth pole theories of the 1 950s and 1960s. These theories, and the policies they inform, are ill-suited to deal with the new forms of spatial and internal organization being adopted by corporations in response to a new international division of labor. These deficiencies in theory and policy suggest that there are areas where leftist or alternative policies that promote a more democratically controlled local economy might be applied. </jats:p>",

The former is manifested by population increase, physical expansion, concentration of institutions, and administrative centralization. The latter is indicated by rapid accumulation of wealth and capital by a tiny layer, poverty of most of the population, and spatial segregation of social classes. These phenomena reflect the transformation from a pre-capitalist city in the 18th through the early 20th century to a transitional capitalist city in the 1920–1950 period, and to a dependent capitalist city after the 1950s. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Many African cities are currently marked by the decline of the formal urban economy and the simultaneous upsurge of household cultivation by the urban poor. This has generated two types of critical responses, though for very different reasons. The modernization proponents view urban cultivation as a manifestation of rural habits, predominantly relied upon by recent migrants lacking integration into the urban economy and culture. The New-Marxist critics, on the other hand, blame such activities for contributing to the “double exploitation of labor” and for maintaining the status quo of capitalist social relations of production. This paper, based on a survey of 250 low-income households in Zambia, attempts to respond to both criticisms. First, it demonstrates that the modernization proponents' assumption regarding who cultivates and why are basically incorrect. The paper then provides evidence that urban cultivation is an innovative response from below which was initially strongly resisted by capitalist countries. The paper also argues that urban cultivation by the poor reduces their vulnerability to the fluctuations of fortune that currently beset the economies of African cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper analyzes the socio-economic and political factors accounting for the spatial structure of Metropolitan Rio de Janeiro. Urban services and facilities, as well as upper- and middle-class housing are concentrated in the core. The most poor are segregated to poorly equipped peripheral areas. To the extent that access to urban services is considered a component of real income, spatial segregation reinforces income concentration, a feature of the region's process of economic development. </jats:p><jats:p> The paper analyzes how state intervention has contributed to this pattern by concentrating investments in the core and immediate periphery, and relocating squatter settlers to suburbs. The state has adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards the periphery, where speculative land subdivision had provided a viable, yet inequitable, housing alternative for the poor. Low-income groups have fought to improve their lot, pressuring against favela removal and for urban improvements in their neighborhoods. They have also used the system to their advantage by becoming petty landlords or land speculators. Although these may be viewed merely as “coping strategies,” their conservative or revolutionary potential is a matter to be assessed empirically. </jats:p><jats:p> Likewise, whether state policies will be repressive, distributive, or even redistributive cannot be stated beforehand. These policies are shaped not only by structural forces, but also by the political context and the views of government employees. </jats:p>",

The current paper interfaces these data with previously developed solutions to address the problem of financing PHC services within the nine LICs. The solutions were recommended by a methodology developed and implemented by two of the authors.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Dispersant use is most effective in the early stages of an oil spill, yet because there is thought to be so much case-by-case variation, decisions about whether and where to use dispersants have been made only after a spill occurs. These decisions require, at a minimum, hours, and may require days. Two major efforts to shorten this decisionmaking process have recently been completed. A multidisciplinary, multiagency task force under the auspices of the American Society for Testing and Materials developed ecologically based guidelines for dispersant use in marine environments. The guidelines for 13 different marine and coastal habitat types consider dispersant use both to protect and to clean the habitat. They also identify those habitats that should be most protected in the event of a spill. These guidelines should be useful references for regional response teams and other spill response planners as they develop site-specific dispersant use plans. The second project was developed by an American Petroleum Institute task force and contractor with input from federal and state government agencies. It is a site-specific method for planning whether to use dispersants in marine environments. It divides an offshore region into “dispersant use zones” based on ecological considerations. The method was applied to selected areas offshore southern California as a test.</jats:p>",

We promised a subsequent article drawing lessons from planning experience which might contribute to improving the international manpower planning process. This, belatedly, is that follow‐up article. In it we review the status of manpower planning in developed, newly industrialising and labour‐short, less developed countries (LDCs). Then we report criticisms which have been levelled at national manpower planning in labour‐surplus LDCs, explain what we see to be the reasons for what has been criticised, identify lessons and make recommendations which we believe will skirt many of the problems identified.</jats:p>",

Applications can be found in communication networks and production facilities. The models include costs of expansions, conversions, excess capacities and capacity shortages, and assume cost functions that are either linear or concave. We find the optimal solution by exploiting properties of extreme flows in networks and employing a dynamic programming algorithm. Specializing our results permits us to obtain different model variations by imposing certain conditions on the cost functions, and to derive the computational complexities for these variations. Typically, applications require extensive sensitivity studies that may use up substantial computer resources. Our analysis unifies previous work, extends the results, and provides intuition concerning the difficulties involved in applying the models. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Software verification and validation (V&amp;amp;V) is a systems engineering process that supports the evaluation of software quality. Software V&amp;amp;V requires careful planning for effective application of a rigorous methodology for evaluating the correctness and quality of the software product throughout the software life cycle. A recent standard, the IEEE Std. 1012--1986, Standard for Software Verification and Validation Plans (SVVP), provides direction for preparing or assessing a software verification and validation plan.This Standard provides uniform and minimum requirements for the format and content of Software Verification and Validation Plans (SVVPs). The Standard specifies minimum verification and validation tasks and the associated inputs and outputs which must be included in SVVPs for noncritical software. it recommends their inclusion in SVVPs for noncritical software. The Standard lists optional V&amp;amp;V tasks to permit the V&amp;amp;V planner to tailor the V&amp;amp;V effort to suit project needs.Definitions for verification, validation, critical software, and software lifecycle are adapted from those from the IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology, ANSI/IEEE Std 729-1983. The IEEE 1012 Standard directs that V&amp;amp;V shall be initiated early in the lifecycle and parailels development. The Standard can be used with a wide variety of lifecycle models and approaches, i.e., the traditional waterfall model as well as rapid prototyping. In order for the Standard to have broad use, it does not specify a particular V&amp;amp;V organizational approach; nor does it require specific tools or methodologies to perform the V&amp;amp;V tasks but rather establishes minimum criteria for a V&amp;amp;V plan.</jats:p>",

In the first stage spectral analysis was used to identify the main postwar cycles in each sector of building (industrial, commercial, and residential); the second stage involved the development of a theoretical framework suitable for dynamic modelling of these cycles; and the third stage was concerned with estimating the best time-series model for each cycle. The estimated models demonstrate the presence of both an endogenous supply-side mechanism creating major building cycles of up to nine years' duration, and the exogenous influence of business-cycle fluctuations within user and investment submarkets which are transmitted via the demand for property into short building cycles of four to five years duration. In addition, the models demonstrate how the building cycle in each sector may be influenced by other factors, such as development costs and property rents and values. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The late 1960s saw the reemergence of concern over the growth of social polarisation in London. Much of the evidence produced subsequently has been fragmentary and inconclusive, the results depending on the geographical extent of the analyses, the time periods, and levels of spatial disaggregation utilised. Using head of household data for 1966 and 1981, it is shown that the level of social polarisation between London and the rest of the South East increased over this period. There was also a slight tendency towards greater polarisation between inner and outer London. It is also shown that these changes were strongly associated with changes in the tenure structure of the region over this period. In particular, the large increases in the number of professional and managerial household heads in the South East outside London were strongly associated with the growth of owner occupation, whereas the relative increases in the less skilled and economically inactive in London were associated with the growth of council tenure. It is concluded that the period 1966–1981 saw an increasing degree of sociotenurial polarisation within the region and that the structure of housing opportunities by tenure played a major role in this process. </jats:p>",

However, the eventual cost impact of forecast errors on system performance and the degree to which cost consequences are explained by typical error measures have not been studied thoroughly. The present paper demonstrates that these typical error measures often are not good predictors of cost consequences in material requirements planning (MRP) settings. MRP systems rely directly on the master production schedule (MPS) to specify gross requirements. These MRP environments receive forecast errors indirectly when the errors create inaccuracies in the MPS.</jats:p><jats:p>Our study results suggest that within MRP environments the predictive capabilities of forecast‐error measures are contingent on the lot‐sizing rule and the product components structure When forecast errors and MRP system costs are coanalyzed, bias emerges as having reasonable predictive ability. In further investigations of bias, loss functions are evaluated to explain the MRP cost consequences of forecast errors. Estimating the loss functions of forecast errors through regression analysis demonstrates the superiority of loss functions as measures over typical forecast error measures in the MPS.</jats:p>",

Interest, intent to participate, and actual participation rates were measured. Contrary to expectations, activities which demand greater participation were more popular than more passive activities which involved lectures. Activities related to child health were better received than family planning activities alone. Barriers to participation which were best predictors of actual participation included “selling goods in town,” “cooking,” or “busy with housework.” That these were ranked by respondents as weak barriers suggests that it didn't take much to dissuade mothers from participation in those activities that they felt had little merit. Study findings suggest a need for greater integration of activities into village schedules, more systematic targetting of activities to high-risk groups, more activities demanding greater participation, and direct promotion of activities through influential individuals (community leaders, traditional healers). </jats:p>",

The importance of close elections for management, unions, and the National Labor Relations Board is emphasized. Likely union and management strategies for contesting close elections are noted, as is the significance of these elections in relation to the changing political and institutional environment of US labor relations. Empirically, a set of structural and contextual variables are used to discriminate between close and nonclose elections. The determinants of close elections are analyzed through a set of regression models, using as dependent variables the margins of victory and loss. Data on close elections are developed from the electoral performance of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union and the United Auto Workers union over the period 1970–82. Implications of these results are considered for the role of the National Labor Relations Board and the effectiveness of management consultants in union representation campaigns. </jats:p>",
