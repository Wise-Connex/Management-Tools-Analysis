By responding to some of the most compelling arguments against the rational paradigm, this paper uses the pragmatism of William James to construct a new notion of pragmatic rationality in planning. This rationality looks towards consequences rather than causes, integrates facts and values, and rejects the search for ultimate foundations. </jats:p>",

After having given an account of current moves towards establishing a planning framework for the European Union of, since 1 January 1995, fifteen member states, the paper presents the notion of planning doctrine. If it ever came to pass, European doctrine would entail a Europe- wide principle of spatial organization and planning principles which match the nature of European institutions, in particular the subsidiarity principle governing the relations between the European Union and its member states. Research in progress into the possibilities of such doctrine is what the paper discusses next. It concludes that European doctrine is surrounded by many uncertainties but that research into it is intriguing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning faces the predicament that as recommendations become bolder possibilities for implementation deteriorate. This is imputed to society's transition from a Fordist and modern to a post-Fordist and postmodern era. On the one hand, postmodern values account for more public participation and heightened environmental sensitivity, which translate into proposals for alternative forms of urban development. On the other hand, the implementation of these proposals is impaired by reduced public sector resources as a result of the economic instablity associated with post-Fordism. Another impediment is the difficulty to achieve sufficient support for planning objectives in the postmodern context. This context is marked by a fragmentation of values, attachment to the existing built environment, and suspicion between social groups. The empirical focus is on Toronto's bold metropolitan planning proposals. Most recent planning documents call for reurbanization efforts, a compact urban form, and reduced reliance on the car. In this paper I cast doubts, however, on the eventual actualization of these proposals by highlighting weaknesses in the of present and anticipated implementation context. These are tied to factors that are specific to Toronto, but also to a greater extent to the post-Fordist and postmodern environment. </jats:p>",

Striking arguments can be made that our willingness to address urban problems is influenced by our history of such popular images.

It theorizes development as a dynamic and non-continuous process of state- civil society interaction. It argues that sustainable development initially requires a strong developmentalist state that allows for the growth of a vibrant civil society. At some point in this process, civil society will muster enough strength to challenge the state. If this transitional stage is successfully managed, the two forces will reach a balance of power that allows the country to enter the sustainable development stage, also characterized by democracy. The paper illustrates the theory through historical analysis and concludes by drawing out the theory's planning and policy implications. </jats:p>",

It is their contention that such techniques can be particularly effective given the recent changes in the education-policy framework; namely the development of a market system to replace the previous, producer-led, planning environment. The authors argue that GIS-based techniques can offer only a partial solution to the manifold problems facing educationalists, and that we must look to more advanced spatial-analysis tools such as spatial-interaction modelling. The authors conclude that a combination of these techniques offers a powerful tool for planners who are increasingly concerned with questions of the equity of provision. </jats:p>",

Domestic markets alone cannot provide the revenue and growth opportunities required by many business organizations. Many business firms want to sell in international markets but lack the expertise and financial resources to sell overseas effectively. In domestic markets, manufacturers’ representatives currently provide the sales function for many such firms, especially small manufacturers. Investigates the potential role that manufacturers’ representatives will play in global marketing expansion. A survey of 119 representative agencies was made to identify and study their experiences and/or perceptions about expanding their client base to world markets. Results show that 60 per cent of representatives were optimistic about their future opportunities in a global economy but were hardly aggressive (up to now) when it comes to entering world markets. Over 80 per cent of the representatives had enquiries from foreign principals, but only 47 per cent initiated the contacts. Moreover, only 23 per cent sought global markets for their current principals’ products.</jats:p>",

Typically, policies and practices related to land are devised at different times for different purposes and are administered by different agencies. Rarely are the relationships between them, their implementation, and their overall impact considered systematically, especially for developing countries. In this paper I evaluate urban land policy in Zimbabwe. I consider tenure, land-use planning and development control, taxation, and direct public sector intervention in the land market. Particular attention is given to the local administrative context and to the relationship between central and local government as portrayed in the paths of land delivery for private developers, municipalities, and central government. The overall conclusion is that Zimbabwe's urban land administration system works effectively. However, it is formal and complex, which is restricting its ability to play an appropriate role in catering for rapid urban growth and the needs of low-income residents. </jats:p>",

The methodologies themselves constitute a method that regulates the various stages in the process of planning and developing the information system. Each methodology has its own advantages and disadvantages but, generally, the correct methodology must be adapted to the required system.The aim of this article is to describe a new methodology, known as OODPM - Object Oriented Design by a Prototype Methodology, that integrates two existing methodologies, namely OOD and Prototype, bringing together many advantages. The principle advantages of this method are as follows: the ability to reduce planning time; to better define user requirements; to plan an enhanced information system; to bridge the gap between the design of the required solution and its development. This article will offer a brief survey of the methodologies currently used in the development and planning of information systems, focusing on the OODPM method and the tools it uses.</jats:p>",

Although the importance of proper experimentation is often emphasized in the literature on discrete event simulation, it is neglected in most practical simulation studies.

This article presents an attempt to structure the process of planning and designing simulation experiments, and proposes a knowledge- based system, namely Design Of Experi ments for Simulation (DOES), that assists the inexperienced analyst in this process. The proposed system takes the analyst through a planning process based on the simulation objectives. </jats:p>",

Therefore, one can ask the central question of the role of physical proximity in economic development processes. Economists try to answer this question through the concept of externalities, but this does not explain why certain externalities are linked with physical proximity. In this paper the author tries first to show why mainstream economists are not able to catch the problem of proximity and territory in their model. It is argued that they make a systematic confusion between physical space and abstract mathematical spaces. In the second part of the paper a tentative definition of a terrority is given and a first mathematical formulation of this concept is proposed. Starting from this definition, the author shows in the third part of this paper how a consideration of territory and proximity should change our understanding of economic development processes in general. </jats:p>",

Outlines the history of the British Library in the context of the 50 years that have elapsed from the inception of the new building to its final opening. Among the 230, 000 defects identified in the 1996 report are: poor quality and reliability of the movable book shelving, damage to electrical cabling, poorly designed ducting and the need for better emergency lighting. Concludes that these were caused by a lack of foresight and commitment to the ideals of the project by gov ernment, rather than by any incompetence on the part of individuals. Comments on unfair criticism of the outward appearance of the library building and the contrast between the stark appearance of the latter with the Victorian exuber ance of the neighbouring St Pancras railway station, blaming it upon the gen eral inability of British society to appreciate contemporary architecture. </jats:p>",

The mathematical basis for the computational scheme is explained concisely by means of set-theory notation, and implementation of the Teitz—Bart heuristic is discussed with particular reference to search and storage considerations in large networks and in trees.

The model is based on the assumption that local governments behave as if they were maximising a nested Stone—Geary utility function; at the first stage of the utility-maximisation process, they set up the overall level of taxation, and at the second level they decide how to allocate expenditure among the different services. The results suggest that in the first years after the reform a utility-based incremental budgeting model could explain the determination of expenditure and its composition. Although the model has strong microeconomic foundations, the interpretation of the results may need to be tentative because the data used in the estimation procedure are for a transition year from the old to the new system. The results of the estimated econometric model were then used to predict the likely changes in expenditure which will be brought about by the introduction to the system of a locally managed property tax. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Since the Education Reform Act of 1988 there has been substantial change in the funding of schools in Britain. Individual schools now have their own budgets which are determined by formula, and they have substantial freedom to spend their budgets as they wish. They are also entitled to keep any savings which they make, and these are rolled forward to the next financial year. The funding formula for a school is designed by its local education authority, subject to constraints imposed by central government. More recently a class of self-governing, or grant-maintained, schools has developed with a parallel funding system which is also formula based. A new institution, the Funding Agency for Schools, has been created to oversee the financing of these schools. In this paper, which is based on interviews with officers in six local education authorities and on documentation from several others, the author assesses these recent changes in the education ‘market’. It is concluded that the market is not working well due to the complexity of the funding arrangements, the institutional arrangements, the inappropriate incentives offered, and the change in the ‘atmosphere’ of the education market. </jats:p>",

Characteristics of tasks are discussed, and then a framework is offered that can organize the nature of task-based instruction and relevant research. The framework is used to generate predictions regarding the effects of three different tasks (Personal Information Exchange, Narrative, and Decision-Making) and three different implementation conditions for each task (unplanned, planned but without detail, detailed planning) on the variables of fluency, complexity, and accuracy. The study reports strong effects of planning on fluency and clear effects also on complexity, with a linear relationship between degree of planning and degree of complexity. However, a more complex relationship was discovered between planning and accuracy, with the most accurate performance produced by the less detailed planners. In addition, interactions were found between task type and planning conditions, such that the effects of planning were greater with the Narrative and Decision-Making tasks than with the Personal Information Exchange task. The results are discussed in terms of an attentional model of learning and performance and highlight the importance of tradeoff effects between the goals of complexity and accuracy in the context of the use of limited capacity attentional resources. The study contributes to the development of cognitive models of second language performance and addresses a number of pedagogic issues.</jats:p>",

However, for deep lane storage systems the last‐in‐first‐out principle holds and direct access to pallets is lost apart from the last pallet entering a channel. To operate deep lane storage systems effectively, namely, providing high throughput rates even at times of high storage rack utilization requires a sophisticated operational planning system. We will describe a totally new concept consisting of five modules for storage and retrieval assignments, as well as for a reorganization of storage location occupations. </jats:p>",

In this paper an applied modelling approach is taken, and the aim is to identify the relative importance of factors that are decisive for the viability of an individual firm's parking policies. The outcomes of an empirical survey conducted at the corporate level of the Free University in Amsterdam are used to discuss the social feasibility of regulatory parking policies conducted at the firm level (in terms of the employees' attitudes) and the effectiveness of such policies. Insight is provided into relevant backgrounds and obstacles serving to affect employees' commuting behaviour and that are likely to be encountered in the formulation of regulatory transport policies at the firm level. Moreover, the outcomes of this research may be relevant for the evaluation of regulatory parking policies at larger spatial scales (for example, neighbourhood parking schemes). </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we show the properties of a spatial hierarchy found in a random configuration in which points are randomly placed on a plane and ranks are randomly assigned to these points. First we show a method of detecting a spatial hierarchy in a configuration of ranked points on a plane (not necessarily the random configuration). Second, using this method we obtain the spatial hierarchy of the random configuration mentioned above, and examine its properties theoretically as well as numerically with the Monte Carlo simulation. From this examination, we find that the spatial hierarchy of the random configuration shares more or less similar properties with Christaller's spatial hierarchy. Stated explicitly, the shape of dominant regions is hexagonal on average; the areas of the same rank centers are fairly homogeneous; the K value defined by Christaller is almost constant. The constant K of the random configuration is close to seven, implying that the spatial hierarchy of the random configuration is close to Christaller's hierarchy of the administrative principle. These results explain to a certain extent why spatial hierarchies are often observed in the real world. At the same time, these results give us a warning. Even if we find a spatial hierarchy in the real world, we should question whether or not the observed hierarchy is a seeming hierarchy like the spatial hierarchy in the random configuration. </jats:p>",

In this paper I examine the cultural implications of this phenomenon by looking at recent changes in the extended metropolitan region of Jakarta, Indonesia. Over the course of the 1980s, urbanization trends in Jakarta's periphery have resulted in a greatly expanded interface between urban and rural components of Indonesian society. Although this has created the opportunity for much broader popular participation in the urban economy, it may also be fostering a new perception within Indonesian society—that the primary social dichotomy lies not between the city and the countryside but between socioeconomic classes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The development programmes of major grocery retailers in Britain have transformed the retail systems of many urban areas. Impacts upon patterns of consumer behaviour and shopping provision have been substantial. Although many writers have discussed retailers' changing corporate strategies and their implications for new store development, there is still a need for local case studies. In this paper, therefore, processes of change in grocery provision in Cardiff, a city of almost 300000 population, are examined, mainly over a recent twelve-year period. An initial burst of superstore development was accompanied by closures of many small grocery stores owned by multiple and cooperative organisations. Since about 1986, rates of new store development and of store closure have diminished. These changes were superimposed upon a longer term decline in independent food retailing. The question of trading impact is then investigated through associations over time and space of store openings and closures. Although some of the closures in this analysis appear to be explained, it is clear also that certain characteristics of the stores themselves (particularly size and location) were strongly related to the likelihood of closure. This in turn reflected corporate strategies for growth, repositioning, or retrenchment amongst the multiples concerned, mediated through the local property market and land-use planning policies. The conclusion is that the case study clearly exemplifies the impacts of recent events in British retailing, but that further studies are needed to build a comprehensive understanding of retail change at the local level. </jats:p>",

It is essential to understand the factors that make business services more or less tradeable over distance. In this paper, empirical evidence concerning the extent of producer and business service exports is reviewed, and the more qualitative dimensions of the tradeability of business services are explored in greater detail in order to identify factors that both limit and encourage exports of business services. Research in the software product segment of the computer services sector suggests that it may not actually be the ‘need’ for face-to-face interaction with clients that keeps some types of suppliers of business services from exporting. The traditional rationale regarding the importance of proximity to markets, the impact of information technology, and the dynamics of producer—user interaction is examined in order to identify when it is most important for suppliers to ‘be there’, close to customers. Based on research with software products, it is possible to identify other attributes of business services that may be more critical to determining tradeability and explaining sectoral differences in export intensity than the need to ‘be there’ for clients. </jats:p>",

In the first part of this paper, an attempt is made to reconcile analysis in terms of interindividual relations with interorganizational analysis, with a view to achieving a better understanding of territorial dynamics. This is done because it is impossible to avoid, on the one hand, individual actors and, on the other hand, the analysis of coordination modes between organizations if we are to grasp what is at stake in the ‘grey area of informal networks’ underlying territorial dynamics. In the second part, this theoretical approach will be found to be particularly helpful when it comes to analyzing territorial dynamics and, more especially, the links between large industrial groups and local innovative systems. Thus, we could widen the mesoanalytic approach which has been elaborated by French industrial economists. </jats:p>",

A cost‐effective solution to transport problems should consist of a land use pattern, a transport system an a set of road pricing policies that together bring demand and supply into balance in an efficient and equitable way. The conventional approach aimed to produce comprehensive, long‐term plans for land use and transport in considerable detail, but tended to ignore the role of road pricing policy, thus ending up with solutions that might not be efficient or economical. This feature of sub‐optimal road pricing policy is accentuated by the overall growth in car use, which has generated problems with the efficient use of road space. This paper presents a computer analysis system (or model) which will enable the analysis of coordinated tunnel toll pricing policies by optimising an “objective function” while satisfying the associated and other constraints. The possibility of integrating the optimal road pricing policies in the land use and transport planning are discussed. A case study based on Hong Kong data demonstrates the efficiency of optimizing tolls on two of the three harbour crossing tunnels in Hong Kong.</jats:p>",

We compared the location of the apex obtained with CT based treatment planning versus localization using retrograde urethrography in 32 consecutive patients. The prostatic apex, localized by CT and retrograde urethrography, was compared relative to the ischial tuberosities and the symphysis pubis. Discordance between the location of the prostatic apex as defined on CT scan and retrograde urethrography was found in 50% of patients evaluated. There was 31% discordance between the location of the prostatic apex as defined on CT and retrograde urethrography when data were analysed with the location of the prostatic apex 1 cm above the narrowing on urethrography, a definition others have suggested. The urethrogram defined prostatic apex, as compared with the CT definition, necessitated the treatment of more of the surrounding normal tissues in 31% of our cases, with four-field techniques. Comparison of dose–volume histograms of the bladder, rectum and penis irradiated for target volumes defined by CT versus retrograde urethrography showed that more penis was irradiated in some patients with the urethrogram defined prostatic apex; irradiation of the base of the penis could be relatively avoided by using a six-field treatment plan instead of the standard four-field box. There is discordance between the CT and urethrogram defined prostatic apex. Dose-volume histogram information suggests that differences in apex localization can significantly affect doses to normal adjacent prostatic tissues. Combining CT localization with the urethrogram localization of the prostatic apex optimizes radiotherapy planning and dose delivery.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this study was to determine the impact of co‐ordinated management and early discharge planning as an intervention strategy to reduce hospital length of stay for children with acquired brain injury. Data for children admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, between 1987 and 1993 were compared with data collected for children receiving the intervention programme from August 1993 to August 1994. In total, 99 children were included in the study, of whom 84 were retrospective and 15 were prospective patients. Age, sex, Glasgow Coma Score, mechanism of injury (traumatic vs non‐traumatic), and treatment intervention were predictor variables, and total length of hospital stay and associated hospital costs were the outcome variables. Univariate analyses were performed to determine differences between the retrospective and intervention groups and showed a highly significant difference between the two groups in relation to length of stay and total hospital costs (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.001). Multiple regression analyses were carried out to determine what factors could predict length of stay. Along with the Glasgow Coma Score (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.01), the intervention programme was found to be a statistically significant predictor of total hospital days (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt;0.01). A couple of issues, nevertheless, remain unanswered. These pertain to the functional status of the patient at discharge and the nature of community supports required. This study opens up an area of investigation not before undertaken in occupational therapy and points towards future studies.</jats:p>",

Hearing loss was more frequently found in PRS (73.3 per cent) than in ICP (58.1 per cent) patients (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.02). PRS patients had more ears with moderate (21–40 dB) and severe (&gt;40 dB) hearing loss, disturbing their social contact, with no tendency to normalization with age (Spearman r = 0.065). In contrast to PRS, ICP patients showed a significant tendency to hearing level normalization with ageing (Spearman r = −0.453; <jats:italic>p</jats:italic> = 0.001). Planigraphs of temporal bones showed inadequately developed pneumatization of the mastoid bone in all PRS patients and in most ICP patients. No malformation of the inner or middle ear was found in either group. PRS patients have a significantly higher risk of conductive hearing loss than those with ICP. Use of tympanostomy (ventilation) tubes is therapy of choice in patients with Pierre Robin syndrome, and it should be introduced as early as possible, even at the same time as palatoplasty.</jats:p>",

The authors compare the outcome of the Third and Fourth Periodic Reviews conducted by the Boundary Commission for England.
