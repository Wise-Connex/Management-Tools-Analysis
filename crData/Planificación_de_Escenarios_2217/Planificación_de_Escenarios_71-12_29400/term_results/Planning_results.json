      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper attempts to provide a general perspective on the potentialities and limitations of research into individual activity patterns. The most common types of activity study and data-collecting device are briefly described, and problems of data collection and analysis are outlined. The main focus is on the value of ‘space-time budgets’ in household surveys, assessed with respect to two contrasting aims: (1) deriving ‘behavioural’ postulates on which geographic theories of spatial structure might be based, and (2) planning spatial structures to suit the behaviour patterns and aspirations of different types of individuals and households. Activities occur in a ‘space-time’ continuum’, and there are temporal regularities inherent in spatial patterns. It is argued that studying activity patterns in terms of ‘space-time locations’ can throw light on pressing socio-spatial problems. </jats:p>",

If overtime in each period is unrestricted and no shortages are permitted, then it is easily shown that the firm will have to know future demand for at most the next k* periods, where k* is determined by the ratio of the wage differential between overtime and regular time to the per unit holding cost per period. Using the k* concept, the paper determines planning horizons when both storage and backlogging of demand are allowed. If overtime constraints are imposed, a planning algorithm is proposed that requires less information on future demand than a linear programming model. Economic implications of this approach for decision-making and information processing in firms are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The stimulus for this article was an observation that resource development in the United States is of a lumpy or whole project-by-project character. We seem to have looked at resource development proposals in isolation from other worthwhile activities and to have been preoccupied with the magnitude of “benefit-cost ratios” in evaluating and comparing individual resource development activities, projects, or programs. Unless properly interpreted, however, such ratios can mislead planners and legislators to invest capital and other inputs in a way that leads to a less than fully efficient pattern of resource development, even where the objective is only to maximize quantifiable monetary benefits. Accordingly, this analysis examines the “benefit-cost ratio” in the context of an income-producing efficiency objective and elementary production theory. Such other currently emphasized objectives as environmental quality improvement are treated implicitly, though not within a multiobjective framework. For a more complete treatment of these see Miller and Holloway [9] who have illustrated an application of multiobjective resource planning principles recently issued by the Water Resources Council [15]. Other particular papers and reports dealing with multiobjective resource development planning are [3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 13 and 14].</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> CALLPLAN is an interactive computer system designed to aid salesmen or sales management in allocating sales call time more efficiently. The system increases their capacity to consider the allocation in a logical and consistent manner. CALLPLAN uses as input the salesman's own best estimates of expected contribution of all possible call policies for each account and prospect. The computer can help the estimating procedure by fitting curves through estimated points on a response function or by obtaining expected values from probability estimates. The system solves a mathematical program which determines the best time allocation to maximize contribution according to these estimates. Factors considered by the system include travel time and costs to get to geographical areas within the territory, amount of time required per call on an account within an area, account profitability, and minimum and maximum account call frequency limitations. An efficient incremental analysis routine is discussed as a solution procedure for the mathematical program. </jats:p><jats:p> CALLPLAN seems best suited to repetitive selling situations where the amount of time the salesman spends with an account is an important factor in the magnitude of sales generated. Preliminary applications have been made by fourteen salesmen in six sales situations. A transcript of a session at the computer terminal of one application is presented. </jats:p><jats:p> Anticipated sales increases, based on the salesman's judgmental inputs, for the call policy generated by CALLPLAN were between five and twenty-five per cent in the majority of applications. </jats:p>",

The forecasting and policy problems are translated into signed digraph problems, and in particular to problems of so-called pulse processes on signed digraphs.

A generalisation of this method, based on the golden section number, is derived and this method is used to explore the sensitivity of the model's goodness-of-fit to changes in parameter values. A fundamental result of these explorations shows that there is no unique fit for retail models with two parameters, and this result is likely to hold for other models of spatial interaction.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As management science models are developed in marketing, they make demands for more sophisticated inputs from the behavioral sciences. This is particularly true in the area of advertising media models. A continuing behavioral research program to develop estimates of repetition response functions for media models is reviewed. The program finds functions which differ importantly in level, slope and shape depending on the measure of response, market segment, product type, brand, advertising format, advertising illustration, advertisement color, media scheduling, ad appeal, and competitive situation. It is argued that such response function variations, found in both laboratory and field research, should be represented in media models. To illustrate this point, the results of a study of repetitive effects of one-sided (supportive) and two-sided (refutational) competitive advertisements are applied to runs of the MEDIAC planning system. Inclusion of the behavioral data produces favorable changes in MEDIAC output in terms of schedules and schedule results. The potential of further interaction between behavioral data and management science models is discussed. </jats:p>",
