The existence of two feed-back rules (one for work force and one for production) is postulated. The universe of possible parameters is searched to find the set of parameters that provides the lowest cost or highest profit for a particular firm. Each set of parameters is evaluated by comparing the costs or profits resulting from the application of rules bearing these parameter values to a likely sequence of sales forecasts and actual sales. Decision rules formed in this way give cost and profit results nearly equal to those resulting from the application of the optimal techniques to purely mathematical problems. In more complex and more realistic situations, the results obtained by Parametric Production Planning may be superior to those achieved by a linear programming approach or a linear decision rule. </jats:p>",

This problem arises whenever the future planning for a newly discovered or partially developed reservoir is under review and the following question is posed: \"What drilling and/or production policy should be adopted to maximize the return from a given operation in the presence of practical constraints?\"</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This question is difficult because of the many factors involved – some of which are not known with any degree of certainty. At the present time, it is not possible to provide a completely satisfactory answer; but some of the salient points may be studied and considerable insight concerning the nature of the problem may be gained. In this paper, the problem is approached via systems theory; i.e., the reservoir is considered to be a dynamic system the behaviour of which is reflected in the pressure- production history. This concept leads to a simple model in terms of which development is considered as a control problem.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This unconventional approach is shown to be consistent with some current reservoir engineering practices, but it has distinct advantages over them because it is possible to specify economic criteria as part of the formulation and, hence, to consider the question of optimal policy. On this basis, reservoir development is the counterpart of the optimal control problem with which so much of the modern systems theory is concerned.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The separate phases of a systems study – systems identification and specification of control policies – are discussed in the context of reservoir development.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",
