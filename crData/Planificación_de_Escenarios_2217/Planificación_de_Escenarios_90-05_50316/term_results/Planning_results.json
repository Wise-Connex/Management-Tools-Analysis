In particular, the demands placed on the outfall seabed riser structures requires consideration of many of the engineering disciplines associated with the offshore industry. This paper describes the investigations, design and construction planning that is required in the development of the seabed diffuser structures and riser shafts of deepwater tunneled outcalls.

Often this discharge or effluent has been untreated and in some locations discharged virtually at the shoreline through open pipelines or via shallow water Outfalls. The result of such practices, in many instances, has been a significant increase in the level of pollution of the marine environment to such an extent that the quality of life in those cities and communities is now becoming threatened.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Governments and regulatory authorities are coming under increased public pressure to rectify this environmental pollution, and in many instances actions have been taken and projects initiated to reduce the level of pollution of the coastal environment. A recognized method of reducing the pollution of coastal waters is to first treat the wastewater and sewage by means of processes which remove the toxins, greases and harmful bacteria, and then to discharge the treated effluent through deep water ocean outfalls.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>A deepwater outfall is a conduit that takes treated effluent from an onshore treatment works to a predetermined seabed site some distance offshore. The effluent is discharged into the marine environment at this seabed site through a structure known as a diffuser. The area of discharge is known as the diffuser zone, The outfall conduit can be either a seabed pipeline or a submarine tunnel. Deep water outfalls usually require conduits in excess of four feet diameter, and discharge in water depths in excess of 60 feet.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>This paper concentrates on the offshore engineering aspects of deep water tunneled outfalls, and in particular, the design and construction planning of the offshore riser assembly, Particular reference is made to the Sydney Ocean Outfall Project currently under construction off the coast of Sydney, Australia. There are three deep water tunneled outfalls involved in this Project and the outfalls are considered the most technically advanced of this kind ever undertaken.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Reference is also made to the planned Boston Outfall, which when constructed will be the largest tunneled outfall in the world.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>OUTFALL CONFIGURATION</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>A tunneled outfall comprises the following components:An access shaft from the onshore treatment works to the start of the submarine tunnel.A submarine tunnel extending from the base of the access shaft to the offshore diffuser zone.A diffuser zone which consists of a collection of riser assemblies. Refer to Figure 1 for the general arrangement of a deep water tunneled outfall.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The male part was the world of public affairs, commerce, business and, of course, the defence of the realm. The female centred on the private domain: home, family and children. The problem that this imposed on women has never yet been successfully resolved: the sexual division of labour and the domestic location of women's work. In Britain in the nineteenth century, as the population moved into the cities and standards of living rose (if patchily), the physical form of the modern urban environment took shape in ways which perpetuated the continuance of the Two Spheres. This was particularly true for middle-class women, whose lives in suburban retreats had little physical connection with the rest of the city. Of all the pressures which dictated the form of nineteenth-century cities, there was not one related to finding new ways for women to live in modern cities outside a rigid interpretation of the Two Spheres.</jats:p>",

Currently 10% of the nation's renters are covered by some form of rent regulation, yet little is known about the economic consequences of rent control. Most evidence suggests that modern rent controls have little or no impact on the amount of investment in rental housing. Such a finding is primarily because of the nonrestrictive nature of most current rent control ordinances, which typically exempt newly constructed housing, guarantee a fair and reasonable return on investment, and allow for annual rent adjustments to cover increases in operating costs. Although this relatively mild type of rent control succeeds in limiting extreme rent increases, it does not result in significant relief from high rents in most regulated cities. Only with strong rent control ordinances will rents be significantly impacted. </jats:p>",

In this paper a large Australian-based firm which has emerged rapidly as a transnational agribusiness and brewing conglomerate in the 1980s is examined. The fractions of capital now reorganised as Elders IXL Ltd have adopted over time various capital accumulation strategies, forging, in each period, distinctive linkages with the global economy. To cope with restructuring crises during the 1970s, Elders has rapidly built a new global geography of production, trade, and investment, accompanied by extensive rationalisation and divestment in its Australian operations. The role of international finance capital has become increasingly important, and domestic restructuring can be understood only in terms of the new global strategies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In 1988 the Australian coal industry was both the most efficient in the world and the most competitive in the international market. At the same time it was in crisis. In this paper this paradox of efficiency and crisis is uncovered by an analysis which integrates long-term structural trends in coal production with an understanding of other determinations such as global market shifts and geopolitical pressures. A perspective on the flows of social labour, or value, within the coal industry is employed as a means of gaining insight into the relationship between long-run tendencies in production and other more contingent determinations. </jats:p>",

It is argued here that critical factors often fall into two distinct sub‐groups: those related to initial project planning and those concerned with subsequent tactical operationalization. A field study was conducted to explore changes in the perceived importance of project planning and tactical factors across four stages in the project life cycle. The sample consisted of 408 managers currently involved in projects. It was found that the relative importance of planning and tactical factors varies across the project life cycle. Further, the perceived importance of these factors is contingent upon the type of success measure employed. When an efficiency success measure is used, planning factors are initially perceived to be of high importance but are overtaken by tactical issues as the project progresses through its life cycle. When ‘external’ success measures (perceived value of the project and client satisfaction) are employed, project planning factors dominate tactics throughout the project's life cycle. Finally, implications for managers are developed and directions for future research are discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper some of the main properties of spatial interaction models deriving from a spatial search process are examined. First, a rigorous definition of the idea of sequentiality of a spatial search process is developed. The departure point of this definition is that if one moves from some region in space to another, so does the spatial repartition of opportunities to be found. Then, the probability of finding an opportunity within the region one leaves decreases, whereas it increases for the region one is going into. Second, it is shown that when a spatial search process is sequential, the corresponding spatial interaction function is one of intervening opportunities. In the last part of the paper a spatial search equilibrium when searchers are competing for the same opportunities is examined. It appears that the effect of competition on one's search process is given by a competing searchers effect, corresponding to the mean duration of vacant opportunities. </jats:p>",

Recently, critics have argued that wood balances are misleading in their simplicity, exaggerating both the severity of the woodfuel shortage and the need for planned interventions to solve that problem. This paper examines four different wood balances developed for Tanzania. While the four studies all indicate that areas with miombo woodlands are in the greatest wood surplus, the specific estimates for any given region may differ widely. Despite their shortcomings, energy planners need woodfuel balances to give an impression of the adequacy of woodfuel resources. However, if energy planning is to have any effect, these balances must represent the beginning, and not the end result, of the planning process. Planners must follow the wood‐energy balance analysis with work utilizing local people to solve local problems.</jats:p>",
