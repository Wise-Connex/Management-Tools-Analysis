Whereas long-term investments and structural policies are often evaluated in terms of overall criteria of system performance, the development of behavioural relations is more properly described in terms of user-optimized choices. The combination of these aspects is difficult to cover in model building. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper reviews some previous integrated approaches (for example, in transportation planning) and describes how a model for long-term infrastructural planning can be interlinked with an aggregated demand model of transportation behaviour. Applications from Stockholm regional planning conclude the paper. Two recent proposals for land use in 1990 are compared with model-generated structural developments, and the impacts of structural changes on behavioural patterns are analyzed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Under conditions of limited and selective growth, institutions propose resource allocation changes which are not strictly related to overall institutional enrollment levels. These proposals often focus attention on the resource impact of internal shifts in student demand and the desirability of maintaining minimum or \"critical mass \"levels of academic program breadth and quality. This paper addresses the academic planning procedures needed to advance non-enrollment driven resource maintenance and acquisition proposals at institutional and state levels. The purpose of critical mass modeling for academic planning is to facilitate analysis, prioritization and negotiation of academic program alternatives and resources. The critical mass approach to academic planning would establish a campus-wide process and informa- tion base for prioritization of academic program development through (a) analysis of existing breadth and depth of faculty expertise in instruction and research at the sub- disciplinary level, (b) identification of subdisciplinary areas in which academic units would like to provide instruction and research in the future. Critical mass denotes the level of course offerings and research which academic units could not reduce and still maintain programs which fulfill their own objectives compatible with the overall mission of their institution. Critical mass program size and \"core\" resource requirements would be established by academic unit faculty and then would be negotiated with committees of academic senates and with institutional administrations. The planning process described is designed for application in medium and large sized institutions in which formal, comprehensive and integrated academic ¡resource planning systems do not operate presently.</jats:p>"

We show under very general conditions that the algorithm will always lead to an exact or asymptotic planning horizon. Planning horizon results due to others form special cases. Applications of the generalized production scheduling model include capacity expansion problems. </jats:p>",

The representations provide a limited explanation of how such a situation might come about and be maintained. Initially they draw on Downs' models of voting and party competition, but explore alternatives because of: (1) the possibility that some assumptions needed for a Downsian representation cannot realistically be made about political arguments; and (2) the probability that factors other than verbal arguments enter into planning decisions. </jats:p>",

To this end, socialist planning is constituted as the object of analysis; planning is viewed as a mani festation of and hence an indicator of a more inclusive process of change. It is our contention that any discussion of planning must be couched in terms commen surate with those used to explain socialism itself, i.e., a discussion of the forms and nature of the social relations. For this reason, we first outline our theoretical formulation of socialism (seen here as the combination of elements from two contradictory modes of production — communism and capitalism). Planning is then located in this general schema prior to a discussion of specific planning practises followed in Cuba for the period under consideration. Our analysis points to the fluidity of the forms taken by planning in Cuba, while attempting to demonstrate that struggles within the Party over correct planning procedures and between the Party and the masses over planning failures have caused this fluidity and stamped each form with its own specific orientation. </jats:p>",

The analysis described in this paper tests the separate and joint effects of housing type and tenure on various reactions to road traffic noise, with the use of questionnaire data and noise measurements collected at residential sites near to major highways in the Toronto region of southern Ontario. The results show that neither housing type nor tenure has any consistent effect on residents' reactions to road traffic noise. The working assumption in the literature is therefore not supported. Two important conclusions follow from this: first, that no one type of housing is clearly more appropriate in residential areas near to major highways; and second, that a policy of setting different noise standards for different types of residential area cannot be supported. </jats:p>",

The model determines the area to be served by a central waste treatment plant, where alternative on‐lot disposal systems are also available. The model is applied to various urban area configurations, which are summarized by their total populations and by their population density distributions. Both minimum regional cost and minimum local cost service area configurations are determined. In addition, the sensitivity of the model to the parameters of the cost and population density functions is assessed. It is found that the model is most sensitive to the parameters of the collection cost function.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In contrast with many surveys of the movement of industry conducted exclusively through management, this study was conducted principally through interviews with employees at new factories, focussing on their experience and labour market behaviour, and thereby reveals relatively unknown implications of British regional policy. It is also unusual for a survey of workers to concentrate exclusively on people who have changed jobs, whether voluntarily or not. Recruitment by plants new to the North East must be seen within the context of employees' complex labour market behaviour, but many aspects of the process are conditioned by the plants' relatively high demand for semiskilled labour. Recruits show rational behaviour and high occupational and industrial mobility within the limitations of restricted travel to work areas and a restricted flow of information about the new jobs. Several aspects of the jobs themselves appear disappointing when set against implicit assumptions and hopes in regional policy. </jats:p>",

Neither the war of 1914–18 nor that of 1939–45 was a single war. Each comprised and interrelated set of wars. Their endingsfound the victors unready and surprised, their preparations for the processes of peace-making unrehearsed and unconcerted. The processes of peace-making themselves were therefore long drawn out in time and overtaken by subsequent events.</jats:p>",
