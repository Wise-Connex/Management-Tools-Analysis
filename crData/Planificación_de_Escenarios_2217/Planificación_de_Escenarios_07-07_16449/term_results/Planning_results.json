      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning rights' (PRs) implications for planning theory and practice are traced in several directions. One explores the complex planning process, where PRs can link the micro-scale to the macro-level of theory and analysis. Another addresses the opposition between planning and property rights, which the concept of PRs resolves. For evaluation in planning, awareness of PRs implies revisions in theory and practice, balancing utilitarian-analytic with normative-dialogic approaches. Recognizing PRs also revitalizes the Public Interest. PRs have positive implications too for the meta-ethics of planning, integrating consequential-utilitarianism with value-based normative judgment. This will affect enacted planning practice and enable real application of professional ethics. </jats:p>",

It suggests a different approach to the regulation of land use more in line with this ideal, based on the assumption that it is not only relevant but also one that cannot be renounced. The objective is to show that the more complex an (urban) system becomes, the greater is the need for abstract, general and end-independent rules to favour a sort of beneficial, spontaneous order — self-coordinating and polycentric — of individual actions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning theory, laws, and systems are essentially procedural in that they focus on the process of planning and decision-making but do not deal with the substance of the decisions nor their impact on cities. They emphasize the role of the many (f)actors that shape the built environment rather than the resultant properties of the built environment itself. This is true both for the rational comprehensive theory of the 1960s and the 1990s postmodern theory of communicative planning theory. In this article we claim that current planning weaknesses, on the one hand, and viewing cities as complex self-organizing systems, on the other, require re-linking planning theory, law, and administration to the substantive qualitative relations between the various urban elements. We then introduce, first, an example for theorizing such an `Urban Code' that turns the spatial relations into a planning rule and, second, a suggestion for a planning system that is responsive to these qualitative relations and is capable of updating them. </jats:p>",

A range of issues relating to the processes by which appeals are heard, issues of expert evidence, and the composition and expertise of the appeal body are examined. A number of areas where appeal processes might be improved are highlighted and it is concluded that although each of these systems is unique, they are all confronted by similar challenges. In a theoretical sense, the author observes that there is currently a significant lacuna in planning knowledge with respect to understanding planning-appeals processes. </jats:p>",

Specifically, the article considers the modernization of an established part of local governance — land use planning, and a novel articulation of modernization through community planning. There are important differences between them, yet they share common interests in securing the integration of service. Through a synthesis of research evidence, emerging policy documentation and consultation responses, we address three questions. First, is the emphasis on integration in both land use planning and community planning helping to address the fragmented state? Second, how are land use planning and community planning adapting to local circumstances? Third, what is the nature of the relationship between these different attempts to plan for local communities? The article considers to what extent this turn to integration within and between land use planning and community planning is constructive. </jats:p>",

The lack of combined insights blocks development in the right direction and makes potential users hesitant to apply PSS in planning. This study presents SWOT of PSS from a combined user–developer perspective. We first express them in terms of combinations of planning task, PSS information function, and user, and subsequently use a literature survey, a series of interviews, and a web survey to gather views from developers, users, and PSS experts. The analysis shows that planners mainly use simple information storage and retrieval systems for exploration tasks, while the majority of PSS are technically much more advanced and aim to support complex tasks. The potential of these advanced PSS can only be realized if planners and system developers start to share knowledge and demands and identify opportunities in a cooperative PSS-development process. Without such a process, the advantages and opportunities of PSS will remain unexploited. </jats:p>",

The situation of Esperanto and interlinguistics in universities remains stable. However, the years 2005 and 2006 have been marked by the passing of two major figures: Ito Kanzi in Japan and William Auld in Scotland. A survey of recent scholarship shows steady production of studies and reference works in the linguistics of Esperanto, interlinguistics, the Esperanto movement and speech community, Zamenhof studies, the history of Esperanto, Esperanto literature, translation, the teaching of Esperanto, and language policy. There has been an increase in publication on Esperanto and interlinguistics particularly in German and Russian.</jats:p>",

The roots for this policy go back to common structural policy in agriculture and to the common structural and regional policy. The new European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development should further strengthen rural development policy in the period 2007–2013. The new perspective is in line with the changing view on the Common Agricultural Policy cutting down sector-specific market and price policy and developing an integrated policy for rural areas. From a scientific point of view the new policy orientation raises several questions. Rural development policy, basically, is a complex policy decision-making problem requiring sound scientific support.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The standardization process of the Basque language presents some unusual characteristics. Although some of the first authors to publish in Basque in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries explicitly remarked on the difficulties brought about by dialectal diversity, very little progress in the standardization of the language was made until the second half of the twentieth century. Even the impact of the rise of Basque nationalism at the end of the nineteenth century was not entirely positive, since the founder of the Basque Nationalist Party favored the development of a different written variety for each of the Basque provinces. The extreme puristic and neologizing tendency of some writers at the time was also a source of obstacles on the path towards standardization. A Basque language academy was founded in 1918 with the unification of the written language as one of its main goals, but it made essentially no progress until the linguist Luis Michelena (Mitxelena) presented a report to the Basque Academy in 1968 on the bases for a written standard language. From then on, other stages in the standardization process have taken place very rapidly. This new standard has enjoyed enormous success and in a few decades has become firmly established in Basque society.</jats:p>",

Due to its dependence on a specific density of agglomeration and interactions between firms, research institutes, universities, public administration and specialised intermediaries, regional innovation systems (RIS) and clusters seem to be a very promising instrument to improve the competitiveness of regions and their citizens, firms and other organizations. However, only few regions are able to implement a strategy of RIS or clusters successfully, causing additional risks of increasing disparities between economically leading and lagging regions. The plans of the European Commission for the next budget period including further instruments to promote innovation are investigated and assessed critically, and within conclusions, an argumentation is presented, why promotion of innovation will never contribute in the intensity intended by the European Commission to EU regional policy.</jats:p>"

It had been expected that poor and peripheral countries and regions could hardly draw benefits from these steps of EU integration or less than those which were already rich and located in the core of the community. Contrary to these expectations the poor countries and regions were able to catch up, in most cases considerably. It is true that presumably EU regional policy has contributed to their catching-up processes. But decisive for these processes have been the market forces which were the result of EU integration and the economic policy within the catching-up countries. Economic growth in the EU has probably not been stimulated by regional policy. Also in the current period regional policy will presumably not contribute positively to economic growth in the EU.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<p>Business needs have driven the design, development, and use of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Intra-enterprise integration was a driving force in the design, development, and use of early ERP systems, but increased globalization, intense competition, and technological change have shifted to focus to inter-enterprise integration. Current and evolving ERP systems thus reflect the expanded scope of integration, with greater emphasis on things like supply chain management and customer relationship management. This manuscript explores the evolution of ERP, the current status of ERP, and the future of ERP, with the objective of promoting relevant future research in this important area. If researchers hope to play a significant role in the design, development, and use of suitable ERP systems to meet evolving business needs, then their research should focus, at least in part, on the changing business environment, its impact on business needs, and the requirements for enterprise systems that meet those needs.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past few years both sheet metal process planning and production planning issues\nreceived increased attention. For process planning of the laser cutting process, nesting algorithms\nare developed in order to decrease the waste material. Additionally, algorithms are available for\npath planning, i.e. determining the best sequence for cutting the different parts. Production planning\nis mainly performed based on the ability to fill a sheet. For air bending, process planning focuses on\nbend sequencing and tool selection, while production planning optimization aims at minimizing\ntime consuming setups between the different production layouts at the press brake. However, when\nintegrating both processes, the benefits from individual optimization counteract one another: good\nnestings at the laser machine can create additional setups at the press brake, hence increasing the\nmakespan. An integrated approach is proposed to verify whether this problem can be solved by\nalready taking into account possible setups at the press brake in the early nesting stage. Integration\nof both processes aims at an optimal combination of parts on a sheet and minimization of the setups\nat the press brake. In this paper, an overview of a modeling effort addressing both goals is proposed.\nWhen combining parts on a sheet, preference is given to parts requiring the same production layout\nat the press brake. If this is impossible, production layouts with low changeover times are preferred.\nIndustrial cases are used to verify the applicability of the proposed model. The results are compared\nto a reference approach where nesting is performed with dedicated software and planning for air\nbending is based on an operator’s experience. Compared to this reference approach, a makespan\nreduction and a setup time reduction can be observed. The planning is generated almost\ninstantaneously and no additional sheets are required compared to the reference approach. Future\nresearch will focus on expanding the model and verifying its applicability on a larger data-set.</jats:p>"

In this paper I attempt to problematize such a gesture in the recent ‘turn to cosmopolis’, arguing that its conceptual frame fails to specify adequately the geohistorical preconditions for a politics capable of mediating between nationalizing and cosmopolitanizing tendencies at work in a globalizing world. For the case of Europe, I argue such a legacy may be more productively located in the ‘border work’ of mid-20th-century anti-imperialism and decolonization, whose struggles to redefine the postcolonial couplet of ‘nation’ and ‘state’ haunt current attempts by the European Union to craft a more inclusive and cosmopolitan transboundary future. I explore how such governmentalizing phantasms specifically inform attempts to create viable cross-border regions ( euregios) within the EU, and continue to gnaw at attempts to negotiate boundary disputes at the outer limits of the continent. In conclusion, a cautious rite of exorcism is ventured by engaging with the elusive anti-imperial cosmopolitanism of Frantz Fanon. </jats:p>",

A vast literature questions the adequacy of this territorial, container-based order in the face of increasingly global patterns of interaction. A remedy is sought in a cosmopolitanization of the political sphere, above all by establishing institutions and by strengthening forms of governance on the international or supranational level. This paper develops an alternative and complementary conception of cosmopolitanization, which stresses the representation of the external world within political institutions. Representative cosmopolitanism is a conception which offers a nonterritorially garbled political representation on a global scale in spite of the territorial organization of political institutions and the political sphere. Instead of overcoming the problematic kind of political exclusion which structures the modern political sphere by establishing new institutional levels, the paper aims to expand the sensitivity and thematic reach of existing political collectives. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Superplastic forming (SPF) is well known in aircraft production of Titanium and\nAluminium parts. The process technology is commercially interesting for small quantities. The\nadvantage of low upfront cost for the tooling is quickly lost however in conjunction with the longer\ncycle times of forming under purest SPF conditions. At given production rates typical for the aircraft\nindustry the technology has an economical advantage over conventional, ambient temperature sheet\nmetal forming processes. Compared to established processes the break-even point is at about 400 to\n4000 parts/year, depending on the metal alloy and the geometry. Transfer to high volume production\nas afforded by automotive production of niche products calls for a modified forming process and an\noptimisation of the production flow. One alternative for a modified process is called “Hot Gas\nPressure Forming” (HGPF). This process is very comparable to SPF, but the applied strain rates are\nmuch higher than recommended for SPF. HGPF can be applied in combination with a pre-forming\noperation done by cold or hot forming. The production line which has to be created to establish a\nconstant production flow of outerbody parts like doors, inner and outer, fenders, bonnet and trunklid,\ninner and outer and roof for a project with an annual production quantity of ~30 to 40 000 cars has\nbeen engineered on the basis of the material’s forming behaviour studies, process investigations, cost\nanalysis studies, etc. The elements of the production line like presses, interstockers, transportation ,\netc have been defined and placed with the help of a production simulation tool to get the best\nefficiency combined with suitable flexibility.</jats:p>"

We propose two production planning models that anticipate the impact of the changeovers in this batch processing problem. The first model is based on underestimating the effects of the changeovers that leads to an MILP problem of moderate size. The second model incorporates sequencing constraints that yield very accurate predictions, but at the expense of a larger MILP problem. To solve large scale problems in terms of number of products and reactors, or length of the time horizon, we propose a decomposition technique based on rolling horizon scheme and also a relaxation of the detailed planning model. Several examples are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed models. © 2007 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2007</jats:p>",

There is evidence of a more strategic approach to economic development and a stronger prioritisation of support. Whether this makes a difference to the Lisbon agenda depends on how the programme objectives are implemented as well as the broader regulatory and other changes required in National Reform Programmes.

They are often observations that exert an excessive influence on the results and lower our confidence in the estimations. As a consequence, the attention given to their identification and treatment in the context of time series is not surprising. Our intention in the present paper is to advance in this same direction but now focusing the discussion on the impact of outliers on cross-sectional specifications. In particular, we will analyse the behaviour of the most habitual misspecification tests in this field in the presence of outliers. With this objective, we present a series of analytical results that try to delimit the effects suffered by these statistics and complete the study with a Monte Carlo exercise designed to measure their effect more precisely. According to our results, the impact of outliers can be very important, especially when several coincide in the sample. </jats:p>",

Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production.

The geography of crime in developing world cities has been an underresearched area in part because of the lack of good-quality, geocoded offence data. In the case of São Paulo the availability of a new digital police dataset has provided the opportunity to improve our understanding of its crime patterns. The authors report the testing of hypotheses about the spatial variation in homicide rates. This variation is explained by poverty, situational conditions determined by differences in land use, and processes that indicate links with the geography of drug markets and the availability of firearms. </jats:p>",

In pointing towards the contextualised and institutionalised nature of sociopolitical action, the six dimensions of the state model is posited as a means of unravelling the constitution and ordering of the state within contemporary society. Specifically, the paper focuses on the potential of the six-dimension model to frame analysis of the strategic use of language in contemporary governance. This is illustrated through the model's application to New Labour's political regime as manifested in key government practices and policies, and the extension of the model to include analysis of the linguistic representation of the shift from a Keynesian welfare national state to a Schumpeterian workfare postnational regime. </jats:p>",

This odd transitional regime points toward some of the material underpinnings and mobile resistances that one finds in the recontainerization of rule in today's networks of globalist governance. It explores how various unbundled nonstatal organizations and postnational identities work through markets and multinational military interventions to displace the authority of current state structures in determining who rules whom, what is produced where, and how identities are maintained. </jats:p>",

It considers politics on national minority rights at different scales in the context of thoughts on postnationalisation and denationalisation of citizenship, which are mainly based on globalisation theories, and in the context of thoughts on shifts in the scales of state activity from a regulation theoretical perspective. The development of common rules on the rights of minorities at the global and European scales is examined and confronted with policies of the individual states. From a systematic analysis of all national minorities in the European Union it appears that common rules at higher scales still allow for considerable diversity. The differences can be attributed to different characteristics of the minorities themselves as well as of the states concerned. Both reflect the vital legacy of strongly different historical paths of nation-state formation in different parts of Europe. The outcomes are better fitting in a regulation theoretical perspective than in a globalisation theoretical perspective on the development of common rules on minority rights in Europe. </jats:p>",

Both research projects, one with 101 participants and the other with 600 participants, looked at youth community belonging, respectively focusing on problems connected to youth unemployment, on related resources (Arcidiacono, Sommantico, &amp; Procentese,<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"#bib10\">2001</jats:ext-link>), and finally on youth planning of future actions in the community (Arcidiacono, Di Napoli, &amp; Sarnacchiaro, submitted). A reinterpretation of the categories emerging from these studies was carried out, by first adopting the grounded theory methodology and subsequently the Prilleltensky (in press) approach of a greater conceptualization within the power frame. The classification undertaken suggests that the perception of a lack of youth power is closely linked to their expectations for the local community. A lack of individual and social power, rage and hopelessness is the core evidence among our interviewees. Powerlessness firstly denies empowerment, thus it is as if young people distance themselves from the context. The assumption of this perspective opens new paths through which promoting empowerment processes. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The Integral Assistance Program for Women's Health (PAISM) can be considered advanced for a country in development. Universal access for family planning is foreseen in the Brazilian legislation, but the services do not offer contraceptive methods for the population in a regular and consistent manner. Abortion is restricted by law to two cases: risk to the woman's life and rape. This reality favors the practice of unsafe abortion, which is the third largest cause of maternal death in Brazil. Legal abortion is regulated by the State and the procedure is performed in public health centers. However, there is resistance on the part of professionals to attend these women. Prenatal care is a priority strategy for promoting the quality of life of these women and of future generations. Nonetheless, it is still difficult for these women to access the prenatal care services and to have the required number of consultations. Moreover, managers and health professionals need to be made aware of the importance of implementing the actions indicated by the public policies in the area of sexual and reproductive health, favoring respect for autonomy in a context of personal freedom.</jats:p>",

The resultant infringements of critical human rights throw into focus the importance of housing as a social policy issue. Urban services are strained in Dhaka city. Urban management has been disrupted as a result of spatial encroachment and environmental degradation. In addition to land scarcity, land speculation and endemic corruption, the high price of land is also a product of the system of land registration. The dearth of valuable urban land, together with delays in urban planning and its implementation, have made the acquisition of land for housing prohibitively expensive for middle and low‐income households. Consequently, the quality of the housing environment is deteriorating. The problem of housing finance is intrinsically linked to its affordability, being currently the prerogative only of the affluent. This article delineates the inherent lack of integrated urban planning, the lacunae within institutions responsible for urban management – and, contextually, the nature of housing as a social policy issue, where reinforced, coordinated planning and administration could ensure distributive benefits even to the poor.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

However, majority of Grid workflow systems either do not support Quality of Service (QoS), or provide only partial QoS support for certain phases of the workflow lifecycle. In this paper we present Amadeus, which is a holistic service‐oriented environment for QoS‐aware Grid workflows. Amadeus considers user requirements, in terms of QoS constraints, during workflow specification, planning, and execution. Within the Amadeus environment workflows and the associated QoS constraints are specified at a high level using an intuitive graphical notation. A distinguishing feature of our system is the support of a comprehensive set of QoS requirements, which considers in addition to performance and economical aspects also legal and security aspects. A set of QoS‐aware service‐oriented components is provided for workflow planning to support automatic constraint‐based service negotiation and workflow optimization. For improving the efficiency of workflow planning we introduce a QoS‐aware workflow reduction technique. Furthermore, we present our static and dynamic planning strategies for workflow execution in accordance with user‐specified requirements. For each phase of the workflow lifecycle we experimentally evaluate the corresponding Amadeus components. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

The promotion scheme has the target to improve of the production conditions and to contribute for the convergence of the incomes within Europe. For the analysis of the effects are applicable a multiplicity of methods, which differ according to the economical range of the effects.

We present some selected results for the recipient countries, which come from the HERMIN models.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Approaching struggles for political representation through a perspective of ‘methodological transterritorialism’, we seek to make sense of recent developments evolving around a territorialised urban neighbourhood. Werderau, a garden suburb founded by a mechanical engineering company at the beginning of the 20th century, enjoyed relative protection from globalising frictions and struggles until the ‘world-in-motion’ suddenly penetrated the community a few years ago. We begin by charting the production of the bounded settlement as a site of alternate social ordering at a time of hyper-industrialisation and its imaginary role as a territorial heterotopia, symbolising order in a seemingly chaotic urban world. Turning to the owner's decision to sell the neighbourhood in 1998, we then argue that long-term inhabitants discursively frame the events following the decision as ‘transterritorial pollution’ of their bounded community, reflected in the commodification of their neighbourhood and in an ‘invasion’ of non-German home-owners. After discussing how longer term residents attempt to restabilise their identities by taking up a xenophobic discourse, we conclude by criticising policymakers for responding solely in a territorial logic and for one-sidedly taking up the discourse advanced by long-term residents. Instead, we advance a utopian vision of the city as a worldly site where people live under conditions of ‘transcultural Gleich-Gültigkeit’ in the double meaning of the German term: understood as being ‘indifferent’ towards the proximate other as well as referring to equality and equal rights. </jats:p>",

The low‐frequency normal modes are regarded as the collective degrees of freedom of the molecule. Geometric path planning algorithms are used to explore these collective degrees of freedom in order to find possible large‐amplitude conformational changes. To overcome the limits of the harmonic approximation, which is valid in the vicinity of the minimum energy structure, and to get larger conformational changes, normal mode calculations are iterated during the exploration. Initial results show the efficiency of our method, which requires a small number of normal mode calculations to compute large‐amplitude conformational transitions in proteins. A detailed analysis is presented for the computed transition between the open and closed structures of adenylate kinase. This transition, important for its biological function, involves large‐amplitude domain motions. The obtained motion correlates well with results presented in related works.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> European agriculture is undergoing major institutional changes, which are of great relevance to our understanding of the role of agriculture in rural development. They are also taking place in contexts in which agricultural development seems to be continuing within the traditional modernisation paradigm. This is the case for agriculture in Spain. The authors develop a theoretical scheme based on the concepts of institutional transactions and institutional arrangements which may be relevant across a variety of contexts. This approach is applied through an analysis of Spanish agriculture, concentrating on (a) changes introduced through the regulation of the environmental impacts of agriculture, (b) new schemes for the control of food quality and altered relations in the food-marketing chains, and (c) shifts deriving from changes to the major support mechanisms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Spanish agriculture is becoming increasingly embedded in the food-production process, and this is associated with a dissipation of property rights from the production sector. The analysis illustrates the usefulness of the approach, although identification of the specific nature of some institutional transactions remains uncertain. Applications in other countries and at more local levels will facilitate regional and international comparisons of the restructuring processes underway in differing contexts. </jats:p>",

The key results indicate that there is a high level of collaboration between and among city government and other levels of government in homeland security preparedness and planning, supporting an element of the adaptive management theory. However, with regard to using performance systems to gain accountability in homeland security this was not commonly occurring. The federal government's color‐coded homeland security advisory system is viewed by 32% of city managers who responded to the survey as being ineffective. The largest administrative/management homeland security concerns were lack of money and personnel limitations.</jats:p>",

Our findings suggest that family firms can benefit from emphasizing the positive aspects of kinship and from developing innovative capacities. As such, we demonstrate that not only do firm specific resources contribute to family firm performance, but also that family relationships can be a source of competitive advantage for a family firm. In addition, we found a heightened importance of reciprocal altruism in environments rich in technological opportunities, and that strategic planning is more important for those family firms that lack innovative capacities.</jats:p>",

A qualitative descriptive study was conducted to describe views of elderly Malaysians on Advanced Care Planning (henceforth ACP) and Advanced Directives (henceforth AD), and explore factors influencing these views. Fifteen elderly subjects with ages ranging from 65 to 83 years, representing different ethnic and religious groups in Malaysia were selected for in-depth interviews guided by a questionnaire. Five core themes were extracted from the interviews:1) Considering the future 2) Contingency plans for future illnesses 3) Attitudes towards life prolonging treatment procedures 4) Doctor-patient relationships and 5) Influence of religion on decisions related to future illness. Despite the lack of knowledge on ACP and AD, older respondents were very receptive to their concept. Although the majority agreed on the importance of planning for future medical management and having open discussion on end of life issues with their doctor, they felt it unnecessary to make a formal written AD. Most felt that the future was best left to fate or God, and none had made any contingency plan for severe future illnesses citing religion as reason for this view. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation and dialysis were considered by most to be invasive life prolonging treatments. We suggest that doctors initiate discussions on end of life care with every older patient and their family so as to promote awareness and introduce the concept of ACP/AD to a Malaysian setting.

Only 43% of the SK puréed diets provided more than 59 g/day of protein and none provided more than 78 g/day; in contrast, 87% and 40% of ON puréed diets provided more than 59 and 78 g/day of protein, respectively. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusions: In-house prepared puréed diets do not consistently provide sufficient protein levels to ensure a low risk of inadequacy for the LTC residents consuming these diets. </jats:p>",

Taiwan met its goal of decreasing its natural increase rate despite its young population, increasing numbers of women of childbearing ages, a strong preference for sons and a per capita income at the outset in 1963 of less than U.S.$200. Recognition of this achievement brought thousands of professionals, particularly from developing countries, to study the program firsthand: more than 3,000 during 1970–73 alone. This was matched by an avalanche of publications about the program that appeared around the world, written by practitioners, academics and others. This article tells the story of this success. </jats:p>",

Our weekly demand model incorporates price, reference price effects, seasonality, article availability information, features, and discounts. Building on previous research, we quantify demand interdependencies and integrate the resulting profit-lifting effects into the optimal pricing model. The methodology was developed and implemented at bauMax, an Austrian do-it-yourself retailer. Along with the practical requirements, an objective function was employed that can be used as a vehicle for implementing a retailer’s strategy. Eight pricing rounds with thousands of different stock-keeping units have each served as a testing ground for our approach. Based on various benchmarking methods, a positive impact on profit was reported. The currently implemented marketing decision-support system increased gross profit on average by 8.1 and sales by 2.1%. </jats:p>",

Para ello se usó la evaluación multicriterio en la definición de las variables críticas que determinan decisiones de manejo y en una segunda etapa, el programa Network2000, que utiliza un algoritmo heurístico asociado a un problema de redes, para abordar la planificación cuando no se cuenta con una infraestructura vial adecuada ni el patrimonio tiene una edad de cosecha establecida. Los principales resultados de este trabajo incluyen la determinación de variables de decisión, una zonificación del patrimonio según objetivos, la selección de la ruta óptima desde cada nodo de origen hasta el destino final, los costos variables fijos y totales para cada unidad de oferta, el costo promedio y el volumen que pasará por cada segmento de camino anualmente, el año de habilitación de los caminos y los beneficios totales del plan de cosecha.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Background: In response to the 2003 global outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and the threat of pandemic influenza, Canadian hospitals have been actively developing and revising their emergency plans. Healthcare workers are a particularly vulnerable group at risk of occupational exposure during infectious disease outbreaks, as seen during SARS and as documented/reported in the recent National Survey of the Work and Health of Nurses (Statistics Canada, 2006). Approximately one third of Canadian nurses identified job strain and poor health, related to their work environment. Three years after SARS, this article presents a critical analysis of the gaps of three hospital pandemic influenza plans in the context of established organizational supports for healthcare workers.Methods: Hospital pandemic influenza plans were obtained from institutional representatives in three Ontario cities. Qualitative gap analysis of these plans was conducted using a checklist of 11 support categories, developed from a review of existing literature and findings from a previous study of focus groups with emergency and critical nurses.Results: Support mechanisms were identified in the plans; however, gaps were evident in preparation for personal protective equipment, education, and informational support, and support during quarantine. Hospital emergency planning could be more robust by including additional organizational supports such as emotional/psychological support services, delineating management responsibilities, human resources, vaccine/ anti-viral planning, recognition/compensation, media strategies, and professional development.Conclusions: Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, hospitals have invested in pandemic planning, as evidenced by the comprehensive plans examined here. Organizational support mechanisms for healthcare workers were included in these hospital plans; however, the gaps identified here may have serious implications for employee health and safety, and overall response during a large scale infectious disease outbreak.

We describe a method for obtaining CT and PET images at separate acquisitions, which allows coregistration and incorporation of PET information into the radiotherapy (RT) planning process for non‐small‐cell lung cancer. The influence of PET information on RT planning was analysed for 10 consecutive patients. Computed tomography and PET images were acquired with the patient in an immobilization device, in the treatment position. Using specially written software, PET and CT data were coregistered using fiducial markers and imported into our RT planning system (Cadplan version 6). Treatment plans were prepared with and without access to PET/CT coregistered images and then compared. PET influenced the treatment plan in all cases. In three cases, geographic misses (gross tumour outside planning target volume) would have occurred had PET not been used. In a further three cases, better planning target volume marginal coverage was achieved with PET. In four patients, three with atelectasis, there were significant reductions in V20 (percentage of the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy or more). Use of coregistered PET/CT images significantly altered treatment plans in a majority of cases. This method could be used in routine practice at centres without access to a combined PET/CT scanner .</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Managing engineering projects is a complex activity involving multiskilled engineers, who have varying levels of capability in these skills. This paper outlines a preliminary approach to modelling and planning the composition of engineering project teams, taking into consideration the skills and capabilities of engineers and the nature of the project work to be undertaken. The approach includes a simple means of identifying engineers' skills and then quantifying their level of capability in these skills. Subsequently, the approach uses a genetic algorithm along with a task-to-engineer allocation strategy to establish how best to utilize the mix of skills and capabilities of the team of engineers assigned to the project under consideration. The approach also provides a means of identifying imbalances or shortfalls in skill and capability within a team, and the formulation of an appropriate development strategy to redress/overcome them. An application of the approach to an industrial case study is presented, which led to significant potential reductions in expected project duration and labour cost. These potential reductions could be achieved by appropriately modelling engineers' skills and capabilities, and redressing the imbalance within the team through proposed changes to its composition. </jats:p>",
