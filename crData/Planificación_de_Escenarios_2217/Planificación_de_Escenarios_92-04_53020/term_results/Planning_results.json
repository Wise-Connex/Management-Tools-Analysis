However, this protocol promises more than it delivers as a source of moral authority, and delivers more than it promises as a source of political power. The protocol simultaneously resolves and reproduces the liberal paradox between freedom and justice. Hence, the ambivalence planners frequently express about their encounters with power on the job may reflect their use of this protocol. </jats:p><jats:p> Two planning stories drawn from face-to-face interviews illustrate how two practitioners facing similar problems adopt different versions of the professional protocol to justify their actions. Analysis of each tale, using critical and postmodern theory, explores how the professional protocol excuses the exercise of power in ways that obscure the liberal paradox. A third planning story offers an example of how a practitioner handles the inherent tension of professional practice in a liberal society without using the professional protocol either to impose closure or to foster premature reassurance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One of the major social concerns at the turn of the twentieth century—how best to cope with massive urbanization and industrialization—stimulated the rise of modern American urban and regional planning. Most of those active in the nascent field of planning directed their efforts toward the receiving end of the population shift, the cities. But the changes in rural places, and especially the meaning of rural change for society as a whole, also received much attention. A variety of activities sprang up in the 1910s and '20s in an effort to strengthen rural institutions. In this article I focus on one category of those activities, the rural survey. The surveys are an important precursor to current approaches to rural socio-economic development planning: they highlight the key roles that culture and community play in the development process. </jats:p><jats:p> I first describe the perceived situation in rural America at the turn of the century. Next I discuss the development of the rural survey as a method to diagnose rural problems. I then examine one example of a rural survey, that done in Lane County, Oregon, in 1915 and '16. Finally, I consider the legacy of rural surveys—their impact on the development of planning for rural areas. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Maine's Growth Management law provides an opportunity to examine public attitudes about state-mandated local comprehensive planning. A survey revealed an overall favorable public reaction, but important differences appeared among some subgroups. It was apparent that some socioeconomic characteristics offered the best predictors of support for local comprehensive planning, although the literature is not consistent on this issue. Attitudes on related issues such as environmental spending and highway development were only weakly linked to those on comprehensive planning. The results suggest directions for public policy development in states considering passage of growth management laws. </jats:p>",

Rates will be highest where these incentives coincide and lowest where both are weak. Within this framework we examine the current low rate of adoption of day surgery in the National Health Service (NHS) of the United Kingdom (UK). We assess the current managerial incentives for the introduction of day surgery in terms of its potential either to achieve financial savings or to allow expansions in overall hospital caseload. These are both shown to have been low within the context of the traditional method of funding health care in the NHS. Clinical attitudes and their perceptions of the barriers to day surgery are examined based on data from a survey of 240 consultant surgeons. A high proportion of surgeons regard day surgery as clinically acceptable for a wide range of procedures, but the limited clinical appeal of day surgery procedures and the lack of day facilities have further limited its adoption. These findings are considered in the context of the revised methods of funding hospital services in NHS, introduced from April 1991. Priorities may change with managerial incentives playing a greater role in the introduction of new technologies and innovatory practices.</jats:p>",

We suggest that progressive planners can develop and implement redistributive plans under conditions of adversity. To do so, however, they must devise creative strategies that make sense in the context of the prevailing social and political environment by framing the issue in terms responsive to business concerns and by building consensus through the creative accommodation of competing interests. Consensus building, however, can succeed only if the courting of business interests is accompanied by the mobilization of a strong political movement and the building of coalitions in favor of redistributive programs. </jats:p>",

This microanalysis focuses attention on the departments of general surgery within four teaching hospitals in the State of Rajasthan in India. The analysis involves devising a costliness index, which then permits a ranking of hospitals according to their relative efficiencies. It is observed, generally, that all the study hospitals exceed their normative cost estimates on inpatient care. This is especially the case for two of the four hospitals, in respect of both fixed and variable costs. In the case of higher fixed costs, the cause seems to be a misallocation of resources resulting from high staffing levels, i.e. on the salaries of teaching or nursing staff. The variable costs are higher either on account of the high expenditure on supplies or on salary costs of common services. A further analysis was conducted to determine the presence or otherwise of inter‐unit efficiencies within the departments of general surgery, it revealed that inter‐unit differentials were mostly insignificant. More significantly, the study does suggest that expenditure efficiency on public health‐care in the hospitals studied could be enhanced through better budgetary management and cost control. This could be achieved, for instance, by enhancing the productivity of (human) resources, by checking wastages and leakages by means of appropriate monitoring, and through adoption as well as experimentation with methods of peer review and quality assurance.</jats:p>",

They also intended to expand further within the ‘90s in the same way. As such, it was necessary for the company to identify a control base for this growth. There were two particular requirements; firstly a corporate planning process that could fulfil this function, and secondly it required a predictive tool to be used in the corporate planning process in the form of a numerical model. It was necessary for both of these factors to include consistent standards across the company, and meet the needs of management and employees.</jats:p>",

The approach presented is also appropriate for other mining and extractive industries.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The paper demonstrates how individual expectation curves can be modified to reflect both technically and commercially recoverable reserves and how these are in turn combined into the economic valuation, planning and control processes of an enterprise. Estimates across the full range of risk and reserves can be aggregated to provide a powerful planning tool that can be used to set corporate, divisional and individual objectives. The way in which reserve estimates can be used as a sensitive control system to monitor an organisation's ongoing ability to meet its objectives is also demonstrated.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<p>This chapter addresses the question of how research on environmental assessment, cognition, and action can be utilized in the professional arenas of public policy, urban planning, and architectural design. Initially a discussion on three papers (Chapters 12, 13, and 14), the chapter attempts to extrapolate policy and design implications for the built environment from current knowledge on life-span developmental issues as represented by these three chapters. Suggestions of other research questions, issues, and strategies that might better inform policy and design are then discussed. In conclusion, the chapter briefly explores six general issues about the interaction of environmental cognition and research utilization. The contributions to this volume by Giovanna Axia, Erminielda Mainardi Peron, and Maria Rosa Baroni, by Lynn Liben, and by Roger Hart and Michael Conn have dealt heavily with child development and very little with aging or life-span development. Little evidence is presented from the gerontological and geriatric literatures, and less from the life-span literature. Liben presents a clear conceptualization of lifespan developmental approaches to environmental cognition, but to date there have been few studies and thus no data specifically on life-span developmental changes in environmental cognition. My chapter, therefore, will be weighted most heavily on the earlier phases of human development though, where feasible, it will comment on implications for the environment of elderly adults and on the environmental context of life-span developmental changes. Despite their titles and intentions, the three chapters focus most heavily on environmental cognition and much less on assessment and action. For example, after discussing the wide variety of possible definitions of assessment, including appraisal, evaluation, preferences, and attachment. Axia et al. focus most heavily on the cognitive aspects of schemata, representation, and organization of knowledge. Similarly, Hart and Conn valiantly take on the challenge of reporting on children's decision making and environmental behavior, but their empirical examples are also limited to cognitive and metacognitive issues. My chapter will thus also focus on environmental knowing. There are many interesting points of a theoretical and conceptual nature to raise about environmental assessment, cognition, and action from these three chapters, but this task is left to the other commentary chapter by Christopher Spencer.</p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine the character of what might be termed ‘Foucault's geography’, and in so doing I wish to respect the ‘otherness' of how Michel Foucault treats space and place rather than coopting his insights into a broader conceptualisation of the society-space nexus. In the first part of the paper I discuss the more theoretical dimensions to his geography, explaining how his vision of social life necessarily calls forth an alertness to ‘spaces of dispersion’, and here I draw upon both his ‘archaeological’ approach to history and his reading of Raymond Roussel. In the second part of the paper I discuss the more substantive dimensions of his geography, considering the way in which space and place enter centrally into his various historical studies. My account here is quite critical, highlighting a geometric turn that both overplays abstract spatial relations and underplays concrete place associations, but I still conclude that Foucault provides an evocative flavour of ‘substantive geographies' which squares with his claimed sensitivity to spaces of dispersion. My overall argument is that Foucault's geography emerges directly from his own suspicion of the certainties (the order, coherence, truth, reason) supposed by most historians and social scientists to lie at the heart of social life, and as such I think that it can be adjudged a ‘truly’ postmodern human geography in a manner that, say, Edward Soja's postmodern geographies cannot. We might not like this Foucauldian version of a postmodern human geography, but I think that there is much that we can learn from it, even if we then choose to retain our faith in a more obviously modernist conceptual, practical, and political geographical project. </jats:p>",

Calculation of absorbed-dose patterns for this treatment has traditionally involved complex computer programs incorporating algorithms designed to reconstruct the shape of the patient's head from computerized tomography (CT) images. A large proportion of the patients treated with SMART, however, have arteriovenous malformations for which angiography provides a better idea of lesion size and position than CT. This paper describes a computer program developed at St Bartholomew's Hospital which enables calculation of absorbed dose for a SMART treatment directly from angiographic radiographs, avoiding the need for CT. The program is compared with the existing CT-based treatment planning program.</jats:p>",

Two major components are incorporated into the model. The first of these describes the oft-cited externalization process among industrial firms, where in-house service provision is selectively abandoned in favor of out-sourcing. The second component describes a vendor location process based on profit maximization, where buyers and sellers are optimally located relative to one another. Normative modeling propositions are then compared with current empirical streams in the literature on producer-service location, the role of manufacturing demand, and the process of selective vertical disintegration among industrial firms. The paper is concluded with a brief research agenda for modeling the intraurban locational behavior of specialist firms in the producer services. </jats:p>",

We also analyze the relations between the optimal quantities to order and to commit, the expected amount received and production capacity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> For a number of authors, the term deconstruction has come to signify an ‘interruption’ within the constitutive discourses of contemporary human geography. Specifically, a deconstructive event is said to mark a site where the coherent and legitimate linking of geographical phrases can no longer be maintained. It should come as no surprise, therefore, to discover that the deconstructive event of ‘interruption’ has been drawn upon as a device capable of marking the limit beyond which modern geography cannot go. Paradoxically, however, it is precisely upon the basis of this absolutely unbreachable limit that one can begin to think about a site which is nevertheless beyond it. Postmodernity is the name usually given to this ‘site’ beyond the ‘interruption’ of modernity. Whether or not one is for or against the attempted passage from the horizons of modernity, one will nevertheless have sought to have done with the event of ‘interruption’ itself. At its simplest, deconstruction is the reversible pathway, or pivot, which connects the modern with the postmodern. This, at least, is what the dialecticians have told us. Within this paper, the texts of Derrida and Lyotard will be drawn upon in order to argue that deconstruction and postmodernism have nothing to do with the passage from modernity into postmodernity. Specifically, it will be argued that the dialectical understanding of the term ‘interruption’ betrays a serious imprecision within our understanding of modernity itself. Ultimately, there will have been neither ‘interruption’ nor ‘pivot’ within the course of this paper, only the interminable vacillation of an interruption without interruption. </jats:p>",

While the incorporation of distributional considerations into CBA would appear to have made it more sensitive to gender differentials, the article argues that it is limited by a number of factors. These include both its own methodological biases, such as the bias towards marketed activities and quantifiable indicators, as well as the political economy of gender at different stages of the project cycle. Empirical examples from both First and Third World contexts are drawn on to demonstrate how these biases work in practice. The article concludes that CBA is best suited to interventionist, rather than participatory projects; to efficiency, rather than equity goals; and, where equity is the goal, to women's practical needs rather than their strategic gender interests.</jats:p>",

But this seemed to suggest a totalising change in our space-time regimes or ‘social spatialisations’ which does not fit with everyday experiences of contemporary life. There is a continuity of most aspects of social spatialisation (which, denying locality and regionalism, once unified the empire of Western modernity). Yet, even small shifts may have notable impacts. If “space makes a difference” (Sayer), it is more important than ever to go on to specify what is different about space and spatiality today. Only changes in the spatialisation of presence and absence (a dialectic which was at the heart of modernity) can be empirically demonstrated. The distinction between modernity and postmodernity must be argued on this basis. After a survey of ‘what remains the same’, postmodern spatial differences, and why they matter are approached via a meditation on our relation to Others who bring the far-off and exotic into the cosy, local world of our everyday lives. The collapse of presence and absence, correlated with an everyday synthesis of proximity and remoteness; near and far; past, future, and present suggest the erasure of a set of cultural oppositions which structured the social imaginary, representations, and practices. Modernist, spatialised oppositions such as public-private, insider-outsider, and subject-object are changed, affecting the nature of the public sphere, forcing new ethical perspectives on community membership, and new understanding of our relationship to Others and to the environment. </jats:p>",

These spatial references are not entirely figurative, but allude to our positioning within particular contexts, which both frame and are constructed by our texts. Thus, Probyn's dialogue inevitably raises geographical questions. Moreover, geography is not merely a passive, unnamed party through which Probyn's dialogue is conducted; it is not immune from or in any way ‘outside’ the situatedness its terminology is employed to articulate. In this context, the metaphorical maps Probyn uses to find her way between the differing terrains of feminism and postmodernism are far from neutral, truthful, transparent representations. In this paper an extension of Probyn's travels at the boundaries between feminism and postmodernism is sought by introducing a more active, self-critical geographical voice. The often hidden tensions underlying the linkages between geography, postmodernism, and feminism are explored, and key issues at the interface between critical human geography and feminist deconstruction are brought to the fore. </jats:p>",

In this paper we are concerned with the structure of the debate over modernism and postmodernism in geography. We feel we are being asked to take a position, for (or against) modernism and against (or for) postmodernism. We have different reasons for refusing the politics of this choice. Both of us take a separate route to this refusal, as shown in this paper. Some words of warning are necessary before we begin. Given the broad scope of this paper, it will be obvious that some liberties will have to be taken in the presentation. We hope that these limitations will be excused by readers sympathetic to the underlying purpose of the paper, which is to invite the most general of debates on this topic<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup>. In this vein, we conclude that there are more possibilities for critical and subversive geography than we are being allowed. </jats:p>",

In Canada, the deinstitutionalization of patients attempted to shift the locus of care from provincial psychiatric hospitals to general hospital psychiatric units. This resulted in the isolation of provincial psychiatric hospitals, general hospital psychiatric units and community mental health programs, with little overall accountability for the services provided — three solitudes. To move toward the creation of responsible, integrated systems a number of issues must be addressed: target population(s); the roles of provincial psychiatric and general hospitals; community support services; continuity of care; co-morbidity; consumerism; and methods of integration. In the development of a comprehensive mental health plan, each issue should be recognized and decisions made which are in keeping with current knowledge. A companion report will survey Canadian initiatives in mental health planning and discuss approaches to many of the issues identified. </jats:p>",

Closer inspection shows, however, a complex pattern of change, in which port location is only one factor. The evidence of the port data, when considered in conjunction with evidence on transport costs and other factors, suggests that theories of the centralisation of production miss much of importance; competitive efficiency can generally compensate for any transport-cost disadvantages arising from location. </jats:p>",

The two migration matrices indicate that counterurbanization at the level of regional planning areas was not present in 1977 but started in 1978 and it was present in 1983.

Combining the two approaches in a spiral approach will result in a synergistic effect, because of the interaction of both approaches. The results of both methods suggest that qualitative methods enhanced the generation of ideas and theories. Qualitative methods were used to formulate ideas for improving quantitative data gathering, analyzing and comparing ideas with respect to program development, and for testing the internal validity of a quantitative design. The quantitative method enabled testing of results in different groups and detecting detailed differences. It also provided information that one of the assumptions of the program, the development of a teacher independent program, was not completely realized. The major advantage of using both methods is that this provides feedback between assumptions and data, thus enhancing comparison of results and critical reflection during the whole project. </jats:p>",

Successive linear programming (SLP) type methods have been widely used for solving these planning problems. But, it has long been recognized that the simplex method used in solving linear programs requires a large number of iterations for staircase/band diagonal structured problems. In this paper, we report results of an application of a recently developed interior point method that promises to be many times faster than the simplex method for multi‐period planning problems. However, to facilitate the use of interior point method in the current SLP algorithms a hybrid method combining the interior point method and the simplex method is developed. Therefore, the results determined with this hybrid method are qualitatively equivalent to that obtained with the simplex method alone. The CPU times corresponding to the hybrid method are compared with the CPU times of simplex and dual affine methods. The new hybrid method generates a <jats:italic>basic feasible solution</jats:italic> of the linear programming problem and is approximately <jats:italic>7 times faster</jats:italic> than the simplex method on the tested planning problems.

Thus, an economically meaningful trajectory is assured for any given starting point. This topic is properly discussed in the present paper, with the realistic case that the capital coefficient matrix is singular and each sector uses at least one capital good in its productive process being considered. Moreover, the stated results are applied to the Italian economy for 1985 by utilizing the intersectoral matrices calculated on the basis of the most recent input-output data. </jats:p>",

The first step of the proposed methodology is to obtain an assessment of the natural resources available to agriculture. The GIS is used to delineate land-use conflicts and provide reliable information on the natural-resource database. This is followed by combining the data on natural resources with other quantifiable information on available labour, market forecasts, technology, and cost information in order to estimate the economic potential of the agricultural sector. LP is used in this step. Finally, the GIS is applied again to map the crop and land-allocation patterns generated by the LP model. The results are concrete suggestions for resource allocation, farm-size mix, policy application, and implementation projects. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>The East Vacuum Grayburg/San Andres Unit (EVGSAU), operated by Phillips Petroleum Company, is the site selected for a comprehensive evaluation of the use of foam for improving the effectiveness of a CO2 flood. The four-year project is jointly funded by the EVGSAU Working Interest Owners (WIO), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), and the State of New Mexico. The Petroleum Recovery Research Center (PRRC), a division of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (NMIMT), is providing laboratory and research support for the project. A Joint Project Advisory Team (JPAT) composed of technical representatives from numerous major oil companies provides input, review, and guidance for the project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The EVGSAU, located about 15 miles northwest of Hobbs in Lea County, is the site of the first full-scale miscible carbon dioxide injection project in the state of New Mexico. The 5000-acre CO2 project is divided into three water-alternating-gas (WAG) areas where CO2 injection was initiated in September of 1985. A 2:1 WAG ratio was chosen so that while CO2 is injected into one area, water is injected into the other two areas of approximately equal pore volumes. After each fourth month of operation, CO2 injection is rotated into another WAG area.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>While tertiary oil response at the EVGSAU is very favorable, some wells are showing excessive CO2 breakthrough, thereby increasing CO2 recycling and compression costs. This project includes a field demonstration of the use of foam to reduce the mobility of the injected CO2, reduce excessive CO2 production, improve the volumetric sweep efficiency of the injected CO2, and increase the incremental oil recovery from the tertiary project. Thus, a suitable pattern in the EVGSAU was selected, based on the criterion that the production there be typical of other patterns without a distinctly better- or worse record of CO2 breakthrough than in the rest of the field. An observation well was drilled in the pattern; location of this well is approximately 150 ft from the pattern injection well. The observation well was cored and logged to improve reservoir characterization in the pattern area, as well as to provide reservoir cores for laboratory tests with suitable foam-generating surfactants. In- order to use the borehole as a logging monitor well, the bottom 800 ft was cased with fiberglass.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The objective of this four-year project is to conduct reservoir studies, laboratory tests, simulation runs, and field tests to evaluate the use of foam for mobility control- or fluid diversion in a CO2 flood. A geological characterization of the pilot area and surrounding patterns has been assembled for the history matching and reservoir simulation studies that are in progress. The foam-flood mechanistic model developed at the PRRC is being incorporated into the field-scale reservoir simulator.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper summarizes the project plans, the baseline field testing, and the laboratory test results that pertain to surfactant selection. This overview provides a background for subsequent papers that will report on various aspects of the project.</jats:p>",

However, it is very difficult for many users to find a suitable solution for their problem. Although working groups, discussing and formulating safety standards for industrial robots, were already formed in various countries at a very early time, it is apparent that safety at the industrial robot workstation cannot be achieved solely by observing regulations, but can only be guaranteed if it is included from the outset in the overall system concept and layout as a planning criterion, and practical planning aids for health and safety aspects are provided to the designer.</jats:p>",
