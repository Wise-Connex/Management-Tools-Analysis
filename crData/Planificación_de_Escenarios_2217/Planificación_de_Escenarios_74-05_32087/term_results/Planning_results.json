Two groups of pressure independent well and reservoir characteristics, incorporated in the equation describing the inflow performance, are used as matching parameters. parameters. Thus derived, the well-performance description is not only accurate for medium- and long-term planning, but it also gives an idea of the inflow performance of a well, without flowing bottom hole pressure surveys being necessary.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The Groningen gas field (proven ultimate recovery 1,900 × 10(9) m3) was discovered in 1959. The location of the field in the north east of Holland is shown in figure 1. The reservoir, lying in the Rotliegendes Sandstone at a depth of about 3,000 m, is mainly bounded by faults and is also in contact with a number of limited aquifers. In the structurally high south the reservoir is completely dry, whereas in the northern part the gas is underlain by bottom water. The permeability of the gas zone is several hundred mD.

The later clusters were located in the centre of the field, each having, an initial capacity of about 24 million m3/d, obtained with 11 wells.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The lay-out of a cluster is shown in figure 2.

Many operators are thus tempted to utilize an onshore-type flow sheet with primary emphasis on selection of components to minimize size and weight requirements. There are some special considerations, however, that require additional careful thought. The primary purpose of this paper is to review some of these purpose of this paper is to review some of these considerations based upon our recent involvement in large offshore installations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Most of the producing experience to date has been onshore or in rather shallow offshore waters like those off the coast of Louisiana or in Lake Maracaibo. When planning and designing a production installation in an area like the northern sector of the North Sea (where deep water and bad weather abound), there are special decisions to be made. The very severity of the environment makes this fairly obvious. In reality, each offshore installation will be different to some degree and each requires a few special decisions regardless of location.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>We begin with this point because people are prone to use their past experience as a \"hitching prone to use their past experience as a \"hitching post\" instead of a guidepost. Too often, those post\" instead of a guidepost. Too often, those with experience tend to simply take a familiar onshore system and reproduce it offshore, with only the minimum modifications required by space and weight limitations. This is logical—to a point. The use of proven components and equipment makes sense, provided they are used imaginatively.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>The other boundary of our problem is dictated by the amount and location of current activity. A large amount of engineering work is being performed by people with little experience in the petroleum industry. It is not as easy as it appears to translate experience with power plants, chemical plants, and the like to plants, chemical plants, and the like to offshore production. A design may be good from a technological viewpoint and yet may be an operational nightmare. However, designs by inexperienced persons (petroleum production-wise) often contain imaginative features production-wise) often contain imaginative features with real merit. Likewise, some equipment suppliers with no traditional petroleum history have much to offer.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Our problem is to blend experience with imagination in a very careful manner. This is no easy task and requires judgment based on both experience and an understanding of prevailing (and potentially new) technology.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Further evidence is found in town plans prepared through support of federal “701” funds during the past decade. These plans are usually for expansion of urban facilities and services and ignore exclusively rural land uses. Planning in England presents a contrast. It is appropriately referred to as “town and country planning” as it covers the range of land use intensities from agricultural to the highest value urban block as interrelated and interconnected parts of a single fabric.</jats:p>",

A brief survey of the developments of the farm planning models is given. This seems to indicate dissatisfaction with the neo‐classical paradigm of the profit maximising firm for practical research and advisory purposes. The behavioural approach is recognised as an alternative, but a production based approach is favoured in the light of experience. Thus a model is offered which is based on the concepts of the business momentum of a firm, and the target levels of economic technical efficiency, which latter are seen as the fundamental generators and sustainers of this momentum.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p>VERS UNE MÉTHODE PLUS DYNAMIQUE DE PLANIFICATION DES EXPLOITATIONS AGRICOLES ‐ UN MODÈLE DE L'ENTREPRISE AGRICOLE FONDÉ SUR LA TECHNIQUE</jats:p><jats:p>L'expérience pratique de l'auteur dans les techniques de gestion tend à soutenir le principe consistant à concevoir un modèle d'entreprise agricole reposant sur le facteur fondamentalement endogène de l'efficacité technique économique, plutôt que sur le facteur partiellement exogéne de la rentabilité.

Considerations must be given to staffing, budget, curriculum, materials, and models, as well as to the development of understanding and good communication with the home and among all staff members directly involved or in peripheral areas. Seven years of experience with such a program in a residential setting has produced observed profitable results. </jats:p>",
