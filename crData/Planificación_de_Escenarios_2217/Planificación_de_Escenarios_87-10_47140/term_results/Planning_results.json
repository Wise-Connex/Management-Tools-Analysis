Recent additions to the urban literature of the New South suggest, however, that its planning legacy can be traced back to the early I 900s and that it was a tremendously fertile groundfor prominent national planning consultants. Although distinctive regional traits influenced the planning style in southern cities, New South urban planning conformed to the mainstream of the emerging profession. In many respects, particularly over the past three decades, the South has been an innovator in planning, although planning history literature has yet to address carefully many of these emerging trends. </jats:p>",

Problems stemfrom the administrative structures and styles of implementing bureaucracies that make programs inaccessible to the poor or unresponsive to their needs. Three mechanisms for making program planning and implementation more responsive are social analysis, citizen participation, and decentralization. After analyzing the administrative context in which planning and implementation of programs takes place, this article surveys the large and scattered literature on the arguments for and against these three approaches to reform. </jats:p>",

The paper begins by comparing the ories of education, explaining what is meant by the radical approach, and arguing for the adoption of such an approach in planning education. A well-known conceptual model of experiential learning is briefly out lined, that of D. A. Kolb, and an illustrative example is given of a particular experience: an intensive five-day workshop which formed the core of a planning course for third- year students at the University of Melbourne. Reflecting upon their own experience, the authors propose a modification to Kolb's model in line with the radical approach. Fi nally they discuss the implications of adopting such an approach in a con ventional academic setting. </jats:p>",

One crucial fac tor inducing past change was the great increase, following World War II, of planning jobs in public plan ning agencies, a development which enabled planners to end their depen dence on foster parent professions such as landscape architecture. A second major factor was the progres sive divergence of the scientific in terests and societal responsibilities of planners from those of their parent professions. A third factor was the increasing number of planning school alumni interested in establish ing their control over the profes sion's entry standards. While ac knowledging the limits of this single Illinois case, the authors hazard sev eral hypotheses concerning the sources of change in American plan ning education in general. </jats:p>",

This judgement is too sweeping. A simulated case example is presented, starting with baseline health expenditure data that are representative of the situation in many developing countries. It is assumed that real economic growth occurs and that government funding of health care is allowed to grow in parallel. Two annual growth rates are considered: 2 and 5 per cent. Two restrictive conditions are applied: none of the main health services is subjected to absolute cuts; and, additional funds from existing or new sources of finance are not considered. It is shown that, even with slow growth rates, substantial increases in the funding of priority (rural and PHC) services can be achieved if the growth in expenditures of lower‐priority services is curtailed. Also, savings from improved health service efficiency can be channelled to priority services.</jats:p><jats:p>The message is that the PHC approach is viable even with slow economic growth. What is required is the <jats:italic>technical capacity</jats:italic> to identify and plan resource flows in the health sector, and the <jats:italic>political will</jats:italic> to effect resource allocations according to PHC priorities. A strategic policy like PHC should not be ‘adjusted’ out of effective existence because of reversible economic problems. Rather, actions should be taken to reverse the adverse economic environment. International health‐related agencies should continue to support countries to develop national health systems based on PHC, and should campaign for reforms in the world economy to create at least the minimum economic conditions necessary for PHC implementation.</jats:p>",

The hypothesis is tested by comparing the dispersion of growth of employment in retail trade in the Philadelphia urban field with that in the area covered by the North Carolina Piedmont dispersed city. The results obtained by using a distance–temporal regression model support the hypothesis that the dispersion of growth in the surrounding area of cluster of cities is wider, and more equitably spread, in comparison with the situation in the case of a single-centered region. This finding suggests that the multiplicity of urban centers in a given region, traditionally viewed as a drawback to a successful application of the growth-center policy, has certain advantages in the long run. Therefore when growth-center policy is applied, it should not be carried out too fiercely to the detriment of other surrounding urban communities. On the contrary, policies geared toward the survival of non-growth-center urban places may yield rewards in the future in the form of wider and more equitable spread of growth throughout the entire region. </jats:p>",

However, county level housing data can be assembled an nually at minimal cost. The Annual Housing Report for Kentucky has presented such data since 1979, in cluding various household and hous ing estimates. The data are derived directly from administrative records or from estimation models that in corporate administrative data. Esti mation models have been developed for households (by age of house holder and type of household), me dian family income, and mobile home shipments. No primary data collection is involved. Planners out side Kentucky can use these models and similar data to monitor housing trends, conduct market analysis, and analyze housing affordability, short ages, and production patterns. </jats:p>",

Limitations on the types of information available for monitoring regional performance are discussed, in the context of the main functions which a routine information service may be expected to fulfill. English and Welsh routine data are used in a study of the utilisation of general hospital psychiatric beds, and then compared with similar data for Czechoslovakia. The findings suggest that regional equity in the provision of beds: as measured by the coefficient of variation of the bed supply rate, and national performance, as measured by the ‘marginal throughput’ of these beds; is superior in Czechoslovakia despite recent additions to such beds in England and Wales. The model of utilisation, which was used to assess national performance, may be used to identify the regions whose performance is substandard when compared to other regions or countries. Finally, the relevance of these proposals for monitoring Health Service performance generally is discussed.</jats:p>",

Criteria for choice of tracer condition are given, and illuminated with reference to fractured neck of femur. The method has been developed in the context of the European Collaborative Health Services Studies, and participants from five countries have been involved. It is concluded that the method is practicable and succeeds in its objectives. The role of health care managers is one of stimulus and support to doctors and nurses who might be interested in carrying out such studies, and a set of stages from the initial idea for a study, through study design and data collection to conclusions for practical change, is described.</jats:p>",

Because of its mixed nature, it can be expressed either in terms of Cartesian coordinates or at joint level.</jats:p><jats:p>Whatever the approach adopted, the optimum path planning problem can be formulated as the problem of minimizing the overall time (taken as objective function) subject to behavior and side constraints arising from physical limitations and deviation error bounds. The paper proposes a very general optimization algorithm to solve this problem, which is based on the concept of mixed approximation.</jats:p><jats:p>A numerical application is presented which demonstrates the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm.</jats:p>",

Although this approach is characteristic of operations research, the profession's direct involvement in agricultural planning has been limited: much of the published work is associated with agricultural economics. In this paper, we provide an OR-oriented introduction to the problems involved in agricultural planning, particularly at the farm level. We describe the planning problems of both the crop and livestock sectors and outline the models that have been proposed for solving these problems. Researchers, and agricultural extension and advisory services, have been the main users of these models, but the widespread availability of microcomputers gives considerable scope for developing models for use by farmers. </jats:p>",

It is then shown how value is measured, when there is joint production, fixed capital, and choice of technique; the methods explicitly treat the time structure of production and emphasise that only expected values can be measured. Measures of the performance of the capitalist system are derived; and the relationship of value measures to price measures is stated.

The concept consists in effects which include: an increase in the unevenness of developmental potential between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ British regions, growing polarisation in income and unemployment indices over space, a shift towards economies of scope by producers, a growing dynamism in localities with large service-class components displaying a privatistic consumption culture, and a growth of casualised and informal labour-market opportunities at the expense of ‘lifetime’ employment. This contrasts with a set of processes characteristic of what may be termed the ‘modernisation’ period circa 1945–1975 in which there was a relatively even spread of developmental opportunities across regional space, there was income and employment convergence, production pursued volume markets and economies of scale, collective consumption provision was socially predominant and employment was relatively secure.

One can start with few approximately specified joint displacement values, or from a joint displacement‐time function which is not entirely satisfactory. The final joint displacement‐time function passes through the initial and final points, and lies in the vicinity of the intermediate approximate points; it also passes through some points which are in the joint dwell ranges. It is important that the final trajectory exhibit little deviation from the desired displacement values. One would also want to obtain a smooth joint acceleration function, and a rapidly declining envelope for the harmonic spectrum. This new method of trajectory planning is based upon the use of the mathematical operation of convolution. It was found that the use of convolution on a given joint displacement time function tended to decrease the peak acceleration amplitudes, while producing a smooth acceleration function. Convolution also reduced the frequency spectrum amplitudes associated with the joint functions, thus reducing the severity of vibrations which can be induced by the joint motion. While there are some drawbacks to this method, such as increased deviations at intermediate points after convolution, it will be shown that these may be reduced by using techniques described in this article.</jats:p>",

A shift toward high‐volume batch and continuous flow processes within American manufacturing has given rise to increasing numbers of crew‐loaded facilities. A majority of AP approaches incorporate continuous decision variables and require frequent adjustments to both production and work‐force settings. Despite the availability and diversity of these approaches, few significant applications have been reported. This paper presents the detailed development of a discrete AP switching rule that can be applied to a variety of cost environments. Inventory costs are estimated using an interval approach rather than traditional point estimates. The model allows incorporation of overtime options and is interactive in nature. Decision variables from the model can be disaggregated and linked directly to lower‐level planning activities. Actual results of model implementation are reported. An overview of the model's incorporation into the larger context of hierarchical production planning is found in [21].</jats:p>",

However, the competing destinations model recently developed by Fotheringham is the first ray of hope for a solution. In this paper, the empirical validity of Fotheringham's model is examined using data of migration and of university enrollment among Japanese prefectures. It becomes clear that the origin-specific estimates of the distance-decay parameter, calibrated from the production-constrained model, are, on the whole, less negatively biased. It is also confirmed that the dominance of the agglomeration effect for one set of data, and of the competition effect for other sets of data, are the sources of the misspecification issue. The empirical implications are discussed. </jats:p>",

The findings seem to reflect the breakdown in local compliance with the Act. This can be related to the major restructuring of some sectors of retail capital.

The model tracks revenue, expense, and faculty effort in each of the three primary medical school activities and estimates, for any given change in the amount or configuration of faculty effort among these activities, the associated financial effects on both the institution and the individuals themselves over a one- to five-year planning horizon. One innovative feature of the model is that it incorporates economically based functions that capture the effect on revenue of factors such as faculty “effort,” price increases, demand elasticity, market saturation, and changes in number of faculty members. We describe the implementation of the model for a major department at Stanford University Medical School (SUMS), and explore a number of sample policy issues, using data from that department as well as from another department at SUMS. We also describe the implementation of the model in evaluating the financial effects of a proposed organ transplantation program at SUMS. </jats:p>",

The concept consists in effects which include: an increase in the unevenness of developmental potential between ‘inner’ and ‘outer’ British regions, growing polarisation in income and unemployment indices over space, a shift towards economies of scope by producers, a growing dynamism in localities with large service-class components displaying a privatistic consumption culture, and a growth of casualised and informal labour-market opportunities at the expense of ‘lifetime’ employment. This contrasts with a set of processes characteristic of what may be termed the ‘modernisation’ period circa 1945–1975 in which there was a relatively even spread of developmental opportunities across regional space, there was income and employment convergence, production pursued volume markets and economies of scale, collective consumption provision was socially predominant and employment was relatively secure.

High‐placed stoma, flexed cervical position, and short, obese necks are predisposing anatomic relationships, in some long‐standing tracheostomies, progressive erosion of the upper anterior tracheal wall and cricoid arch is observed, often with secondary subglottic stenosis. No discussion of measures to prevent or correct these problems was found in a review of the literature. This article discusses surgical techniques to (1) prevent laryngotracheal erosion and (2) repair and reconstruct an airway that is already damaged. A superiorly based tracheostomy flap and a muscular sling are designed to buttress the tracheostomy. Results and follow‐up are also reported.</jats:p>",

There is potential as well for using such algorithms for teaching and counseling in the preventive services, especially in family planning services. The employment of paramedical or lesser trained workers in family planning or management requires careful attention to skill development in all phases of training. The use of graphically presented algorithms may simplify this process of skill development. In addition, the algorithms provide guidelines for use in the field by those providing family planning services, and for program management and supervision. Examples of algorithms used in paramedical services are presented. The development of two algorithms are discussed in detail, 1) an algorithm for introduction of contraceptives during lactation, and 2) an algorithm for supervision of data collection. </jats:p>",
