Despite\n      almost 20 years of vigorous effort and the expenditure of about one\n      billion rupees and some 70 million U.S. dollars, family planning has\n      achieved no tangible decrease in fertility rates. Pakistan has a\n      population of about 75 million today and this is expected to double by\n      the year 2000. To put the matter quite bluntly, the family planning\n      effort has not succeeded. Discouragement, disillusionment and\n      recrimination threaten to replace the earlier enthusiasm and optimism\n      among supporters of the programme. But while such emotional reactions\n      are under¬standable they are not helpful. What will be useful is a\n      careful review of these years of experience to learn whatever is there\n      to be learned, for population planning in Pakistan will go\n      on.</jats:p>"

If the partnership is to operate a community centre that is architecturally acceptable, free from vandalism, well patronised and economically viable, then negotiations should reflect these broader aims and not be conducted as pure horse‐trading over initial terms.

It was promoted by the History of Planning Group which has been meeting at the University of Birmingham under the direction of Professor G. Cherry and has provided both a forum for discussion and a means of contact between scholars working in this field. Organised by Dr. A. Sutcliffe, the conference brought together academics and practising planners from Europe, North America and Japan for five days of lectures, discussions and excursions. The proceedings were opened by Sir John Summerson who examined \"The Sources of John Nashfs Plans for Regent's Park.11 He not only reminded the conference that it was often necessary to delve back in time and search widely for the origins of town planning concepts and models, but also introduced visitors to the immediate urban environment in which the conference would be taking place. The relationship between such individual schemes and the general growth of planning traditions and attitudes, and the parallelism of such developments in different countries was the theme of the second of the introductory addresses from Professor G. Albers. In his lecture on \"Town Planning in Germany: Change and Continuity Under Conditions of Political Turbulence,\" he reflected on these parallels which he saw as emanating from the common experiences affecting the industrial nations, notably the economic depression of the 1930s, the strength of planning1s professional and technical tradition and the growing international exchange of ideas and information. In the subsequent discussion it became clear that consideration of these international differences and parallels would provide the dominating themes of the conference. </jats:p>",

The diffusion process depends upon the flow of information about the message from prior adopters. Two cases are identified: (1) in which adopters are individuals within cities, so that information relevant to adoption may flow from adopters in one city to other individuals in that city, and (2) in which the city is the adopting unit, so that information relevant to adoption may only arrive from other adopter cities. In both cases an approximation must be made in order that the differential equations can be solved. The simpler case is case (1), which is analysed fully; calculations reveal a close negative relationship between the total interaction into a city and the mean and variance of the time of arrival of the message in that city. Case (2) can only be solved in series form, and so the second paper in this set examines this case numerically. </jats:p>",

Generally, master water plans include analyses of supply and demand, descriptions of existing facilities, and proposed construction programs. Although many master water plans do consider the potential effects of future conditions, recent advances in technology and changing social concerns are beginning to exert a significant influence on the future course of water system development. Some of the new considerations which should be incorporated into municipal water system planning include the Safe Drinking Water Act, coordination with wastewater planning, wastewater reclamation and reuse, water conservation, environmental concerns, energy utilization, financial constraints, and changing public attitudes. In order to provide a responsive and effective framework for future planning of municipal water systems, the influence of these new considerations must be carefully evaluated in conjunction with traditional planning concerns.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A new management strategy for Ontario fisheries was addressed by a federal–provincial task force in 1974–76. It was initiated in an atmosphere of concern over the deteriorating status of fish stocks in Ontario, and indeed elsewhere in Canada. The task force published interim documents on \"Goals and Issues,\" on \"Mandates,\" and on \"Objectives.\" These received limited distribution for criticism. This report summarizes the proposed \"Strategy.\" Speaking generally, it has become abundantly clear that our traditional approach to fisheries management — development-oriented, exploitive, open access — is no longer appropriate in the 1970s and 1980s. That approach, together with the accelerating impacts of land and water uses that conflict with fisheries, has resulted in serious losses in our resource base, particularly during the past two or three decades. A new approach to fisheries management, characterized generally by maintenance in the north and by rehabilitation in the south is now essential. Much of the scientific and technical knowledge needed for the new approach is already available. To apply that knowledge, and to achieve the new knowledge and current data series necessary to its application, a major new initiative is necessary. That initiative, though costly in comparison to past levels of expenditure, seems easily justified in terms of the current economic value of the resources. Furthermore, additional values attributable to fisheries resources are now gaining wide acceptance; e.g. healthy fish communities are indicators of healthy aquatic environments. The new initiative will require more than just funding. It will require the evolution of different value systems, and of new and/or more explicit policies regarding— a new level of public participation;— a \"user pays\" policy in place of the free access philosophy of the past — to meet some of the increased cost of managing the resource;— more limited access and increased emphasis on protection in place of the open access, common property approach of the past;— explicit recognition that \"experimental management\" is needed to gain the new knowledge necessary to manage;— recognition that management of fisheries requires greater attention to environmental quality matters;— explicit allocation of those parts of the resource base available for commercial and for recreational use;— new working arrangements between fisheries agencies and other institutions. </jats:p>",

The implications of the model are that developer behaviour is a reaction to the constraints imposed by the various government and institutional regulations and that his particular location preferences are conditioned by these. These constraints have spatial implications because the behavioural processes underlying the developer's reaction to them provide important insights into the changing spatial form of the city. </jats:p>",
