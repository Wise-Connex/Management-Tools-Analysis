In this paper we address the problems and potential of such systems, particularly in relation to the analytical, predictive, and prescriptive models on which strategic planning processes are based. Current GIS are not rooted in the sorts of functions which drive these processes and here we will identify the difficulties and possibilities for developing more appropriate GIS which are sensitive to the simulation, optimization, and design activities which define spatial planning. To this end we will describe the development of planning support systems (PSS) in which a wide array of data, information, and knowledge might be structured, and within which GIS develop ment must take place. We will identify the sorts of urban system and locational models which characterize strategic planning and whose data-demands might be accommodated using GIS. Our critique of GIS is positive and constructive in that we are concerned to embed GIS into planning processes in the most appropriate way. In conclusion we will identify a series of requirements which PSS must meet. </jats:p>",

Through an examination of a local campaign by development interests against control practice, the ways control practice changed during the period is revealed and the criticisms made in local campaigns against the planning authority are evaluated. Then the imposition of an urban development corporation and the local fight against designation are explored, revealing how this also affected control practice, and a preliminary evaluation of the performance of the corporation is made. The author shows how a tough negotiating stance with developers has been progressively eroded to ensure that planning has become more of an enabler of development and less preoccupied with community impact or environmental quality. </jats:p>",

This article examines the reforms as a re‐structuring of incentives facing agencies within the internal market for health care, and forecasts how agency behaviour is likely to change as a result of such re‐structuring. Medium‐term implications of the reforms for hospitals, general practitioners and patients are derived.

This article considers the impact of the proposed changes for health service management, and argues that management education has to produce people who possess both strategic and operational competencies to effect the transformation of an unequal and divisive health service into one that offers an equitable and high quality service to all South Africans.</jats:p>",

This model addresses problems of geographical accessibility rather than quality in existing services. While it responds to the most urgent health service problems in Kenya, it ignores the communities felt needs for the extension of services to treat serious illnesses. Nevertheless, the Initiative has been successful in generating community enthusiasm and in establishing an affordable and sustainable services.

The vacated housing stock is often larger and offers a greater choice in neighborhoods, in schools, and in proximity to employment areas than is feasible when families are concentrated in a few public housing projects. The extent to which these benefits can be realized will vary depending on the local housing market and characteristics of the vacated housing. Additional research is needed to define multipliers that take into consideration the overall improvements in housing opportunities that are attributable to a subsidized housing project for the elderly. </jats:p>",

A specific well course planning is the key to drill horizontal well successfully as well as optimizing the directional tools and procedures. As a result, it leads to improve the drilling efficiency significantly and minimize the overall cost for horizontal drilling. However, the process of using an analytical approach in developing and finalizing the plan is time consuming. Therefore, it is vital to make use of a computer model for faster and easier process. For this purpose, '2D' and one of '3D' models with geological data base have been developed and their integrity has been confirmed by bench mark tests. A unique feature of these models is that they can produce not only a well profile but also supplemental requirements, i.e., the estimation of intersection with a certain single or multi-dip formation, the vertical distance between well course and reservoir formation top in horizontal section and casing setting depths. This paper describes theoretical equations adopted for the in-house computer models and presents the results obtained using planned well data.</jats:p>",

Yet, the full implications of such schemes in a developing country context are unclear; in particular, the impact on and relationship with private sector providers has infrequently been explored. This study examines patterns of public and private sector utilization under the Civil Servants' Medical Benefit Scheme (CSMBS) in Bangkok, Thailand. The CSMBS currently provides limited reimbursement for private inpatient care, but recent proposals suggest increasing benefit levels for care sought in the private sector. The study shows that despite high level of cost recovery in the public sector, charges were much lower than those in the private sector. Different patterns of diagnosis in the two sectors were found with private hospitals tending to treat a less complex case mix. Within the private sector, there was a limited tendency to specialize in certain types of care. It is concluded that under the current payment mechanism of fee‐for‐service reimbursement, measures to enhance access to private sector care should be approached with caution. In the long run, the scheme should merge with the recently established social security scheme.</jats:p>",

It involves a move from collecting, collating, and presenting data to an alteration of behaviour in the practice to improve the quality of care (Rogers 1971). In the introduction to Part II the characteristics of a healthy practice were outlined. Those characteristics allow a practice to perform effectively and the time and effort expended in attaining them are well rewarded. Often such ideal circumstances are unobtainable; for instance, due to a long history of resistance to change within the practice, or due to one powerful partner blocking all progress. If these or other similar circumstances apply to you, do not be put off introducing audit. Often the process of examining the quality of the care you provide, including team work, discussion, planning, and effective meetings can help to bring about the metamorphosis to a healthier practice. If you are the person trying to introduce change into your practice do not get too disheartened by initial resistance and failures, but use the ideas and principles in the following chapter to help ‘sell’ your ideas to the other members of your practice.</jats:p>",

A recent external review of the Bamako Initiative in Burundi considered the extent to which the ‘Carte d'Assurance Maladie’ (CAM) has the potential to improve the quality of, and access to, health services. Although utilization of the CAM was found to be low overall, most of those visiting the health centres were in possession of a card, leading the team to conclude that health service utilization for curative care is extremely low. Focus group discussion revealed that users perceive the quality of health services to be poor, and that frequent shortages of basic drugs and supplies create uncertainty as to whether the CAM will provide good value for money, the shortage of basic drugs, the lack of community participation in the management of health services, and the fact that very little of the revenue from sales of the CAM is spent on health service provision provide possible explanations for the weak uptake of health insurance.

Specifically, success is considered not only in terms of how it may be achieved but also in terms of how it can be defined (i.e. what constitutes SISP success) and how SISP success can be measured. Specific research questions addressing the measurement of SISP success are identified.</jats:p>",

Two cases are considered: the shop rents in the first model are determined by competition with the housing sector, whereas in the second the licensing of sites for retail use by a planning authority landlord which has as its aim the maximization of its receipts from all shops in the town is modelled. The models developed are solved for a range of parameter values. It is shown that allowing for the endogeneity of shop rents, as opposed to treating them as a fixed cost, reverses some well-established comparative static results—when income is increased the market area increases with an endogenous planning authority, whereas with exogenous shop rents the market area decreases. Differences are also established for variations in population density and the costs of travel to the shops. </jats:p>",

The results indicate that while general support exists for a symbiotic relationship between the two, the residents place more emphasis on tourism development while the tourists give greater weight to environmental protection. Both groups indicate a preference for small-scale developments and believe that tourism should be integrated with the overall conservation and land management of the region. A number of recreational and touristic activities which are perceived to be environmentally harmful are noted, as well as others which are viewed as being environmentally compatible and therefore acceptable. The findings have direct management applications as the region is undergoing a tourism boom and has also just been proclaimed the first World Heritage Area in the state. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By the end of 1987, Cleveland in northern England had been attributed with a new and disturbing meaning. It was the centre of a ‘crisis' about the sexual abuse of children. Although no one yet knows the ‘truth’ about the situation, popular and strongly held perceptions of what really happened remain widespread and entrenched. In this paper, the way in which a place came to be associated with a particular set of meanings is examined; the reasons why some readings are ‘silenced’ whereas others enter the dominant public discourse are investigated. In ‘Cleveland’, feminist perspectives were suppressed. The debate around child sexual abuse successfully avoided the question of who was doing the abusing, and there was a deafening silence on how to prevent that abuse. The issue of sexuality appeared to be edited out of the agenda. An examination of the symbolic geographies of a particular place such as Cleveland allows an analysis of power and the nature of society. It is now difficult to mention the name ‘Cleveland’ without triggering an array of images associated with child sexual abuse. What these images arc is important for any understanding of the situation whereby ‘Cleveland’ became a metaphor for child sexual abuse. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> There are good reasons for assuming that places symbolic for and valued by black people exist in Britain, One such locale is London's Notting Hill, which was, with Brixton, one of the two earliest zones of Afro-Caribbean settlement in the metropolis from the mid-1950s onwards. Notting Hill was also, in 1958, the locus of riots by young white people against black immigrants; the site of the Mangrove Restaurant, associated with the Black Power movement, and harassed continually by the police from its establishment in 1969 until its demise in 1991, Also, most notably, this area is the venue for the vast, annual, black-accented Notting Hill street carnival. These attributes did not, however, seem to engender strong responses in interviews with a set of twelve families of Barbadian origin. The interviewees, now materially successful, no longer inhabited the neighborhood, nor did their London-raised adult children. For the thirty-four interviewees, Notting Hill was a place that might once have been important for black people, but was no longer greatly valued for any such symbolisms; its looming gentrification by whites, for example, was not viewed with regret. This weak attachment to the place Notting Hill—or indeed to any other purportedly ‘black’ locales in London or Britain—has multiple sources in the particularity of this set of respondents: middle-class, respectable, generally conservative, homeowners, many of whom exhibit marked Barbadian island chauvinism. Most strikingly, some of the households still, after over thirty years in London, view themselves only as sojourners in Britain, who will before long return home to Barbados. Indeed, at least one household already has. </jats:p>",

Limitations in this information may still leave large uncertainties in field performance predictions leading to a low confidence in ranking of reservoir recovery methods.

This problem may be largely overcome by adopting a more geostatistical approach in which the data uncertainties are reflected within probability distributions for relevant reservoir parameters.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>In addition to reservoir uncertainties the importance of fully integrating drilling, surface facilities, and economic constraints is sometimes not obvious during the initial reservoir screening exercise.

The claims which groups asserted for the use and enjoyment of this symbolic space, and the responses of the inhabitants and city government to the exercise of these rights, reveal the process by which the community adjudicated social conflict and built consensus through the manipulation and control of a valuable collective asset: the streets. </jats:p>",

RESULT: In collaboration with local midwives, contraception for 2 years had been recommended to the patients. Only one woman had been using contraceptives before. After cesarean, 46 women used contraceptives and 13 had undergone tubal ligature. Contraceptive users had their next pregnancy on average 10 months later than women not practicing contraception. Patients showed a strong interest to limit their family size. None of the woman desired more than 5 children. CONCLUSION: Correct promotion provided, cesarean section patients in a traditional environment accept contraceptives and are interested in family planning.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

In this paper, the workings of the fashion system are explored, with a focus on changing consumption patterns and new market trends, which may have the potential to even out the profoundly unequal relationship which exists between high-street multiples and small independent retailers. The suggestion is made that the fashion system is polarising at present, that design-led boutiques are enjoying renewed popularity. Not only is this benefiting local design talent, it is also a means of affording greater autonomy to local manufacturers. The emergence of one particular fashion agglomeration, the Nottingham Lace Market, is traced, with local linkage structures looked at through the interplay of manufacturers, designers, retailers, and local policymakers. In this way, an attempt is made to offer a more expansive investigation of flexible production systems, one which is not grounded exclusively in economic-centred narratives but which recognises that the factors which shape the development of local agglomerations are rooted in production and consumption shifts, and are dependent on multiple political, cultural, and economic discourses. </jats:p>",

The Liberian programme provided uni-purpose NFP services to 1055 clients mainly in rural areas; the Zambian programme provided NFP services integrated with MCH to 2709 clients predominantly in urban areas. The one-year life table continuation and unplanned pregnancy rates were 78·9 and 4·3 per 100 women-years in Liberia, compared to 71·2 and 8·9 in Zambia. However, high rates of loss to follow-up mandate caution in interpretation of these results, especially in Zambia. More women progressed to autonomous NFP use in Liberia (58%) than in Zambia (35·3%). However, programme costs per couple-year protection were lower in Zambia (US$25·7) than in Liberia (US$47·1). Costs per couple-year protection were higher during learning than autonomy, and declined over time. These studies suggest that NFP programmes can achieve acceptable use-and cost-effectiveness in Africa.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Soft images of pubescent women scaling the dizzy heights of a massive phallic rock in turn-of-the-century rural Victoria, and young men matching physical prowess in the indomitable Western Australian desert as World War I rages in Europe, provide foci for two of Peter Weir's most successful early films, Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975) and Gallipoli (1981). In both these films the physical landscape is simultaneously integrated with and contrasted to the passions of young men and women. The result is an aesthetic that takes the viewer beyond the immediate narrative to a place where masculinity and femininity find expression. In this paper, transactional and psychoanalytic perspectives are used to interrogate the gender images which are portrayed in both these movies, linking them to some concepts which find currency in ecofeminism. The concern is with the individual struggle between the powerful, complex, and yet less-than-rational forces that are integral to the nature of our individual beings and the rational nature of prevailing societal values that supposedly provide us with guidance. A dynamic theory of contemporary film is implicit in our discussion of “images in motion over time through space with sequence”. These elements—along with an overlay of shape, size, scale, color, sound, and light—arc the cues that provide meaning for Weir's portrayal of wo/man-in-environmcnt relations. Suggested in this paper is a broader narrative which speaks to a postmodern sexual order and its representations in social theory and contemporary cinema. Crucial questions are raised regarding the ways that cultural identity is grounded in class and gender. </jats:p>",

The “situation analysis” approach used involved: 1) observation and inventory of services, facilities, supplies and record keeping reviews; 2) observation of interaction between service providers and FP clients at FWC's; 3) interviews with service providers; and 4) exit interviews with FP clients after service provision. This one-day on-site observation by teams of three interviewers provided a unique overview and baseline assessment of the availability of services, the staff functioning and the quality of service. Significant findings include a low caseload, inadequacies of facilities, some stockouts, lack of educational materials, insufficient outreach, unnecessary medical and social barriers to providing contraception as well as in some cases insufficient information to clients about contraindications to contraceptive usage and possible side-effects. The need to bolster in-service training and supervision is emphasized. </jats:p>",
