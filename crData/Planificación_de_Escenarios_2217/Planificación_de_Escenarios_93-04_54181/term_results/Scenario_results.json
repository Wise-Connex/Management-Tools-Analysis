      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Indian Coal Mining Industry, which now ranks 5th in the world, was started in 1975. After initial sporadic efforts the thrust for coal exploration was given only after independence. The real impetus to the exploration was received after industrialisation of the coal industry in 1971–72 and 1973–74. The National Policy of coal exploration is well defined and is subjected to national level co-ordination by the Planning Commission of the country. </jats:p><jats:p> For the purpose of exploration, coalfields have been divided into types which consider basinal area of coalfields and category-based on coverage by exploration of potential coal bearing areas. About seventy four coalfields are covered under various exploration systems. India has a three tier system of coal exploration viz. regional, detailed and production support exploration. Most modern techniques are being employed for coal exploration including remote-sensing, HRSS, well logging, geo-engineering investigations, physico-chemical and physico-mechanical studies, hydrogeological investigations and computer applications. The National Coal Inventory placed the reserves of the nation at about 196 billion tonnes which could be augmented by further exploration to about 239 billion tonnes. To this about, 620 billion tonnes of futuristic resources could also be added in the distant future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Environmental quality is as much an indicator of the level of development as the generally accepted norm of per capita consumption of energy. Coal, being the mainstay of energy in India, will continue to play a crucial role on both the counts as annual coal utilization is expected to increase by 2.5 times by the year 2005. Indian coal being of poor quality with 35 to 48% ash content has serious adverse implications on air, water and land environment which will be aggravated further by opening up extensive areas for opencast coal mining operations to meet the increased coal demand. Many coal deposits in India are located in areas rich in bio-diversity and, these areas need to be specially protected as they are crucial for our very survival. Mining operations, therefore, need to be harmonised with protection of genetic stock and the forest areas which serve as cheap “Carbon-dioxide Sinks”. </jats:p><jats:p> A prerequisite in coal extraction and its utilization is the need for making technological conversion processes as efficient as possible to achieve a higher output from the same resource base. This calls for setting up a chain of coal washeries for better plant performance, reduced environmental pollution and overall cost savings. Demonstrated benefits of coal washeries include 5–15% saving in coal consumption with a freight saving alone to the tune of $3 billion in the year 2000; 2% increase in plant availability for every percent drop in ash content and, improved plant load factor netting annual savings of $1.4 million in a single 210 MW thermal power plant. Switching over to cleaner technologies and replacement or retrofitting of vintage boilers can further add to coal savings, and an improved environment. </jats:p><jats:p> Optimisation of coal utilisation and internalisation of environmental concerns demands adoption of “carrying capacity based” planning process. Adoption of rational pricing at full cost, introduction of fiscal incentives for promoting Clean Coal Technologies and, reorientation of lending policies towards “Greener Credit” can also contribute to improved benefit stream with reduced environmental damage. </jats:p><jats:p> This paper outlines the strategy for sustainable development while concurrently meeting the obligations for controlling Green House Gases under the International Conventions. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nonlinear self-excited oscillations are usually investigated for two-dimensional models. We extend the simplest and best known of these models, the van der Pol oscillator, to a three-dimensional one and study its dynamical behaviour by methods of bifurcation analysis. We find cusps and other local codimension 2 bifurcations. A homoclinic (i.e. global) bifurcation plays an important role in the bifurcation diagram. Finally it is demonstrated that chaos sets in. Thus the system belongs to the few three-dimensional autonomous ones modelling physical situations which lead to chaotic behavior. </jats:p>",
