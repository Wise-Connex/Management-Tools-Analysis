Contingency planning is complex and must be fitted to the nature and location of the particular operation. particular operation. This paper attempts to summarise the experience of an oil company in the contingency planning field. The steps taken to set up a plan and to run a spill clean-up operation are shown diagramatically, and important elements discussed in some detail. However, should an accident such as a blowout occur it is important to recognise and accept that oil spill clean-up will be one part of a large counter-operation extending beyond oil industry boundaries. The fullest cooperation and co-ordination must be organised between the oil spill experts and those engaged in fire fighting, safety and source elimination. This will include oil industry personnel and contractors. Externally, contacts with government bodies and research interests will be essential to ensure an effective and smooth operation.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>B. CONSTRUCTION THE PLAN</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>It is recognised that for many offshore developments a cooperative approach between operating companies is desirable. This is true in the UK sector of the North Sea, where stocks of equipment are available to members of the UK Offshore Operators Association (UKOOA). However, this should not mask the need for companies to determine their individual organisational and planning needs to utilise these common resources.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Setting up and running a contingency plan for an offshore operation will involve many departments within the main structure of an oil company. While that structure will vary in detail from company to company, the general lines of consultation and communication will be similar. Also, although the requirements by each company for a contingency plan will differ, the broad processes and stages in setting up an plan will differ, the broad processes and stages in setting up an appropriate plan are common to most offshore operations. Thus it is possible to draw up a diagram showing a route which should be applicable to any company constructing an oil spill plan for offshore work. Such a diagram is shown in Figure 1, Phases 1 and 2. Phase 1 is the planning stage leading to recommendations to management, and Phase 2 is the implementation of those recommendations. The steps, contacts and sequence of events indicated in Figure 1 are by no means meant to be immutable: the diagrams are merely a guide. However, they do emphasise the need for consultation, coordination, and above all the need to think through the problem clearly. Organisationally, every step must be logical problem clearly. Organisationally, every step must be logical and the result of adequate discussion and agreement. It is only too easy for relevant personnel both internal and external to a company to be consulted either inadequately or not at all.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Se citan por ejamplo Tanzania e India, indicando las dificultades de conseguir la meta cuando falta la intervención política.

These ratios are influenced by duration of marriage and by desired number of children. Effects of different levels of contraception are measured. Another strategy, spacing the last two wanted births, is also studied. It is found that breast-feeding status has little effect on fecundability selection. The women usually found to have greatest fecundability are not those recently pregnant at durations of marriage five and ten years, unless they wanted fewer than two children, but rather those who are using contraception to limit the number of children.</jats:p>",

Regulation which uses primarily structural criteria for monitoring and evaluating services tends to de-emphasize the importance of contraceptive counseling as a component of abortion services. Our process/outcome evaluation of abortion clinics located in Chicago suggests that contraceptive counseling provided at the time of the abortion procedure has a potential long-term impact in terms of reducing the need for elective abortion. We suggest that regulation policy should include process and outcome criteria which support the eventual reduction in need for abortion as a long-range policy goal and suggest key issues for consideration when such a policy is formulated.</jats:p>",

Such programs have now been in existence for sufficient lengths of time to have had an impact on fertility levels. In several countries with organized family planning programs, marked declines in fertility levels have been observed. The extent to which such declines may be credited to organized programs has not been rigorously measured because an appropriate research methodology has been lacking. This paper describes one method of directly linking declines in fertility levels to the contraceptive protection experienced by a population. The contribution of organized family planning programs is estimated by decomposing the amount of total contraceptive protection into within-program and outside-program sources.</jats:p>",

Planners have entered a blind alley, described as ‘narrow‐planning’, where professionalisation and division of labour have led to a concentration on documents rather than real‐world changes. Narrow‐planning is contrasted with ‘broad‐planning’, where data collection, the consultation of relevant interest groups, forecasting, the definition of objectives, plan construction, authorisation, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation, are linked, providing a model of a continuous, integrated planning process. The preconditions for the success of this model are discussed, and it is emphasised that planning is essentially a political process.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>RESUME</jats:bold> <jats:bold>Le processus de planification: leçons du passé et modele pour I'avenir.</jats:bold></jats:p><jats:p>La planification du développement, telle que pratiquée au cours des 25 dernières années, a été technocratique, isolée politiquement et naïive.

A planning model capable of reflecting the implications of the pollutant constraints and the scale economies of point source abatement implicit in the legislation is developed. The model captures within a mathematical programing format important characteristics of decisions associated with the time‐related water pollution control goals of PL 92–500. The model's unique features are the utilization of a biomass potential parameter as a measure of water quality and a set of heuristic procedures involving linearization of the waste treatment capacity‐removal curves. These features allow avoidance of nonconvexity problems associated with analogous models. The model also includes the usual BOD, DO, N, and P water quality measures. The model was applied in a recent planning study for the Saint John Basin in Maine.</jats:p>",

Each infeasible solution found by using the method is converted to a feasible regional configuration of plants and interceptors. The alternative plans can be compared to examine tradeoffs between cost and other qualitative and quantitative planning objectives. Also the tree itself can be extended to generate additional planning alternatives. Rather than to find mathematically optimal solutions, the principal uses of the method are to generate systematically attractive alternative plans and potentially to assist in evaluating tradeoffs between different planning objectives.</jats:p>",

Although some of the decisions are largely “artistic” and not subject to formal analytic procedures, many other decisions can be aided by model-based procedures. This paper describes some of the analytic procedures which are being used by the management of one performing arts series. </jats:p><jats:p> The starting point for ARTS PLAN is dummy variable regression analysis of historical data which leads to a prediction of attendance at future performances. This prediction can be overridden by the manager if he or she disagrees with the forecast The forecast is then embedded in an interactive model which can be used for planning a season or for deciding which events to promote in a season already planned. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper attempts a reformulation and generalisation of Reilly's (1931) law of retail gravitation. Reilly himself challenged workers in the field to produce new evidence which would refute or strengthen his law, and developments in spatial-interaction theory during the last decade are used here in taking up this challenge. A critique of Reilly's law sets the scene: By adopting a gravity model more general than the Newtonian model used by Reilly, it is shown how the limitations of the law with respect to hierarchy, spatial competition, locational size, and the symmetry of trade flows, are overcome. In particular the notion of Reilly's law as a special case of the market-area analysis originating from Fetter (1924) and Hotelling (1929) is demonstrated in terms of a theory of the breakpoint implying spatial price–cost indifference. Another approach, through entropy-maximisation and its dual problem, leads to similar conclusions with regard to prices, and it also serves to introduce multicentred spatial competition. These ideas are then generalised in several ways: through notions about the influence of prior spatial information, through concepts of consumer as well as producer market areas or fields, and through the implications of the analysis for the family of spatial-interaction models. A speculation on the relationship of price differentials to Tobler's (1975) interaction winds is made, and the paper is concluded with an application of these models to the definition of an urban hierarchy in the Reading subregion. </jats:p>",

The Cohen and Whitworth random partitioning models are applied to these data. Standard normal deviates show the increasing population concentration in large urban areas during the 19th century and the reversal of this trend in the 20th century, leading to the suggestion of maximum entropy in 1968. A comparison of the Cohen and the rank–size models suggests the greater utility of the former once the primate city is excluded from consideration. The analysis highlights the timing of critical changes in the evolution of the settlement pattern, particularly the reversal of trend in 1901. </jats:p>",

Simple empirical relationships are often used to predict the impact of management decisions.

The problems of worth of additional information, and uncertainty of estimates were handled within a cost‐effectiveness framework.

The cost criterion is the expected value of opportunity costs, costs of analysis and costs of additional information.</jats:p><jats:p>Uncertainty analysis techniques were used to estimate the effectiveness of various management alternatives.
