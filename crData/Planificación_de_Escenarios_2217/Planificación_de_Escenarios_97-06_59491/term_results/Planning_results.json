In Korea, the multifaceted economic, social, and spatial restructuring could provide an opportunity for the economic growth of some cities, while for others they present a challenge to the planning profession. This paper first examines the process of fundamental restructuring that has been taking place at the global level. It then evaluates the internal and external strains that restructuring has exerted on major Korean cities. Based on the urban pressures, various problems and policy issues that face urban policy-makers are discussed. The paper is an attempt to link macro logic at the global level global restructuring-to the micro logic of planning policy at the city and regional level. It is based on the firm belief that a thorough understanding of ongoing structural changes is required for Korean cities to cope with the contemporary process of global restructuring. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Models of participatory or consensual planning based on theories of communicative action and rationality are emerging as an important paradigm for interpretation of the process of planning. Within this framework, Forester (1991) has described planning as \"anticipatory analysis\" the work of anticipating implementation and managing argumentation. This article uses Forester's framework to analyze the role of planners in managing argument about wellhead protection in Indianapolis, Indiana. The article examines the ways in which planners envisioned alternative futures, structured and managed processes of argumentation, and presented recommendations for risky, technical decisions. It concludes with observations about the usefulness of the model of anticipatory analysis in environmental planning. </jats:p>",

Outlines, through numerous examples, the changes followers can make in their competitive profiles to become alternative leaders. The smaller firms may thrive serving a limited demand which would normally be unattractive to the leading firms; the larger company could do well by concentrating on products for market niches that are neglected by the industry leaders.

A companion to a course in environmental planning, the course was designed to prepare planning students to engage in the environmental policy debate by exposing them to its historical, moral, and technical dimensions. By examining strategies and tactics of planning practice, they learn to apply their analytic and research skills to appropriate advocacy, mediation, and community planning roles. The course seeks to connect the environmental justice movement with social movement theory, concepts of procedural justice, and advocacy and equity planning. It integrates propositions and concepts about the politics of planning, land use policies, and practices with political philosophy, populist beliefs and what Perry (1994) calls \"the street-level Rawlsian approach.\" </jats:p>",

The survey found support for a remedial action plan, measured in both willingness to pay and willingness to support a new agency to implement the plan, was significantly greater among those familiar with the plan. The survey also found willingness to pay for the plan greater among the young and better educated, a strong preference for industry fees and user charges over taxation as a method of payment, and little support for the creation of a new agency to implement the plan. Unlike previous research on public support for growth management and land use reform, the survey found the support was based not on self interest but on general preferences for a clean environment. These results suggest that the key to public support, and perhaps for successful RAP implementation, lies less in fostering recreational use of the watershed and more in continuing efforts to provide education and information to the young, the dedication of user fees for RAP implementation, and continued leadership by state government. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The neotraditional resort development of Seaside, Florida merits special attention from geographers and urban planners because of the normative claims made by its designers and because it has garnered widespread attention from practising architects, planners, anti social critics, Under the banners of ‘neotraditionalism’ and ‘community planning’ the principles implemented in Seaside have also been employed in numerous other developments in North America. Central to Seaside's appeal and normative content is the deliberate attempt to resurrect an idealised past of uniquely American communitarianism through the skillful manipulation of urban form. We develop our critique of neotraditionalism through a deconstructive analysis of the physical and ideological spaces of Seaside. Specifically, we discuss the origin and development of Seaside, the centrality of its urban and architectural codes, the paradoxical deployment of public and private spaces, and the emergence of a distinctively neotraditional subject. Our basic claim is that neotraditionalism is actually a carefully veiled form of what Foster has called “postmodernism of reaction”. </jats:p>",

The electronics industry, already the fourth most important industrial sector in the world, is tipped to become the principal growth sector in the next century. A recent survey reveals that in this important industry, companies’ attempts to understand their competitors do not always live up to the models of Michael Porter or Philip Kotler.</jats:p>",

This is indicated by the role that Australian politicians often assume in regional organisations and the recent tone of statements regarding environmental and political concerns in the region. In real terms, this process extends the social, cultural and political influence of Australia in the region. As part of this process of educational aid, the Primary &amp; Secondary Education Project (PASEP), investigates the problems of design, planning and project implementation in Vanuatu through a detailed examination of an educational project, co-funded by AIDAB, the World Bank and the respective Vanuatu Governments during the period 1990—1994. The major issues of curriculum reform provide an underlying focus for these changes. The outcome of the project suggests that the ongoing dynamics of political change should not be underestimated or ignored by any planning process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency    of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link    (POCL) planning.  We review this literature, and present new    experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some    of the discrepancies in it.  In particular, we describe the Least-Cost    Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and    Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including    Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy.  LCFR and ZLIFO make    very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most    effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning.  We    resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini    and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is    better attributed to other causes.  We show that for many problems, a    strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of    separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and    will do so without excessive computational overhead.  Although such a    strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain    domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.</jats:p>"

Argues that the disposition of the buyer towards a product or service, or supplier, during the sourcing process can be represented by five criteria, termed the “five Vs”: value, viability, volume, variety and virtue. Proposes that the five Vs can be used in conjunction with the marketing mix to enable a supplier or provider to achieve a more detailed understanding of the buying process, and ultimately of product/service adoption. Argues that a fundamental understanding of buyers’ needs and wants, through the eyes of the buyer, will help to generate a stronger and more strategic focus on the achievement of marketing objectives.</jats:p>",

A conceptual model for the enforcement component of a comprehensive community alcohol‐related trauma project is presented and its implementation at the three sites is described. Limitations in the available police department resources delayed the implementation of local programs. Media advocacy tied to specific operations proved to be successful in publicizing sensors and sobriety checkpoints were only partially accepted. Overall, the community trials sites increased or held steady their arrest rates in contrast to the comparison sites where DU1 arrests declined.</jats:p>",

This Case Study looks back at the early experiences of community care planning, looks ahead to the issues which will have to be addressed in the new children's services plans, and teases out the messages for transferred learning. It warns that local inter‐agency planning has no qualities of spontaneous growth or self‐perpetuation, and that without safeguards the process is at risk of becoming marginalised.</jats:p>",

It is normally tackled by decomposing goal objects into features, and then sequencing features to obtain a plan. This paper investigates an alternative approach. The capabilities of a manufacturing process are represented by a formal language of shape, in which sentences correspond to manufacturable objects. The language is interpreted to describe process plans corresponding to the shape generation, complete with cost estimates. A macro layer that describes single operations of the machine is implemented on top of the formal language. The space it describes is searched by the generative simulated annealing algorithm, a stochastic search technique based on simulated annealing.

Two types of centralizers are known: bow-type centralizers and rigid centralizers. The bow-type centralizers are made of two collars and a number of metal springs attached to them. The characteristics of the metal springs is known, so that the deflection of a centralizer in a given load situation can be determined. Rigid centralizers have a fixed outer diameter which is basically independent of lateral forces. The decision which type of centralizer to use depends on several factors such as the borehole condition (see table 1).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>During the cementation process, the mud used to drill the well has to be replaced by cement.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

It analyses the links between the projects of directed social transformation in “backward” societies that characterize the program of “development” since the 1920s, and the emergence of a discipline aiming at a scientific understanding of these societies. A reconstruction of the process of autonomization of British social anthropology in Africa during the interwar period thus offers at the same time a genealogy of the uses of anthropology in development. It is argued that, instead of viewing the relationship between anthropology and the colonial administration as an alternative between instrumentalization or independence, it is more fruitful to analyse it as structured by both common interests in producing knowledge about colonized societies and a competition between academic specialists and “practical men”. The “professionalization” of social anthropology and its institutionalization as an academic discipline then appears as a process of construction of a monopoly of competence on non-western social phenomena.</jats:p>",

The growth of creative agencies reveals a desire on the part of advertisers to reroute rising consumer skepticism of advertising by producing more reflexive, innovative work and signals a heightened apparatus of control. The case of advertising raises questions about the limits to reflexive consumer subjectivities. </jats:p>",

This scale has shown that practicing family physicians have a greater psychosocial orientation than those in other specialities such as internal medicine. The current study was done to see whether students choosing family medicine already have this greater orientation before they begin training as residents. 664 fourth-year medical students received surveys during their senior year and 378 (57%) returned completed surveys. Female students had a significantly greater psychosocial orientation than their male peers, but there were no significant differences between students planning residencies in family medicine and those selecting other residencies. The greater orientation of family doctors would appear to be a product of further training and experience either during residency or later during the actual practice of family medicine. </jats:p>",

The establishment of self-governing units in 1990 was the most important achievement of the first period of transformation and a very promising sign for potential political and economic changes in the future. An attitude to local self-governments presented after 1993 by postcommunist parties that came back to power, have not allowed these governments to build the infrastructure essential for the efficient operation of the jurisdiction. It also was impossible to establish the next level of self-governance— powiat (county)—designed as a complementary one to gminas. The second phase of self-government reform has been halted. There is still no clarification of the functional responsibilities between different levels of government and no authorization of revenue sources corresponding to functional responsibilities. These facts have a negative influence on local transformation processes including those of an economic nature. That is why public administration reform is perceived as a very necessary step to continue democratic reforms and to make regions and counties or municipalities well managed and administered. However, reorganisation of central government or the introduction of new levels of self-governing units will not automatically promote local transformation. In order to do so public administration requires complex and deep changes. The starting point for these changes will be a new definition of the state and of central government's roles and responsibilities. If public administration reform is to bring real changes its role must be redefined from the perspective of a decentralized state. The reform should be designed and implemented in such a way that helps to work out transparent and efficient mechanisms of intergovernmental relationships. The reform should also change the position of local government relative to central government. New professional standards as well as training programs for local government employees must be prepared to improve human resources and to overcome bad bureaucratic customs and practices inherited from the communist era. </jats:p>",

Starting from the premises that sustainable development is a complex and contested ideal, and that experiences with state planning in the twentieth century have been deeply ambiguous, this article reflects on the insights which political science can shed on the new social project of ‘planning for sustainable development’. The discussion centres on three relevant political science literatures — meta critiques of planning, ‘new governance’ debates, and enquiries into policy related learning. Consideration of these perspectives suggest that to the extent that it is possible for ‘planning for sustainable development’ to attain its declared objectives this will depend upon the integration of sustainable development norms into existing planning structures and modalities, the extensive development of co–operative management initiatives, and vigorous debates about alternative futures. Coordination among the inevitably disjointed and partially contradictory efforts of multiple agencies will rely upon the integrative potential of the sustainable development norm, central government initiatives, and collision, negotiation and mutual adjustment.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author argues that in Poland the 1989 commitment to political and administrative decentralization has weakened over the last seven years and has resulted in (re)centralizing tendencies. It is argued that the center's interest in gaining short-term political successes rather than engaging in long-term reforms fostered the retention of past centralized practices and the emergence of new (re)centralizing tendencies. This has been accomplished by the central state through application of three sets of forces: (1) fiscal, (2) political, and (3) systemic (preservation of the past). The first part of the paper lays out a theoretical framework for analysis of pressures and barriers to decentralization and (re)centralization. The second is an examination of the process of implementation in Poland, of local government and public administration reform over the period 1989–96. The third is an examination of (re)centralization processes in the context of political and fiscal forces as well as the inability of the center to reform itself and terminate the legacy of the past system in its multidimensional form (legal, institutional, territorial). The author concludes by asserting that, although clear (re)centralizing tendencies can be identified, Polish (re)centralization is characterized by the duality of the struggle: to move forward with the reforms and to dismantle the remnants of the past centralized system. Therefore, although Polish (re)centralization may appear similar in form, it differs in terms of causes from countries that are not subject to political and economic restructuring. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The following problem appears in robotics. A number of small, circular robots live in a common planar workspace. Each is attached by a flexible cable of finite length to a point on the boundary of this workspace. Each robot has a target point in the workspace it must reach. When a robot has reached its target, its cable will have been dragged out into the workspace and possibly pushed and bent by other robots. The cables remain taut at all times and may not overlap, but may bend around other robots. When only the target points are specified for the robots, their motion can produce arbitrarily complex cable configurations. The more complex a cable configuration is, the more restrictive it is to the motion of the robots. To keep restrictions on the robots' motions at a minimum, it is necessary to specify, in addition to the target points, a configuration of the cables that is as simple as possible but allows all robots to reach their targets. The problem of finding the simplest cable configuration for a given set of target points is shown to reduce to the problem of finding a minimal set of nonintersecting routes in a Euclidean graph whose nodes are the robots' cable line. That no set of edges can intersect any other set of edges is an unusual characteristic of this graph problem. This consideration leads to interesting geometric analysis used to determine which relative placements of the graph edges represent overlapping cable lines. An algorithm is suggested that uses an exhaustive search method with pruning to find a set of nonintersecting routes in the graph that is minimal according to a chosen criterion. The algorithm has been implemented and tested; examples of its performance are given. </jats:p>",

It is shown that decentralization is a multidimensional concept and that actual local government systems can be positioned differently on each dimension (functions, control, and finance) depending on the implicit model of local government. Formal and substantive definitions of democracy are distinguished and some conventional measures examined; it is concluded that decentralization and democracy do not necessarily go together. The degree of decentralization and implicit models of postsocialist local government in Eastern Europe are then outlined, with a focus on the contrast between Budapest and Moscow. The development of social movements in the two capitals is taken as an index of substantive democracy and is shown to be influenced not only by the extent of decentralization but also by other features of the local political context. This illustrates the earlier argument that the relation between decentralization and democracy is an empirically variable one rather than a necessary one. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We propose a new method for generating smooth paths for vehicle path planning. The problem of finding the \"smoothest path\" joining two given configurations is solved (a configu ration is a position and a direction). Generally, we solve the problem using two \"simple \" path segments. The most important issue is how to define the smoothness cost of a path. We pro pose two distinct definitions: the first is the path curvature, and the second is the derivative of the path curvature. We use cir cular arcs with the first definition, and we use \"cubic spirals\" with the second for \"simple curves\" respectively. The set of cubic spirals has several advantages when used in smooth-path planning, one of which is curvature continuity. This theory also reveals other important concepts in robotics, such as \"symmet ric configurations \" and \"symmetric means. \" This algorithm has been successfully implemented on the autonomous mobile robot Yamabico-11 at the University of California at Santa Barbara and at the Naval Postgraduate School. </jats:p>",

By viewing the alternative approaches in the literature as specific cases of restricted estimation a number of important methodological issues associated with model misspecification are identified and examined analytically. Additional insight as to the importance of these issues is provided by means of a series of Monte Carlo simulations. The results suggest that the relative performances of the various approaches towards integration are sensitive to errors associated with the form of the intersectoral linkages, labor-productivity coefficients, and regional purchase coefficients. The previous finding that the embedding strategies provide indicators of the strength of regional intersectoral linkages is shown to be potentially misleading. </jats:p>",

Utilizing the advantages of the expert-system technology in teacher training, the five training stages of TTIPSS were presented: (a) case description, (b) formulating the preliminary hypothesis, (c) collecting additional information through questions from four different sources: observations, the psychologist's report, parents' inter-view and the child's view, (d) intervention planning and (e) evaluation. Preliminary pilot reflected teachers' satisfaction and focused attention at needed changes. A sample session illustrates the teachers' patterns of interactions with the system. </jats:p>",

The authors then turn to an account of the ‘transaction socials' perspective and, drawing upon English and French literature, apply it to the analysis of the relations of local grass-roots democracy. A practical step forward in increasing liberational forms of participation in local politics through the development of the concept of ‘the smuggler’ is offered. </jats:p>",

A major argument for global funding is the high benefit-cost ratio of eradication; however, financial benefits are greatest for rich countries. By contrast, the greatest costs are borne by poor countries; the Pan American Health Organization has estimated that host countries bore 80% of costs for polio eradication in the Americas. The 1988 World Health Assembly resolution setting up the Polio Eradication Initiative carried the proviso that programs should strengthen health infrastructures. Drastic cuts in donor funding for health make this commitment even more important. Two international evaluations have reported both positive and negative effects of polio and Expanded Programme on Immunization programs on the functioning and sustainability of primary health care. Negative effects were greatest in poor countries with many other diseases of public health importance. If poor countries are expected to divert funds from their own urgent priorities, donors should make solid commitments to long-term support for sustainable health development.</jats:p>",

All countries in the region have taken clear steps to pass legislation creating new local government institutions. Such institutional reform is necessary, but not sufficient, for the development of autonomous local self-government. In this paper we present several fundamental criteria which must be satisfied in order to establish and nurture autonomous local self-government. We test these criteria against institutional reforms in Central and Eastern Europe and the newly independent states to gauge the extent to which there has been actual devolution of governmental responsibility from central to local governments. We conclude that, although some individual strands of these fundamental reforms may have received some attention in the current transition process, such attention is more ad hoc than strategic. As a result, the goal of creating autonomous local self-governments has not been achieved. Donor nations and reform elements in each country must think strategically about all dimensions of this local government transition if these changes are to be institutionalized and the transition is to be successful in the long term. </jats:p>",

Responses recorded during interviews with service users, their key workers and some family members are complemented with data collected from participant observation of individual planning meetings. The findings suggest that the majority of service users able to speak for themselves who were interviewed have a good understanding of the planning process and find it a positive experience; this is supported by participant observation data. Those speaking on behalf of people unable to speak for themselves are unclear as to how much understanding the group has of the process. Observation data suggest that people needing others to speak on their behalf are excluded from discussion during meetings more often than they are included. Recommendations are made for developing the service and providing additional support for keyworkers, building upon the considerable progress made during the service's inception.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During real-socialism in Central and Eastern Europe the scope for local government discretion was marginal. Local government had a very low degree of legitimacy, and this is something that poses a big problem when it comes to developing local self-government under postsocialism. It seems as if most citizens are prepared to pin their hopes on new central leaders, while they are still very hesitant with regard to local self-governance. Various expressions of localism appeared during the first three to four years of postsocialist development. However, today it seems as if the tide has turned in favour of more centralist hopes and policies. This development is discussed in the light of some of the arguments commonly raised in favour of centralism and localism, respectively, highlighting the complex relationships between the two concepts and their current manifestations. In the concluding section some ideas are put forward concerning the issue how to bridge the gap between centralism and localism, and there is also a reminder that some of the current developments of local government in Eastern and Central Europe are similar to those in Western Europe. This makes a strong argument in favour of intensified transnational contacts between academics, practitioners, and ordinary citizens with an interest in developing local self-government. </jats:p>",

Two examples are decentralization in the structure of public administration, and decentralization in provision of local services, which seems to be more complicated, Some type of integration is necessary for ‘real’ administrative decentralization, the purpose of which is to get closer to democratization. However, fragmentation is not a synonym of decentralization. According to my hypothesis the more decentralized a system the more necessary it is to integrate its basic units. There are different forms of integration. The scale is very wide: it varies from amalgamation, to the creation of voluntary associations among municipalities. Administrative decentralization does not exclude public managerial integration in service delivery. In East – Central European countries, parallel to the structural decentralization, different new forms of integration are emerging, simply as a result of the establishment of local institutions in place of former monopolies. This nonadministrative, functional, integration seems to be very important for the development of effectiveness in local democracy. </jats:p>",

Two possible mechanisms (reduction of uncertainty and a better choice of bus options, based on a general cost-minimization assumption) that may stimulate bus use are distinguished. The model is empirically tested by using microdata from the Southampton Stopwatch telematics project, which were collected both before and after the introduction of this telematics information service. The estimation of the model leads to interesting findings in explaining (anticipated) increases in bus use, for both the before and the after survey. It is shown that uncertainty reduction is the more important effect of the new system. Differences in the before and after data are found concerning the increase in bus use, but the explanatory model proves consistent over the two samples. </jats:p>",

As a creative rather than solely a conservationist strategy, its ambitious multipurpose ideals link closely with broader political, scientific, and popular debates on economic investment, social improvement, and environmental enhancement. In this apaper we explore the nature — society relations which underpin the Forest vision. These are examined by reference to the planning design with its supposedly radical approach to environmental transformation; the distinctive environmental aesthetic including the ecological principles and cultural designs on which it is based; and the forms of participation on which this aesthetic depends, notably the emphasis placed upon partnership from international to local scales and, building on Agenda 21, the promotion of environmental citizenship. We examine the meanings of participation in practice and their links with flexibility, accountability, and control. The changing relations between participation, professional knowledge, and power are also explored, together with the implications for citizenship. </jats:p>",

Profiles of hypothetical shopping centres are developed that describe the total size of centres as well as the marketing mix positionings of the individual stores within these centres. The approach is implemented in choice experiments, one on food shopping and one on shopping for clothing and shoes.

Although we initially work with a distinction between tactile and digital ethnographics, the issues that we raise are not unique to computer-aided analyses. Indeed, we argue that the adoption of computers marks a useful moment in which to think critically about the means and ends of qualitative analysis. In this paper we urge qualitative researchers to avoid both an outright rejection and an unquestioning adoption of computer software packages. Rather, we work towards a ‘crafty’ approach to ethnography where computers are incorporated into the body of research in a critically reflexive and creative manner. We end the paper with some thoughts on the potential of such incorporation. </jats:p>",

This was met with opposition from a range of interests who articulated concerns about potential blight and the effects upon property development. Amongst these interests were those of local authorities of which the larger ones, it is contended, would have good reason to oppose the introduction of registers because of the fear of their consequential impact on local economic development. In this paper the author appraises the local authority responses to the government's proposals for registers of potentially contaminated land and, following the government's decision to abandon the registers, their views of what policy and legal measures ought to be adopted in their place. The author then considers the extent to which these views have been reflected in the 1995 Environment Act which sought, inter alia, to provide a comprehensive legal and policy framework for the resolution of the location and apportionment of contaminated land liabilities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article is concerned with part representation and reasoning algorithms for automatic process planning in CADCAM (computer aided design and manufacture). Process planning involves the translation of a part description into instructions for a sequence of operations for the manufacture of the part. Part representations in CADCAM are reviewed, and a hierarchical representation is introduced which describes parts as the set-theoretic union of positive (protrusion) features, with the set-theoretic union of negative (depression) features subtracted. The model information hierarchy also incorporates topological relationships among features (adjacency, ownership and intersection), tolerances and links to a boundary representation (B-rep) geometric model. The hierarchical part representation is used as the basis for a reasoning scheme that uses topological relationships between features to restrict the search space of operation sequences. A recursive algorithm produces candidate operation sequences that are then ranked by applying manufacturing heuristics in a process called machining regularization. The representation approach is illustrated by an example, and possible extensions to the scheme are briefly discussed. </jats:p>",

The results were compared betyeen two groups of patients with epilepsy: in one group (n = 12), the patients had frontal lobe epilepsy with frequent focal motor seizures (FMS); in the second group (n = 12), they had temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with complex partial seizures but no ictal movement disorder. The results were also compared with those of control subjects of same age (n = 10).</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Results:</jats:italic> In the control group, desynchronization of murhythm began over the contralateral central region 2,000 ms before the movement onset. In the FMS group, the desynchronization of mu rhythm was delayed, appearing only 500 ms before the movement onset, and the amplitude of ERD was increased over the frontocentral region. In the TLE group, the spatiotemporal pattern of ERD was the same as in normal subjects, but the amplitude of ERD was increased.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Conclusions:</jats:italic> These results indicate that there is a change of reactivity of mu rhythm in patients with partial epilepsy. The change in spatiotemporal pattern of ERD in patients with frequent focal motor seizures suggests that there is an abnormal cortical activation during the planning of a voluntary movement.</jats:p>",
