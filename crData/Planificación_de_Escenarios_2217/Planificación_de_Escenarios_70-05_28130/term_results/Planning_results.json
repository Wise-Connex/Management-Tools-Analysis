Unless the birth registration system is becoming steadily worse or unless the Tunisian population has been decreasing in size, however, the birth rate has fallen; births registered in 1967 or in 1968 were fewer in number than births registered in 1964, 1965, or 1966. The downturn in the crude birth rate occurred shortly after an official national family planning program was inaugurated. Estimates of births averted by contraceptive use, however, suggest that only about one third of the decrease in the rate could be attributed to accomplishments of the program. Occurring at the same time were changes in the age structure which led to smaller numbers of women in the peak reproductive ages and changes in the social status of women which included a sharp reduction in the proportion married in the age group 15–19.</jats:p>",

A neo-Malthusian perspective, in which a reduction of the current high rates of population growth is considered to be a necessary condition for economic development in the less developed countries, is dominant among professionals in family planning. Population control has come to be regarded as a kind of“leading sector” in the development process. The position taken in this paper is that the contention that fertility reduction is crucial to short term economic development is not substantiated empirically and represents a distorted view of the economic development process. Nor is there good evidence that demographic modernization can move far ahead of other aspects of modernization. Skepticism about the success of family planning tends to lead to advocacy of alternative methods of population control which are generally beyond the economic, administrative, and political capacities of the less developed countries and are sometimes repressive in tone. The family planning movement, in overstressing the independent contributions of fertility reduction programs, has tended to underplay conditions such as improved health, lowered mortality, and altered opportunity structure which make these contributions possible at all.</jats:p>",

In this method of testing, a well is pulsed with cycles of injection followed by shut-in, or production followed by shut-in. The pressure response to the cycles is then measured in an offset well.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Articles in the literature1,2 discuss, to some extent, the theory of pulse-testing; but an engineer who wishes to analyze the results of such a test will find that he must make a number of tedious exponential integral calculations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The paper briefly covers the theoretical rationale behind pulse-testing, and then develops some approximate equations. As a result of these equations, two simple graphs are developed that can be used for design and analysis of pulse-tests. An example calculation is shown later in the text.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>General Response Theory</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Pulse-testing was first discussed by Johnson et al.l The concepts involved are fairly straightforward. Briefly, the bottom-hole pressure in a shut-in well will respond to production or injection cycles in an offset well. The magnitude and timing of the response depend on the flow rate, the permeability, porosity and thickness of the formation, and the compressibility and viscosity of the fluids that lie between the wells. Inhomogeneities, geometry and boundaries also affect the response, but these factors are not included in the scope of this paper, nor in the literature.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The equations for the response are line-source solutions to the diffusivity equation. For instance, if a well is produced for a time ?t, then shut in, the equation for the pressure response in the shut-in well isEquation 1</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Going further, if there are a number of cycles of production followed by shut-in, if each production rate is equal, and if each cycle lasts for an equal period of time (?t), then by superposition the equation for the pressure response becomesEquation 2</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>where N is the number of equal-length periods of production and shut-in (for instance, for one production and one shut-in period, N=2; Eq. 1).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Eq. 2 is the same as cited by Johnson et al. Notice that each shut-in and production period is assumed equal. This is not necessary, but it is easier to handle theoretically and will be used throughout the rest of this paper. Also notice that Eqs. 1 and 2 are for production and shut-in. For continuity we will continue to speak of production; but the reader should realize that injection and shut-in will work equally well. We would merely reverse the signs.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although the “diet problem” for animals and humans is similar in basic formulation, psychological parameters relating to monotony and production factors complicate the model for the human diet. The “diet problem” differs from the “menu planning problem” in (1) simplicity of the problem, (2) complete definition of the relevant parameters, and (3) availability of accurate, complete, and reliable data. For these reasons the designation “diet probem” should be restricted to linear programming methods applied in animal feed blending; textbook examples should use feedstuffs for illustration. The term “menu planning problem” should refer to methods for planning menus for the human diet, including the related psychological parameters and production factors, but should not include projects in data collection or the peripheral problems of menu control. </jats:p>",
