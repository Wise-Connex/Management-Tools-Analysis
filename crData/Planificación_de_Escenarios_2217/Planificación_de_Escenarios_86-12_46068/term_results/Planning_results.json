Combination of an even flow constraint with a wealth-maximizing objective function in current formulations of the forest planning model can lead to an anomaly, dubbed the declining even flow effect (DEFE), when the national forest planning process is repeated periodically as required by law. When the effect occurs, first-decade harvests fall during successive planning cycles. The cause lies in both the redefinition of the even flow constraint that occurs at successive planning cycles and the assumptions associated with a capital efficiency objective function that are violated when an even flow constraint is imposed.

On national forests, the relative efficiency of alternative fire management strategies is investigated using a modification of traditional cost plus loss methods. Current procedures do not indicate potential variability in the performance of these alternatives, however. A multiattribute utility model is presented as the appropriate framework for evaluating alternatives when decision-makers are concerned with the risk and efficiency implications of selecting a particular strategy. Among fire management planners, the term risk usually relates a perception of the variability of potential damages. A risk measure is defined and an index is created to indicate the performance of each fire management strategy relative to the potential performance of a standard established as a benchmark. Utility functions for the risk attribute were assessed using hypothetical lotteries where the value (utility) of risk was a function of its deviation from a risk benchmark. Two-attribute utility functions indicated surveyed respondents' preferences for attaining risk and efficiency related objectives. Analysis yielded two conclusions: (1) that fire management planners are not risk-averse, and (2) including risk as an attribute of the decision problem can significantly influence investment selection.

Using these systems, the scheduling of production can be better planned than has been the case using the classic method with a foreman, which has long represented the typical form of organisation in mechanical engineering production. In the following contribution important results of an empirical investigation into the use of EDP-aided production control systems in mechanical engineering firms in West Germany have been summarised. Two different management concepts have been focussed on: one is ‘total planning and control’ (of the production process), and the other ‘framework planning and control’. We will show the consequence production control systems installed according to these concepts are having upon foremen, workers, control personnel and operating results. In addition, indications are put forward for discussion concerning the design of computer-aided production control systems taking into account the interests of all groups in the firm.</jats:p>",

The author concludes that the board of directors, in terms of its mandate, should not only become involved in strategy evaluation but also in the formulation and implementation of strategic plans. This is particularly true within the context of the current socio-economic and political environment in South Africa. The implications of this conclusion for the composition of the board and for the conducting of board affairs are discussed.</jats:p>"

There are certain criteria which the musicians—who must, after all, live with the hall long after the architects and acousticians have departed—consider basic. There are building materials they prefer for acoustical reasons, and configurations they consider better than others. What are these considerations, and how subjective are they?

The paper reports a study undertaken to evaluate and explain the nature and rate of farmer uptake of benefits on sixteen publicly financed projects involving flood alleviation and improved arterial drainage in central England. A total of 177 farmers, 880 blocks of land, and 5500 hectares were surveyed, with data collected on the changes over time in drainage status, land use, and farming system and performance attributable to the improvement schemes. Physical data were converted into standardised enterprise and farm budgets. Particular attention was given to assessing grassland productivity. Benefits were perceived on 58% of the areas. The highest value of benefit uptake was associated with land-use change, field drainage installation, increased nitrogen use on grass, and changes in grass management. Early uptake was associated with land-use change and field drainage. Influencing factors related to a combination of field, farm, and farmer variables. The best performing schemes contained farmer drainage organisations. An S-shaped aggregate uptake curve was derived which, together with the formulation of ‘benefit scenarios’, could be used to help predict uptake on future schemes. </jats:p>",

Using data compiled from international agency sources, and from primary sources, it is shown that fiscal decentralization has gone significantly farther in developed than in developing countries. The use of factor analysis and regression analysis indicates three general explanations for the wide variation in fiscal decentralization among countries. The public expenditure share of subnational governments appears to be greater where the level of economic development is higher, in countries with larger populations, and in countries whose central government budgets carry less of a defense burden. The results also suggest that where central governments mobilize more resources through the revenue system, the subnational government's share of expenditures may be lower—taxes are more likely to stick where they hit than to be passed through as grants to local governments. </jats:p>",

It is argued that economic development is no longer a policy or functional reserve of the national government, nor even an activity exclusively public. All sectors and governmental levels are currently engaged in its practice. Economic development, in effect, has become everyone's business although obvious inadequacies exist in defining what it is, let alone results. The paper provides an historical overview of national involvement in economic development and covers the recent debates over the federal government's appropriate role in fostering development. The remainder of the article traces the evolving and dynamic functioning of US States in the development arena, and the strategies and actions they are taking for strengthening their individual economic foundations. Yet, it is concluded that promising and creative as these ventures may be, it is unclear how much of a measurable impact they have had set against broader economic forces and trends. What is more clear, however, is that US States have emerged at the center of public, private, and intergovernmental activities aimed at responding to changes in the US economy. </jats:p>",

This paper describes the basic data used for the soil database system, and the exploitation of this system in agricultural water planning. The principles for calculating the irrigation need at county level are given and also those for nationwide mapping of the potential need for drainage. Mapping of potentially acid sulphate soils, which has given rise to legislation on drainage of wetlands, is described, and the future use of the soil database system in agricultural water planning is discussed.</jats:p>",

Recent developments in the pattern of local economic activity have been the increasing use of section 137 of the Local Government Act 1972 to fund local programmes, the spread of local authority involvement from the Assisted Areas to the more prosperous regions, and the increasing interest shown by the smaller shire districts, often in rural areas. The portfolio of possible interventions has also changed, bringing a new diversity to the practice of local economic development. Whereas central government has in the past eschewed the temptation to exercise close controls over these activities, the new diversity of local economic initiatives presents it with new dilemmas. It can no longer be assumed that such initiatives will be supportive of central government's spatial or sectoral policies. This vacuum in central-local relations is unlikely to remain, and renewed pressures to grant specific economic development powers to local authorities can be expected. If these claims are accepted, central government will be drawn inexorably into local economic affairs by the need to develop the capacity of local authorities to intervene effectively in pursuit of economic and employment goals. </jats:p>",

The fact that some firms should not plan even in the face of uncertainty and transactions costs emphasizes the importance of the relative magnitudes of various costs and demonstrates the relevance of standard economic analysis for the study and practice of business planning.

The question arises as to whether the attempts to superimpose metropolitan culture via public transport structures in African, Asian, and Central and South American cities were as spectacular and speedy. Attention, in tackling this question, focuses upon the transfer of public transport technological — organisational structures to Southeast Asia since the 1860s. Rather than accept the transitional process of competition through oligopoly to state-monopoly as given, a test is made of whether the basic prerequisites of these phases can be sustained in a Southeast Asian context, from an analysis of core technologies and the structure, conduct, and performance of individual firms. Past corporate growth paths of urban public transport in Southeast Asia can then be mapped out and future directions suggested. </jats:p>",

Mill.) trees dead between 0 and 5 years were sampled in three widely separated areas that had distinctly different population levels of the secondary, stem-attacking, balsam fir bark beetle (Pityokteinessparsus (Lec.)). The percentage of stem volume affected by sap rot increased significantly with the number of years since tree death. The wood volume lost in debarking tests, simulating pulp mill conditions, averaged 23% in trees dead 4–5 years in the two areas with the most sap rot, and in individual trees, debarking losses were significantly correlated with the extent of sap rot. Sap rot developed most quickly where stems had the most bark beetle activity, whereas where the bark beetle population was very low, sap rot development was significantly slower. These results are consistent with those of many earlier studies and observations in which a close relationship has been noted between the extent of sap rot and the intensity of bark beetle attack in stands of budworm-killed balsam fir. Evidence is presented indicating that stem deterioration rates and beetle activity frequently change with time in specific regions during any one budworm outbreak. It is postulated that inoculum levels of Polyporusabietinus (Dicks ex Fr.), the fungus responsible for the sap rot, and population levels of the balsam fir bark beetle are similarly and greatly affected by earlier occurrences of balsam fir mortality in a region. The average density of bark holes, caused by bark beetle tunneling in recently killed trees, can be used as a nondestructive and quick indicator of the average rate of development and probable extent of stem sap rot in budworm-damaged balsam fir stands. This information can be useful in assessments of the economic feasibility of proposed salvage operations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A content analysis was conducted of all UK local daily newspaper articles appearing in the first half of 1981, concerned with nuclear power or renewable alternatives. Evaluative coverage of these technologies was compared on dimensions found to characterise energy issues (economic, environmental, technological, future/political, physical and psychological risks). In addition, comparisons were drawn between coverage in areas ‘threatened’ with the potential siting of a new nuclear power station and that in ‘unaffected’ areas. The development stage of the two technologies and the degree of ‘factual’ as opposed to ‘polemical’ coverage they attracted were also recorded. In evaluative terms, nuclear power was evaluated overwhelmingly negatively, and alternatives positively. Moreover, this pattern showed a degree of consistency irrespective of the dimension of evaluation. The ‘threatened’ subsample was most negatively disposed towards nuclear power. Polemical coverage was greater for nuclear power than for alternatives and greatest in the ‘threatened’ sample. This category also contained articles more likely to attract attention because of their greater headline size and length. Whereas most coverage of nuclear power concentrates on preoperational or operational stages, coverage of alternatives is more concerned with its formative and planning stages. These findings were related to people's attitudes concerning nuclear power, and the growth in antinuclear feeling in particular. </jats:p>",

This article examines the roadblocks to citizen involvement in water resource planning in terms of two policy models: (1) the Social Feasibility Model and (2) the Political Feasibility Model. Each model posits a different role for public participation.</jats:p><jats:p>Although the Political Feasibility Model has been widely accepted in water resource planning, changes in the nature of the policies involved in water resource management have weakened its appropriateness. Currently, social and redistributive policies involving value conflicts often dominate water planning and these policies are best chosen through the Social Feasibility Model. The article discusses the nature of the social feasibility model, the new types of policy decisions facing water resource managers, and how the social feasibility model can help overcome the roadblocks to increased public participation in water resource policy making.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the pattern of purchasing linkages and their relationships with organisational structure of small- and medium-scale industries in Sri Lanka, particularly in the Colombo Metropolitan Area, are examined. The different structural features of this industrial sector, consisting of so-called registered and unregistered firms, reflect differences in size, ownership pattern, and their relationship with government organisations. These structural differences of firms influence their pattern and the degree of relationships with different types of suppliers. </jats:p><jats:p> For the study a sample of 136 firms selected from textile, rubber, and metal industries is used. Principal components analysis is used to analyse the structure of firms and also to identify the significant characteristics of industries. The extent to which the organisational structure of firms is reflected in the purchasing linkage patterns is investigated by means of a correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis. </jats:p><jats:p> The conclusion is made that in most industries, purchasing links are highly localised, and retail and wholesale suppliers are more important than the private manufacturers and government organisations. Patterns of purchasing links and the relationship with different types of suppliers vary with the internal structure of firms and the types of industries involved. The study also suggests strong relationships between organisational structure and links with retailers and wholesalers, weak relationships with private manufacturers and government organisations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Four alternative theoretical approaches to analysing the form of the national state are outlined, their use in studies of African countries noted, and their appropriateness assessed, to provide background for a consideration of the possible utility of the concept of a local state in analysing African urban situations. Instrumentalist views of the national state In Africa are now less widely used than structuralist approaches, and so structuralist approaches have been considered in more detail, A review is presented of the findings of recent studies with respect to the form of the state and the class structure and processes of class formation in developmentalist African states, with particular reference to urban areas. The functions of the state in general terms at national and local levels are discussed, by use of Sandbrook's categorisation of development strategies in Africa. In the absence of studies of urban local government in Africa within the theoretical framework provided by debates on the form and functions of the state, some work on the functions of the local state in the United Kingdom is reviewed, and an initial assessment made of the extent to which the local state in Africa fulfils the same functions and has a similar, albeit limited, degree of autonomy from the national state. It is concluded that there is a case for focusing enquiry on subnational levels of the state in Africa, including the urban local state, and that structuralist views of the form and functions of the national state may be extended to providing a theoretical analysis at the local level, providing that the continuously changing nature and functions of the state, the dynamism and ambiguity of evolving class structures, and the importance of nonclass interests and identities are recognised. </jats:p>",
