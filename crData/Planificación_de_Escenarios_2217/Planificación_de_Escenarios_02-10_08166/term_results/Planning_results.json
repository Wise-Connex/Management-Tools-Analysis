      "abstract": "<jats:p> Previous research had introduced a genetic algorithm procedure for creating alternative policy options for municipal solid waste (MSW) management planning. These alternatives were generated during the design phase of planning, with the final policy determined in subsequent comparative analysis. However, because of the many uncertain factors that exist within MSW systems, this earlier procedure cannot be applied to situations containing such stochastic components. In this paper, it is shown that a generic algorithm approach can be simultaneously combined with simulation to incorporate these stochastic elements in the policy option generation phase; thereby permitting uncertainty to be directly integrated into the construction of the alternatives during the planning-design phase. This procedure is applied to case data taken from the Regional Municipality of Hamilton–Wentworth in the Province of Ontario, Canada. It can be shown that this procedure extends the earlier approach and provides many practical planning benefits for problems when uncertain conditions are present. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This article questions the effectiveness of a managerial tool in changing a health‐care system. The process of implementing regional planning and its impact on creating integrated service networks is examined, using a case study and a multi‐dimensional analytic model. This model highlights the influence of contextual, structural, cultural and dynamic factors on forming networks. The regional planning developed in the province of Québec (Canada), aimed at a major transformation of the mental health‐care system. In each district, organizations working with people who have serious mental disorders were mobilized to plan and implement a more coordinated, continuous and diversified supply of services, under the direction of a regional health body. This study outlines the limitations of regional planning as a tactic for transforming the system. It recommends instead developing more diversified integration strategies to further the process of forming integrated service networks within a complex system. In conclusion, a brief discussion deals with the difficulties related to the study of systemic change implementation. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

We also show the advantage of this approach (relative to the previously suggested tree representations) for patterns with certain natural symmetries. To do this, we describe an example, and discuss its implementation by means of the application procedural interface of our system. Because the chain-model formulation subsumes the tree representation as a special case, the chain-model approach can also be used wherever the tree representation would be appropriate. </jats:p>",

A landscape element which is increasingly the subject of aesthetic scrutiny and visual analysis is the wind-energy turbine or—when installed in large numbers—the wind farm. I take the wind turbine as my subject partly because of its recent significance and also because, as a moving element, it is a special case. I report an Internet-based experiment to determine the relative perceived size of a turbine, image analysis to determine its typical contrast level, and the effect of atmospheric scattering on this contrast. With these three factors and equations derived in an earlier study, estimates are made for the probability of turbine detection, recognition, and visual impact at distances up to 30 km. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Information and communication technology (ICT) is widely accepted as a potentially favourable set of instruments, which may improve the welfare and competitiveness of nations and cities. Nowadays, both public and private actors aim to exploit the expected benefits of ICT developments. The authors seek to investigate the potential of ICT use at an urban level and, in particular, to shed more light on various factors that influence urban ICT policies in the public domain. First, a conceptual framework, designed to improve understanding of the driving forces of urban ICT policies, is outlined. It focuses on the way decisionmakers perceive their city, and shape their opinions about ICT; it addresses in particular the way these decisionmakers evaluate the importance of ICT for their city. Next, interviews with urban decisionmakers in different European cities in three countries (Austria, Spain, and the Netherlands) are used to analyse the complex relationship between perceived urban characteristics (for example, nature of problems and urban image), personal attitudes towards ICT, administrative features of the cities concerned, and perceptions of the relevance of ICT to the cities. The authors' main focus is on the identification of a possible systematic relationship between the aforementioned explanatory factors and urban decisionmakers' attitudes towards ICT policies. Understanding the decisionmakers' perceptions is an important step towards grasping the nature and substance of the policy itself, and may explain some of the variance among different cities. Because the ‘urban ICT’ discourse is still relatively new, an open-interview method is used to capture a variety of different views and perceptions on ICT and on the information age in the city. With the aid of qualitative content analysis, the interview results are transformed into a more systematic and comparable form. The results suggest that even interviewees from the same city may have a different understanding of their urban reality whereas, on the other hand, cities with different characteristics may appear to suffer from similar problems. Moreover, the authors found a wide range of attitudes toward ICT and its expected social impacts, although most of the interviewees appeared to be more sceptical than had been expected. The authors identified a clear need for a more thorough investigation of background factors and, therefore an approach originating from the field of artificial intelligence—rough-set analysis—was deployed to offer a more rigorous analysis. This approach helped in the characterisation and understanding of perceptions and attitudes regarding urban policies, problems, and images.</jats:p>",

This dilution of planning control led to a proliferation of insensitively sited mobile-phone masts across the United Kingdom, prompting large-scale public hostility. After the publication of the Stewart Report in 2000, which pointed to the possible risks to people's psychological health from antennae radiation emissions, the newly devolved planning administrations of the United Kingdom conducted reviews of these permitted development rights. The author examines these reviews and the decisions that emerged from them. It is argued that the differentiated approach to mobile phone mast control that has resulted represents an early and important departure from what was, arguably, a unified planning system within the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

Ironically, efforts to avoid standardization are caught in another trap of sameness and blandness, because a very similar vocabulary is used in the ability of those tourist-historic places to meet the expectations of the universal tourist industry. In this context, we analyzed the recent efforts to integrate an inner-city area, Ankara Citadel and its vicinity, focusing on the changing identity owing to the introduction of income-generating and tourist-attraction facilities.

In recent years, the Free Return System, which is a subsystem of Library Services, has been developed so that users can return books to any library. In this paper, a model for describing the users' choice behaviour of facilities is constructed, and a method for evaluating travel costs accrued when travelling from home to facilities is proposed. The proposed model is applied to actual data of the choice behaviour of users of public libraries. The results of numerical analyses show that the Free Return System can reduce travel costs by 20% on average, and this value is equivalent to a growth of approximately 8% in the user base. </jats:p>",

Socio‐economic inequalities have also increased but there is little information on inequalities in health care utilization. This paper examines the pattern of illness behaviour in Bulgaria, seeking evidence of inequalities in access to services and eliciting users' pathways to care.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Design</jats:title><jats:p>Analysis drew on a representative population survey in Bulgaria (1997). The financial determinants of service use were tested in a multivariate model adjusted first for age, and then for age, marital status and self‐reported health. In‐depth interviews with users and providers addressed pathways to care, use of connections and other informal strategies to obtain care.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Results</jats:title><jats:p>As expected, rates of illness vary with income, with highest rates among the poor. After adjustment for illness, consultation rates are relatively equal across income levels, with the exception of worse‐off women who tend to consult more. For first contact, there are few differences according to income, with the better off preferring secondary level. Pathways slightly differ, with women more often treated in primary care. Private sector utilization is low. Qualitative research reveals well‐established strategies to obtain more advanced care, including use of connections, informal payments and use of emergency services.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>An apparent lack of inequalities in access to care conceals a more complex picture in which income and gender influence the pathways taken through the system.

This is of particular interest at this time, given the changing configuration of the health sector in many countries as a result of health sector reform policies. The article provides a historical overview of the development and emerging role of the church health services within this changing environment.</jats:p><jats:p>The factors affecting the relationship between the government and church sector are identified. These include differences in objectives, types of service provided, and the organizational culture and management styles. The paper then explores key issues seen to affect the future pattern of relationships including the changing scene, and identifies different models for relationships and implications for key actors including the Ministry of Health, church health agencies and coordinating bodies. The article concludes that church health services will continue to play a key role in health care in sub‐Saharan Africa; however, there are challenges facing them and both parties need to develop a response to these.

Assumption-based planning (ABP) is a tool for identifying as many as possible of the assumptions underlying the plans of an organization and bringing those assumptions explicitly into the planning process. This book presents a variety of techniques for rooting out those vulnerable, crucial assumptions. The book also presents steps for monitoring all the vulnerable assumptions of a plan, for taking actions to control those vulnerable assumptions where possible, and for preparing the organization for the potential failure of those assumptions where control is not possible. The book provides a variety of examples and practical advice for those interested in carrying out an application of ABP in the fields of business, management, strategic planning, engineering, and in military applications.</jats:p>",

Implied models of school management and leadership, the legacy of school effectiveness and improvement research and the role of the school principal are considered. Based on this analysis, an alternative approach to planning in schools and to school organisation and a more flexible approach to school organisation and leadership is proposed that is grounded in a shorter planning time scale and the development of structures that facilitate involvement, cooperation and collaboration.</jats:p>",

A critical review is undertaken of this model and attention is especially drawn to a number of key inherent fallacies including spurious rationality, linear as opposed to nonlinear thinking, over‐formalization and a separation of the planning and operational elements of the process. The paper concludes with some thoughts on the potential contribution of alternative strategic management paradigms, and their implications for the preparation of community strategies.

A typical urban configuration, within the dense residential grid, is simulated to evaluate the effects, advantages and limitations of this proposal. In one case, volumes are shaped following existing planning codes. In the other, modifications to avoid shadows on the open space during the cold period of the year are included.

Rather than asking the political science question of why states are committed to Schengen (or not, in the case of the United Kingdom and Ireland), I interpret Schengen as a political moment for genealogical reflection and analysis. The purpose is to contribute to a more historicized understanding of borders. Schengen is analyzed in terms of three trajectories, each of which allows us to denaturalize certain key aspects of the border, such as its identity, function, rationality, and contingency. Schengen is theorized in relation to the geopolitical border, the national border, and the biopolitical border. Other possibilities for genealogies of the border are also canvassed. </jats:p>",

Reports a study about why more persons are not applying for principal positions in Catholic schools in New South Wales, Australia. An analysis of the career aspirations of those eligible and likely to apply at some stage for a principal position revealed a high level of “unwilling” respondents. Ranks and discusses ten factors identified from a study of their perceptions of issues that would discourage or encourage them to apply. The most significant negative factor is the impact on family and personal life. Others include gender issues and the nature of the selection and interview process. The significant positive factor is that principals have the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others. Reflections on the findings include addressing the changing nature of school culture, the implications for the principalship and the need to develop a culture of leadership in schools.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> One dynamic and central element in China's urban landscape is its retail structure. Yet, little attention has been given to the burgeoning retail sector in the vast literature that relates to China's economic reforms. Using the latest census of commercial activity in Beijing and recent empirical work undertaken in the city, we analyze Beijing's postreform retail structure and economy. Beijing's retail sector has been greatly diversified in both ownership and format. In addition to the emergence of the numerous family-based retailers, private and joint-stock companies now represent a significant part of the retail enterprises—a strong trend towards a market-oriented economy. The presence of many overseas-invested enterprises shows that the Beijing consumer market has been effectively opened to foreign competition and that the Beijing government has a strong desire to continue this trend. The high concentration of retail facilities in Beijing proper is closely related to the urban form. The relative concentration of full-line department stores within the third ring road suggests that new entrants will be better off if they stay away from the inner city and take peripheral locations outside the third, or even the fourth, ring road, in conjunction with development of the newly planned suburban communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we address questions of ‘shopping as practised’ and its relation to shopping space. We argue that modes of shopping, which comprise distinctive sets of shopping practices involving relations to goods (purchases), relations of looking (and seeing), the place of shopping in the rhythms of everyday life, and the socialities of shopping, are used to invest meaning in particular types of shopping space and to produce individual, accumulated, personalised shopping geographies that weave together particular locations and generic spaces. Furthermore, modes of shopping are shown to require specific sets of knowledge to practise and to relate to specific subject positions, namely necessity and choice. These arguments are developed in relation to charity shops and charity shopping. However, they are shown to have broader implications: specifically they show the relationality of modes of shopping and shopping spaces, and the distinctions between shopping geographies and retail geographies. Theoretically, they suggest that accounts of shopping need to locate meaning in practice; that the meanings of shopping (and the meanings invested in particular shopping spaces) are therefore potentially unstable; and that accounts of the constituting subjects of shopping need to take seriously the spatialities of subjectivities. </jats:p>",

Both exercises stretched very substantially beyond the previous horizons for such reviews. Through visioning forward as far as 30 years, the Air Force leadership sought to quicken support for substantial reassessments of core programmatic commitments. The availability of two iterations of strategic visioning of this sort affords a rare opportunity to track the effects of an innovative approach to planning under different leaders, institutional approaches, and circumstances. Along the way, the analysis uncovers a number of important issues that might find applicability to other government organizations, whether in the United States or elsewhere.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are being rapidly developed to carry sensors into the sea in ways that have previously not been possible. The full use of the vehicles, however, is still not near realization due to lack of the true vehicle autonomy that is promised in the label (AUV). AUVs today primarily attempt to follow as closely as possible a preplanned trajectory. The key to increasing the autonomy of the AUV is to provide the vehicle with a means to make decisions based on its sensor receptions. The current work examines the use of active sonar returns from mine-like objects (MLOs) as a basis for sensor-based adaptive path planning, where the path planning objective is to discriminate between real mines and rocks. Once a target is detected in the mine hunting phase, the mine classification phase is initialized with a derivative cost function to emphasize signal differences and enhance classification capability. The AUV moves adaptively to minimize the cost function. The algorithm is verified using at-sea data derived from the joint MIT/SACLANTCEN GOATS experiments and advanced acoustic simulation using SEALAB. The mission oriented operating system (MOOS) real-time simulator is then used to test the onboard implementation of the algorithm.</jats:p>",

Playgrounds most often substitute a narrow range of physical activity for the spontaneous play in diverse environments that children more naturally crave. Not only do playgrounds fail to satisfy the complexity of children’s developmental needs, they also tend to separate children from the daily life of their communities - exposure to which is fundamental to the development of civil society. What is needed, argues the author, is not more segregated playgrounds, but a greater attempt to make neighbourhoods safe and welcoming for children, responding to their own preferences for free play close to home. </jats:p>",

Accordingly, to solve the problems allegedly associated with the spatial concentration of poverty, public housing, which concentrates low-income people in the inner city, must be demolished and the residents relocated. In this paper I argue that such federal public housing policies are based on a conceptually inadequate understanding of the role of space and of spatial influences on poverty and on the behavior of poor people. The use of spatial metaphors such as the ‘concentration of poverty’ or the ‘deconcentration of the poor’ disguises the social and political processes behind poverty and helps to provide the justification for simplistic spatial solutions to complex social, economic, and political problems. </jats:p>",

The Unayzah formation had never been tested in North Kuwait before, therefore meticulous planning was required to successfully test this unknown HP-HT formation. The objective of the test was to obtain fluid samples, flow to surface and measure flow rates and establish basic formation properties to determine commercial viability from the deep formations of North Kuwait. This was the deepest well drilled in that area to the depth of more than 20,000 ft, having a formation pressure of 16,158 psi and log temp. of 350 DegF. The well was drilled with 19.6 ppg oil base mud, which was consistent with the formation pressure.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Since the well was rated as one of the deepest well in the Middle East, and it was new experience to KOC to deal with such type of wells, it was a challenging task for the management to successfully test this well. The complications in the drilling also generated lot of constraints, which were to be taken into consideration while designing the test. More than 10 months of careful planning and preparation for special equipment lead to the successful testing of the deepest formation. Special care was taken to take into account the HSE issues to eliminate any chance of loss of life or property, without compromising the test objectives. This case study details the complete sequence of planning and preparation for designing and testing a super deep well like this one, which might be referred as a bench mark for HP-HT testing of deep wells in Kuwait and other places.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Modern exploration for oil is heavily dependent on seismic data, which is used to detect and estimate properties of subsurface reservoirs. Seismic data is processed by applying a sequence of algorithms to filter, estimate velocity fields, beamform, and invert for reservoir properties. There are multiple algorithms to choose from at each processing step—ranging from simple and inexpensive to complex and costly. The Bayesian Cramér–Rao bound, combined with a statistical model of the signal and noise in seismic data, can be used to predict the information content of a specific data set at each stage in a proposed processing flow. This allows the exploration manager to identify the least-cost processing flow to achieve a certain information goal and to identify when the goal is unachievable at any cost. It can also guide research efforts to those processing steps where the greatest amount of information is being lost.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Existing literature on the status of the field of China geography has been focused either on what has been written or on the internal advancement of knowledge in the field, without considering its relationship to the broader social context and academic environment. In this study I adopt a contextual approach to analyzing two interrelated issues: (1) the changing position held by China geography in the grand geographic discipline; and (2) the evolution of discourses formulated by China geographers as a result of interactions with the broader academic environment. A systematic survey of research papers published in leading international journals has placed China geography in a peripheral position, with a volume of research output disproportionate to the size and importance of the nation. Nevertheless, several encouraging trends are observed, including the dramatic growth of research output since the 1990s and the broadening of the field beyond physical geography to encompass human geography and urban studies. A narrative investigation of the professional experience of a leading China geographer reveals a process of discourse (re)construction conditioned by both the changing political economy of China and the shifting emphases in the geographic discipline. Four periods of discourse formation are identified in this case study, namely the conception of the Chinese city as the center of change in the 1970s, interpretation of the uniqueness of Chinese urbanism in the 1980s, modeling of spontaneous town-based urbanization and regional development in the 1990s, and, most recently, the use of the notions of space, place, and transnationalism to construct the Chinese diaspora as a geographic system. Discourse formation in China geography can be understood as the consequence both of the rapidly changing material conditions in China and of discursive practices in the geographic discipline. Much needs to be done by China geographers to go beyond the empirical arena of area studies and become more actively engaged in the ongoing theoretical debates in the mainstream of geography and China studies. </jats:p>",

The operator is planning to develop the gas reserves, partly using existing infrastructure as well as installing new compression and separation facilities at strategic points in the network. The current development plan must meet the gas contract volumes from an inventory of 23 fields, 38 reservoirs produced across 16 platforms. Separation and compression facilities are located on three different platforms and one offshore island base.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This paper describes the total system model built from the reservoirs to the various delivery points. The integration of reservoir material balance models with a network optimizer via systems analysis is described. Particular attention is given to the surface network infrastructure which is complex in several key areas. The resulting model was \"timestepped\" forward on an annual frequency to generate the forecast profile.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The results from the study have confirmed the ability of the proposed production network to meet the operator's sales and fuel gas obligations. Other benefits include identification of compression requirements and scheduling which can be used directly in the full-field development planning. These results are not only of use in the early FEED, but are also important for investment planning throughout the life of the project.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The integrated model, besides capable of being used in a forward planning mode as at present, can also be migrated for eventual use in the optimization of production operations, both on and off line. Well, reservoir and facilities data incorporated into the model at this early stage thus provide an important element of knowledge capture for future planning and optimization of the asset.</jats:p>",

In the 1980s the national governments of many countries became less directly involved, with the consequence that spatial policy and urban policy were left more to the marketplace. In that period, this trend could also be observed in the Netherlands. Since the mid-1990s, however, in the Netherlands there has been a new public commitment to infrastructure policy and urban policy, and also to spatial policy. In this paper I account for this marked change of course by the extra profits which the Netherlands has received, particularly since the 1990s, from excise duty on natural gas and government income from the privatization of government services. Privatization and the export of natural gas have enabled the Dutch government to put more public investment into the development of traffic infrastructure and the regeneration of cities. </jats:p>",

Yet data reveal that, during the 1990s, Estonia was relatively adept at cleaning up old contamination. In this paper we identify the key determinants of Estonia's relatively high level of success at environmental remediation. Content analyses of clean-up experiences were performed for three main categories of contaminated sites: ex-military, industrial, and municipal. All analyzed sites were identified by the government of Estonia as priority environmental hot spots in the early 1990s. The most successfully remediated sites were recipients of foreign direct investment or foreign aid, or both, and particularly aid from international financial institutions (IFIs). IFIs and foreign private actors were persuaded to act because of their confidence in the income-generating potential of the projects. In light of this finding, revisions must be made to an oft-cited model of ‘institutions for international environmental cooperation’. In its current form, this model downplays external actors' market-oriented motives.</jats:p>",

Second, I connect the poetics of resistance of the Forest with the politics of territorial land claims of the North Sutherland Community Forestry Trust, whose objective is to reverse ongoing processes of dispossession through the collective ownership and management of the 3000–hectare Borgie Forest which the one-hectare Millennium Forest borders. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The data presented here were collected as one component of a project aimed at developing a regional innovation strategy for the West Midlands region of England. Like most regional policy measures the regional innovation strategy programme was driven by concern over widening economic performance differences between (European) regions and was intended as a means of closing observed cohesion and technology gaps [Commission of the European Communities, 1998 Reinforcing Cohesion and Competitiveness Through Research, Technological Development and Innovation COM (98) 275]. More importantly, however, the notion that distinct regional innovation strategies may be developed in each assisted region is premised on a belief in underlying idiosyncrasies in regional resource endowments, competencies, institutional infrastructure, industry, and governance. In other words, it is premised on the belief that there exist, or may exist with sufficient encouragement or facilitation, distinct regional innovation systems within Europe (Thomas K, 2000 Regional Studies34 190–198). Accordingly, my purpose in the current paper is to outline the basic precepts underpinning a systemic approach to innovation, generally, and a regional systemic approach, specifically. Thereafter, an attempt is made to map partially the existence, or indeed absence, of a West Midlands regional innovation system, proxied by available firm-level data, and to comment on the appropriateness of regional systems of innovation as units of analyses. </jats:p>",

Sometimes such ‘scale jumping’ is also seen as part of an effort to bypass the nation-state. This paper explores a particular case of scale jumping, which illustrates some of the complexities of the process. Building on the anticorporate globalization momentum generated during the ‘battle in Seattle’ and the demonstrations during the February 2000 United Nations Commission on Trade and Development meetings in Bangkok, local antidam activists from Ubon Ratchathani province in Thailand scaled up their activities during 2000, utilizing various international connections to improve their visibility and strengthen their prospects for success. Rather than simply bypassing the nation-state, however, they have had to use both local and international resources to try to combat the policies of the nation-state, a project in which they have had real but still contested success. The case of antidam activism in Ubon Ratchathani illustrates some of the nuances of ‘globalization from below’, as well as the continuing power and relevance of the nation-state as a site of struggle. </jats:p>",

This project established a wellness program at a major university using a participatory planning approach that is applicable to other complex organizations. University students, faculty, staff, administrators, and retirees volunteered to participate in a 12-week planning project. The project consisted of weekly sessions designed to promote participation, ownership, and problem solving. Activities included information exchange, wellness lifestyle practice, reflection, discussion, and wellness program planning. Participants organized themselves into special task forces to identify campus health problems, barriers, and resources as well as to define goals and implementation strategies for a proposed ongoing university wellness program. A campus-wide university wellness program was implemented the following academic year. The project was effective in overcoming institutional barriers and mobilizing community resources. It is recommended that this approach be used in other settings. </jats:p>",

A nonrepresentative sample of 635 seminarians (90.5% Anglo; 66.5% male) from 10 theological schools in the United States completed a mailed survey. Students were classified according to their religious beliefs as conservative (61.9%) and nonconservative (38.1%), and group differences in intention (and its correlates) were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to assess relationships among attitudes toward sexuality, attitudes toward family planning, subjective norms, knowledge, self-efficacy, and intention for both conservative and nonconservative students. Results indicated that the relationships among predictors of intention were essentially similar for both conservative and nonconservative seminarians, with attitudes and self-efficacy for promoting family planning exhibiting the strongest direct effects on intention. </jats:p>",

It is shown that both are dynamic innovation and production centres for populate music. In both cases local characteristics of the organisational and firm structure in the industry are claimed to be crucial for understanding innovation processes and the competitiveness of the resulting products. However, it is shown that considerable differences exist between the two centres in terms of the profits and returns (both monetary and otherwise) on global competitiveness and success made both by local actors and by the local production system. It is suggested that two crucial areas explain these unequal returns to commercially successful creativity: interfirm and intrafirm links between the local and global; and the effectiveness of intellectual property regimes. It is suggested that work on cultural-products industries must attempt to understand not only the processes from which commercial innovation arises and in which it is embedded, but also the processes and mechanisms by which appropriate levels of returns on creativity can be secured by the local production centre. </jats:p>",

This paper, through a case study of the emergence of Kunshan in southern Jiangsu (Sunan), shows that the orthodox Sunan model centered on the development of township and village enterprises (TVEs) has become inadequate to account for the recent development and restructuring in Sunan. I argue that spatial development in China is a complicated process incorporating the role of the state, local development conditions, and foreign investment. Moreover, there are strong geographical foundations for the functioning of local states. The arguments are particularly relevant to the transitional nature of provincial China, where the state still plays a significant role in development while local and global forces have emerged as equally important forces. </jats:p>",

Observing which strategies are chosen can help us to understand relative priorities in speech planning and phonology [Wood, J. Phonetics (1996)]. One particularly felicitous case of such a conflict is the interaction between tongue tip position for English /r/ and vowels and the flapping of /t/ and /d/. This study presents data from ultrasound imaging of tongue kinematics and acoustic output during productions of words containing sequences of vowels, flaps and /r/’s. Results show that for at least some speakers of North American English, a flap may be produced either up (from tip-down to retroflex, as in ‘‘Jupiter’’) or down (from retroflex to tip-down, as in ‘‘puberty’’). For the one speaker analyzed to date, r-flap-r (‘‘frankfurter’’) and V-flap-V (‘‘taffeta’’) begin in the correct position for the leftmost segment in each sequence (retroflex and tip-down, respectively). However, ‘‘double flaps’’ start in tongue down position (‘‘Saturday,’’ ‘‘editor’’), even when it forces compromise of multiple vowel/liquid tongue positions (‘‘absurdity’’). Flap kinematics thus take precedence over tongue position (and therefore acoustic realization) for vowels/liquids. Additional results will be presented.

Unfortunately, many operators use decision-making processes that are inappropriately weighted toward cost reduction and insufficiently or incompletely weighted toward incorporating completion processes that will ensure adequate producing rates.

Increasing initial well costs about 20 to 25% resulted in a 3- to 10-fold increase in economic returns. This project included wells drilled in the heart of the play, in one of the flank areas, and also in an \"edge\" portion of the field, with comparisons to openhole completions in each area. The project offers several guidelines that should be followed by almost any global application of horizontal completions in lower-permeability reservoirs.</jats:p>",

In the case of manufacturing MOFAs, local business partners in West Sweden seem to be important as cooperative partners. By using a multiple logistic regression to analyse key determinants, it was found that the size of MOFAs positively affected the establishment of technological linkages to business partners in Sweden, among both manufacturing MOFAs and sales MOFAs. A positive correlation with linkage formation was also found among manufacturing MOFAs regarding both increasing age and the extent in which they operate within competitive Swedish industry clusters. </jats:p>",

The objective of the well was to produce water-free (dry) oil at high rate from a difficult-to-reach portion of the reservoir. Dry production is especially desirable due to constrained wet crude processing capacity. The well successfully delivered the expected rate, making this well the highest-rate producer in the field.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Uncertainty in structure and stratigraphy are inherent in the area due to weak/noisy seismic reflections and rapid change in reservoir facies in marine-influenced channel deposits. Innovative correlation schemes and detailed reservoir description were used to reduce uncertainties. The trajectory was designed along the direction of maximum principal stress to overcome borehole instability problems. The horizontal-section was drilled with minimum overbalance to avoid potential reservoir damage.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Well-site data including logging-while-drilling (LWD), cuttings, and drilling data were used to identify faults along the well and to optimize the selection of kick-off point (KOP) and end-of-build (EOB). Subtle markers were identified while drilling, and the trajectory was geo-steered within the channel sand while maintaining maximum standoff from a rising oil-water contact (OWC). Absence of shale along 3000-ft of horizontal/high angle section was instrumental in faster drilling. Low mud weight was used to minimize potential formation damage caused by prolonged formation exposure to high-density mud.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The completion of the well was designed to deliver long-term high-rate dry oil production. The horizontal section of the well was cased and cemented to ensure zonal isolation. A perforation strategy was developed and implemented to encourage even flow from the reservoir along the productive section to avoid local water coning, facilitate future well intervention and increase productivity index (PI) by reducing potential skin. External casing Packers were used to further ensure isolation of across a fault in the horizontal section. 5-1/2\" tubing with appropriate jewelry was selected to accommodate the expected high rate and to ensure well integrity.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The details of the multidisciplinary approach and the lessons learnt during planning and implementation of this horizontal well are summarized in this paper.</jats:p>",

Structural Funds have played a crucial compensatory role, promoting the economic development and real convergence of lagging regions. The amount of resources destined to regional policy and the conflicts arising from its funding and distribution create the need for an adequate theoretical foundation or model to help politicians solve the distribution problem. In this paper we propose an empirical procedure to carry out and evaluate different distributions of funds for the periods 1989 – 93 and 1994 – 99. We begin with the estimation of an augmented production function to permit the calculation of the expected GDP per capita. We then propose a nonlinear programming method to simulate alternative distributions of Structural Funds among Objective 1 regions, based upon two different approaches: equal development, and equal opportunities. For these two approaches we calculate different possibilities, ranging from highly efficient to highly equitable, with the result that we are able to show the ‘frontier’ of optimal distributions. Finally, we evaluate these results and compare them with the real distribution. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The question of where to accommodate future urban expansion has become a politically sensitive issue in many regions. Against the backdrop of ‘urban compaction’ policy, this study uses population surface modelling and cellular automata (CA) to conduct an empirical urban growth simulation for Southeast England. This implementation leads to a consideration of the proper balance between the theoretical abstraction of self-organised growth and empirical constraints to land development. Specifically, we use 1991 and 1997 postcode directories to construct population surfaces. From these, the distributions of developed and vacant (rural) land are derived. Development potential is assessed through accessibility surfaces, which are constructed from the travel/commuting time to major London rail termini, to motorway junctions, and to principal settlements. Through investigating the frequencies of land development in relation to the accessibility surfaces, we can begin to understand the distribution of land development in this region. Based on this empirical relationship, the transition rules of a CA simulation of future urban expansion are constructed. In addition, government population projections at the county level are used to constrain simulation to the year 2020. The study demonstrates the utility of empirical CA in urban growth modelling; in particular the importance of empirically informed CA simulation rules in characterising the distribution of land development. </jats:p>",

For this purpose, we trained a monkey to capture a target on a video screen with the part of the arm displayed on the screen. The target-capturing body part was either the right or left side of the hand image. Because the actual arm movement was invisible, the motor task was guided by the arm image, which was at times right-left inverted on the screen. We found that neuronal activity in the PMd predominantly reflected arm-image movement rather than the actual arm movement, and for half of PMd neurons, the activity differed depending on the target-capturing body-part defined in the right or left side of the arm image. </jats:p>",

A key feature of this agenda is the emphasis on paid work as a mechanism of social inclusion. However, the UK government is about to implement the Police Act (1997) which will increase the access of employers to the criminal records of job applicants. The author investigates how employers currently respond to job applications from offenders, and examines the likely impact of this new legislation on their recruitment. The key findings are that the Police Act will heighten discrimination against offenders, undermining the policy focus on combating social exclusion. This contradiction reflects the increasingly punitive response of successive UK governments to those committing criminal acts, and the narrow way in which social exclusion has been defined. </jats:p>",

At the same time, the PCG's history illustrates that “aggressive” Cold War policies had not been completely dismissed by the Eisenhower administration, a situation that contributed to the “conflicting approaches” strategy it pursued in 1955 and 1956 and the contradictions that adversely affected its policies in Eastern Europe.

According to the new economies of labor migration, it is often a strategy used by families with small farms to acquire investment capital for future business formation. In this paper, I argue further that human-capital accretion during migration reinforces the mobilization of local social capital, which in turn enhances a returnee's entrepreneurship. By using the results of an in-depth survey of returned labor migrants in rural China, I seek to explain the mobilization of social capital and income return to entrepreneurship in a multivariate framework. I find that skilled returnees are indeed more prone to mobilize social capital. The income return to local social capital is as considerable as that to investment capital and skills acquired at the urban destination. The findings suggest that the consequences of labor migration can be better understood through the integration of the new economics of labor migration and social capital </jats:p>",

In this paper I examine the use of task forces to organise economic development at employer, sectoral, and territorial levels at the local and regional scales in the North East region of England. It is argued that New Labour's experimental use of task forces reflects a particular mediation of more general tendencies in the historical evolution of state modernisation, which varies in particular and contingent ways at the local and regional levels. The research reveals the continued importance of the existing public-sector and public—private-sector institutions, the less significant and contingent role of the private sector, and the contribution of the task force to the ‘quasi-governance’ of the United Kingdom, with its problems of coordination, transparency, and accountability. A renewed politics of economic development governance is required to establish the accountability and legitimacy of such bodies in the context of the emergent multilayered governance system of the UK political economy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors discuss the regulation of rural land use and compensation for property-rights restrictions, both of which appear to have become more commonplace in recent years but also more contested. The implications of contemporary theories in relation to this matter are examined, including: the applicability of new welfare economics; the relevance of the neoclassical theory of politics; and the implications of contemporary theories of social conflict resolution and communication. Examination of examples of Swiss and Australian regulation of the use of rural properties, and the ensuing conflicts, reveals that many decisions reflect a mixture of these elements. Rarely, if ever, are social decisions in this area made solely on the basis of welfare economics, for instance social cost-benefit analysis. Only some aspects of such decisions can be explained by the neoclassical theory of politics. Theories of social conflict resolution suggest why, and in what way, approaches of discourse and participation may resolve conflicts regarding regulation and compensation. These theories and their practical application seem to gain in importance as opposition to government decisions increases. The high degree of complexity of most conflicts concerning regulation and compensation cannot be tackled with narrow economic theories. Moreover, the Swiss and Australian examples show that approaches involving conflict resolution may favour environmental standards. </jats:p>",

Our recently developed module is self-reconfigurable. A group of the modules can thus generate various three-dimensional robotic structures and motions. Although the module itself is a simple mechanism, self-reconfiguration planning for locomotion presents a computationally difficult problem due to the many combinatorial possibilities of modular configurations. In this paper, we develop a two-layered planning method for locomotion of a class of regular structures. This locomotion mode is based on multi-module blocks. The upper layer plans the overall cluster motion called flow to realize locomotion along a given desired trajectory; the lower layer determines locally cooperative module motions, called motion schemes, based on a rule database. A planning simulation demonstrates that this approach effectively solves the complicated planning problem. Besides the fundamental motion capacity of the module, the hardware feasibility of the planning locomotion is verified through a self-reconfiguration experiment using the prototype modules we have developed. </jats:p>",

This article explores the progress of local budget holders for health services in the two countries—primary care groups/trusts in England and county councils and municipalities in Sweden—in developing consultative and participative processes. Using secondary and primary research methods, the study identified much activity among English primary care groups/trusts, although with less certainty of outcome. In Sweden, initiatives were limited to a few county councils, were more distinctive, and in the case of one county council, resulted in the sustained channeling of citizens' views. In comparing and contrasting the approaches in the two countries, the authors note the importance of political cultures and institutional arrangements as well as, more generally, the complexities and challenges of consultation and participation in health care planning. </jats:p>",

The district's current strategic planning process therefore could have substantial effects on regional water planning and management. The rate restructuring phase of the planning process has produced a multiple component, cost of service based framework. This paper describes that framework as well as some criticisms that have been directed toward it. The rate restructuring was shaped, and for a while stalled, by old disputes among member agencies over rights to water supplied by Metropolitan. That controversy has diverted attention from the resource management implications of the rate structure. This paper presents an alternative future focused approach to regional integrated water resource planning for Southern California based on projections of current trends and anticipation of future events. This discussion raises the question of how regional integrated water resources planning of this sort may proceed, and what role Metropolitan will play in that process.</jats:p>",

To improve patient safety and to determine the radiobiological characteristics of the epithermal neutron beam of Finnish BNCT facility (FiR 1) dose‐response studies were carried on the brain of dogs before starting the clinical trials. A dose planning procedure was developed and uncertainties of the epithermal neutron‐induced doses were estimated. The accuracy of the method of computing physical doses was assessed by comparing with <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> dosimetry. Individual radiation dose plans were computed using magnetic resonance images of the heads of 15 Beagle dogs and the computational model of the FiR 1 epithermal neutron beam. For <jats:italic>in vivo</jats:italic> dosimetry, the thermal neutron fluences were measured using Mn activation foils and the gamma‐ray doses with MCP‐7s type thermoluminescent detectors placed both on the skin surface of the head and in the oral cavity. The degree of uncertainty of the reference doses at the thermal neutron maximum was estimated using a dose‐planning program. The estimated uncertainty (±1 standard deviation) in the total physical reference dose was ±8.9%. The calculated and the measured dose values agreed within the uncertainties at the point of beam entry. The conclusion is that the dose delivery to the tissue can be verified in a practical and reliable fashion by placing an activation dosimeter and a TL detector at the beam entry point on the skin surface with homogeneous tissues below. However, the point doses cannot be calculated correctly in the inhomogeneous area near air cavities of the head model with this type of dose‐planning program. This calls for attention in dose planning in human clinical trials in the corresponding areas.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. The first global tropospheric forecasts of O3 and its precursors have been used in the daily flight planning of field measurement campaigns. The 3-D chemistry-transport model MATCH-MPIC is driven by meteorological data from a weather center (NCEP) to produce daily 3-day forecasts of the global distributions of O3 and related gases, as well as regional CO tracers. This paper describes the forecast system and its use in three field campaigns, MINOS, CONTRACE and INDOEX. An overview is given of the forecasts by MATCH-MPIC and by three other chemical weather forecast models (EURAD, ECHAM, and FLEXPART), focusing on O3 and CO. Total CO and regional CO tracers were found to be the most valuable gases for flight planning, due to their relatively well-defined anthropogenic source regions and lifetimes of one to a few months. CO was in good agreement with the observations on nearly all the flights (generally  r &gt; 0.7, RMS  &lt; 20%). In every case in which the chemical weather forecasts were primarily responsible for the flight plans, the targeted features were observed. Two forecasted phenomena are discussed in detail: outflow from Asia observed in the Mediterranean upper troposphere during MINOS, and outflow from North America observed in the middle troposphere over northern Europe during CONTRACE. It is shown that although such pollution plumes occur repeatedly during the months around the campaigns, their frequency is sufficiently low (~10--30% of the time) that global chemical weather forecasts are important for enabling them to be observed during limited-duration field campaigns. The MATCH-MPIC chemical weather forecasts, including an interface for making customized figures from the output, are available for community use via  http://www.mpch-mainz.mpg.de/~lawrence/forecasts.html .\n                        </jats:p>"

RWED and WBNP maintain Anthrax Emergency Response Plans (AERPs) for their respective jurisdictions. An AERP is a pre‐planned logistical framework for responding effectively and rapidly to an outbreak so as to minimize spread of the disease, reduce environmental load of spores available for future outbreaks, and minimize risk to public health. In this paper, we describe the main components of an AERP and outline areas for future research.</jats:p>",
