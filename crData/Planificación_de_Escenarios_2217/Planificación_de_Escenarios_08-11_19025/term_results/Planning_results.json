      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, we argue that Niklas Luhmann has a lot to offer present-day planning theory. Until now, planning theory has been engaged with Luhmann's work only minimally. Convinced of its potential, we want to show how Luhmann's systems theory offers fresh insight into both limits and possibilities of planning in contemporary society. We argue that Luhmann's understanding of society as functionally differentiated into self-referentially closed subsystems (politics, economy, law, science, etc.) creates space for a complex and subtle analysis of planning practice. In particular, we look at the role of planning within an autopoietic account of society, and its ability to steer other social subsystems. Planning is seen as the form of steering aiming to coordinate processes of spatial organization, therefore an activity dealing with steering problems. We illustrate key concepts of the systems theory in brief analyses of planning situations and interpret these situations using the systems theoretical framework. The analyses center around the questions of planning's steering capacity and the role of the planner, thus creating linkages with mainstream discussions in planning theory. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Planning systems are not the property of planners alone, rather they are collectively owned by the broad range of stakeholders that planning involves and affects (after Hague, 2000). As a consequence, issues of participation, responsiveness and relevance are fundamental to the health and vitality of planning systems. To accurately diagnose this aspect of the patient's condition it is necessary, as Allmendinger notes, to examine `the rich context in which planning operates' (2002: 4). This article does so by shedding light on planning consultation at the local level. It examines the often overlooked relationships between community councils (the lowest level of statutory community representation in planning) and principal councils (a term employed to include all local authorities and national parks that make planning decisions). The article will illustrate the frequency, function and degree of agreement existing between different council tiers on planning deliberations and, from this, identify a number of crucial points of tension between community councils and the planning system. These tensions centre on the nature of democracy within the system, the legitimacy of local knowledge in deliberation, and perhaps most importantly, the (perceived) interests and values of the planning system as they are practised. The article will argue that these tensions produce both competence and confidence disparities between councils and, as a consequence, the planning dialogue is reduced to each council `talking to the hand' of the other. Such circumstances raise important concerns regarding the vitality of the planning system in remaining relevant and responsive to these local participants, and thus the health of the planning system overall. </jats:p>",

Zeno paradoxes are a good example of their use in antiquity, while in modern science theoretical physics stands as a domain where paradoxes are intensively used. This is not the case with cities and their planning, however. This article introduces paradoxes as useful means to study predictions in the context of cities and their planning. It discusses several city planning paradoxes and suggests seeing their origin in the complexity of cities and in the role played by cognitive maps and information exchange in complex, self-organizing cities. </jats:p>",

We adopt Fainstein's two-part definition of what is `valued' in a just city, and then discuss how planners who are racial minorities might be helpful for one part of that definition. Minority-race professionals may help bring tangible benefits to the workforce, but these benefits become difficult to cultivate if minority-race professionals experience difficulties in their work environment. Interviews with several US black planners provide illustrative examples concerning these points. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In many sub‐Saharan African countries, young women face decreasing educational opportunities, age asymmetries between sexual partners, and high prevalence of HIV infection. This study draws upon data from the 2002 Cameroon Adolescent Reproductive Health Survey to analyze the determinants of young women's perceived ability to refuse sex in urban Cameroon. Our findings are consistent with predictions of social exchange theory: young women's status characteristics predict their vulnerability differently under different circumstances, and, overall, young women report having a lower ability to refuse sex in their relationships with men who offer to pay their school fees than in their relationships with men in positions of power over them. The costs and benefits of sexual exchanges made in order to continue one's education increase simultaneously in a context of declining enrollments and spreading HIV infection. When educational aspirations exceed opportunities, policy supporting access to education could reduce young women's need to employ their sexual resources in order to invest in their future.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study puts forth three criteria for assessing the extent to which the timing of sexual, marital, and reproductive transitions among male and female adolescents could be considered “too young”: (1) the physiological maturation of the body; (2) the cognitive capacity for making safe, informed, and voluntary decisions; and (3) institutionalized concepts of “old enough” for consent to sexual intercourse and marriage as reflected in legal frameworks and international standards. Expansion of the age grouping of adolescence is proposed, from the customary 15–19 into three age categories—early adolescence (ages 10–14, or 10–11 and 12–14), middle adolescence (15–17), and late adolescence (18–19)—to better capture the age‐specific variations in the trajectories of male and female sexual, marital, and reproductive events. An application of the three adolescent development criteria to the timing of transitions observed in Demographic and Health Surveys in 64 developing countries leads to the conclusion that boys and girls aged 14 and younger are universally “too young” to make safe and consensual transitions; that 15–17‐year‐olds may or may not be too young, depending on their circumstances; and that 18‐year‐olds are generally “old enough.” Policies and programs should focus on capacity building and the creation of an enabling environment for making safe and voluntary transitions among all age groups, but particularly among 10–14‐year‐olds, whose sexual and reproductive health and rights are so clearly at stake.</jats:p>",

Data are analyzed from the Cape Area Panel Study (CAPS), a recently collected longitudinal survey of young adults and their families in metropolitan Cape Town. We find that teen pregnancy is not entirely inconsistent with continued schooling, especially for African (black) women. More than 50 percent of African women who were pregnant at age 16 or 17 were enrolled in school the following year. We estimate probit regressions to identify the impact of individual and household characteristics on sexual debut, pregnancy, and school dropout between 2002 and 2005. We find that male and female students who performed well on a literacy and numeracy exam administered in 2002 were less likely than those who performed more poorly to become sexually active and less likely to drop out of school by 2005. Surprisingly, 14–16‐year‐olds who had completed more grades in school in 2002, conditional on their age, were more likely than those who had completed fewer grades to have become sexually active by 2005, a potential indicator of peer effects resulting from the wide dispersion in age per grade in South African schools. Overall, this study shows the importance of accounting for a measure that reflects the knowledge and skills of young people in an examination of their transitions to adulthood.</jats:p>",

We find that prior schooling discontinuities—defined as instances of non‐pregnancy‐related grade repetition or temporary withdrawals from school—are strongly associated with a young woman's likelihood of later becoming pregnant while enrolled in school, dropping out of school if she becomes pregnant, and not returning to school following a pregnancy‐related dropout. Young women who are the primary caregivers to their children are also significantly more likely to leave school than are those who have help with their childcare responsibilities. Given the increasing importance of female school participation in sub‐Saharan Africa, programs must be designed to reach girls and their families early to increase incentives for ensuring their timely progression through school and to increase their access to reproductive health information and services.</jats:p>",

Using household survey and qualitative data, this study examines partnership dynamics and characteristics in the context of HIV risk, including number of partners, age differences, partnership duration and concurrency, and frequency of contact among young people aged 15–24 in rural KwaZulu‐Natal, South Africa. One‐third of the men surveyed reported multiple and/or concurrent partnering, and one‐fourth of the women had partners who were five years older than they were. Nonparticipation in civic organizations or school was correlated with higher‐risk partnerships for women but not for men. On average, relationships lasted more than a year for the women and men surveyed, and were frequently characterized as “serious.” Qualitative findings pointed to the sequential and overlapping nature of relationships, however, with distance and mobility being important influences. These fluid partnership patterns are an important feature of young people's sexual risk in the context of South Africa's severe HIV epidemic.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>With the spread of formal schooling in sub‐Saharan Africa and delays in the age at marriage, a growing proportion of adolescents remain enrolled in school when they “come of age.” As a consequence, more and more adolescents have to negotiate sexual maturation and sexual initiation in a vastly different context from that of prior generations. Using data from the 2004 National Survey of Adolescents conducted in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi, and Uganda, we investigate the empirical association between premarital sex and leaving school among those who were enrolled in school at the outset of adolescence (age 12). Discrete‐time logistic regression models show that, in general, girls are more likely than boys to leave school before completing secondary school, before completing primary school, and, among those completing primary school, before progressing to secondary school. Girls who complete primary school, however, do so at the same age as or a younger age than their male peers. Girls appear more vulnerable to leaving school once they engage in premarital sex. These findings can assist researchers, policymakers, program managers, and educators in understanding and addressing the challenges to educational attainment posed by the increasing proportion of school‐aged adolescents engaging in premarital sex.</jats:p>",

Apart from the surgery itself (median 81 min per procedure), the longest interval was the time taken to get patients into the anaesthetic room from the ward (median 20 min). Although patients waited a median of 10 min before the start of anaesthesia, if the first procedure on the list was excluded, the anaesthetist was waiting for the patient to arrive in the anaesthetic room in 13/30 (43%) cases, wasting a median of 7 min per case. The surgeon had to wait a median of 22.5 min between operations.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions</jats:bold> Considerable operating theatre time is wasted while patients are transferred to and from the operating theatre resulting in both anaesthetists and surgeons having to wait between patients in a high proportion of cases, averaging 1 h during a 4 h operating list. Surgery could be made more time efficient by ensuring that patients arrive in the operating theatre complex early enough (to reduce time wasted for anaesthetists and surgeons), and by having two anaesthetists available at the end of surgery, one to reverse the anaesthetic while the other starts the next induction (to reduce time waste for the surgeon), coupled to adequate recovery area capacity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Analysis of data from a questionnaire survey of 2,000 young Malians undertaken by the authors in 2002 demonstrates that, even in underprivileged urban and rural populations, changes in sexual behavior are emerging. Among women, first sex and motherhood are taking place slightly later, and a minority is now dissociating sexuality and procreation. Our data confirm the considerable impact of female education on this transition. Girls’ sexual activity before procreation is also influenced by lower religiosity. Among men, in contrast, in a traditional context of late sexual debut and fatherhood, the trend is toward earlier sexual activity and procreation. Fatherhood is delayed, however, among better‐educated, wealthier, and less religious urban men, who therefore experience a longer period of sexual activity before they begin to build their own families. The study concludes with an analysis of the possible association of the sexual transition with young people's increased vulnerability resulting from their adoption of risky sexual behaviors and from unfavorable conditions surrounding the arrival of their first child.</jats:p>",

It can be regarded as another tool for improving the odds of success by remaining in the productive zone for longer periods of drilling. Also, it can be used to optimize the positioning of a horizontal wellbore in the sweet spots within the reservoir. The current process has been successfully applied to large infill drilling programs at over 40 wells for heavy oil, tight gas, conventional oil and gas plays and for Mannville coalbed methane (CBM) in Alberta. The service has been provided irrespective of location, as long as the Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language (WITSML)/Pason Satellite service is available.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Exploration and production (E&amp;P) companies are continuously being driven to reduce the cost per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). E&amp;P needs and technologies related to advanced and accurate directional drilling, communication of vital data in real-time through the internet, as well as reduced cycle time associated with advanced forward-looking 3D geo-modelling and visualization technologies (Figure 1), are currently converging. The motivation to reduce costs has been responsible for advancing the horizontal well geosteering process by incorporating the Measurement While Drilling (MWD) tool into mainstream drilling practices. The universal economic benefits gained can be found in all resource play types (conventional oil and gas, heavy oil, tight gas and coalbed methane).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>It is important to note that the process described here is essentially collaborative. For best results, there must be cooperation between the E&amp;P operational geologist, wellsite geologist, directional driller and geo-modelling staff, as well as the engineering consultants involved in the project (i.e. the team as a whole).</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:sec>\n                        <jats:title>Reducing Costs and Increasing Performance for Optimal Well Results</jats:title>\n                        <jats:p>Whether drilling a long reach horizontal well in heavy oil or a tight gas play, the basic requirements for a successful well are:Planning the optimal path based on the current knowledge of integrated geological/geophysical models.Monitoring the progress of the well through real-time updates by well profiles and 3D visualizations.Continuously re-mapping to identify the true stratigraphic position (TSP) of the bit relative to the reservoir.

This reduces guesswork in the drilling process which translates into less drilling time for a given well, ultimately decreasing the total cost and increasing profits. The 3D geo-models can be updated every few minutes for structural changes and periodically for characterization of gamma ray (GR), resistivity and other reservoir attributes.</jats:p>\n                     </jats:sec>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study investigates the reporting of premarital sex in rural southern Malawi. It summarizes the results of an interview‐mode experiment conducted with unmarried young women aged 15–21 in which respondents were randomly assigned to either an audio computer‐assisted self‐interview (ACASI) or a conventional face‐to‐face (FTF) interview. In addition, biomarkers were collected for HIV and three STIs: gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis. Prior to collecting the biomarkers, nurses conducted a short face‐to‐face interview in which they repeated questions about sexual behavior. The study builds on earlier research among adolescents in Kenya where we first investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of ACASI. In both Malawi and Kenya, the mode of interviewing and questions about types of sexual partners affect the reporting of sexual activity. Yet the results are not always in accordance with expectations. Reporting for “ever had sex” and “sex with a boyfriend” is higher in the FTF mode. When we ask about other partners as well as multiple lifetime partners, however, the reporting is consistently higher with ACASI, in many cases significantly so. The FTF mode produced more consistent reporting of sexual activity between the main interview and a subsequent interview. The association between infection status and reporting of sexual behavior is stronger in the FTF mode, although in both modes a number of young women who denied ever having sex test positive for STIs/HIV.</jats:p>",

This study presents findings regarding abortion practices and beliefs among adolescents and young adults in Tanzania, where abortion is illegal. From 1999 to 2002, six researchers carried out participant observation in nine villages and conducted group discussions and interviews in three others. Most informants opposed abortion as illegal, immoral, dangerous, or unacceptable without the man's consent, and many reported that ancestral spirits killed women who aborted clan descendants. Nonetheless, abortion was widely, if infrequently, attempted, by ingestion of laundry detergent, chloroquine, ashes, and specific herbs. Most women who attempted abortion were young, single, and desperate. Some succeeded, but they experienced opposition from sexual partners, sexual exploitation by practitioners, serious health problems, social ostracism, and quasi‐legal sanctions. Many informants reported the belief that inopportune pregnancies could be suspended for months or years using traditional medicine. We conclude that improved reproductive health education and services are urgently needed in rural Tanzania.</jats:p>",

The comparison is based on studies about the current state of implementation of the Bologna Process, which has been originally undertaken and recently updated by the Association of European Schools of Planning (AESOP). The training of planners, i.e. the quality of planning education and its applied standards, is a key point of discussion among schools of planning. Ultimately, the definition of standards depends on the feedback from professional circles (in particular regarding the situation on the labour market), and on co-operation with planning organisations. Accordingly, AESOP currently is in discussion with the European Council of Spatial Planners (ECTP) on the extent to which standards should be defined in terms of the new system of university degrees (bachelor’s and master’s degrees) to guarantee a common European labour market and avoid any restrictions on access.</jats:p>"

The main losers in the scramble to establish family planning in Egypt were those female reformers who had been the first to endorse it and offer contraceptives in their clinics.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. In this paper a new inundation model code is developed and coupled with Storm Water Management Model, SWMM, to relate spatial information associated with urban drainage systems as criteria for planning of storm water drainage networks. The prime objective is to achive a model code that is simple and fast enough to be consistently be used in planning stages of urban drainage projects.  The formulation for the two-dimensional (2-D) surface flow model algorithms is based on the Navier Stokes equation in two dimensions. An Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) finite difference numerical scheme is applied to solve the governing equations. This numerical scheme is used to express the partial differential equations with time steps split into two halves. The model algorithm is written using C++ computer programming language.  This 2-D surface flow model is then coupled with SWMM for simulation of both pipe flow component and surcharge induced inundation in urban areas. In addition, a damage calculation block is integrated within the inundation model code.  The coupled model is shown to be capable of dealing with various flow conditions, as well as being able to simulate wetting and drying processes that will occur as the flood flows over an urban area. It has been applied under idealized and semi-hypothetical cases to determine detailed inundation zones, depths and velocities due to surcharged water on overland surface.\n                        </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Spatial planning is a public task which is concerned with identifying, explaining and solving difficult problems with spatial impacts. A large part of its remit is therefore to provide technical advice to policymakers and to inform the general public. Spatial planning has successfully established itself as a distinct discipline — and one which is now quite indispensible, not least due to the absence of any real alternative to it. For what other discipline is there which takes on responsibility for sustainable spatial development by embracing not only the social, ecological and economic, but also the cultural and political dimensions; or expands the prospects for regions, cities, neighbourhoods and villages by promoting integration and interdisciplinary approaches; or, in the face of all uncertainty, which plots possible long-term courses of development for society to follow? In times of increasing segmentation, it is precisely the multifaceted nature of spatial planning that makes it not only both distinct and modern, but also a neutral source of authority. Nonetheless, the point at which spatial planning has traditionally brought — and continues to bring — its influence to bear is not at the very heart of political activity or at the centre of the debates taking place within society, but rather in the background. Only in rare cases are individual citizens directly affected by the decisions taken in the field of spatial planning. With some regularity, spatial planning is called upon to list its successes and to justify its existence, not least because the standing it enjoys within society is not particularly high. However, spatial planning must itself bear some responsibility for the relatively poor image it has acquired and for its lack of visibility. Apart from in a small number of exceptional cases, it remains much too reticent in contexts where it should rather market its distinctiveness, its strengths and its competencies — qualities which are described, albeit briefly, in the present paper. This would seem to be an auspicious time for a concerted marketing campaign. The new guidelines for spatial development in Germany call for a refocusing of tasks and for a new understanding of the role of spatial planning. With their new bachelor’s and master’s degrees, university courses in spatial planning are now positioning themselves for the future.</jats:p>"

This Hegelian imaginary reflects the intellectual history of radical and/or critical anglophone geography.

Service provision is organised according to the principles of person centred planning (PCP), a model which places the desires, interests and capacities of each service user at the centre of the decision-making process. As the music therapy programme has developed, the parallels between the music therapy concepts which informed it and the PCP model have became more apparent. The main purpose of this report is to detail the core features and aimed-for outcomes of the person-centred planning process and highlight corresponding concepts from humanistic music therapy, community music therapy and music therapy for empowerment. Implications of coordinating the music therapy programme with the PCP process as implemented at Enable Ireland are also suggested. The core features of PCP are considered highly useful in conceptualising a resource-based, humanistic music therapy programme for people with disabilities. In addition, music-making in its various forms is considered a valuable activity which has the potential to satisfy the outcomes of the PCP model.</jats:p>"

Case studies from several continents are used to explore this trend, including several that are widely hailed as success stories. It is argued that this model represents a reassertion of public sector control and that portraying service contracts in public transport as ‘privatisation’ misses the point that it marks a defeat for a deregulation agenda. This is clear especially from examples in Latin America and Asia where this model has been replacing approaches with very weak public sector oversight. The paper also highlights that this model has been emerging via a number of different pathways and from a wide range of initial circumstances, including some surprisingly low-income contexts.</jats:p>",

However, if those traditions have not been existent before, universities did not establish any gender aspects in the course of the reforms. Finally, it is suggested that sustainable spatial development has to be supported by gender aspects. Therefore, universities are advised to further develop those aspects within their study programme.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Dialectics is a powerful way of engaging with our conflicted world, and yet it remains obscure, neglected, and badly misunderstood. Despite the prevalence of attempts to come to terms with all manner of antagonisms, contradictions, polarities, and oppositions across a host of theoretical practices and domains, relatively few authors make recourse to dialectics, and those who do invariably frame it within the following, rather unhelpful, terms: thesis–antithesis–synthesis or position–negation–negation-of-the-negation. While the advent of poststructuralism in general, and of deconstruction in particular, has arguably robbed the dialectic of much of its purchase, it is nonetheless worth revisiting dialectics since it offers an exemplary distillation of what is at stake in thinking through the Real as conflicted and charged. Accordingly, the paper is an attempt to clarify the dialectical articulation of the Real in its confliction, and advances the heretical possibility that the Real may be bereft of charge. Almost everyone works on the basis of a charged Reality—of a Real that is essentially polarized, antagonized, and conflicted—and most critical and fatal theorists dream of discharging the Real: selectively in the case of the former; wholesale in the case of the latter. Thinking through dialectics in the company of deconstruction and poststructuralism, however, opens up an entirely new terrain for the Real that is untouched by the positive and the negative, and which slips through the grasp of both critical and fatal theory. Reality is always already cracked open, but there is nothing to discharge. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The persistent divide within French philosophy between so-called structuralists and poststructuralists has been recently revived in the writings of Badiou and others. This narration of the history of French philosophy is trapped inevitably in the very way it poses the problem: as a dialectic of the negative. The abstracting of these traditions from all their messiness into a dialectical opposition is itself part of the problem, a misrepresentation, ignoring any points of convergence. Drawing centrally on the work of Pierre Macherey, I suggest this divide can be traced back to Hegel's profound misreading of Spinoza, which became the basis for Hegel's dialectic and Marx's subsequent inversion. I explore crucial points of convergence between Marx and Spinoza, and a resonance between Deleuze and Macherey (who are often stereotyped as emblems of oppositional tendencies within French philosophy). Their work converges on a rejection of negation as the defining quality of essence or multiplicity and, in the case of Deleuze and Macherey, a shared uptake of Spinoza's concept of potentia. Their work gestures towards the development of a dialectics of the positive: a problematic that might enable us to think across our differences to a political ontology that embraces the posthuman, immanent, and affirmative qualities of struggle. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Two empirical studies are presented to show how experienced project leaders execute New Product Development (NPD) projects. In the first study we interviewed project leaders from four different design firms. We discovered that inside realistic NPD projects the NPD activities seldom occur in the same order as they are described in the NPD literature. Some activities are omitted, some activities are run in parallel and some even have a seemingly illogical timing. The reasons for these ‘strange’ patterns are usually project‐specific. The NPD project leaders distinguish four types of NPD projects. On the one hand, familiar (client well known and/or standard technology and/or re‐design) or non‐familiar projects (new client and/or new technology and/or innovative design), and on the other hand, the complexity of the product (simple versus complex), and they plan their NPD projects differently according to those four types. For instance, within simple and familiar projects they omit more NPD activities than in projects with a more complex and new nature. In the second empirical study we did a matched pairing study (finding NPD projects which would match each of the four types). This time we interviewed experienced project leaders from different companies, because they are probably more familiar with only one type of NPD project. We found a minimal and a ‘regular’ NPD process. Projects on new products (the non‐familiar type) contain the most activities in the total project. Complex projects execute more activities in the first stages, and also different activities than in non‐complex projects. We also found that NPD project leaders adapt an opportunistic attitude towards carrying out activities in parallel in order to gain time.</jats:p>",

Rather than a wholesale rejection of the dialectic, these authors attempt to think how poststructuralism might force an encounter with it, retaining yet transforming it. Drawing on Deleuze's characterization of abstract thought as dealing with concepts that “like baggy clothes, are much too big”, and Bergson's complaint that dialectics are “too large … not tailored to the measurements of the reality in which we live”, the paper moves to thinking about the relation of dialectics, measure, and world. It does so through an interrogation of a nondialectical materialism, that of Alain Badiou and his ex-student Quentin Meillassoux, particularly Meillassoux's critique of correlationism. One of the key issues raised is the return of mathematics, and its embrace within some aspects of human geography. Raising the question of how this may reverse some of the gains of poststructuralism and Marxism in combating the reduction of the quantitative revolution, the paper concludes by asking if geography is really willing to accept mathematical ordering, not merely in terms of a way of understanding the world, but as a suggestion that this is how the world actually is. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Intensity modulated radiation therapy(IMRT) is an advanced form of external beam radiation therapy. IMRT offers an additional dimension of freedom as compared with field shaping in three‐dimensional conformal radiation therapy because the radiation intensities within a radiation field can be varied according to the preferences of locations within a given beam direction from which the radiation is directed to the tumor. This added freedom allows the treatment planning system to better shape the radiation doses to conform to the target volume while sparing surrounding normal structures. The resulting dosimetric advantage has shown to translate into clinical advantages of improving local and regional tumor control. It also offers a valuable mechanism for dose escalation to tumors while simultaneously reducing radiation toxicities to the surrounding normal tissue and sensitive structures. In less than a decade, IMRT has become common practice in radiation oncology. Looking forward, the authors wonder if IMRT has matured to such a point that the room for further improvement has diminished and so it is pertinent to ask what the future will hold for IMRT. This article attempts to look from the perspective of the current state of the technology to predict the immediate trends and the future directions. This article will (1) review the clinical experience of IMRT; (2) review what we learned in IMRT planning; (3) review different treatment delivery techniques; and finally, (4) predict the areas of advancements in the years to come.</jats:p>",

With the reform, full time (five years) planning education in Germany, exclusively established at Technical Universities is under scrutiny. By now all German schools of planning have restructured their programmes and introduced BA/BSc and MAI MSc degrees, substituting the traditional Dipl. Ing. in planning. This transformation will have considerable repercussions on the established programmes, on teaching and on practice orientation, as well as on student admission and international mobility.

This study investigates effects of residence in the Matlab MCH-FP treatment area on men’s involvement in family planning. The analysis compares for treatment and comparison areas knowledge of and attitudes toward contraception, as well as levels of contraceptive use, among 413 married men interviewed at the baseline of an ICDDR,B men’s involvement project. Although residence in the MCH-FP area is associated with a higher overall contraceptive prevalence, it also is associated with a lower adjusted ratio of male-to-female method use, and lower odds of other indicators of men’s involvement in family planning. Historical decisions to exclude men from contraceptive decision-making may place the ‘burden’ of contraception on women and may preclude the productive involvement of men. These and other implications and strategies for increased men’s involvement are discussed.</jats:p>",

In the first part of this article, we describe the underlying trajectory generator and the on‐road planning component of this system. We then describe the unstructured planning component of this system used for navigating through parking lots and recovering from anomalous on‐road scenarios.

The goal of this paper is to explain Žižek' idea of the parallax view and to demonstrate its relevance for geographers. To do this, I begin by showing how Žižek's dialectical vision differs from that of David Harvey by using the example of Harvey's analysis of ‘capitalist imperialism’. Next, I turn to Deleuzian spatial ontology and its understandings of virtual and actual spaces. I discuss Žižek's engagement with Gilles Deleuze's thought and draw out the implications of a dialectical understanding of the virtual and the actual. </jats:p>",

Here, a set of criteria for processes for sustainable river basin planning is used as a basis for analysing how the responsible planners in one EU member state – Sweden – carry out the work prescribed by the WFD. The paper is based on 13 interviews with water planners and directors. The current processes represent progress in relation to the situation pertaining before implementation; e.g., participation and collaboration are increasingly becoming pivotal, knowledge of the natural water state is increasing and the economy of water is emerging as a new and important issue. The interviews do however show that knowledge of how to work with values and how to create forms and methods of participation and collaboration remain clearly underdeveloped. In consequence, the main objectives behind participation – the provision of knowledge and perspectives for the process and the creation of legitimacy, acceptance or engagement – are actually at risk. Recommendations include complementing the existing knowledge base with insights from the social sciences and the humanities, to create well informed learning systems within the new water administration and to make use of alternative methods for the handling of values. The Swedish case may provide useful insights for other member states. Copyright © 2008 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.</jats:p>",

The design task is mathematically formulated as a bi‐criterion stochastic mixed‐integer nonlinear program (MINLP) that simultaneously accounts for the maximization of the net present value and the minimization of the environmental impact for a given probability level. The environmental performance is measured through the Eco‐indicator 99, which incorporates the recent advances made in Life Cycle Assessment. The stochastic model is converted into its deterministic equivalent by reformulating the probabilistic constraint required to calculate the environmental impact in the space of uncertain parameters. The resulting deterministic bi‐criterion MINLP problem is further reformulated as a parametric MINLP, which is solved by decomposing it into two sub‐problems and iterating between them. The capabilities of the proposed model and solution procedure are illustrated through two case studies for which the set of Pareto optimal, or efficient solutions that trade‐off environmental impact and profit, are calculated. These solutions provide valuable insights into the design problem and are intended to guide the decision maker towards the adoption of more sustainable design alternatives. © 2008 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The dialectical tradition that derives from Hegel and Marx has been very influential within social science, flowing into human geography from the early 1970s through the work of Lefebvre and Harvey. In their different ways these two scholars sought to extend dialectical logic to encompass the contingencies of space, and it is in this context that their seminal contributions to scale analysis can be understood. Since the 1980s, however, confidence in the dialectical tradition has been undermined by poststructural philosophers such as Derrida—who (whilst being careful to avoid simply negating Hegelian dialectics) has exposed the nontotalisable structure of contingency that both subtends and subverts dialectical reason. In this paper I draw upon Derrida's treatment of contingency, and explore the nondialectical ‘foundations’ of dialectical logic through a reading of Neil Smith's 1984 book on Uneven Development (Blackwell, Oxford), a classic text from Marxist geography which was the first to articulate a fully theorised scale framework. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Using data from retrospective surveys carried out in the Netherlands during the early 1990s, we describe how the residential mobility of couples—that is, short-distance moves—is affected by family events and how fertility is affected by residential mobility. The results show that residential moves are particularly likely to happen in a short period preceding a wedding or during pregnancy, supporting the hypothesis that residential mobility is likely to occur in anticipation of family changes. Anticipation is also suggested by the fact that the likelihood of having a child is greater after a residential move, but only starting from some months after the move. Family events also have a hampering effect on residential moves. Starting from some months after the wedding, being married is associated with a lower propensity of experiencing a short-distance move, while the presence of children is associated with less residential mobility only when children are school-aged. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>As Exploration and Production (E&amp;P) companies look to drill in record-setting water depths, facing extreme conditions and ever-increasing technical challenges, they will need the best people, processes and technology available in the petroleum industry. To compensate for this, Chevron's Deepwater Exploration and Production (DWEP) Business Unit undertook a project to optimize the use of their unique project management process, the Chevron Project Development and Execution Process (CPDEP). This project, called the Well Design, Execution and Collaboration Center (WellDECC), is a combination of people, processes, and technology working to use, align with and augment CPDEP throughout DWEP. This paper outlines the basic CPDEP phases and how WellDECC supports and enhances this process.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The CPDEP consists of five phases: identify and assess opportunities, generate and select alternatives, develop preferred alternatives, execute, and operate and evaluate. Chevron initially developed its current process in the upstream side of the business and ultimately adapted it for all projects. WellDECC was created using this process in 2004 with the primary objective of bolstering CPDEP within DWEP. WellDECC is currently in the last stage, operate and evaluate, as we enter 2008. In recent years, sharply increasing water depths have been accompanied by similar increases in technical challenges and drilling costs; a robust project management process is essential for success in this environment. Chevron Drilling and Completion (D&amp;C) and the Geological and Geophysical (G&amp;G) communities came together and developed the concept of WellDECC to be fully engaged in each of these phases.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>One of the important considerations when planning WellDECC was the selection of an operating platform that would seamlessly integrate cross-functionality to best support CPDEP. Halliburton (Landmark and Sperry Drilling Services) was ultimately selected as the primary provider for WellDECC's tools and support. By combining 3-D earth-model visualization, well-construction engineer tools, real-time telemetry functions, real-time drilling parameters, Logging While Drilling (LWD) viewing and data storage, WellDECC has the people, processes and technology to best accomplish its mission.</jats:p>",

This debate, led with particular ferocity in War and History, is based on German files that Zuber was the first to study. The following paper, however, challenges Zuber's theories on the basis of files and maps Zuber failed to consider. It seeks to prove that there was a basic operational-strategic doctrine — the Schlieffen Plan — and Schlieffen's successor stuck unwaveringly to it, although a few operational modifications were made. This doctrine was even implemented by the Wehrmacht in the Second World War, albeit in a modified version. </jats:p>",

The robot is permitted to manipulate unspecified obstacles in order to create space for a path. A plan is an ordered sequence of paths for robot motion and object manipulation. We show that under monotone assumptions, anticipating future manipulation paths results in constraints on both the choice of objects and their placements at earlier stages in the plan. We present an algorithm that uses this observation to incrementally reduce the search space and quickly find solutions to previously unsolved classes of movable obstacle problems. Our planner is developed for arbitrary robot geometry and kinematics. It is presented with an implementa tion for the domain of navigation among movable obstacles. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this essay is neither to praise or condemn dialectic nor to adjudicate between dialectics. I seek instead to investigate a particular relation between dialectic and dualism that was developed in the ancient Greek polis as a way of opening a conversation concerning the necessity of waging a posttranscendent, postdualist politics. Approaching the polis through the problematic nomos of flesh, and focusing on the produced opposition between reason and appetite, the essay suggests how a dispositif of transcendence operated in the polis to reduce the rule of the many, associated with the mob-like appetites of the body, in favor of the few who had (allegedly) achieved self-mastery and transcendence. For beings produced as body this meant a greater degree of corporeal vulnerability and a reduced, at times radically reduced, potential for survival. This politics of transcendence did not vanish with the polis but persisted in diverse forms, continuing to under-write the unevenly distributed right to be that it originally authorized and that, beginning in ‘1492’, was globalized, becoming the massive assault on bodies that has characterized the bio(geo)politics of Western modernity and still dominates the present. The essay concludes with a consideration of what a posttranscendent politics might be and a postscript regarding the cunning of passion. </jats:p>",

The fluoroscopic anatomy of the sacrum can be difficult to understand, and this is why sacroplasty is considered more challenging than ordinary vertebroplasties. </jats:p><jats:p> Purpose: To demonstrate the planning of the procedure and the effectiveness of treatment with sacroplasty by means of three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) by combining multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) and volume-rendering technique (VRT). </jats:p><jats:p> Material and Methods: Five elderly, osteoporotic patients with intense pelvic and hip pain underwent weeks of inconclusive clinical and radiological diagnostic efforts. Correct diagnosis was finally attained with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CT. Plain radiographs rarely show fractures, and MR or CT examinations are necessary to demonstrate longitudinal fractures. The procedures were performed with digital biplane equipment using preoperative 3D CT planning procedures. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) was injected to fill the fracture sites. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: The fractures were successfully treated with sacroplasty using PMMA. A new technique, which involves placing the needles along the long axis of the sacrum, was optimized to the individual patients’ fractures and sacral anatomy by meticulous planning on a workstation with 3D CT data sets. It was technically successful in all five cases. Four of the five patients had sustained pain relief. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: Sacral insufficiency fractures are not uncommon and should be considered in the elderly population with low back pain. Sacroplasty using the optimized “long-axis technique” gave almost immediate pain relief for all five patients in our study material. No complications were observed. </jats:p>",

The aim of this paper is to critically analyse district nursing workforce planning and development methods, in an attempt to find a suitable method for Northern Ireland. </jats:p><jats:p> A systematic analysis of the literature reveals four methods: professional judgement; population-based health needs; caseload analysis and dependency-acuity. Each method has strengths and weaknesses. Professional judgement offers a ‘belt and braces’ approach but lacks sensitivity to fluctuating patient numbers. Population-based health needs methods develop staffing algorithms that reflect deprivation and geographical spread, but are poorly understood by district nurses. Caseload analysis promotes equitable workloads but poorly performing district nursing localities may continue if benchmarking processes only consider local data. Dependency-acuity methods provide a means of equalizing and prioritizing workload but are prone to district nurses overstating factors in patient dependency or understating carers’ capability. In summary a mixed method approach is advocated to evaluate and adjust the size and mix of district nursing teams using empirically determined patient dependency and activity-based variables based on the population’s health needs. </jats:p>",

The motive to conserve does not arise only from within the interpretation field. Due to increasing urgency of biological and cultural heritage loss, the wider resource management field requires participation of all conservation-related tools, interpretation included. Any conceptual model concerned with integrating interpretation into conservation programs, then, must explain how interpretation's central elements of place meanings and audiences directly contribute to conservation. This paper, then, presents a conceptual interpretive planning model that involves audiences in place conservation by leveraging culturally constructed place meanings (in an interpretive framework) to promote desirable actions that meet conservation objectives found in a place's policy framework. It further describes how interpretive planning can facilitate people's natural process of constructing meaning, that when combined with appropriate place-based cultural narratives, interpretive media, and conservation knowledge, can result in audiences’ increased likelihood to participate in conservation. </jats:p>",

Such knowledge would help both to guide the priorities of policy and to interpret the probability of policy interventions being successful. This exploratory study draws on an evaluation of the British government's National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, part of which entails an interpretation of household mobility data from the 2001 Census. It suggests four categories of neighbourhood—transit, escalator, isolate, and improver areas—based on the relationship between where households move to and move from, focused on the 20% most deprived lower super output areas in England. Evidence on the ground suggests the plausibility of the different functional roles played by the four neighbourhood types. Some continuing conundrums—the robustness of the categorisation, the need to take account of the spatial context of deprived areas, and the difference between movers and stayers—are discussed as a prelude to further continuing research. </jats:p>",

Nineteen of these studies were selected for analysis based on the following factors: the inclusion of a behavioral theory, strong study design, an intervention was conducted, and an evaluation was completed. Results indicated that all of the interventions met the criteria to be classified as a health communication intervention, but none met the complete criteria to be considered a true social marketing intervention. Limitations in the evaluation designs made it difficult to assess the impact of these interventions; however, results suggest that health communication principles have been applied widely, while social marketing techniques are poorly understood and underutilized in planning occupational safety programs. </jats:p>",

However, global climate model-based (GCM) output grids can bias the area identified as suitable when these are used as SDM predictor variables, because GCM outputs, typically at least 50×50 km, are biologically coarse. We tested the assumption that species ranges can be equally well portrayed in SDMs operating on base data of different grid sizes by comparing SDM performance statistics and area selected by four SDMs run at seven grid sizes, for nine species of contrasting range size. Area selected was disproportionately larger for SDMs run on larger grid sizes, indicating a cut-off point above which model results were less reliable. Up to 2.89 times more species range area was selected by SDMs operating on grids above 50×50 km, compared to SDMs operating at 1 km\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            . Spatial congruence between areas selected as range also diverged as grid size increased, particularly for species with ranges between 20 000 and 90 000 km\n            <jats:sup>2</jats:sup>\n            . These results indicate the need for caution when using such data to plan future protected areas, because an overly large predicted range could lead to inappropriate reserve location selection.\n          </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Based on ethnographic work, this paper examines the market research practices of the outdoor advertising industry in the UK and their commercial production of space. I focus on the role of calculation in the performance of market relations between a range of actors in the field and the use of marketing research's classificatory practices as a currency which enacts those relations. In many accounts of urban governance, city space is produced by various statistical and classificatory devices as calculable and hence governable. But with recent developments in commercial enterprises, the performative quality of market relations engenders calculative space, a nexus of people-in-space, commercial imperatives, and a calculative energy or orientation to calculation. This is understood by the industry as a kind of commercial vitalism—an enlivening of market relations and of objects of commercial calculation—which firms aim to exploit by tapping into and channelling the energy they perceive it generates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Angsi Field is an offshore field located in offshore Peninsular Malaysia, developed with an integrated oil and gas processing plant, water injection facilities and gas lift infrastructure. The field was brought to oil production at an initial rate about 30 Mstb/d in end 2001. In early 2002, it started gas production at an initial rate of about 300 MMscf/d of gas which is currently maintained at about 300-400 MMscf/d. Crude oil production peaked in 2005 and was followed by a moderate decline over the next three years. Besides crude oil and gas production, the field also produces condensate while producing gas. It was recognized that a proactive field management strategy was required in order to minimize any further production decline and maintain excellent production operations as the field production forecast showed a declining trend. Four key levers for sustaining Angsi's production were identified, namely: 1) prudent reservoir management and reliable water injection; 2) continuous production improvement and unfailing well integrity; 3) facility optimization and operational improvement; and 4) maintenance of high equipment uptime and infrastructure integrity. On top of those four levers, prudent and integrated production planning was very important in managing the integration of sub-surface and surface aspects. Various sub-surface and surface technologies were sourced with a target of sustaining production and maximizing oil and gas recovery. The lookback analysis presented here describes the use of an integrated approach in production planning and creativity in resolving problems involving reservoir management &amp; well integrity and production operations through teamwork building.</jats:p>",

Accordingly, the motion direction derived from traditional artificial potential field (tAPF) is regulated. The maximum velocity, maximum acceleration and energy consumption of the OMR moving in different directions are analyzed, based on the kinematic and dynamic constraints of an OMR, and the anisotropy of OMR is presented in this paper. Then the novel concept of an Anisotropic-Function is proposed to indicate the quality of motion in different directions, which can make a very favorable trade-off between time-optimality, stability and efficacy-optimality. In order to obtain the optimal motion, the path that the robot can take in order to avoid the obstacle safely and reach the goal in a shorter path is deduced. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to demonstrate that the motion resulting from the iAPF is high-speed, highly stable and highly efficient when compared to the tAPF. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this work is to evaluate quality of intensity‐modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plans resulting from the use of biological cost functions in comparison to plans designed using a traditional TPS employing dose‐volume‐based optimization. Treatment planning was performed independently at two institutions. For six cancer patients, including head and neck (one case from each institution), prostate, brain, liver, and rectal cases, segmental multileaf collimator IMRT plans were designed using biological cost functions and compared with clinically used dose‐based plans for the same patients. Dose‐volume histograms and dosimetric indices, such as minimum, maximum, and mean dose, were extracted and compared between the two types of treatment plans. Comparisons of the generalized equivalent uniform dose (EUD), a previously proposed plan quality index <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3556-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3556:mp3556-math-0001\" />, target conformity and heterogeneity indices, and the number of segments and monitor units were also performed. The most prominent feature of the biologically based plans was better sparing of organs at risk (OARs). When all plans from both institutions were combined, the biologically based plans resulted in smaller EUD values for 26 out of 33 OARs by an average of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3556-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3556:mp3556-math-0002\" /> (range <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp3556-math-0003.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp3556:mp3556-math-0003\" />). Owing to more efficient beam segmentation and leaf sequencing tools implemented in the biologically based TPS compared to the dose‐based TPS, an estimated treatment delivery time was shorter in most (five out of six) cases with some plans showing up to 50% reduction. The biologically based plans were generally characterized by a smaller conformity index, but greater heterogeneity index compared to the dose‐based plans. Overall, compared to plans based on dose‐volume optimization, plans with equivalent target coverage obtained using the biologically based TPS demonstrate improved dose distributions for the majority of normal structures.</jats:p>",

Our aim is to compute good quality roadmaps which encode the multiple connectedness of the configuration space inside small but yet representative graphs which capture the different varieties of free paths well. The proposed Path Deformation Roadmaps (PDRs) rely on a notion of path deformability indicating whether or not a given path can be continuously deformed into another existing path. By considering a simpler form of deformation than that allowed between ho motopic paths, we propose a method that extends the Visibility-PRM technique to construct compact roadmaps which encode richer and more suitable information than representative paths of the homotopy classes. PDRs contain additional useful cycles between paths in the same homotopy class that can be hardly deformed into each other. Experimental results show that the technique enables small roadmaps to reliably capture the multiple connectedness of complex spaces in various problems involving free-flying and articulated robots in both two- and three-dimensional environments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Much of the writing on urban regeneration in the UK has been focused on the types of urban spaces that have been created in city centres. Less has been written about the issue of when the benefits of regeneration could and should be delivered to a range of different interests, and the different time frames that exist in any development area. Different perceptions of time have been reflected in dominant development philosophies in the UK and elsewhere. The trickle-down agendas of the 1980s, for example, were criticised for their focus on the short-term time frames and needs of developers, often at the expense of those of local communities. The recent emergence of sustainability discourses, however, ostensibly changes the time focus of development and promotes a broader concern with new imagined futures. This paper draws on the example of development in Salford Quays, in the North West of England, to argue that more attention needs to be given to the politics of space–time in urban development processes. It begins by discussing the importance and relevance of this approach before turning to the case study and the ways in which the local politics of space–time has influenced development agendas and outcomes. The paper argues that such an approach harbours the potential for more progressive, far-reaching, and sustainable development agendas to be developed and implemented. </jats:p>",

It then analyzes the Xinzheng reformers' reconstruction of Confucius into a symbol of Chineseness and situates it in the late Qing debate on citizen formation and nation building. Finally, it looks into the planning of a new ritual scheme for worshiping Confucius and highlights its departure from imperial precedents. Previous research has suggested that the Xinzheng reforms followed the Meiji example.

The planner computes optimal steering actions to maximize the probability that the needle will reach the desired target. Given a medical image with segmented obstacles and target, our method formulates the planning problem as a Markov decision process based on an efficient discretization of the state space, models motion uncertainty using probability distributions and computes optimal steering actions using dynamic programming. This approach only requires parameters that can be directly extracted from images, allows fast computation of the optimal needle entry point and enables intra-operative optimal steering of the needle using the pre-computed dynamic programming look-up table.

In this paper we study the problem of planning high-quality paths. A high-quality path should have some desirable properties: it should be short, avoiding long detours, and at the same time it should stay at a safe distance from the obstacles, namely it should have clearance. We suggest a quality measure for paths, which balances between the above criteria of minimizing the path length while maximizing its clearance. We analyze the properties of optimal paths according to our measure, and devise an approximation algorithm to compute near-optimal paths amidst polygonal obstacles in the plane. We also apply our quality measure to corridors. Instead of planning a one-dimensional motion path for a moving entity, it is often more convenient to let the entity move in a corridor, where the exact motion path is determined by a local planner. We show that planning an optimal corridor is equivalent to planning an optimal path with bounded clearance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In recent years the introduction and subsequent enhancements of information technology has seen the emergence of major opportunities for developing new approaches to improve information interchange. The provision of information provides opportunities to find resolutions to problem situations, and the power of providing relevant and accurate information through using information systems cannot be underestimated. However, the world of information systems thinking has, so far, experienced difficulty finding a methodology suitable for utilizing the full range of available current information technology. This situation in the real world shows itself predominantly as information starvation as current information systems struggle to bring order and structure to information technology developments. This paper will discuss the issues relating to the development of a new generic framework. The novel aspect of this generic framework for planning information systems is that it integrates Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) and Viable Systems Model (VSM) in a coherent whole, whilst embracing the concepts of self‐adaptation and autonomy. Further, the generic framework integrates the spatial analysis capabilities of a Geographical Information System (GIS). The generic framework will then be tested in real‐world problem situations in order to test its effectiveness, efficiency and efficacy with regards to finding suitable solutions to the problem of information starvation. The importance of focusing the framework on GIS functionality is related to the fact that in many organizations GIS is employed as the solution to information starvation because of its ability to display spatial information. This paper will demonstrate the implementation of the generic framework in a UK Police Authority, a large emergency service that suffers from information starvation. In the context of a UK Police Authority the combination of SSM and VSM being supported by GIS functionality is seen as being a significant progression in relation to crime detection and operational planning.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author draws on a case study of Austin, Texas to argue that the emerging cannon of critical obesity studies should be situated in and interrogated with reference to empirical research undertaken in the urban spaces that enable or constrain healthy behavior. With federal, state and city-scale government departments calling for concerted obesity-prevention efforts, it is suggested that this enterprise has now rendered Austin a space of philanthropic entrepreneurialism. Drawing on stakeholder interviews with those charged with healthy-lifestyle promotion, the author contends that the city's bifurcation by Interstate-35 marks a clear real and imagined socioeconomic and racial divide. Moreover, this divide permits the delineation of East Austin as ‘at risk’ by virtue of its Hispanic population and the assumption that higher prevalent rates of obesity among Hispanic residents are an outcome of certain cultural norms. As a result, East Austin has been legitimized as a strategic place of intervention to help boost the city's image as a healthy, and therefore good, place to live. However, such interventions favor changing personal behavior and therefore neglect to address the environmental and structural factors which, it is asserted, often have far more immediate and profound effects on health. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Forest transportation planning problems (FTPP) have evolved from considering only the financial aspects of timber management to more holistic problems that also consider the environmental impacts of roads. These additional requirements have introduced side constraints, making FTPP larger and more complex. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has been used to solve FTPP, but its application has been limited by the difficulty of solving large, real-world problems within a reasonable time. To overcome this limitation of MIP, we applied the ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic to develop an ACO-based heuristic algorithm that efficiently solves large and complex forest transportation problems with side constraints. Three hypothetical FTPP were created to test the performance of the ACO algorithm. The environmental impact of forest roads represented by sediment yields was incorporated into the economic analysis of roads as a side constraint. Four different levels of sediment constraints were analyzed for each problem. The solutions from the ACO algorithm were compared with those obtained from a commercially available MIP solver. The ACO solutions were equal to or slightly worse than the MIP solution, but the ACO algorithm took only a fraction of the computation time that was required by the MIP solver. </jats:p>",

While gaited walking may suffice on easy ground, rough and steep terrain requires unique sequences of footsteps and postural adjustments specifically adapted to the terrain's local geometric and physical properties. In this paper we present a planner that computes these motions by combining graph searching to generate a sequence of candidate footfalls with probabilistic sample-based planning to generate continuous motions that reach these footfalls. To improve motion quality, the probabilistic planner derives its sampling strategy from a small set of motion primitives that have been generated offline. The viability of this approach is demonstrated in simulation for the six-legged Lunar vehicle ATHLETE and the humanoid HRP-2 on several example terrains, including one that requires both hand and foot contacts and another that requires rappelling. </jats:p>",

Although computed tomography angiography (CTA) has been shown to be highly accurate, it is associated with radiation exposure, and as such modalities without radiation exposure have been sought. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been proposed as such an option. We conducted a pilot study comparing MRA with CTA and with operative findings in six consecutive patients undergoing DIEP flaps for breast reconstruction. The DIEA, superficial inferior epigastric artery (SIEA) and perforators were all assessed with each modality. We found that the DIEA and SIEA were accurately imaged with both CTA and MRA, but that while MRA could identify some major perforators, CTA was more accurate than MRA for perforator mapping. As such, while MRA does have a role in the imaging of DIEA perforators, CTA is still the preferred modality. On the basis of these findings, a larger study into the role for MRA in this setting is warranted. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Microsurgery, 2009.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Helical tomotherapy is an increasingly common form of intensity modulated radiation therapy that allows for image guided adaptive radiotherapy. Its treatment planning system (TPS) uses a convolution superposition algorithm for dose distribution calculations. The accuracy of this algorithm in the presence of heterogeneities was evaluated against Monte Carlo (MC) calculations and measurements. This work performed BEAMnrc‐and DOSXYZnrc‐based MC dose calculations of tomotherapy deliveries to a CIRS anthropomorphic heterogeneous phantom with typical clinical inverse planning and delivery settings. Point measurements with A1SL ion chambers and relative measurements with Kodak EDR2 film were carried out in the phantom. The experimental results were used to evaluate both the TPS and MC dose calculations. Furthermore, the dose distribution for a clinical head‐and‐neck cancer plan was calculated on the TPS and MC systems. The results support this MC system as a viable option for the accurate simulation of the tomotherapy process in the presence of heterogeneities where direct measurement may not be practical. Ion chamber measurements in the CIRS phantom suggested the TPS has an average relative difference of 2.3%, with the largest difference being <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2316-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2316:mp2316-math-0001\" /> in one of the organs at risk. The MC system accurately predicted the dose to these measurement points within statistical uncertainty. The film measurements in the CIRS phantom demonstrated 90.7% (of pixels) agreed with the MC system using a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2316-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2316:mp2316-math-0002\" /> acceptance criteria, where only 50.3% agreed with the TPS.

Whilst the rhetoric of neoliberal doctrine presents an emancipatory urban imaginary based upon individual freedom and the beneficent role of free markets, the embedding of the policies discussed accentuates the political and economical disenfranchisement of the most marginalised neighbourhood inhabitants. Moreover, the ability of this group to politically mobilise against hostile neoliberalisation and gentrification is undermined by the facilitation of out-migration of stable low-income families and community leaders, and the reproduction of the negative, criminal, and blighted aspects of Over-the-Rhine's environment. Neoliberalisation is seen to operate through material and discursive moments of social exclusion and in perpetuating sociospatial structures which justify the continued implementation of repressive political and regulatory projects. In concluding, I suggest neoliberal hegemony may be undermined through exposing the ways in which it reproduces and exacerbates the phenomena it condemns. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Systems involving loops have been especially challenging in the study of robotics, partly because of the requirement to maintain loop closure constraints, conventionally formulated as highly nonlinear equations in joint parameters. In this paper, we present our novel triangle-tree-based approach and parameters for planar closed chains with revolute joints. For such a loop, the loop closure constraints are exactly, not approximately, a set of linear inequalities in our new parameters. Further, our new parameters provide ex plicit parametrization of the system deformation space (configuration space modulo the group of rigid motions of the system's ambient space respecting system specifications) and endow it with a nice geometry. More precisely, the deformation space of a generic planar loop with n revolute joints consists of 2<jats:sup>n-2</jats:sup> copies of one and the same convex polytope (which, when all of the link lengths are fixed, is bounded and of dimension n - 3), glued together into either one connected component or two (ignoring collision-free constraints), via proper boundary identification. Such a completely solved, stratified space of convex strata will have profound implications for these sys tems and lead to great simplifications in many kinematics related issues. For example, in essence, our approach makes path planning for planar loops with revolute joints no more difficult than for open chains. We also briefly point out the connection and extension of the work presented here to other systems such as spatial loops with spher ical joints and systems involving multiple loops. </jats:p>",

Research and planning attention then focused on particular aspects of the event and on restoring order. In contrast, sociologists and similar‐thinking scholars have increasingly viewed disaster situations from multiple locations and histories, often using systems theory. Here, reanalysis of empirical material from ethnographic research in New Orleans pre‐ and post‐Katrina suggests that a sociological embeddedness perspective illustrates the dynamic seamlessness of past, present, and future economic contexts and social actions. The perspective's constitutive concepts of weak, strong, and differentiated ties highlight the role of local knowledge, intermediary‐led workforce networks, and sustained participatory planning in creating a robust economic environment. Toward this end, disaster research, planning, and theory building could incorporate network tie assessments into social vulnerability protocols, compare embeddedness with other perspectives, and learn from related international experiences.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

Nonetheless, on an annual basis, at least 10% of patients shift from PD to hemodialysis for a variety of reasons. Thus the issue of vascular access creation needs to be addressed for this small but significant group of patients. Despite the relatively consistent number of dropouts, the creation of an arteriovenous fistula prior to transfer remains suboptimal, and variable from center to center. Literature for this specific area is poor and dated. Guidelines seem to suggest vascular access creation in high-risk failure patients, but they have no detailed criteria to select patients that would likely fail PD and therefore take advantage of a backup access. There is a need to better understand and predict patients that require conversion to hemodialysis to develop a plan that focuses on wellness and maximum quality of life in the lifecycle of PD patients. This review addresses the issue of vascular access planning in adult PD patients, presents the available literature on the topic and the current guidelines and recommendations, and describes a research agenda to guide decision making in clinical practice. </jats:p>",

This is necessary to provide for a sustainable and acceptable implementation of the WFD with regard to the affected parties. However up to now there are many undefined legal concepts and few specific procedural developments, which often do not correspond to the required interdisciplinary and practical approach but are based on complex scientific methods.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:bold>In northeastern Illinois, restored wetlands are used to improve water quality in streams degraded by agriculture and urban development. Using freshwater wetlands to reduce nitrogen loading to lakes and rivers is well documented; however, there are fewer studies addressing their use to remove phosphorous. In 1998, a systematic water quality monitoring project was begun at Prairie Wolf Slough Wetland Demonstration Project, a restored palustrine emergent marsh wetland located on an abandoned farm field north of Chicago. The wetland drains 98 ha of mixed land uses into the Chicago River. Our objectives were to assess spatial and temporal variations in total suspended solids, soluble reactive and total phosphorous concentrations, and mass loadings and compute a mass balance and retention efficiency for these constituents. Water sampling was conducted from 1998 to 2003. In 2004, soil samples were collected from the marsh and an adjacent abandoned farm site and analyzed for soil test (Bray) phosphorus. The marsh effectively traps suspended solids but acts as a source of soluble reactive and total phosphorous to the river both during the growing and nongrowing seasons. Net export of phosphorous from the wetland was likely due to mobilization of orthophosphate as a result of anoxic conditions produced during inundation events. Often little consideration is given to the link between soil and water quality when locating restoration sites. Our study adds to a growing body of literature that clearly demonstrates the need for both soil and water quality assessments in wetland restoration planning, design, and monitoring.</jats:bold> </jats:p>",

The dose predicted in the target center met the test criteria (5% of the dose normalization point or 3 mm distance to agreement) for all TPSs tested; however, at the tumor‐lung interface and at the peripheral lung in the vicinity of the tumor, the CSA/AAAs performed better than the PBAs (85% and 50%, respectively, of pixels meeting the 5%/3‐mm test criteria), and thus should be used to determine dose in heterogeneous regions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p> <jats:italic>Clinus cottoides</jats:italic> is a fish endemic to the coast of South Africa, predominantly inhabiting rock pools. All South African clinids are viviparous, but probably breed throughout the year; as such, their dispersal may be limited, unlike species with pelagic larval stages. We analysed 343 fish from 14 localities on the west, south and east coasts using two mitochondrial genes and the second intron of the S7 ribosomal gene. Mitochondrial DNA analyses recovered significant genetic differentiation between fish populations from the east coast and other sampling locations, with a second break found between Gansbaai and Cape Agulhas on the south coast. Nuclear DNA recovered shallower, but significant, levels of population structure. Coalescent analyses suggested remarkably asymmetrical gene flow between sampling locations, suggesting that the cold Atlantic Benguela Current and Indian Ocean Agulhas counter‐current play important roles in facilitating dispersal. There was no gene flow between the east coast and the other sites, suggesting that these populations are effectively isolated. Divergence times between them were estimated to at least 68 000 years. Neutrality tests and mismatch distributions suggest recent population expansions, with the exception of peripheral western and eastern populations (possibly a consequence of environmental extremes at the edge of the species distribution). Analyses of the current South African marine protected areas network show that it is not connected and that De Hoop, one of South Africa's largest marine reserves, appears to be an important source population of recruits to both the south and southwest coasts.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The problem of matching production levels for individual products to demand fluctuations during multiple periods is known in the production planning literature as the multi-product multi-period (MPMP) problem. Linear programming (LP)-based solutions have been extensively reported in this respect. MPMP problems are commonly solved by using either analytic or simulation methods. More recently, hybrid solutions consisting of both analytical models and simulation analysis have been proposed where some operational criteria, e.g. the order of visit to machining centres, are taken into account. In this paper, results related to some of the literature based on hybrid solutions are used as the initial feasible solutions and then examined in the context of project scheduling by considering the influences of resource constraints. After converting the MPMP to a project network problem and assigning resources to activities and consequently levelling the resource profiles, it is discovered that machine utilization can be further improved by applying unused machine capacities. A LP model is therefore developed in order to maximize feasible production rates over all the production planning periods. The proposed approach results in improvements on the results of earlier hybrid solutions reported in the literature. Finally, three different planning problems are suggested for further applications of the proposed approach in the context of manufacturing environments. </jats:p>",
