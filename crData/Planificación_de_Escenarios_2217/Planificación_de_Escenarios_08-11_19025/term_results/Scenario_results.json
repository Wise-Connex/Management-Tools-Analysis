The model is equivalent to that of a true ferroelectric in a weak external dc bias. Permittivity maximum occurs as a result of crossing the Widom line. In the model, the role of the external bias plays an intrinsic internal bias originating from a weak polarity of the high temperature state of the material. The results obtained show that the ferroelectriclike phenomena reported for doped ZnO are compatible with a Landau-theory description.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The isothermal Brownian-type molecular dynamics simulation has been applied to study the melting behavior of bimetallic clusters. It was found that the specific heat and Lindermann-like parameter customarily used in bulk system to describe solid-liquid transition show incongruity in the predicted melting temperature Tmelt. The underlying mechanisms that lead to the incompatibility of Tmelt separately deduced from these two quantities were analyzed further. To gain insight into the melting behavior, we calculated in addition the velocity autocorrelation function and its Fourier transform, the power spectrum, and extracted from them the Tmelt. It appears that the Tmelt inferred from the latter quantities is closer to that deduced from the principal peak position of specific heat. Two bimetallic clusters, namely, Ag1Cu13 and Au1Cu13, were selected for a thorough investigation. In the context of cluster morphology, we scrutinized the atomic distributions of Ag1Cu13, Au1Cu13, and Cu14 and effected a comparative study between a bimetallic cluster and a pure cluster so as to learn from comparison the differences in the thermal reaction of atoms, in particular, the impurity atom in the bimetallic cluster. On analyzing the dynamical data, we observed at a lower temperature (T⪡Tmelt) migrational relocation of atoms whose dynamics was superimposed at an intermediate temperature (T&amp;lt;Tmelt) by permutations between atoms, and at a higher temperature (T≈Tmelt), liquidlike or even gaslike behavior.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The HadRM3P regional model from the UK Hadley Centre has been used to assess the moisture flux and the low‐level jet (LLJ) east of the Andes in South America over two time periods: the first can be understood as the current climate and covers the period from 1980 to 1989; the second covers the period from 2080 to 2089 under a future global warming climate as projected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A2 high‐emission scenario. The results are analyzed considering the vertically integrated moisture transport in the lower atmosphere and the moisture flux between the two core areas of South America—the Amazon Basin and the La Plata River Basin. In order to analyze the moisture transport east of the Andes, composites of South American LLJs were built based on the wind speed and vertical wind shear following the modified Bonner criteria 1 used to define LLJs. Integrations along the lateral boundaries of the two basins show that there could be a more intense moisture transport from tropical regions available to feed the mesoscale convective systems in the subtropical La Plata Basin in the IPCC A2 scenario, as compared to the present. This is because of the intense flow to the south associated with a faster LLJ bringing more moisture from the Amazon Basin southwards. It was also observed that the presence of the LLJ affects moisture convergence in the Amazon Basin in the current climate as well as in the warmer climate. In the future high‐emission scenario A2, a more intense LLJ in a global warming climate suggests increased moisture transport from north to south east of the Andes as compared to the present.

The main components of mammalian hair are cysteine-rich type I and type II keratins, also known as hard α-keratins or “hair keratins.” To determine the evolutionary history of these important structural proteins, we compared the genomic loci of the human hair keratin genes with the homologous loci of the chicken and of the green anole lizard\n            <jats:italic>Anolis carolinenis</jats:italic>\n            . The genome of the chicken contained one type II hair keratin-like gene, and the lizard genome contained two type I and four type II hair keratin-like genes. Orthology of the latter genes and mammalian hair keratins was supported by gene locus synteny, conserved exon–intron organization, and amino acid sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. The lizard hair keratin-like genes were expressed most strongly in the digits, indicating a role in claw formation. In addition, we identified a novel group of reptilian cysteine-rich type I keratins that lack homologues in mammals. Our data show that cysteine-rich α-keratins are not restricted to mammals and suggest that the evolution of mammalian hair involved the co-option of pre-existing structural proteins.\n          </jats:p>",
