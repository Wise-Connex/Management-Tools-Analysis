      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article examines the relevance of leading social science network theories for the analysis of social relations in particular fields and as a guideline for democratic planning practice. The first section explains the risks of using the network metaphor in social science analysis: the confusion of normative and real features of networks may lead to an abstract representation of institutional structures and power relations and naïve expectancies regarding democratic planning opportunities. The second section reviews institutional network theories in social science. The survey focuses on: the ‘raison d’Ítre’ of the network, the typical behaviour of its agents, the types of communication, interaction with the environment and creation of its own institutions. Section 3 examines how these network theories deal or do not deal with power and suggests improving the theorizing of the role of power in networks by providing a more solid reading of power relations in institutional structures and personal relationships in networks. This solidity could be offered by a combination of Regulation Theory and Bourdieu's theory of practice. The final section provides some guidelines on how a better reading of institutional structures and power relations may improve the impact of democratic planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The article suggests that planning's current sources of moral philosophy are no longer an entirely satisfactory guide on issues of ethical judgement in a context of deepening social difference and an increasingly hegemonic market rationality. A focus on process in planning and a relative neglect of product, together with the assumption that such processes can be guided by a universal set of deontological values shaped by the liberal tradition, are rendered particularly problematic in a world which is characterized by deepening social and economic differences and inequalities and by the aggressive promotion of neoliberal values by particular dominant nation-states. The notion of introducing values into deliberative processes is explored. </jats:p>",

The introduction to the article presents the author's positioning of planning theory. The first section thereafter provides a general background of the trajectory of development of complexity theory and discusses the rationale of using the theory of metaphors for evaluating the use of complexity theory in planning. The second section introduces the workings of metaphors in general and theory-constructing metaphors in particular, drawing out an understanding of how to proceed with an evaluative approach towards an analysis of the use of complexity theory in planning. The third section presents two case studies – reviews of two articles – to illustrate how the framework might be employed. It then discusses the implications of the evaluation for the question ‘can complexity theory contribute to planning?’ The concluding section discusses the employment of the ‘theory of metaphors’ for evaluating theory transfer and draws out normative suggestions for engaging in theory transfer using the metaphorical route. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Israeli planning system, like many other Western systems, is a regulatory system, meaning that statutory land-use plans are attempts at both setting long-term planning policy and defining planning rights. However, planning in Israel faces a growing gap between its official structure and what is actually implemented. Mainly, an inconsistency exists between the formal top-to-bottom approach of the system and the flexible dynamics that occur in practice. In this paper I focus on the prevalent local zoning amendment procedure and examine its background as well as its implications. Based on this, the paper claims that in Israel, the tension between certainty and flexibility in planning creates a spatially disturbed behavior, which actively tests the bans and limits of existing possibilities. </jats:p>",

However, when empire involves much more than war, when empire also involves reconstruction, renewal, aid, and democracy, then it is much more difficult for planning to opt out of this liberal moral order. Situated at the heart of empire, that is, in America, this article explores some of these dilemmas of praxis and thereby the limits of liberalism. Drawing upon Marxist theory, cultural studies, and postcolonial critique, it makes a case for an ethics of ‘doubleness’, one where benevolence can be recognized as Othering but also where complicity can be transformed into subversion. </jats:p>",

Although Entsorgung + Recycling Zürich (ERZ), the sewer-age utility of the city of Zürich, has considerable financial means available for the rehabilita-tion of its sewers, it has so far not established a continuous leading role in triggering rehabili-tation projects among the city’s utilities departments, which results in a suboptimal qualitative improvement of the sewer network. This was due to organisational as well as technical rea-sons. It was thus decided in late 2003 to develop a decision support tool for rehabilitation and cost planning, which visualises the most urgent rehabilitation needs. A lot of data necessary for rehabilitation and cost planning is readily available on different databases and servers, but was so far never linked to provide a semi-automatic tool that combined all the information. This paper describes the basics and the methods for the design of a rehabilitation- and cost-planning prototype.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An examination of fertility trends in countries with multiple DHS surveys found that in the 1990s fertility stalled in mid‐transition in seven countries: Bangladesh, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ghana, Kenya, Peru, and Turkey. In each of these countries fertility was high (more than six births per woman) in the 1950s and declined to fewer than five births per woman in the early or mid‐1990s, before stalling. The level of stalling varied from 4.7 births per woman in Kenya to 2.5 births per woman in Turkey. An analysis of trends in the determinants of fertility revealed a systematic pattern of leveling off or near leveling in a number of determinants, including contraceptive use, the demand for contraception, and number of wanted births. The stalling countries did not experience significant increases in unwanted births or in the unmet need for contraception during the late 1990s, and program effort scores improved slightly, except in the Dominican Republic. These findings suggest no major deterioration in contraceptive access during the stall, but levels of unmet need and unwanted births are relatively high, and improvements in access to family planning methods would, therefore, be desirable. No significant link was found between the presence of a stall and trends in socioeconomic development, but at the onset of the stall the level of fertility was low relative to the level of development in all but one of the stalling countries.</jats:p>",

Such arguments have provided much of the ideological underpinning for coalitions around the country promoting smart growth and other regional reforms. Smart growth policies seek to curb urban sprawl by channeling investment into already developed areas, including inner-city communities. Given the attention paid to urban policy among advocates of the new regionalism, one would expect inner-city minorities to be well represented in the dialogue. However, the dialogue over smart growth and regionalism has largely failed to engage inner-city African Americans, Latinos, and other minorities. This article asks why that is the case, examines the consequences, and proposes a strategy for reframing the new regionalist debate in a way that may resonate more with minority stakeholders.</jats:p>",

The analysis shows that the Cornell new urbanist development increases suburban densities but not by nearly as much as would be inferred by analysis that simply compares the density of the development with that of the surrounding conventional suburbs. Most households living in the higher-density building types plan to eventually move to detached houses. If new urbanism, as it is expressed in the planning and design of Cornell, is to be a generalizable substitute to conventional suburban development, its projects will have to have a much larger proportion of single-family detached houses than the Cornell's 37 percent. New urbanists may best help reduce city spread by inducing households to move to and then to stay in single-family detached houses on smaller lots. </jats:p>",

One is to enhance access to choices and the other to influence modal shifts away from driving. Existing studies have focused primarily on the second-tier effect. This article presents an empirical study of automobile dependence with emphasis on the identification of the first-tier effect. Using the Boston 1991 activitytravel survey data, the study jointly models travel choice set formation and mode choice decision. Automobile dependence is defined and measured as the probability that a traveler has the automobile as the only element in the choice set of travel modes. The study finds a wide variation in levels of automobile dependence along spatial and social dimensions. Elasticity estimates show that automobile dependence is highly sensitive to street network connectivity and to automobile availability, while population/job density and transit supply also matter. The study confirms the choice-enabling role of land use in reducing automobile dependence. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the past decade, planners and policy makers have increasingly raised concerns about the undue influence of fiscal criteria on development patterns. However, realestate conditions, local practices, state policies, and community characteristics also shape land-use patterns. This study seeks to unpack these complex relationships through an explanatory model evaluating the construction patterns of mediumsized U.S. cities. The results reveal that although market conditions do help explain development patterns, the fiscal and demographic profiles of cities are also significant factors. In particular, rising public expenditures, statewide revenuelimitation policies, and other fiscal pressures are more strongly associated with certain patterns of development. Specifically, these factors were associated with cities that developed primarily high-value residential units, excluded multifamily units, and developed proportionately more retail than housing. This suggests that fiscal conditions, including those generated by statewide policy, do seem related to the land-use outcomes highlighted by the critics. </jats:p>",

While an “adaptive management” approach is attractive in such situations, it is difficult to implement where there is a real or perceived decline of the state. Based on a case study of mariculture development in Hawaii, the authors suggest that planners and policy makers consider informal social contracts as complements to formal regulatory frameworks to increase the viability of adaptive management regimes. Discussion includes the benefits as well as potential pitfalls of social contracts where formal regulations may be necessary. </jats:p>",

The objectives of this study are to compile the best current estimate of cesarean birth rates for developing countries, to estimate regional rates, and to document trends nationally and by urban/ rural residence where data permit. A database of cesarean birth rates was compiled representing 90 percent of births in the developing world, resulting in an estimated cesarean birth rate for the developing world of 12 percent, with regional rates ranging from 3 to 26 percent. Data representing 45 percent of births in the developing world show that a majority of countries experienced increases in cesarean birth rates during the 1990s, except in sub‐Saharan African countries, where little if any change occurred. Cesarean birth rates must be monitored routinely to call attention to rapidly changing practices. These data can, in turn, trigger investigation into the appropriateness of the rate in a given context.</jats:p>",

The Bruce‐Jain framework for quality of care was adapted for use in evaluating antenatal care. Methods included examination of hospital records, in‐depth interviews, exit questionnaires, and structured observations. The study revealed deficiencies in the quality of antenatal care being delivered at the study hospitals in all six elements of the quality‐of‐care framework. The technical content of visits varied greatly among the hospitals, and an overuse of technology was accompanied by neglect of some essential components of antenatal care. Although at the private hospital some problems with the technical content of care were identified, client satisfaction was higher there, where the care included good interpersonal relations, information provision, and continuity. Providers at all three hospitals felt constrained by heavy patient loads and a lack of resources. Multifaceted approaches are needed to improve the quality of antenatal care in this setting.</jats:p>",

Although advocates for global population control have lauded China's effort to limit births as a fundamental part of its sustainable development goals, the country's population policy has also generated much international criticism. As China enters the new millennium, a long‐overdue reform of its approach to implementing its family planning program has begun to refocus the program on clients' needs, informed choice of contraceptives, and better‐quality services. Originally inspired by the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development held in Cairo, the reform program began as a pilot project among six counties and has now become a blueprint for reorienting the national family planning program. This article reviews the process by which a small, innovative pilot project was scaled up into a national reform effort and the key lessons learned about scaling up sensitive but necessary innovation in a difficult political environment.</jats:p>",

From 1999–2002, six researchers carried out participant observation in nine villages for a total of 158 person‐weeks. Many villagers perceived condoms negatively for multiple reasons, for example, the method's association with infection or promiscuity, reduced male sexual pleasure, and cultural understandings of meaningful sex. Men controlled the terms of sexual encounters and reported that they would use condoms only with risky partners, but few perceived their partners as such. Use of condoms appeared to be very low, primarily as a result of limited demand, although barriers to access also existed. These qualitative findings contrast with inconsistent survey reports of relatively high condom use in the same population. Intervention efforts should address the tradeoff between possible short‐ and long‐term consequences of condom use, particularly for men, for example, reduced pleasure versus reduced HIV risk. If possible, surveys should assess the validity of reported condom use through comparison with other data, including qualitative findings and distribution/sales records.</jats:p>",

This approach is adequate for planning isolated and well-defined water systems. With the introduction of the concept of sustainability, the water systems interact with societal processes in the urban environment. We are not any more dealing with an isolated water system but with a complex adaptive system. For such systems the traditional planning models are not good enough. A more integrated planning approach is needed (Model B). An important characteristic of this new approach is that the complexity of the planning process is not combated but made manageable. As a result, during the process different space scales are handled parallel, time plays a more important role and more actors are involved. It is an open process. Also more values of water are taken into account. Different techniques for sustainable stormwater drainage are described. Based on experiences in the city of Malmö in Sweden a practical approach for integrated planning of these types of drainage systems has evolved (Model B). As a result multiple use of stormwater facilities has today been general practice in Malmö. The outcome of some sustainable stormwater projects is presented.</jats:p>",

We explicitly model two distinct sources of uncertainty: stochastic end‐product demand and unknown market proportions for the different product options available. Our cost minimizing model focuses on determining the optimal requirements policies for component options that meet a pre‐set service level. We show that simple common‐sense requirements policies are not generally optimal; there is a non‐linear connection between service level and component requirements that is hard to characterize without a detailed analysis. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The exchanges reveal problems for standard accounts of both the socialist calculation debates and logical empiricism. They also raise questions concerning the sources of ignorance and uncertainty in modern economies, and the role of market and non-market organisations in the distribution and coordination of limited knowledge, which remain relevant to contemporary debates in economics. Hayek had argued that Neurath's work exemplified the errors of rationalism that underpinned the socialist project. In response Neurath highlighted assumptions about the limits of reason and predictability that the two theorists shared and attempted to turn those assumptions back against Hayek in a defence of the possibility of socialist planning. The paper critically compares Neurath's and Hayek's criticisms of rationalism and considers how far Neurath is successful in his attempt to employ Hayek's assumptions against Hayek himself.</jats:p>",

Using El Salvador as a case study, the paper analyses the mainstreaming process in the developmental disciplines of urban planning and housing. The overall aim is to identify how the existing separation between risk reduction, urban planning and housing can be overcome and integration achieved.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Since Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and especially after the 2001 earthquakes, not only relief and development organisations, but also social housing organisations have initiated a shift to include risk reduction in their fields of action in order to address the underlying causes of urban vulnerability. The factors that triggered the process were: 1) the negative experiences of organisations with non-integral projects, 2) the organisations' increased emphasis on working with municipal development, 3) political changes at national level, and more importantly, 4) the introduction and promotion of the concept of risk reduction by international and regional aid organisations. However, required additional knowledge and institutional capacities were mainly built up independently and internally by each organisation, and not through the creation of co-operative partnerships, thus duplicating efforts and increasing ineffective competition.</jats:p>\n<jats:p>Whilst positive experience has been gained through the implementation of more integral projects, the creation of adequate operational, organisational, institutional and legal frameworks is still in its initial stage. Unfortunately, four years after the 2001 earthquakes, emergency relief funding for post-disaster risk reduction is coming to an end without the allocation of resources for following up and consolidating the initial process. Based on the findings, an integral model is proposed which shows how mainstreaming risk reduction in urban planning and housing could be dealt with in such a way that it becomes more integrated, inclusive and sustainable within a developmental context.</jats:p>",

In this paper, I invert this practice to examine instead men's experiences of being feared in public spaces. Drawing on interviews with 82 male college students, I use a social constructionist approach to examine how men's experiences of being feared interact with men's formation of racial identities and the racialization of public places. Fear is a key mechanism for justifying and maintaining race privilege and exclusion. The experience and interpretation of being feared (or not feared) in public space intersects with men's construction of gender and race identities, and the ways that men assign racial meanings to public places. This paper examines these processes and proposes strategies for challenging fear and the exclusion it supports. </jats:p>",

A traditional data warehouse has the function of providing data to decision support systems (DSS) or online analytical processing systems (OLAP) but not knowledge. This paper proposes that an existing data warehouse can be extended to create a knowledge warehouse for knowledge management. The knowledge warehouse can manage not only data and information but also the knowledge assets of an enterprise. Both tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge can be analysed, integrated, and converted; new knowledge can be created through the synergistic interactions within the knowledge warehouse. In this paper, knowledge warehouse architecture based on ERP, how it works, and related technologies are discussed. The knowledge warehouse will provide more effective support for DSS and OLAP.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper develops a model of dynamic tax planning in which the implementation of a tax plan involves exercising an option to execute an irreversible investment or financing structure transaction. The model considers four aspects of such transactions and shows that transactions are deferred if the tax savings from the transaction are lower or if the time horizon over which the transaction can be executed is longer. Deferral is also increasing in cost of a future unfavorable event to which the irreversibility of the transaction limits one's ability to respond, but may increase or decrease with a change in the probability that an unfavorable event occurs. We apply the model to a common estate freeze tax plan in Canada. Undertaking an estate freeze requires a private company's owner-manager to choose how one's business assets are to be distributed at death. In contrast to the conventional wisdom regarding the timing of this strategy, we find that waiting to implement the strategy is often optimal. We test the model using data on family-owned businesses in Canada and find strong support for the model's predictions.</jats:p>",

The researchers created a course that would meet the needs of agricultural education students, teachers, and faculty across the United States in the form of open courseware. Using the Tyler Rationale, the subjects of the study were teachers (learners), teacher educators (subject specialists), and 22 university program planning course syllabi collected from agricultural education teacher preparation programs. A collective list of content items was derived from the course syllabi. Outstanding high school agricultural education teachers and university teacher educators were asked to rate the importance of each item. Only those items rated as important by both groups were incorporated into a new curriculum framework for the course. Overall, 59 content items were considered important by both groups and recommended for inclusion in the program planning course. The 59 items were grouped into twelve categories. The categories included Introduction to Program Planning, Program Goals, Program Evaluation, Program Needs Assessment, Professionalism, Curriculum Planning, Program Budgeting/Funding, Advisory Committees, Recruiting and Marketing, Summer Programs, Legal and Safety Issues, and Total Agricultural Education Program.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper explores the forms of argumentation employed by participants in a recent public engagement process in the United Kingdom around new technologies for organ transplantation, with specific reference to xenotransplantation and stem-cell research. Two forms of reasoning recur throughout participants' deliberations which challenge specialist framing of this issue. First, an often scatological humour and sense of the profane are evident in the ways in which participants discuss the bodily transformations that such technologies demand. Second, a sense of the sacred, in which new biotechnologies are viewed as against nature or in which commercial companies are ‘playing god’, is a repetitive and well-recognised concern. Such forms of reasoning are frequently dismissed by policymakers as ‘uninformed gut reactions’. Yet they also form a significant part of the repertoire of scientists themselves as they proclaim the hope of new medical breakthroughs, or seek to reconstruct ideas of the body to facilitate new biotechnological transformations. Through questioning of assumptions in Habermas's notion of discourse ethics, and exploring the importance of hybridity and corporeality as concepts in ethical thinking, the author suggests that, far from being ill-formed opinions, such reasonings perform an important function for thinking through the ontological significance of the corporealisation of these proposed new forms of human and animal bodies. </jats:p>",

First, the shaping and reconstruction of the city structure, including the structure of land management, as well as the mutual arrangement of functional areas, should be based on the need to preserve the axes – the lines and planes of mass, energy and information transfer of landscapes of various orders. Second, the order of preserved landscape axes depends on the organisational complexity of a territory. Third, assessment of the sustainability of the structure of a city and agglomeration should be based on the criteria of river systems along their borders, such as the quantity and composition of water, its temperature, retention of the annual functioning cycle and biodiversity. Finally, urban planning control regimes should be established across the entire city and they should be determined by the position of the territory in the city's landscape structure.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-heading\">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>This work will provide a better understanding of integrated environmental systems to enable development of best management practices in the city of Moscow.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Niigata Ken Chuetsu earthquake struck a mostly rural and mountainous part of Niigata prefecture in Japan. Forty-eight people died, and 551 were severely injured. Over 100,000 people required emergency shelter, and nearly 3,500 households are living in temporary housing. The prefecture government has estimated earthquake damages at 3 trillion yen (about $30 billion), and at least 1,000 workers lost their jobs. The primary issues involve lack of access to rural settlements because of landslides, effects on elderly populations, and the long-term effects on the agricultural economy and lifestyle of the region. Because of extensive landsliding, many communities will also have to face difficult decisions regarding possible relocation or abandonment of their village sites. Based on the experiences of other earthquakes, it is clear that this process will take many years to resolve, and that much of the region will be permanently changed by this earthquake. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author seeks to decentre some already familiar geographies of biotechnology. By asking, with respect to genetically modified (GM) crops, not ‘what is the new?’, but ‘where is the new?’, the intention is to redirect attention (at least briefly) away from the GM technique or genetically modified object and its supposed properties, to the world to which that technique or object is being added. This in turn allows the question concerning GM to be approached from new directions, for example, via the routes taken into the controversy by three specific organisms. Not fully taken into account in the calculations of the biotechnology industry, the honey bee, the Monarch butterfly, and the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis have all, in very different ways, made their presence felt as they literally and metaphorically encountered GM. In an attempt to do justice to these marginalised lifeforms, the forms of life of which they are part, and the biopolitical questions which they raise, the works of Jacques Derrida on friendship and animality, Jean-Luc Nancy on being with, and Bruno Latour on making things public, are brought into conversation. It is suggested that together what they offer is a way of thinking ourselves as collectively in the midst of things. </jats:p>",

In this paper, the focus is on joint radio network planning of hybrid mobile communication networks consisting of unicast (UMTS) and broadcast (DVB‐H) delivery systems. Optimised network planning is a non‐trivial task even for a single network. Hence, planning and optimisation of hybrid networks implicate great challenges. For these issues, realistic traffic estimations are required. Therefore, a scenario has been developed based on the public reference scenario of Berlin from the IST‐MOMENTUM project. A method for designing a DVB‐H network architecture including transmitter position and cell size is introduced. Furthermore, the necessary transmitting power is estimated. The evaluation of the benefit of a hybrid network is introduced and shown in an example. Copyright © 2006 AEIT.</jats:p>",

The potential role of managers' psychological type (MBTI) as a determinant of preferences towards design of the planning process is examined. From a study based upon 187 managers it is concluded that managers' planning preferences primarily reflect the imperatives presented by specific strategic situations rather than psychological type. Managers appear to vary their planning response to strategic situations according to the characteristics each situation presents. Conclusions are provided for managers engaged in strategic planning, recruitment, management training and for academic strategy research. </jats:p>",

Instead of reinventing the wheel, I argue in this paper that Marxist notions of metabolism are ideal for investigating urban environmental change and the production of uneven urban environments. In so doing, I argue that despite the embeddedness of Harvey's circuits of capital within urban political economy, these connected notions still have a great deal to offer regarding better understanding relations between consumption and metabolization of urban environments. From this theoretical perspective, I investigate urban socionatural metabolization as a function of the broader socioeconomic processes related to urban restructuring within the USA between 1962 and 1993 in the Indianapolis inner-city urban forest. The research examines the relations between changes in household income and changes in urban forest canopy cover. The results of the research indicate that there was a significant decline over time in the Indianapolis urban forest canopy and that median household was related to these changes, thus demonstrating a concrete example of urban environmental metabolization. </jats:p>",

This assumption is unpacked through the detailed study of an end-user-oriented environmental research project.

Theoretical and practical approaches to the spatialities of the research–policy interface are considered in order to politically reconstruct the local as a meaningful field of environmental governance. </jats:p>",

The question being raised is whether economic policy instruments, such as taxes, can contribute to slowing this land conversion. In order to assess the effects of taxes on the use of land for housing, more information is needed about the extent to which economic agents adapt their consumption of residential building land in the event of price increases. Based on data from the Swiss cantons of Basel-Landschaft and Zurich, this paper investigates whether and to what extent residential housing density is influenced by land price. For the purposes of this study, the selected indicators for residential housing density are the lot size of single-family houses, the ratio of floor space to parcel area (Ausnützungsziffer), and the ratio of realised to maximum floor space to parcel area (Ausbaugrad).</jats:p>"

A lead vehicle must execute a certain mission whereby wireless line‐of‐sight communication to its ground station is lost. Relay helicopters are therefore introduced that must position themselves in such a way that indirect line‐of‐sight connectivity between the leader and the ground station is always maintained. This requires coordinated multivehicle trajectory optimization which is tackled online using centralized and distributed receding horizon planning strategies. The problem is formulated as a mixed‐integer linear program that accounts for the vehicle dynamics, obstacle and collision avoidance, and connectivity constraints. A centralized two‐helicopter mission is described for which simulation, hardware in the loop, and real‐time flight‐test results that show the online adaptability of the approach are presented. Simulations of distributed scenarios are given as well. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</jats:p>",

The possibilities and added values of this market approach have been researched in this paper. Added value has been found in the area of utilisation of knowledge, innovation and creativity of the market, thus gaining time and obtaining a more business-like character of the planning procedure. Solutions are proposed for impediments concerning disclosure versus confidentiality, adapting tender conditions and award criteria, (re)using market party ideas and procedure period.</jats:p>",

Devastating flood disasters have occurring in various locations throughout the world, and there has recently been rising concern that the intensity and frequency of catastrophic floods may be increasing. Being located on the eastern edge of monsoonal Asia and having climatic variations according to the seasonal and regional conditions, Japan has long suffered from numerous flood disasters, and thus has developed advanced flood management policies. This paper aims to discuss flood disasters in Japan and the recently improved flood management policies. In addition, this paper introduces a new plan attempted by the Public Works Research Institute (PWRI) of Japan that takes advantage of the wealth of long accumulated experience and knowledge in the hydro‐meteorological field. The PWRI is now working toward the establishment of an International Centre on Water‐related Hazard and Risk Management by acquiring UNESCO's auspices. In order to contribute to the global challenge of reducing devastating hydro‐meteorological disasters all over the world, this centre aims to conduct research, capacity‐building and training programmes, and information networking activities at the local, national, regional and global levels. The aim is to prevent and mitigate hydro‐meteorological disasters from the viewpoint of sustainable and integrated river basin management. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

By simultaneously planning the trajectories of the COG (Center of Gravity) and the ZMP (Zero Moment Point), a fast and smooth change of gait can be realized. The change of gait is also realized by connecting the newly calculated trajectories to the current ones. While we propose two methods for connecting two trajectories, i.e. the real-time method and the quasi-real-time one, we show that a stable change of gait can be realized by using the quasi-real-time method even if the change of the step position is significant.

The problem of preplanning backup routes considering both cost minimization and end-to-end delay guarantee for multicast communications in the case a single link failure is investigated. Two delay labels, the limited label and the tolerable label, are defined to evaluate the end-to-end delay requirement. Four heuristic algorithms, including two tree-based algorithms, one subtree-based algorithm, and one link-based algorithm, are proposed to determine the delay-constrained backup routes having the minimum costs. Two procedures to determine a node selection sequence, Random and Minimum-Cost, are used in the tree-based algorithm. Experimental results show that the tree-based algorithm by the Minimum-Cost sequence yields the best performance in cost minimization with guarantee of end-to-end delay. </jats:p>",

We describe the new kinds of students who are entering college today and the ways that colleges have begun to adapt. Then, analyzing interviews with students and administrators and a survey of nearly 4,400 students in 14 two-year colleges, we examine four questions: (1) Do students have serious information problems, and are college procedures ever responsible? (2) How can college structures improve students’ information and planning? (3) Do colleges with alternative structures affect student information and confidence? (4) Do alternative college structures matter, net of student attributes ? The results suggest new approaches to addressing the information needs of college students, which may have important implications for their confidence and success. The evidence in this study suggests that structured programs, structured advising, and structured peer supports should be added to the menu of college policy alternatives that deserve further consideration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we consider a motion planning problem that occurs in tasks such as spot welding, car painting, inspection, and measurement, where the end-effector of a robotic arm must reach successive goal placements given as inputs. The problem is to compute a nearoptimal path of the arm so that the end-effector visits each goal once. It combines two notoriously hard subproblems: the collisionfree shortest-path and the traveling-salesman problems. It is further complicated by the fact that each goal placement of the end-effector may be achieved by several configurations of the arm (distinct solutions of the arm's inverse kinematics). This leads to considering a set of goal configurations of the robot that are partitioned into groups. The planner must compute a robot path that visits one configuration in each group and is near optimal over all configurations in every goal group and over all group orderings. The algorithm described in this paper operates under the assumption that finding a good tour in a graph with edges of given costs takes much less time than computing good paths between all pairs of goal configurations from different groups. So, the algorithm balances the time spent in computing paths between goal configurations and the time spent in computing tours. Although the algorithm still computes a quadratic number of such paths in the worst case, experimental results show that it is much faster in practice. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The current round of local government modernisation in England, which commenced in 1997, has focused primarily on three main areas—new council constitutions, e-government, and performance. However, a fourth strand of initiatives relates to the power of well-being and the duty to prepare a community strategy, in partnership with a local strategic partnership. Academic commentators and planners, who have been focusing on the proposed UK planning reforms as contained within the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act (passed in 2004), have largely ignored the development of this strand. In this paper we explore these aspects of the local government modernisation agenda for planners and pull out some of the key issues for comparison in the ownership, role, and development of the new plans: community strategies and development plans. Opportunities and difficulties of ensuring that new development plans become the spatial expression of community strategies is assessed through an illustration of the relationship between the London Borough of Camden's community strategy and its unitary development plan. Following a review of the content of both documents, wider assessments are drawn out and we conclude by debating the implications of and challenges for a future reformed planning system at the local level. </jats:p>",

First, the authors offer their conception of planning for resiliency as a goal for recovering communities, and the benefits of planning in efforts to create more resilient places. Next, they discuss major issues associated with planning for postdisaster recovery, including barriers posed by federal and state governments to planning for resiliency, the promise and risks of compact urban form models for guiding rebuilding, and the failure to involve citizens in planning for disasters. Finally, they discuss lessons from prior research that address these issues and policy recommendations that foster predisaster recovery planning for resilient communities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Concern about eating biotechnologically produced foodstuffs is embedded within the complex relationship between food, science, politics, and everyday eating practices. In this paper I consider how this concern is expressed less at the reflexive level of opinions and attitudes and more at the nonreflexive level of eating practices. Therefore, I draw upon literatures that talk of a practical everyday aesthetic and literatures that assert the significance of the material to geographical work, and go on to argue for the significance of a material connective aesthetic within eating practices. This argument is developed empirically and theoretically by considering to what extent consumers can discuss the edibility of different types of carrots in terms of superficial material qualities, integral material qualities, and the immaterial. Crucially, the process of edibility formation is thus understood as relationally embedded in the material environment. This provokes a realisation for an ethics and a politics of (im)material connectivities. This work contributes to geographical work in which an embodied affective ethic is employed, by arguing that the transversal qualities of the material are as significant as the transversal qualities of ‘affect’. It is relevant to those studying consumption, biogeographies, and nonreflexive practices. </jats:p>",

Previous studies have investigated aging effects on planning, looking at either widely used laboratory-based neuropsychological tasks such as the Tower of London (TOL) or more naturalistic planning tasks, such as organizing shopping errands. In the current study, we compare the effects of normal adult aging on both the TOL and a more ecologically valid planning task, the Plan-a-Day (PAD) task. There was a reliable decline in TOL planning performance with age, but no significant correlation between age and PAD planning performance. Age-related variance was partly explained by variance in information processing speed and education. It is proposed that in more ecologically valid planning tasks, age changes in processing speed can be compensated for by task-related knowledge. Implications for everyday planning performance by older adults are considered. </jats:p>",

It is a useful statistical modelling tool in a number of areas of spatial data analysis. After an MGWR model is identified and calibrated, which has been well studied recently, one of the important inference problems is to evaluate the influence of the explanatory variables in the constant-coefficient part on the response of the model. This is useful in the selection of the variables and for the purpose of explanation. In this paper, a statistical inference framework for this issue is suggested and, besides the F-approximation, which has been frequently used in the literature of the geographically weighted regression technique, a bootstrap procedure for deriving the p-value of the test is also suggested. The performance of the test is investigated by extensive simulations. It is demonstrated that both the F-approximation and the bootstrap procedure work satisfactorily. </jats:p>",

Patients, relatives and hospital staff, along with healthcare professionals responsible for outpatient care, assemble to achieve an individual care plan. One of the explicit principles informing the discharge planning conference is to increase patients’ influence on decision‐making. However, research points at shortcomings in this respect.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Method. </jats:bold> A discourse analysis was conducted using transcriptions of eight video‐recorded discharge planning conferences. The selected patients were eight older women expected to be discharged from hospital. Other participants were staff nurses, social workers and occasionally relatives, an occupational therapist, district nurse or home care aide.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Findings. </jats:bold> Participants adopted different roles as persons/patients, relative/next of kin and healthcare professionals/institutional representatives during the discharge planning conference, which they simultaneously struggled to act upon.

Details of how weather might influence population performance are rare, yet necessary to assess the effects of global climate change on a species’ distribution.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Based on a 26‐year data set of a population of <jats:italic>Himantoglossum hircinum</jats:italic> in a nature reserve in Germany, variations of life‐history traits and vital rates were studied. Matrix analysis was used to identify the most important life‐state transitions for population growth. Multiple linear regression was used to quantify the response of population traits and vital rates to changing weather conditions.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Population size increased exponentially and density effects could not be observed. Flowering plants and large plants had the highest and second highest reproductive value, respectively.

A certain and sometimes large amount of that variability could be attributed to variability of weather conditions, with warmer winter conditions favouring population performance. Prediction of population size was fairly accurate within a time frame of 10 years, but size class structure was not.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p> <jats:italic>Synthesis and applications.</jats:italic> Matrix modelling proved to be unreliable for predicting long‐term population dynamics, despite the long‐term data set used for matrix construction. This can be explained by weather‐dependent variability of vital rates driving population dynamics. A minimum study period of 4 years is necessary to produce relevant information for model development. Our study emphasizes the need for critical evaluation of management decisions based only on single short‐term studies and for studies covering longer time intervals than 2–3 years.</jats:p></jats:list-item>\n</jats:list>\n</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Information visualization techniques such as overview + detail displays have traditionally been applied and studied in domains with static data sets supporting information retrieval tasks. This study examines how these techniques can be extended to the design of interfaces for decision support systems (DSSs). Specifically, we developed a computerized decision support tool to assist Naval Tomahawk Strike Coordinators in the complex process of assigning a set of planned missions to a set of available launch platforms based on a number of different constraints and objectives, and compared user performance on two realistic scenarios (a within-subjects factor) across two versions of this tool (a between-subjects factor). The first version of the Mission-to-Platform Assignment Tool provided users with only a set of detail displays when assigning missions, whereas the second version had an additional, abstracted ‘overview’ display that allowed users to see the effect of early decisions on later decisions. The results showed that subjects performing this planning task with the overview + details display version completed scenarios, on average, 21% faster, with 22% fewer errors and with 74% fewer required workspace navigation activities than a comparable group using just the detail displays version. Subjects in the former group also rated their situational awareness 14% higher than those subjects without the overview display. </jats:p>",

In the context of recent trends towards deregulation of hours and supply, fears have again resurfaced as to the detrimental impact of the ‘night‐time economy’ on street disorder and violence, concerns that have focused attention on the Licensing Act 2003. Utilizing a case study of the regulation of nightlife in the London locality of Southview, this article will explore how there has been ongoing and renewed attention on the problems associated with the night‐time economy centred on differentiating between risky and safe cultural and economic forms. The article will argue that the Licensing Act represents a consolidation of over a decade of regulatory change that has ‘reordered’ regulatory approaches to nightlife; one that has, in combination with other aspects of economic, social and cultural change, been productive of ‘subcultural closure’.</jats:p>",

We describe the new kinds of students who are entering college today and the ways that colleges have begun to adapt. Then, analyzing interviews with students and administrators and a survey of nearly 4,400 students in 14 two-year colleges, we examine four questions: (1) Do students have serious information problems, and are college procedures ever responsible? (2) How can college structures improve students’ information and planning? (3) Do colleges with alternative structures affect student information and confidence? (4) Do alternative college structures matter, net of student attributes ? The results suggest new approaches to addressing the information needs of college students, which may have important implications for their confidence and success. The evidence in this study suggests that structured programs, structured advising, and structured peer supports should be added to the menu of college policy alternatives that deserve further consideration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In the present study, we aimed to dissociate the neural correlates of two subprocesses involved in the preparatory period in the context of arbitrary, prelearned stimulus-response (S-R) associations, namely, S-R mapping and movement planning (MP). We teased apart these two subprocesses by comparing three tasks in which the complexity of both S-R mapping and MP were independently manipulated: simple reaction time (SRT) task, go/no-go reaction time (GNGRT) task, and choice reaction time (CRT) task. We found that a more complex S-R mapping, which is the common element differentiating CRT and GNGRT from SRT, was associated with higher brain activation in the left superior parietal lobe (SPL). Conversely, a greater number of planned finger movements, which is the common difference between CRT and both SRT and GNGRT, was associated with higher brain activation in a number of frontal areas, including the left supplementary motor area (SMA), left dorsal premotor cortex (dPM), and left anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The left-hemisphere dominance for S-R mapping could be related to the fact that arbitrary S-R mapping is often verbally mediated in humans. Overall, these results suggest a clear dissociation in the preparatory-set period between the more abstract role of left SPL in activating the appropriate S-R associations and the more concrete role played by the SMA, dPM, and ACC in preparing the required motor programs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Carbon (C) dynamics and forest management have become integrated in recent years, largely due to the Kyoto Protocol stipulating that forest C changes may be accountable in an emissions framework. A C stock modeling framework for forest managers is introduced in this paper. Empirical growth and yield models are used to develop sustainable timber supply for forest companies. These models use linear programming to solve the complex mathematical problem of timing and allocation of forest harvest and silviculture interventions. In this paper, we evaluated the effects of “business as usual”forest management versus management objectives to maximize C sequestration. Goal programming was used to minimize the deviation of two goals for C forest management: maximizing C in the forest, and maximizing the return on investment (net present value of forest timber products). Species-specific wood-to-C content conversion factors were used to parameterize the amount of C in forest stands on Canadian Forces Base Gagetown forest lands in New Brunswick, Canada. Goal programming reduced the loss of revenue associated with increasing C stocks in the forest. Partial harvesting and high valued end-products tended to increase C stocks and provided a higher return on investment in the simulations. Key words: Carbon stock modeling framework, forest, goal programming, partial harvesting, timber supply </jats:p>",
