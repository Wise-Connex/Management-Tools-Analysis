However, in the process of clarifying the application of Real Options analysis to real decision making, a strong dependency upon scenario thinking is established. The value to decision makers of Real Options depends crucially on the substance and use of the scenarios on which it rests. The distinctive contribution of this paper consists in substantiating this view. </jats:p><jats:p> By forging a critical link between Real Options analysis and scenario thinking, this paper illustrates how the beneficial application of Real Options to decision making brings it down from the esoteric heights of mathematics, converts it into a technique readily accessible to managers and qualifies it for inclusion in the curriculum of management education. Two cases drawn from personal experience are used to illustrate the approach recommended by the authors. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Large-scale forest scenario models are widely used to simulate the development of forests and to compare the carbon balance estimates of different countries. However, as site variability in the application area often exceeds the variability in the calibration area, model validation is important. The aim of this study was to evaluate the European Forest Information Scenario model (EFISCEN). As Switzerland exhibits high spatial and climatic diversity, it was taken as a case study. The model output was compared to measured data in terms of initialization, estimation of growing stock, stand age, increment, management, and natural mortality. Comparisons were done at the country level, but also for regions and site classes. The results showed that the initialization procedure of EFISCEN works well for Switzerland. Moreover, EFISCEN accurately estimated the observed growing stock at the country level. On a regional level, major differences occurred. In particular, distribution of the harvesting amounts, mortality, and age-class distribution deviated considerably from empirical values. For future model applications, we therefore propose to define the required harvesting level not per country, but to specify it for smaller regions. Moreover, the EFISCEN simulations should be improved by refining the mortality function and by incorporating more flexibility in forest management practices.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            A volcanic catastrophe even more devastating than the famous\n            <jats:italic>anno Domini</jats:italic>\n            79 Pompeii eruption occurred during the Old Bronze Age at Vesuvius. The 3780-yr-B.P. Avellino plinian eruption produced an early violent pumice fallout and a late pyroclastic surge sequence that covered the volcano surroundings as far as 25 km away, burying land and villages. Here we present the reconstruction of this prehistoric catastrophe and its impact on the Bronze Age culture in Campania, drawn from an interdisciplinary volcanological and archaeoanthropological study. Evidence shows that a sudden, en masse evacuation of thousands of people occurred at the beginning of the eruption, before the last destructive plinian column collapse. Most of the fugitives likely survived, but the desertification of the total habitat due to the huge eruption size caused a social–demographic collapse and the abandonment of the entire area for centuries. Because an event of this scale is capable of devastating a broad territory that includes the present metropolitan district of Naples, it should be considered as a reference for the worst eruptive scenario at Vesuvius.\n          </jats:p>",
