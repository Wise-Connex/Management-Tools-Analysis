CAPS finds the volume mix of products to maximize profit, constrained by the existing tool capacity, or identifies the tool capacity required to manufacture a specified mix of products. The major challenge was formulating the linear program to reflect the available manufacturing capacity. The formulation has to deal with parallel, unrelated tool groups that may perform the same operation at different rates, to capture the preferential order in which to use such tool groups, and to identify which are the true bottlenecks. Capacity planners use CAPS to reconcile product-demand forecasts with the available or planned manufacturing capacity and to generate requests for capital investments. The manager of site operations credits CAPS with identifying tens of millions of dollars in revenue opportunities and with avoiding significant unnecessary capital expenditures. </jats:p>",

In this paper, I examine first, the emergence of the idea of New Bombay and the interest groups who influenced the planning process. Secondly, I examine the actual achievements of the New Bombay project and the disjuncture between planning and reality. The New Bombay case shows clearly the way the political environment can influence the planning process. Confronted with the demands of different interest groups, the state in its urban planning opted for a solution which would accommodate all of them. In the process, many of the original objectives of building the new city have remained unfulfilled.</jats:p>",

It offers about 670 types of courses of which several hundred take place each year. The course-scheduling problem LTT faces is to develop a schedule for the year that maximizes its profit while meeting complex precedence, temporal, and resource-related constraints. A good operational schedule should also meet a number of subordinate objectives. In the past, LTT did all its scheduling manually. We developed a prototype course-scheduling module, using the operational planning situation of 1996 as our major test instance. It turned out that most of the schedules generated were substantially better than the solution LTT constructed manually, both in terms of profit and computation time. We subsequently developed a fully fledged decision-support system. </jats:p>",

Using the language of the IDEA, the position is taken that successful transition planning requires family participation, consideration of the communication needs of adolescents and young adults with disabilities, and decisions regarding which assistive technology devices and services are required. A range of issues is explored pertaining to transition planning, including (a) independence for the adolescent or young adult desired by the family, (b) rules of acceptance, (c) needs for information, (d) changes in family routines, and (e) family and child life experiences. The importance of related assistive technology issues to training is discussed with particular emphasis on dimensions of relevance and specificity, family and cultural sensitivity, duration and intensity, and user-friendliness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The concept of reproductive health received global recognition in the International Conference of Population and Development (ICPD) at Cairo in 1994. A reproductive health approach means: people have the ability to reproduce and regulate their fertility; women are able to go through pregnancy and child birth safely; the outcome of preg nancy is successful in terms of maternal and infant survival and wellbeing; and couples are able to have sexual relations free of the fear of pregnancy and of contracting disease. In 1995, after the Cairo conference, the Government of Rajasthan took the initiative to translate the concept of reproductive health into policies and programmes. The innovative interventions, one in Bundi district with UNFPA support, and the other in the two districts of Tonk and Dausa under the Vikalp project were imple mented, abolishing the method-specific targets. Later, in April 1996, the government abolished the targets in all districts and introduced micro district level planning in which the emphasis was laid not on numbers but on the quality of care. In the light of a target-free approach, the quality of family planning services in Rajasthan has been examined by using data from Concurrent Evaluation of Reproductive and Child Health Services. The quality framework evolved by Bruce (1990) was adopted to evaluate the total quality of care of family planning services. Nearly 86 per cent of couples were informed about three spacing methods, namely, condoms, oral pills, IUD and sterilis ation. Less than three-fifths of the users mentioned the method of their own choice. Nearly half of the couples were not informed about the side effects and risks of the methods at the time of adoption. About one-third of the female health workers did not have correct knowledge of IUD insertion. About 79 per cent women were visited by health workers three months prior to the survey. The present study concludes that there </jats:p>",

The systems' emissions, residual products, energy turnover, and resource consumption were evaluated from a life‐cycle perspective, using a computerized model, ORWARE (ORganic WAste REsearch model).</jats:p><jats:p>Transportation was of relatively low importance to overall environmental impact, even at high rates of nutrient recycling. This is remarkable considering the geographical setting of Stockholm, with high population density and little nearby farmland. Ancillary systems, such as generation of electricity and district heating, were crucial for the overall outcome.</jats:p><jats:p>Increased recycling of nutrients in solid biodegradable waste in Stockholm can reduce net environmental impact, whereas separation of human urine to be spread as fertilizer cannot yet be introduced without increased acidification. Increased nutrient recycling from solid biodegradable waste inevitably increases spreading of metals on arable land. Urine is by far the least contaminated residual product. Spreading of all other residuals would be limited by their metal content.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In its 1998 White Paper on competitiveness, the British government stressed the importance of entrepreneurship in halting Britain's apparent relative economic decline and in enhancing international competitiveness. In this document the potential contribution of entrepreneurship is envisaged primarily in terms of the need to increase the supply of entrepreneurs capable of starting and growing innovative new businesses; less recognition is given to the entrepreneurial vitality of the existing business base. This is in keeping with much of the influential policy and research literature, in which concentration through core growth of single firms has tended to be valued, rather than growth through diversification by entrepreneurs starting additional firms. The authors researched diversification as an entrepreneurial phenomenon through case studies of new high-growth Scottish companies. Most business founders in the study had established more than one company, and many had successfully pursued entrepreneurial forms of diversification. The high-growth companies were, in effect, embryonic business clusters, rather than single unidimensional businesses. This supports the notion that the greatest source of new high-growth businesses is entrepreneurs with existing businesses, not novice entrepreneurs. This has implications for future policy support for entrepreneurship. </jats:p>",

To assist BC Gas, we elicited values separately from most of the senior executives at BC Gas, members of the BCUC, and representatives of several stakeholder groups. Based on these values, we structured a set of objectives and associated performance measures for integrated resource planning (IRP) at BC Gas. A multistakeholder process then provided judgments about appropriate value tradeoffs among these objectives. This information was used in several ways in the IRP process. It fostered improved communication and served as a guide for designing more attractive plans and identifying future information needs. It also provided the basis for a quantitative evaluation of alternative plans and resources. Both the IRP process and the chosen integrated resource plan were reviewed by lawyers representing intervenors at a quasi-judicial hearing of the BCUC. Their concerns are informative in providing lessons for the use of the elicited values in the context of regulatory hearings. </jats:p>",

After completing a modified form of the SPQ, participants read two musical scores on a PC, one line at a time. Reading times for each line were taken, as were reaction times to a secondary probe. At the completion of each score, participants verbalised how they would go about learning the score to a level of performance competence. Protocols were scored for the presence of higher-level, mid-level and lower-level strategies, and for the level of focus in planning. Path analyses, with planning focus as the outcome measure, were conducted for each score. In both sets of analyses, reference to higher-level processing strategies predicted a higher planning focus, while a deep approach predicted higher-level strategy use. For the traditional score, surface learning was a negative predictor of high-level strategies, while a longer reading time was a positive predictor of higher-level strategy use. For the non-traditional score, both highand mid-level strategies predicted a higher focus, while low-level strategies predicted a lower focus. Familiarity with graphic notation, through mid-level strategies, also predicted focus. The implications of the results for the teaching of music are discussed. </jats:p>",

The Act has been fuelled by discourses which present a vision of a society escalating towards lawlessness and moral decline. Curfew orders are grounded on the exclusionary principles of control and deterrence. We argue that the case for curfews is much less clear than recent policy documents suggest. Evidence based upon a large-scale study points to a more positive role of streets in the lives of young people than is acknowledged in current discussions. We propose that curfew does not offer a way forward: for young people it reinforces a sense of power-lessness and alienation and for adults it establishes a positionality which further dislocates young people from their world. Throughout the curfew debate there has been no attempt to incorporate the views of young people. We propose that, instead of curfew, what is needed are inclusionary strategies which encourage the incorporation of young people into communities, empower their voices in environmental decisionmaking, and challenge the hegemony of adulthood upon the landscape. </jats:p>",

While the greater use of short lead time technologies provides one possible way to deal with this problem, it is not clear how they are best deployed. The approach taken in this paper is to examine a capacity mix model that explicitly accounts for differences in technology lead times. Key results that are obtained include the characterization of the optimal solution and the development of a new set of technology screening criteria. In practice, the “lead time order” (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending length of lead time) is typically the inverse of the so-called merit order (i.e., the set of available technologies ordered by ascending operating cost). We show that for this case, the optimal solution may be determined with relative ease. A numerical example demonstrates that some short lead time technologies screened out by standard planning methods may enter the optimal solution when differences in lead time are considered, while some long lead time technologies may leave. In addition, the optimal expected level of reliability may be greater.</jats:p>",

But so far this phenomenon has been examined mainly from a political standpoint, and has not as yet received an adequate regulationist treatment. The regulation approach is at heart a systems theory, whereby innovations in accumulation and regulation—whatever their origins—will tend to be selected and woven into a stable pattern if they contribute to the expanded reproduction of capital. It is argued here that the viability of regimes of accumulation, and of modes of regulation, depends in part upon whether an appropriate scale division of labour is established between their component activities. It is suggested from the analysis that it is possible on this basis to develop a regulationist account of the fundamental tendency towards the integration and division of societies at different scales, and the emergence of dominant societal units in each epoch. </jats:p>",

The project aimed to provide decision makers, environmental health professionals and the community with better information on the health impacts of environmental hazards. The paper summarizes the social, environmental and health conditions in the city and the organization of local government services, and then describes the participatory process used by the initiative including the qualitative approaches used to develop a situation analysis of environmental health information systems. Despite the use of participatory methods to involve planners and field staff from different municipal agencies, the initiative failed to develop the hoped for set of indicators. The primary reasons for this were difficulties in creating an “institutional space” for the project; on-going local government restructuring; and poor linkages to other initiatives. The paper concludes that there is a need for planners, managers and academics to begin using a more structured approach to implementing policies and managing uncertainty in order to facilitate change in areas such as environmental health information systems. Policy instruments which can be used for planning and managing change are discussed. </jats:p>",

In this paper I seek to provide an answer to this question by arguing that Bosnia became strategic because of its geopolitical location in a Europe supposedly secured by NATO and because of the negative sign value it accumulated over the course of its bloody war. The Bosnian war exposed the limits of the Bush administration's New World Order, the inability of the European Union to impose peace, the weaknesses of the United Nations, the impotency of NATO, and the leadership failures of the United States. It thus became strategically important as a threatening sign of disorder in Europe that the United States needed to confront in order to relegitimate NATO and its plans for expansionism, and to regenerate its national exceptionalist identity as a global power. In this paper I consider the role of the media in helping generate Bosnia as a ‘strategic sign’ by arguing that the videocameralistics of the media play an important role in conditioning the practices of foreign policy. </jats:p>",

In this paper we discuss the application to area data of exploratory analysis methods and visualisation techniques, and in particular the growing number of software packages which provide visualisation methods to support exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA). In the exploratory analysis of nonspatial data, the data are often considered to consist of rough and smooth elements. If this idea is extended to spatial data, it can be argued that a software system for ESDA should have facilities for exploring the rough and smooth elements of both the spatial and nonspatial elements of the data. Visualisation techniques can assist with this by providing a wide range of graphical displays, in a highly interactive environment. Conceptual frameworks are developed for both ESDA and scientific visualisation, and four software packages that link graphical and cartographical views of the data are reviewed against these requirements. The packages fall into two broad groups. In one, the emphasis is on highly interactive graphics, but with few numerical methods or tools for exploring the spatial properties of the data. In the other, specialist spatial tools are provided, but the graphical tools are less flexible. It is argued that a combination of both approaches would provide a package which more fully satisfied the requirements of ESDA. The need to assess the effectiveness of different visualisation techniques in supporting and encouraging the exploratory analysis of spatial data is noted. </jats:p>",

We discuss how Chinese business networks, traditionally conceptualised as closed and internally shaped owing to a variety of historically and geographically specific factors, are being (re)shaped by an array of actor-networks with an international business dimension. Groups of actor-networks associated with international finance, the international business media, and multilateral institutions are engaging with Chinese business networks. Through their capacity to enrol relevant Chinese firms into their actor-networks, the international business community is forging changes in some business practices, while also reinforcing other business practices. At the most basic of levels, though, the reshaping of Chinese business practices has been driven by the desire of large Chinese firms to access the financial resources that flow through the global financial system. That such a situation should arise is not surprising given the nature of profits that have been generated from the development process in Asia-Pacific over the past two decades (before the onset of the Asian economic crisis). In the context of the reworking of global capitalism, and the reshaping of subglobal capitalisms, such a relational approach to analysis of economic organisation may help shed some light on the networks that bind together actors and institutions over time and space in uneven (albeit evolving) relations of interdependence. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the mid-to-late 1980s, a number of theoretical approaches were deployed to account for some major changes in the sociospatial form of capitalist development. One influential approach—which drew loosely on French regulation theory—chronicled a shift from Fordism to a post-Fordist flexible accumulation, which is characterised, in part, by the rise of ‘new industrial spaces’ . Such accounts were criticised for playing down the constitutive effects of social and political factors in energising such regional prosperity. As debates in the 1990s have sought to address this weakness, much research has demonstrated a greater readiness to address the social and institutional regulation of these new industrial spaces, and more recently, of old (rustbelt) industrial regions. In some respects, though, what we are witnessing is the replacement of a one-dimensional reading of regional transformation—that based on production—by an ‘institutional turn’, which is variously guided by some new directions in the regulation approach, networking theory, and institutional sociology. By fusing the recent work of Jessop and Jenson, the authors seek to deploy a discourse-theoretic regulation approach towards understanding some complex shifts in the regulatory fabric of Lowland Scotland—an archetypal rustbelt region. However, in order to escape a drift towards a one-dimensional ‘institutionalism’, they revisit much (old) contextual ground in an attempt to simultaneously locate the region's political economic mechanisms of transformation and the accompanying ‘politics of representation’ amidst the contemporary transition. The authors conclude that within the United Kingdom, following the institutional possibilities opened up by the late 1990s reconstitution of national and regional governance, there is a real danger of lapsing into a ‘soft institutionalism’ if future analysis on regulation and governance fails to locate socioinstitutional forms within the broader dynamic of political and economic forces. </jats:p>",

In the specific context of a transitional economy, where planned and market elements coexist, the flow of capital into and out of the built environment is not automatically conditioned by the production sphere, or relative profitability, as suggested by Harvey's original theory of capital switching in an advanced market economy, but rather is dependent upon active involvement of various agents or ‘game players' with different vested interests and motivations. Attention is focused on intertwined local and global forces in the ‘game’ of production of new urban space. It is argued that capital circulation is the intrinsic dynamic rather than the precondition of the game. The new phase of urban development is characterised as property-led rather than industrial surplus-driven development. Specifically, I examine the role of central and local governments, state-owned enterprises, and foreign investors in urban land development and reveal that the predominant role of the state is now being substituted by complex interactions among these actors in a local context of globalisation. </jats:p>",

Such spatially focused regulation can be created by networks of professional associations such as banking or insurance associations interacting with public sector officials on a regular basis.

The limited number of existing networks vitiated any study of these trading entities by means of established techniques for measuring commitment or trust. Hence an alternative model, based on relationship and entrepreneurial marketing, was developed. A survey of small manufacturing firms was used to validate the model.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The fast-paced and large-scale Chinese urban development since 1980 is unprecedented in China's urban history. Much of the credit has to be attributed to a nascent local property industry which itself is the product of the economic reforms. Two factors—building commodification and marketization, and state-owned-enterprise (SOE) reforms—have germinated a local property industry, with the facilitation of inward foreign capital, in the context of transition from a static and rigid planning system to a dynamic market-oriented economy. Nevertheless, the gradualist economic reforms and piecemeal SOE transformation, which are intended to transform the Chinese urban economy by increment and experimentation, complicate the evolution of the property industry, which has developed unique characteristics in the transitional time between plan and market. The presence of inequality in the market and absence of measures for hardening soft budget constraints have moulded a market in the making. Market efficiency is compromised and a dual plan—market system puts the competitiveness of the growing property industry in jeopardy. </jats:p>",

Such spread, occurring along the commuting field defined by the daily journey to work, and along national travel routes connecting metropolitan regions, is characterized, respectively, as ‘spatially contagious' and as ‘hierarchical’ by geographers. Here we explore the nested ecology of these and similar infections by using the martingale theorem of probability theory to study the endemic limit and apply Ito's stochastic calculus to analyze the approach to endemicity. We find that increasing segregation and marginalization of subpopulations creates, in terms of incurable infectious disease, the paradox of a highly integrated apartheid system, entraining the rich into the diseases of the poor across vast scales of space and population, in effect poisoning the public health well for all. We suggest that, on the global scale, analogous processes can entrain the affluent North into the suffering of the South, particularly through the importation and redistribution of emerging infections. </jats:p>",

Their aims are to present recent evidence of the nature and extent of innovative activity in rural SMEs; to identify barriers to innovation in rural SMEs, together with any weaknesses with respect to their innovative performance that may affect their future competitiveness; and to contribute to the development of a policy agenda designed to support and strengthen the innovative performance of rural SMEs. Using a broadly based definition of innovation (including product, process, marketing, and new-market development) the authors demonstrate considerable sectoral variations in the nature and extent of innovative activity in rural SMEs. This is explained in terms of sectoral differences in the ways in which SMEs seek competitiveness and of the role of innovation in this process. Nevertheless, the authors demonstrate a strong correlation between the level of innovation shown by firms and their performance, in terms both of sales and of employment growth. With the exception of marketing and new-market development, only a minority of managers perceived their rural environment to be a constraint on their ability to innovate, although more detailed analysis showed SMEs in the more technology-based sectors to be disadvantaged in a number of respects. Support needs are identified in relation to marketing, the use of the Internet, process innovation, and access to specialised training. Emphasising the distinctive characteristics of the rural environment, the authors describe a policy agenda for the encouragement and support of innovation in rural SMEs which includes a recognition of the so-called ‘rural premium’. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author uses new survey evidence of sector business associations and local chamber of commerce services. He analyses the membership of these bodies by size and type of business. In the main part of the empirical analysis the author assesses association services in four categories: (1) individual services to members, (2) excludable collective services available only to members, (3) nonexcludable services available to all businesses, and (4) self-regulation. It is demonstrated that association services tend to develop in niche markets chiefly by diversification rather than by intensification. Most associations seek to develop excludable and individual services as their primary focus. Because of this inherent tendency, government policy is most likely to be successful if it works with the grain of these trends rather than against them. Hence, government policy is argued to have had too high an emphasis on using associations to develop the individual competitiveness of their members, rather than focusing on their role to improve collective industry standards and through this individual business performance. Failure to recognise the limitations of individual supports by associations may undermine the potential of the government's 1998 white paper on competitiveness. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Left-sided post-operative radiotherapy fields for the treatment of breast cancer inevitably encompass the heart within the treatment volume, resulting in late mortality which may negate the cause-specific survival advantage of the therapy. The effect of positioning was studied in 11 patients with left-sided tumours and five with right-sided tumours receiving routine post-operative radiotherapy to the breast or chest wall as part of primary therapy for breast cancer. Using the same arrangement of glancing fields for each patient treatment position, the optimum patient positioning resulted in a reduction in cardiac dose compared to our standard patient treatment position. On the left side the reduction in mean cardiac dose was 60% (p &amp;lt; 0.001) and the reduction in maximum dose was 32% (p &amp;lt; 0.001); on the right it was 17% and 31%, respectively. The volume of cardiac tissue irradiated was also reduced for all patients. Using this optimum treatment position, cardiac dose was investigated in a further 10 patients with left-sided tumours and our standard glancing field set-up was compared with 3-dimensional planning. A further reduction of 12% in the mean cardiac dose was achieved. 5 of 10 patients had a further small reduction of 4.6% in the maximum dose and one patient had a further reduction in maximum dose of 58%. In conclusion, sophisticated radiotherapy planning can reduce cardiac doses, but optimum patient positioning is of greater importance. The general application of such relatively simple measures could have a significant positive effect on overall survival from breast cancer.</jats:p>",

All results accord with earlier findings for UK regions, signifying that the main source of variation in spatial net entry patterns stems from within-industry variation in locational preferences across space. However, analysis by establishment size indicates that the predominance of within-industry variation, expressed by the magnitude and the significance of the competition effect, is much less marked for larger establishments. The determinants of spatial variations in net entry rates across Greek regions and over manufacturing sectors emphasise local economic conditions, especially for smaller firms. In methodological terms, the one-way ANOVA-based variant of shift-share analysis is criticised on the grounds that the alleged numerical equivalence between the estimated industry-mix component and that calculated conventionally is an artefact of little value. It is demonstrated that this numerical equivalence is sustained even when fundamental estimation assumptions are violated and despite the use of only partial information. </jats:p>",

Important differences between the three regions in support networks are highlighted. The limited networking between small-business owners and training providers in South London is explained by a lack of embeddedness of UK small engineering firms in the institutional framework supporting business. The absence of a critical mass of engineering businesses, the limited experiences of business owners and the weak business-support network in South London are mutually reinforcing and perpetuate the isolation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) from external training providers. Drawing on experience in Stuttgart and Aarhus, some policy proposals are offered which are aimed at increasing the take-up of management training by UK SMEs. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent studies of the role of lobby groups in European Union (EU) policymaking have drawn attention to the concept of ‘multilevel governance’ as a powerful explanatory tool in analysing how these organisations exert political influence on EU institutions. One of the longest standing of these groups is the Comité des Organisations Professionnelles Agricoles (COPA). Until the mid-1980s, COPA was regarded as being remarkably successful in influencing the content and direction of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), More recently, however, commentators have noted a marked decline in COPA's influence, citing as evidence the organisation's abortive attempts to blunt the radical edge of the 1992 reform package of the Common Agricultural Policy. In this paper the authors use Grande's conception of multilevel governance to provide a thorough examination of why COPA carried little influence with the European Commission's Agriculture Directorate, Directorate-General VI (DGVI) during the 1992 reforms. An illustrative case study is presented of a minor though notable element of these reforms, the so-called ‘agri-environment’ regulation, EU 2078/92. In explaining COPA's slight effect on the final text of the regulation, Grande's notion of multilevel governance emphasises the eclectic positions adopted by COPA's constituent farming unions towards the regulation, and the complexities of a negotiating process transacted simultaneously with different EU institutions, each requiring the tailoring of specific lobbying strategies by COPA's secretariat. The authors conclude that the negative outcome of COPA's lobbying resulted not only from disarray among this organisation's national policy constituencies, but also from skillful counterlobbying mounted by DGVI to prevent COPA from derailing the delicate CAP reform process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In most models of the links between attitudes and behaviour it is assumed (implicitly if not explicitly) that people have stable predispositions to act in particular ways. This assumption has rarely been tested in studies of British voting behaviour which show, as in the first two papers of this series, strong links between measured attitudes and party choice when a longitudinal data set is used. Investigations of the respondents' attitudes over time show substantial inconsistency, however, which suggests a cross-temporal ecological fallacy and raises serious questions regarding the traditionally employed models of voting behaviour. </jats:p>",
