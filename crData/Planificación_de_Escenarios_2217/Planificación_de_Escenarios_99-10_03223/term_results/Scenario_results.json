Their views on global developments were distilled into a range of issues, opportunities and actions to address. These have been woven together into a scenario based on achieving norms by 2050 that were identified and rated by Millennium Project participants from around the world. This scenario describes how technological success, human development, and economic/political policies achieved a global economy that appears to be environmentally sustainable while providing nearly all people with the basic necessities of life and the majority with a comfortable living. The resulting social stability has created a relatively peaceful world and allowed the exploration of possible futures for the second half of the 21st century.</jats:p>",

However, its application to stimulate permeable oil reservoirs is not reported to our knowledge scope. This paper presents the application of waterfrac to a shallow oil reservoir with low permeability, reservoir M of Laojunmiao oil field (the oldest oil field of China). The average permeability of reservoir M is 24.2 mD. The use of waterfrac to the permeable reservoirs is a different scenario from that to tight reservoirs because the higher fracture conductivity is required in order to ensure the fracture's flow capability. The more than forty-year history, development, optimization and application effect of waterfrac to reservoir M are given out in this paper.</jats:p>",

Successful applications of VR can be found in many fields outside entertainment ranging from science and engineering to education. In this paper, we present our research work on using a synthetic subsea scenario to assist the navigation of a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) in and around an offshore installation. Our approach takes the ROVs position and orientation data from a sonar-based underwater positioning unit and generates a 3-D synthetic subsea navigation scenario that is based on a geometrical model of the offshore installation. It incorporates the “ROV safety domain” concept to ensure that the synthetic subsea scenario conveys sufficient accuracy for ROV navigation. Our research results have positively demonstrated the feasibility of assisting ROV navigation using a synthetic subsea scenario in combination with the ROV safety domain. </jats:p>",

In contrast to previously identified high li, high βN equilibria, these configurations have high bootstrap current fractions (fBS∼50%–70%); they require only modest central current drive for maintaining steady state and are therefore compatible with advanced tokamak (AT) operation. Strong plasma shaping is crucial for achieving the high β and high bootstrap fraction simultaneously.</jats:p>",
