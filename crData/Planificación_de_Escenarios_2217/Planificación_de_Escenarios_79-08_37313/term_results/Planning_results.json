      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two major areas of research in dynamic programming are optimality criteria for infinite-horizon models with divergent total costs and forward algorithm planning-horizon procedures. A fundamental observation for both problems is that the relative cost of two possible initial actions for a given initial state may be quite insensitive to structural information in all but the first few periods of a multiperiod model. Recently Lundin and Morton have developed a unified machinery for the dynamic lot size model that provides a general optimality criterion for the infinite horizon problem and complete planning-horizon procedures. Here those ideas are extended to provide a formal infinite-horizon/planning-horizon framework for a reasonably general form of the dynamic programming problem. Several examples and illustrations are provided. The approach provides a good vehicle for investigating the non-stationary stochastic inventory problem; this work will appear elsewhere. </jats:p>",

Interviews were conducted with officials in New York State and Washington, D.C., to explore the dynamics of state and local responses to a federal grant-in-aid. Resistance was found at every level of government, as well as in the environments of these levels. Segmentation of the program and the displacement of federal intention were found to be common state and local tactics. A comparison with the progressive program in California is used to indicate the significance of political and economic conditions for program development. The successful resistance to the federal program in New York is discussed in terms of its implications for the future of federal land use planning. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This essay is an attempt to describe from three related perspectives the successes and failures characterising the short but turbulent history of urban modelling: from the broader perspectives of knowledge or scientific theory, and of action or design; and from the narrower perspective of the modelling activity itself. It is argued that modelling is concerned solely neither with science nor with design but with both; that is, it is concerned with the relationship between science and design and must be examined accordingly. Various arguments pertaining to these themes are elaborated in terms of the inadequacy of its theory and the dictates imposed by policy. Viewed from the individual perspectives of science or design, modelling is often judged a dismal failure but in this essay it is argued that as such views are necessarily incomplete, some compromise must be sought. In these terms, the field manifests a limited success. Much has been learned about the activity itself but, as in all situations involving immature science, the real value of these experiences may be in raising awareness of the conflicts and dilemmas which occur when uncertain knowledge is applied to problems whose perception is continually changing. </jats:p>",

A number of quantitative highlights are presented which resulted from a rather large regional-systems study of the island of Gotland, Sweden. In particular, energy and economic flows are quantified for a number of activities including industrial sectors, forestry, agriculture, and fisheries. An important aim of the study was to make explicit the coupling between the renewable energy flows in the natural ecosystems and the fuels and electricity flows in the economic system. To this end analyses were made of the Baltic ecosystem, the Gotland coastal system, the forest system, and the agriculture and other terrestrial ecosystems. Some estimate is made of the potential for renewable energy technologies on the island as well as of the work which is currently expended by renewable energies through natural processes. </jats:p>",

The first section contains a description of the Walras—Wald version of general economic equilibrium, plus a working definition of the expressions: general equilibrium sketch, paticularised general equilibrium sketch, and partial equilibrium sketch. [The author's distinction between a sketch and a model is explained in Macmillan (1978).] In section 2, von Thünen's assumptions, Stevens's (first) revised version of those assumptions, and Stevens's linear programming model are described. In section 3, the relationship between the Stevens linear programming model and the Walras—Wald model is examined. The fourth section contains a description of Stevens's approach to the relaxation of von Thünen's assumption of infinite demand elasticity, and a comparison of that approach with the so-called partial equilibrium approach to the same problem. It is claimed that this comparison is of some general, methodological interest. Section 5 contains the paper's conclusions. </jats:p>",
