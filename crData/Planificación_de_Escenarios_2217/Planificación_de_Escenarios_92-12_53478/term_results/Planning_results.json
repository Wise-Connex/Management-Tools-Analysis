      "abstract": "<jats:p> The importance of integrating policies concerned with the demand and supply of labour within growing regions has long been recognized. However, there are important theoretical deficiencies associated with orthodox methods. In the traditional approach to operational urban and regional models it is claimed that the relationship between labour demand and labour supply is functional and one sided, that is, the growth of labour demand causes population growth and leads to an assured level of labour supply. However it is argued that in the development of regional labour-force policies aimed at recognized objectives, estimates of the number and characteristics of persons available to the labour force are at least as important as estimates of the structure of labour demand. A change in the traditional theoretical framework is therefore necessary to allow for the influence of a particular population structure upon the supply of labour—in aggregate as well as to different occupational submarkets. Presentation of a more independent treatment of methods aimed at estimating the ‘availability’ (and the ‘requirements’) of labour also allows for the possibility, and consequences, of imbalance in the labour market to be recognized. </jats:p>",

It examines the evolution of policy planning in comparison with planning staffs' original objectives. It contrasts the practice of policy planning at External Affairs with policy planning theory, and argues that policy planners' contribution to the policy process lies less in forecasting or futurology and more in policy integration, challenging existing policy, developing new initiatives, and serving the department's policy‐making machinery.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Sommaire: </jats:bold> Dans cet exposé, la planification des politiques est envisagée du point de vue des praticiens. On y examine l'évolution de cette planification en la comparant aux objectifs d'origine du personnel de planification. On y compare la planification des politiques, telle que pratiquée au ministère des Affaires extérieures, à la théorie de la planification des politiques. L'exposé soutient qu'en ce qui concerne Ie processus d'élaboration de cellcs‐ci, la contribution des planificateurs réside moins dans la prévision ou la futurologic que dans l'intégration des politiques, la mise en question des politiques existantes, l'élaboration de nouvelles initiatives et dans le maintien du bon fonctionnement des mécanismes mettant au point les politiques du ministère.</jats:p>",

In this paper, a time efficient algorithm has been developed to determine a collision free path for the end effector tip of the robot with a single spherical obstacle inside the workspace. A truncated pyramid and a right circular torus are used to model the nonreachable workspaces of the end effector tip of the robot. The problem of guiding the spatial 4R manipulator while avoiding a spherical obstacle is reduced to moving a point while avoiding a truncated pyramid and/or a right circular torus inside the workspace. The point represents the tip of the end effector of the manipulator. This approach produces an efficient algorithm for determining a collision free path. The algorithm has been successfully developed and implemented in the Silicon Graphics 4D-70GT workstation to verify the results.</jats:p>",

The methodology plans optimal path to achieve the best robot kinematic and dynamic performance criteria formulated through proper objective functions. The algorithm uses robot design parameters, the size and the location of the obstacles, and the initial and the goal states to generate a collision-free optimal tool path. Using these inputs the robot workspace is generated and discretized, and the obstacles are modeled as forbidden regions of the workspace. The search for the optimal path begins with the definition of a searchspace that includes the starting and the end points. All possible paths in the searchspace connecting these points are enumerated through the formation of a network graph structure. An intelligent heuristic search scheme has been developed to enumerate the network of allowable paths. The optimal path is then obtained as a sequence of via points connecting the initial and the final states by applying Dijkstra’s minimum cost algorithm. Contrary to most existing methodologies, the computational complexity of this algorithm decreases with an increase in the number and/or the size of the obstacles in the workspace. An interactive computer program has been developed to implement this methodology for a general planar two-link manipulator. This path planning methodology can be applied to any manipulator for which the workspace and the obstacles can be geometrically represented. The algorithm has been applied to some industrial SCARA robots and the results are discussed.</jats:p>",

A census of mental health professionals has allowed the workloads to be determined and organisational models which focus on treatment in the community established. As diagnosis is the first step in treatment it is timely that new, computerised structured diagnosis interviews are available. Treatment evaluation likewise is able to suggest that medication and cognitive behaviour therapy backed by good clinical care are the keys to good patient treatment. The two major problems that follow mainstreaming of the treatment of persons with mental disorders are the reallocation of money to treatment in the community, and the education of mental health staff to diagnose and deliver the proven effective treatments.</jats:p>",

At times there has been inadequate communication and even antagonism between the practitioners of the different fields. Each field views its own expertise as all encompassing and able to perform all that is required in the production of educational programs and materials. This paper examines these three areas of expertise, describing their backgrounds, analysing the different types of responsibilities and looking for definable interfaces between them. It presents a layered model, wherein each layer has an interrelating place as part of a holistic approach to the production of good educational materials. Examples are given to illustrate the requirements, limitations and opportunities offered by each layer of the model to those above and below it.&lt;/span&gt;</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sexuality, gender, and class (with race, ethnicity, physical mobility, and other social categories related to power) are deeply implicated in the constitution of each other as social relations. Spatial structures and conflicts that are constitutive of class relations are therefore also constitutive of sexuality. An examination of recent developments in feminist, lesbian and gay, and radical social theory, and certain elements of the historical geography of capitalism, reveals specific ways in which this is so. Urban spatial designs in Britain and the USA in the 19th and 20th centuries, for example, implicate hegemonic constructions of sexuality in gender-based and class-based spatial divisions of labor. Similarly, struggles over the social definitions of sexuality have involved individuals and groups recoding spaces that have been devalued by the market in potentially counterhegemonic ways. Thus, struggles over sexuality manifest themselves as struggles over sexual representations of, and sexual symbols in, space as well as over spatial organization. Indeed, these sorts of struggles may actually be more important in the contemporary era than those concerning the spatial organization of sexuality. This is because the sociospatial construction of otherness, which has as much to do with representational and symbolic space as with physical space, has become key to the survival of capitalism. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Second World War marked a decisive expansion of planning for port cities in Western Europe and the UK. The study of plans for Glasgow shows that planners failed to prepare for the modernisation of port facilities and of waterfront-related industry and the improvement of transport connections between ports and the rest of the city. A comprehensive assessment of port matters was compromised by politics, first in bringing about government intervention in matters of port administration, and then in generating opposition between the municipal authorities of Glasgow and the central government on whether Glasgow should dominate the Clyde Valley. The Cooper report on the Clyde Estuary dealt with the question whether a unified port authority should be created. This institutional question kept port issues separate from the process of urban renewal. The Bruce and Abercrombie plans differed in their estimation of the importance of the port to the regional economy, but agreed that major changes in the port district were necessary if conditions in the rest of the city were to improve. This analysis shows that the shortcomings of planning during war cannot be attributed to wartime conditions, but reflected established perceptions of urban conditions and expectations of future development. </jats:p>",

The underlying approach is to preplan the transient behavior of the system thereby generating an appropriate command profile. To assist in applying this technique to the control of air-powered servo-systems, the paper highlights important knowledge derived previously with regard to the stability and operating characteristics of pneumatic drives. Preliminary rules for conducting such planning are then proposed with reference to a series of experimental observations. This approach can be employed to significantly reduce or prevent overshoot and instability of servo-driven pneumatic actuators (cylinders in particular) which are difficult to overcome by using conventional methods. At the same time, increased operating speeds and improved positioning can be attained. The proposed control scheme has been implemented in prototype form through using a proprietary programmable motion controller which incorporates software mechanism for generating gearbox and cam-like motion profiles.</jats:p>",

How best to address this challenge is widely debated. We describe the Harvard School of Public Health's self-evaluation and development of a practice-oriented program. METHODS. As part of Harvard's schoolwide review of the master of public health (MPH), self-administered questionnaires were distributed to all MPH students, 1987 to 1989, and international and US alumni, 1979 to 1986. Extensive discussions were conducted with relevant student and faculty groups. RESULTS. Survey results provided a basis for educational policy and curricular changes that culminated in a revised MPH that targets key areas of public health practice. Examples from the Harvard experience are provided. CONCLUSIONS. Information derived from student and alumni surveys can be highly effective in the process of guiding curricular change at schools of public health. This should be coupled with a strategic approach to gain faculty support for proposed innovations. Ongoing monitoring and modification of the new curriculum is essential. </jats:p>",

This paper describes and demonstrates the supervenience architecture, a multilevel architecture for integrating planning and reacting in complex, dynamic environments. We briefly review the underlying concept of supervenience, a form of abstraction with affinities both to abstraction in AI planning systems, and to knowledge-partitioning schemes in hierarchical control systems. We show how this concept can be distilled into a strong constraint on the design of dynamic-world planning systems. We then describe the supervenience architecture and an implementation of the architecture called APE (for Abstraction-Partitioned Evaluator). The application of APE to the HomeBot domain is used to demonstrate the capabilities of the architecture. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Industrial policy of the European Community (EC) shifted in emphasis towards a neoliberal approach in the late 1980s as one part of moves towards completion of the single internal market by 1992. Intervention by national governments was also to be curtailed (in theory at least) on the grounds that it would be contrary to fair competition and free trade. There is mounting evidence, however, that European industry is increasingly falling behind its main rivals based in the USA and Japan. This poses a sharp challenge for the future of companies in certain key sectors, and for the places and regions dependent on employment in those industries. These issues of industrial strategy and regional development are explored in this paper. First, the change which took place in EC industrial policy from the limited but deliberately interventionist stance of the early 1980s to a much more strongly market-led approach by the early 1990s is outlined. The implications of such free-market measures for the energy sector, in terms of security-of-supply considerations are identified, and these measures are compared with the difficulty experienced in formulating a response to the challenge of global competition in another key sector, automobile production. The uneven regional impacts of such changes are then considered, and the inadequacy, even in its own terms, of present EC regional policy is indicated. Finally, the emergent strategic deficit in EC industrial policy, the regional dilemma associated with the ‘1992’ proposals, and the potential scope for alternative policy directions are addressed. </jats:p>",

General transversality conditions corresponding to the boundary ones (resulting from the task to be performed) are derived. Thus, closed systems of boundary dependences fully specifying differential equations, which arise from the necessary conditions of extreme for the above criterion, are obtained. As a result, this system renders it possible to reduce the collision-free trajectory planning problem to a two-point boundary value problem. A numerical example involving a manipulator of three-revolute kinematic pairs of the Vth class is considered. </jats:p>",

With the increasing globalisation of economic activities, however, regional economies will also depend to an increasing extent on investments that are international in character, control, and ownership. Industrial modernisation and an optimal long-term allocation of resources require a series of state-led initiatives in the spheres of innovation and new technologies. There is, however, a contradiction between the internationalisation of production and the national character of economic regulation. The appropriate scale for industrial intervention is increasingly supranational. It is at this scale that capital is organised and where there is in any case a need for countervailing political power. At the same time there is evidence of a greater local embeddedness of successful productive activities. In these circumstances the development of local potential assumes increased importance. Attention is therefore paid to the respective roles of market and nonmarket modes of coordination of skill and infrastructure provision. In each of these areas, private and market provision are inadequate. Increases in regional resource endowments and the development of an advanced industrial and social infrastructure require organisation, collective action, and active interventionist regional and supranational states. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> By way of an examination of the contemporary reemergence of homeworking in the Australian clothing industry, some of the links between industrial and labour-market restructuring are explored. The growth of homeworking reflects not only the pressures placed on clothing firms to reduce costs and enhance production flexibility (increasingly, the ‘conventional wisdom’ explanations), but also represents an attempt on the part of these firms to reconstruct their urban labour-market relations. It is argued that labour-market considerations warrant attention alongside those considerations pertaining to the labour process which are usually prioritised in the literature on industrial restructuring. The case of homeworking reveals some of the ways in which labour-market processes (such as the gendered nature of labour supplies, the ethnic segmentation of the labour force, and the contours of interindustry competition for labour) exert a powerful influence upon the nature of industrial change. Moreover, questions about the development, by firms and by industries, of characteristic urban labour-market relations are also raised. </jats:p>",

This paper presents and discusses a technique that can be used in conjunction with linear programming to evaluate ‘nearly optimal’ solutions. This technique is referred to as Nearly Optimal Linear Programming or Modelling to Generate Alternatives (MGA). MGA allows planners to incorporate important objectives that are difficult to include in a mathematical model by identifying and evaluating alternative ‘nearly optimal’ solutions. Some of these alternative solutions may be consistent with the goals or objectives of decision makers.</jats:p><jats:p>To date, MGA has received little use in addressing agricultural planning problems. A micro‐level application of MGA, concerning a dairy ration formulation problem, is presented to demonstrate the relevance of MGA to agricultural planning by decision makers. Within this application, the use of MGA to complement and enhance normal linear programming analysis is also discussed.</jats:p>",

Conceptually, I draw on postmodern feminist critiques of Foucault's work to argue that the effectiveness of WSA as a political voice locally, provincially, and federally has depended on the strategic manipulation of two contradictory ideologies. On the one hand, an explicitly feminist discourse created by WSA challenges male hegemony in work and property rights on the farm. On the other, the struggle for equality, for farm partnerships, is grounded in an appeal to the ‘family farm’, a symbol of national security and sovereignty, which in the past has served to perpetuate gender-based hierarchy. </jats:p>",

This article examines nitrogen cycling in rural catchments, placing particular emphasis on the delivery of nitrate to the stream system. Nitrate levels in UK freshwaters are reviewed. Over the last two decades increases in nitrate concentration have been noted for many rivers, both large and small; in many cases, this increase can be related to the intensification of agricultural practices. Evidence is presented which shows that nitrate concentrations in many lowland rivers are close to, and in some cases exceed, EC limits for nitrate in drinking water. In southeast England, only the chalk aquifer provides low-nitrate water at present, though evidence suggests that the unsaturated zone of the aquifer is already heavily polluted by nitrate. The possibility of controlling nitrate loss by managing land use is discussed, including the implications of recent EC legislation; the UK's pilot Nitrate Sensitive Area scheme is briefly reviewed. The paper ends with a description of the authors' own research on riparian buffer zones. </jats:p>",

The struggle against the stigmatization of AIDS has forced many gay men and lesbians to reject the relative pleasures of the closet and its legal girdings in discredited notions of constitutional privacy for a radical insistence on the right to be ‘queer’ on their own terms in public. ACT UP and Queer Nation present a threat not only to prevailing state and church ideologies of power and submission, but perhaps more importantly to the gendered and sexualized assumptions which define the boundaries of public space itself. People who are ill and people defined as degenerates present a special threat to the historical myths and antiurban morphology of Los Angeles, which still is perceived as an island of private consumption and public piety by those in power. The challenge presented by ACT UP and Queer Nation is an integral part of the spatial densification of the region, feared by old Anglo and new Catholic authorities. </jats:p>",

Inputting these effects into an economic and demographic forecasting and simulation model of the basin's economy, that includes business and human migration responses, we predict that up to the year 2000 employment will be increased by the AQMP, whereas real per capita disposable income (as it is traditionally meausred) will decrease.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is argued that the view put forward by some analysts that unemployment had little or no effect on constituency results in the 1987 British general election is faulty. It rests on the failure to develop a satisfactory specification of the effects of unemployment, a problem which was also inherent in studies of previous British elections. A suggested new specification is tested and it indicates that changes in unemployment between 1983 and 1987 both at constituency and at regional level had a quite substantial effect on voting shifts in constituencies in 1987. </jats:p>",

By using a real-world case study (intraurban location of public libraries), two different estimations of demand associated with the same set of demand and potential supply sites are compared. Results show only small differences in the p-median outputs in spite of rather large discrepancies in the distributions of demand weights. This invites further and systematic research about the robustness of p-median results with respect to variations in the geographical distribution of demand. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Nursing home care for terminally ill cancer patients was organized according to nursing care plans that were based on diagnoses as recommended by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA). This study was carried out among a sample of 40 patients receiving home health care for a period of 1 to 19 weeks. More than 697 nursing diagnoses were identified in the study. The most frequently recorded nursing diagnoses were anxiety, constipation, and diminished food intake. Fifteen of the 40 patients in the study were able to complete a weekly self-report of their symptoms. The patients’ own descriptions of their symptoms were then compared with their symptoms as identified by nursing staff. There was a congruence in 63% of reported instances. Although nurses’ assessments were not always in agreement with the symptoms reported by the patients, agreement was more frequently found with somatic symptoms than with psychological ones. One conclusion is that nursing plans should incorporate multidimensional methods for assessing patients’ real needs. </jats:p>",

The significance of the whole process of the production of industrial policy is stressed: the selection of the object of policy, the institutions of policy formation and delivery, and the organisation of work and the distribution of skills within such institutions. The nature of the innovative and creative institutional responses that will be required to avoid further industrial decline are discussed. </jats:p>",
