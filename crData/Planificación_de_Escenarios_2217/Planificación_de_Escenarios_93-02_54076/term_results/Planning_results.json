This neglect, interestingly enough, occurs in spite of the recent emergence of innovative theories on organizationalfunctioning put forth by fellow planners and social scientists. This article informs planners of the need to theorize more penetratingly about organizations and reveals an evolving literature on this topic. It introduces frameworks such as urban managerialism, revisionist managerialism, organizational structuralism, and structuration, by tracing their evolution, substance, and points of controversy. The results suggest that planners need to theorize more substantively about the interconnections among societal structures, organizational morphology, and individuals. These influences generate active but bounded decision-makers who structure frequently unorthodox actions. </jats:p>",

This is due to the need for constant evaluation of the impact of incoming well data on the yet to be drilled wells. Samarang Revisit Campaign II provides an Illustration on how a closely coordinated effort achieves the aim of maximising reserves in the most economic fashion. This effort is discussed in the context of a Joint Venture &amp; Production Sharing Contract (PSC) environment.</jats:p>",

In this paper an attempt is made to fill part of this gap in knowledge by means of an analysis of the causes of the regional differentiation in labour union membership in the Netherlands. A theoretical survey into the causes of variation in regional membership is reported on. Subsequently, the effects of the potential causes of this regional differentiation are analysed empirically. First, it was found that several potentially important aspects do not explain the regional variation in membership. Second, those aspects that were relevant can be reduced to two common factors. Third, it can be concluded that the rather low level of explanation of the regional differentiation suggests that present economic locational analysis should be supplemented by an approach in which the economic historical context is taken into account too. Regional differentiation in trade union membership can only fully be understood from a regional economic historical approach. </jats:p>",

In so doing, she raises issues of professionalism, ethics, and democracy, Habermas's consideration of communicative action is of value in such analysis. She further reveals, however, that Habermassian thought tends to demonstrate a significant blindness to the role of power in such interaction. Consideration of Foucault's ideas, with regard to the manifold relations of power which characterise and constitute society, thus add an extra dimension to the work. In a strategic linking of the two the author attempts to demonstrate how communicative action can illuminate the analysis of power relationships in a manner useful to planning theory and practice. The paper concludes with a development of the Habermas-Foucault framework into a proposal for discursive democracy in an attempt to enable achievement of negotiated planning policies through a process of planning through debate. </jats:p>",

A theoretical framework is developed, linking power disparities to levels of social and political strife. Following the findings of recent research on policies towards the Arabs in Israel, it is hypothesised that Arab-Jewish power disparities have narrowed since the mid 1970s. This hypothesis is tested against the case of land use planning in the Galilee between 1975 and 1988. Three principal aspects of the issue are examined: the power structure of the planning system; participation in the formulation of land use plans; and Arab and Jewish efficacy in the planning process. The findings do not support the hypothesis. Power relations have narrowed in some areas of the planning system during the research period, but in other areas disparities have widened with the introduction of new inequalities. Overall, a status-quo has been maintained, leaving the Arabs largely outside the policy-making process in a region where they form a clear majority. </jats:p>",

With the forecasts based on Isard's interregional input-output model as a standard, the frequency and volume of the sectoral outputs and intermediate outputs (INOU) estimation errors of the MRIO model are measured under two different economic structures and two different types of final-demands shocks. It is shown that under the condition of strong interconnectedness and overall increase in final demands, the MRIO model underestimates intraregional INOUs and overestimates interregional INOUs. In the case of economies with weak spatial interconnection and subject to a mixed change in the direction of final-demands shocks, the general tendency seems to be toward overestimation of sectoral outputs and INOUs of any sector that experiences a decline in demand for its final product. The model underestimates the other sectors. </jats:p>",

Discounted cash‐flow techniques were conceived in the context of active expense‐intensive technologies, such as conventional, fuel‐intensive power generation. Photovoltaic (PV) technology, by contrast, is passive and capital intensive—attributes that are similar to those of other new process technolgies, such as computer‐integrated manufacturing. Discounted cash‐flow techniques have a dismal record for correctly valuing new technologies with these attributes, in part because their benefits cannot be easily measured using tradiational accounting concepts.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper examines how these issues affect cost measurement in both conventional and PV‐based electricity, and presents kWh‐cost estimates for three technologies (coal, gas and PV) using risk‐adjusted approaches, which suggest that PV costs are generally equivalent to the gas/combined cycle and about twice the cost of base‐load coal (environmental externalities are ignored). Finally, the paper evaluates independent power purchases for a typical US utility and finds that in such a setting the cost of PV‐based power is comparable to the firm's published avoided costs.</jats:p>",

The estimates are derived from a set of models representing the demand and supply sides of the market for the new private housebuilding which include an explicit land supply element. The models are fitted to cross-sectional data at the inter-urban (local authority) level, and then employed in medium-period simulations of alternative policies. Modelling at this level enables estimates to be made of the extent of variation between local markets in the elasticity of supply and also in the impacts of policy measures, including the capitalisation of tax subsidies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, the relationship between the political economy of tourism and ethnic cultural revival in southwest China is explored. It is suggested that cultural revival is a process of ‘place creation’ whereby identities may be consciously localized as a strategy for engaging structures of political economy which link local actors with broader geographical frameworks and more distant sources of power. Approaching the intersections between tourism and local cultural construction in this way reveals the inadequacy of Marxist analysis in theorizing the spatial relationship between political economy and culture. The theoretical argument has several prongs: (1) the local does not exist as an oppositional reality to the global, but rather constitutes a dynamic cultural negotiation with the changing structures of political economy, a negotiation in which dominant structures are mediated by individual agency; (2) ‘modernization’ is thus as much cultural as it is economic; (3) the traditional ‘space of places’, which a modern ‘space of flows' supposedly supersedes, is an idealistic construct of the past, based on a static conception of culture kept separate from a dynamic conception of economics; (4) historical materialism perpetuates this idealism in its preoccupation with the economic power of capital, relegating the cultural to a ‘response’. Last, the above approach makes it necessary to question the assumption that the ‘confused identities' of postmodernity arc the result of global capitalism's ‘annihilation of space through time’. Rather, a highlight upon the contentious nature of ‘place creation’ within broader systems of power suggests that identity has never been neatly provided by a naturally bounded place, but has always been negotiated within a complex and often confusing mesh of interaction across multiple geographic scales. </jats:p>",

The system integrates neural network computing that captures designer's design concept and rule-based system to generate a task-level assembly plan automatically. The design concept is expressed by a standard pattern format representing qualitative assembly information. A neural network model together with feature-based model translates the input pattern into a preliminary boundary representation (B-rep). Based on a refinement B-rep assembly representation, assembly plans are generated for practical use in a single-robot assembly workcell. A feasible assembly plan that minimizes tool changes and subassembly reorientations is generated from the system. A robust part collision detection algorithm to generate the precedence relationships among the assembly's components is included in the system. By contrast with many assembly planning systems that used a prolonged question-and-answering session or required knowledge beyond what is typically available in the design database, an automated assembly planning system presented here draws input relationships directly from the conceptual design and the geometry of the assembly. The system developed under this study extracts all reasoning information from the product model and permits the components to be assembled in a multitude of directions. Several experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the designed assembly planning system.</jats:p>",

The findings demonstrate that the US and Japanese governments have altered their trade policies according to broader cyclical developments in the global economy. US and Japanese trade policies can be seen as the reverse of each other: the US pursued a policy of liberalization up to the 1970s, whereas Japan entertained protectionism, and recently the two have switched roles. </jats:p>",

It appears that low-income consumers are willing to travel further for grocery shopping, ceteris paribus, probably to take advantage of lower prices. Higher income consumers may be unwilling to spend the extra time involved to shop at the stores with the lowest prices and therefore give up low prices for the sake of convenience. </jats:p><jats:p> The general conclusion from the results presented here is that intrinsic differences in store-choice behavior exist across different groups of consumers and that analyzing store location accurately demands knowledge of such differences. </jats:p>",

To reduce rehospitalizations (hospitalizations within 31 days of the previous discharge), health care professionals have turned to the discharge planning process. Using Orem's theory of self-care, a medication discharge planning program was developed to provide instruction on the requisites necessary for medication self-care. The purpose of this pilot study was to examine the effects of this program on readmissions within 31 days. Five nurses implemented the program for 54 patients with an admitting diagnosis of congestive heart failure. These patients were alternately assigned to a control or an experimental group. The experimental group received the medication discharge planning program. The control group received the usual informal discharge planning provided on the nursing unit. Eight (28.6%) of the 28 patients in the control group were readmitted within 31 days of the previous discharge. Two (7.7%) of the 26 patients in the experimental group were readmitted within 31 days. These results showed a statistically significant difference using Fisher's Exact Test (p = .05). Those receiving the medication discharge planning program were less likely to be readmitted, suggesting the importance of a medication discharge planning program. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> An effort is made in this paper to contribute to recent debates, inspired by the regulationist literature, on the restructuring of capitalist society. A major weakness in this literature concerns the treatment of the state, and especially the local state. Despite the fact that the state is clearly identified as a key component of any mode of regulation, the actual processes through which economic and social forces are translated into state activity are rarely examined, Moreover, these forces are usually assumed to operate at the national scale, but in this paper it is contended that the practices and relations of regulation also operate locally. These local spaces of regulation arise not only because of the uneven development of capitalist societies, but also because local agencies are often the very medium through which regulatory practices arc interpreted and ultimately delivered. The local state is thus a key component in these local modes of regulation, and will be implicated in any transition from one mode to another. These issues are examined by looking at the changing nature of urban politics in three British ‘cities’: Sheffield, Bracknell, and Camden in inner London. It is concluded that the local state is both an object and an agent of regulation, which itself needs to be regulated so that its strategies and structures can be used to help forge a new social, political, and economic settlement. </jats:p>",

The sample consisted of 507 Lebanese, 250 Turkish and 223 Vietnamese women. This study has revealed differences within and between the 3 migrant groups and the general population. Fertility among the 3 groups, but particularly among the Lebanese, was relatively high. While most women understood about birth control, there was a heavy reliance on traditional methods. Incidence of sterilization and hysterectomy was low compared to the general population. Use of abortions as a method of birth control was quite common among the Turkish women.
