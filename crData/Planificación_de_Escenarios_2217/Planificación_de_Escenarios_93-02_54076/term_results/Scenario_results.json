This analysis allows a consumption scenario developed previsouly to be tested by means of the classification of families according to the number and age of their members into three types—extended, mean and reduced—with the aim of establishing a few standard cases of optimization for sizing purposes.</jats:p><jats:p>Because the use of AC current is indispensable, at least for domestic appliances, the scenario hereby proposed leads to PV system sizes of 160, 320 and 480 Wp for reduced, mean and extended families, respectively, enjoying a level of comfort similar to grid‐conneced systems.</jats:p>",
