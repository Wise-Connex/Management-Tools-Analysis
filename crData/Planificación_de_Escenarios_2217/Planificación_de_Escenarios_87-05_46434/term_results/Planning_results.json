These guidelines were drawn up some time ago for the relocation of a sub‐division of an international publishing company — and cost control and accommodation of information technology will undoubtedly be stronger priorities today — but they are still referred to and are an effective model for facilities managers in all types of industry charged with the unenviable and often seemingly impossible task of co‐ordinating the office move.</jats:p>",

Erstens geht es um das Ausmaß von Migrationen, die aus Ausbildungsgründen vorgenommen werden. Bezogen auf die Geburtsjahrgänge 1929–31, 1939–41 und 1949–51 zeigt sich, daß diese Migrationen leicht zugenommen haben und sie am ehesten von Personen vorgenommen werden, die in Orten mittlerer Größe aufgewachsen sind. Zweitens wird gezeigt, daß die regional ungleiche Verteilung der Bevölkerung nach dem Bildungsniveau nicht nur eine Folge infrastruktureller Benachteiligungen, sondern zudem auf die Selektivität von Migrationen zurückzuführen ist. Die Studie kommt drittens zu dem Ergebnis, daß das Bildungsniveau eine bedeutsame Determinante räumlicher Mobilität ist. Höherqualifizierte Personen sind überproportional an Nah- und an Fernwanderungen beteiligt. Die Bildungsselektivität von Migrationen ist abhängig von der Größe der Zielregion. Es sind die Wanderungsströme in die größeren Städte, mit ländlichen oder städtischen Herkunftsregionen, an denen Personen mit einem hohen Bildungsniveau besonders stark beteiligt sind.</jats:p>"

Die Anwendung des Wachstumspolkonzeptes in den 60er Jahren brachte – trotz der wirtschaftlichen Boomjahre – von ganz wenigen Ausnahmen abgesehen, keine Erfolge. Die Ölschocks und Rezessionen der 70er Jahre schädigten die Peripherregionen zusätzlich.Seitdem jedoch Begriffe wie „High Tech als Motor der Regionalentwicklung“ oder „Der pazifische Raum als erstarkender Wirtschaftsraum“ zunehmend „aktuell“ geworden sind, erregt die neue „Technopolis-Konzeption“ (mittlerweile schon 5 Jahre alt) immer mehr Aufmerksamkeit. Mit ihr versucht die japanische Planung mit dem Prinzip „High Tech-Betriebe in strukturschwache Regionen, aber mit Einbindung in lokale Gegebenheiten“ eine ausgeglichenere Raumentwicklung zu erreichen. In diesem Beitrag wird versucht, die bisherige Regionalpolitik Japans darzustellen, jedoch vor allem – leider lediglich aufgrund von Literaturanalysen und noch ohne praktische Anschauung vor Ort – die Merkmale der Technopolis-Konzeption und deren Implementationsaussichten zu erläutern.</jats:p>"

Technical and structural change in the organisation of shipping, reflected largely in containerisation, have changed the context for these services and they have responded in a variety of ways. Data in this paper trace the location of a selection of these services in the USA and Australia, indicating a separation between services and negotiations on aspects of trade services, and new patterns of physical activity in trade. It is suggested that this separation may be facilitated by the standardisation that has come with containerisation, the importance of intercorporate linkages, the role of official markets, and the application of modern communication technology. These aspects account for the clustering of services in large cities and their separation from day-to-day trade business, and could provide insights for producer-service location in general. The paper indicates the need for survey work to test these ideas. </jats:p>",

This paper is an examination of the factors that influence location choice of international offices, by means of survey data that facilitate a sectoral analysis of location choice. Analysis of the motives that lead to direct foreign operations is based on the ownership–location–internalisation paradigm, which suggests that international firms tend to be most active in those sectors in which their ownership advantages are most pronounced, and in which these advantages are best exploited internally to the firm. A branch–regional classification is used to distinguish cases in which office-location choice is dominated by external market forces (branch offices) and those in which location is determined by internal organisational forces. </jats:p><jats:p> The primary influences on location choice are market size and the need for personal presence to serve this market. There is also clear evidence of a ‘bandwagon’ effect. But more detailed influences vary with office type and sector. In this respect, the quality and availability of resources are generally more important than direct costs. The United Kingdom emerges as a high-skill economy with a flexible labour force and good communications facilities. It is also the case that, although proximity to London remains important, there is a clear tendency to consider locations further from London, a tendency that will be further encouraged by technical change and improvement in domestic travel infrastructure. </jats:p>",

An attempt is made in this paper to present elements of such a locational framework, with specific reference to producer services. Patterns of trade and of location are complementary aspects of the same problem. Thus three distinct channels through which producer services are traded are examined: direct and intrafirm exports by producer-service firms, and intrafirm exports by manufacturing firms. The last two ‘invisible’ channels, in particular, have important implications for the locational decision. A model for the locational analysis of producer-service establishments is then posited. The producer-service location problem may be conceptualized essentially as one of a trade-off between market-pull factors, specialized labour needs, and urban externalities. Last, the location of producer-service activities within the Canadian urban system is examined. These activities are found to be highly concentrated, but not in a simple hierarchical pattern, suggesting the importance of both specialized labour pools and urban externalities. </jats:p>",

In this paper a general procedure to transform the parameters between these two levels is presented and applied to a case study.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Two general issues relating to the nature of the service sector are addressed in this paper. The first concerns the growing interdependence between the secondary and tertiary sectors, largely a function of the increased use of service functions in the manufacturing process; these service inputs may be either internalized or externalized by a manufacturing firm. The second issue concerns the role of the service sector in promoting regional economic development. It is generally acknowledged that, although it may be important for a region to possess a sufficient level of service activity so that its firms are not required to make major service imports, because of externality effects, high-order service activities tend to locate in major cities. Can it therefore be concluded that the locational pattern of the service sector has a minimal potential for reducing regional disparities, and that it would be unrealistic to expect the diffusion of services into peripheral regions? This may be the case for higher order services, but those more directly linked to industrial production may indeed be able to be decentralized. The potential for the decentralization of services activities is examined both within a conceptual framework and by reviewing the results of certain empirical studies conducted in Switzerland. </jats:p>",

Linear programming techniques were applied to data from ten container plant nurseries to determine possible production systems, their inputs, and to maximize profit. Models were developed for large (average, 27 ha) and small (average, 5 ha) container nurseries. Plant type and container size were used interactively as decision variables (activities) in the models. The small nursery model had 44 plant type alternatives and the large nursery model had 87. Resources included in the constraints were equipment, materials, and labor used to produce each plant type. The actual constraint values determined from survey information are provided, as well as a multiperiod model and a theoretical model.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the Netherlands over the last fifteen years business-service activities have decentralized towards the intermediate provinces and the regions around the large cities in the west. A survey, based on postal questionnaires, was conducted to analyze this sector in thirteen medium-sized cities in the intermediate provinces. Work in this paper centers on the role of the business-service offices in the urban economy. From Pred's information-circulation theory it is argued that this role can be demonstrated by the following measures: the amount of local inputs, the degree of external control, the size of regional exports, and the size of the business-service sector (both in terms of employment and establishments). It is demonstrated that business services are not so reliant on a local market and on the manufacturing sector as has been assumed formerly. However, there are differences between the different types of offices. In a consideration of the role of business services in the economy of medium-sized cities it is shown that there are important variations between the cities studied. Initial advantages, the region in which the city is situated, planning policies, and the nature of the market are some factors accounting for the variations. Given the strong degree of regional export orientation, the intermediate function of business services and their recent and possible future growth, these results suggest that regional and urban policies, which in the Netherlands concentrate on stimulating indigenous development opportunities in the cities and regions themselves, need to reexamine the role of business services in the economy. </jats:p>",
