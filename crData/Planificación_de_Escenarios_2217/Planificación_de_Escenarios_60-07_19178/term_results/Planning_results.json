In one county known well to the writer, present‐day students in day‐release classes know former students in those same classes who have joined the ranks of the leading farmers in the county. In other cases, while there was a fair amount of advisory work with farmers in pre‐war days, there was little or no direct educational work, which was left to the few farm institutes and agricultural colleges.</jats:p>",

The 1949 paper discusses transportation models for a single commodity and for many commodities (including empty vehicles), and a single-commodity model for a capacitated network, with applications to sections of the Russian railroad network. All problems considered in the 1939 paper reprinted in this issue are what would now be called linear programming problems. The coefficient matrices of the problems labeled “A” and “B” exhibit special structures somewhat similar to that of the transportation problem matrix. Problem “C,” while appearing still to have a somewhat special structure, is in fact equivalent to the general linear programming problem. </jats:p>",
