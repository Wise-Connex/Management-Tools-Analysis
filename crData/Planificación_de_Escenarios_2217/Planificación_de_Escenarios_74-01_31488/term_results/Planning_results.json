The investigative program related to this planning effort embodied numerous interrelated elements which, on integration, resulted in a rational engineering design having a continuous beach fill as the central feature. Specifically, the investigation included: (a) definition of the environment, viz, wind, waves, storm tide frequencies, beach profile characteristics, shore processes, and ecological habitats along the proposed project area as well as in potential beach fill sources; (b) Designs and cost estimates including establishment of various fill profile configurations, cost optimization of fill positions, evaluation of the frequency of shoreline retreat and the attendant displacement of fill materials, evaluation of the compatability of materials from various fill sources with the natural beach materials, environmental impact studies, and economic studies; and (c) Final plan formulation arriving at the optimum fill plan in terms of engineering functionality, economics, and minimal adverse environmental impacts.</jats:p>"

This paper illustrates an application of utility and decision theory in one such situation: the selection of a “land‐use plan” for a large rural area in a southeastern state. The planning group was required to generate a utility matrix for a set of alternative plans consistent with their perceived hierarchy of needs for the region in question. Subsequently, expected value calculations were used to determine the optimal plan. The examination concludes with a discussion of the reliability and sensitivity of this approach, along with an exploration of areas for possible utilization and the problems attendent thereto.</jats:p>",

This paper discusses research currently under way to develop a land-use methodology that will help planners address the tradeoff between environmental quality and economic development. The methodology is used to evaluate the social, economic, and environmental impact of alternative land-use plans. The methodology consists of a Regional Analysis Submodel and a Site Analysis Submodel. The first component is based on an expanded input-output analysis incorporating land use, resource inputs, and waste-emission outputs. The second component is an empirical analysis based on the specific suitability and compatibility of proposed land-use development areas. The land-use planning model developed is applied to a case-study area centered on Charleston, South Carolina.</jats:p>"

Puerto Rico is, after all, legally a part of the United States, and for many decades its well-being has been intimately tied to both general conditions in the U.S. and to U.S. policies, even those not directed specifically at Puerto Rico. For these reasons, planning by the government of Puerto Rico is very constrained: it must act without any of the options available to independent governments, such as the issuance of money or the control of imports; its laws and procedures must accommodate to the constraints of the U.S. legal system; it must permit U.S. citizens who are not Puerto Ricans to participate under conditions of full equality and mobility in Puerto Rico and between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland.</jats:p>"

The zones of special education, self help, language skills, socialization, and motor skills are used. Children move from one prescribed zone to another upon completing daily goals, thereby avoiding the interfering stimuli of other zones and the distracting social stimuli of large groups.

When the length of a salesman's tour cannot exceed a specified constant, the problem becomes that of finding the fewest number of salesmen such that every city is visited by a salesman and the length of each salesman's tour does not exceed a specified constant. This is the chromatic traveling‐salesmen problem. An algorithm for this problem is developed and is used to create periodic markets in parts of Sierra Leone. Fifteen rural areas were examined from Sierra Leone, and weekly market places were identified in each area. Salesmen were to be assigned to an area so that each market place was visited and each tour (or periodic ring) did not exceed forty hours. The chromatic traveling‐salesmen algorithm was used to minimize the number of periodic rings needed for each area and provide the specific tour for each ring.</jats:p>",
