      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is concerned with those elements of planning knowledge that are common to both understanding someone else's plan and creating a plan for one's own use. This planning knowledge can be divided into two bodies: Knowledge about the world, and knowledge about the planning process itself. Our interest here is primarily with the latter corpus. The central thesis is that much of the knowledge about the planning process itself can be formulated in terms of higher‐level goals and plans called meta‐goals and meta‐plans. These entities can then be used by the same understanding and planning mechanisms that process ordinary goals and plans. However, the meta‐planning knowledge now enables these mechanisms to handle much more complicated situations in a uniform manner.</jats:p><jats:p>Systems based on meta‐planning would have a number of advantages over existing problem solving and understanding systems. The same knowledge could be shared by both a planner and understander, and both would be able to handle complex situations elegantly. In addition, in planning, the use of meta‐planning has several advantages over more traditional methods involving constraints or critics. Meta‐planning allows the full power of a problem solver to be applied to situations that are generally amenable only to special purpose processing. In addition, meta‐planning facilitates the representation of some situations that are difficult to express otherwise. We have begun to introduce meta‐planning knowledge into two systems: PAM, a story understanding program, and PANDORA, a problem solving and plannin̈g system.</jats:p>",

This paper examines the planning experiences of 86 <jats:italic>Fortune</jats:italic> 1000 companies, many of them with formal planning systems ten years of age or more. Data collected in this study suggests that planning systems move through different phases in a development cycle. The ability to cope with planning problems, the satisfaction of planning participants, and the extent to which companies formulate explicit policies to recognize managerial contributions to long range planning activities are associated with the age of a company's formal planning system and its phase of planning system development. Mature system companies do a better job in coping with planning problems, are more satisfied with their planning systems, and are more likely to recognize managerial contributions to long range planning.</jats:p>",

However, the use of establishment level data covering the 1966 to 1975 period for Greater Manchester indicates that the process which exhibited the greatest spatial variation was plant closures. This contrast with the conventional wisdom is due, at least in part, firstly to the internal structure of Greater Manchester, and secondly to its lack of regional policy assistance which in the Development Area conurbations has resulted in the opening of new plants in suburban locations. The implication is that attempts to revive the inner-city economy will be relatively unsuccessful unless steps are also taken to combat its high level of plant closures. </jats:p>",

However, interperiod effects of assignment decisions are potentially as significant. Often these dynamic forces are neglected in distribution system planning. This paper focuses on approaches for analyzing the consequences of interperiod allocation relationships. A mathematical program is developed to provide a comprehensive treatment of dynamic implications and their interactions with single-period effects. Then, special cases of the model are examined. The paper shows that these specific approaches contain dynamic counterparts of treatments which are used in static (single-period) formulations. The general model and its special cases are the basis of a conceptual structure that is presented as a frame of reference for multiperiod allocation analysis. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cycles in beef cattle inventories and prices have been documented as far back as 1880 (Breimyer). The inability to identify optimal herd management strategies in response to fluctuating cattle prices is frequently blamed for the low historical returns received by cattle producers (Farris and Mallett). Cattle producers typically react to rising prices by increasing the size of their breeding herd and liquidating a portion of the herd when prices decline. Long lags between the time a cow is bred and the time her calf is weaned and ready for market make it difficult for cow-calf operators to make optimal long-run production plans. And because a cow has a long productive life, several years are required to evaluate the decision to invest in a larger breeding herd by adding more heifers. During this period, prices may fluctuate drastically, so that with hindsight, the decision to increase the investment in the herd may have been a poor choice. The same problem occurs when the herd is liquidated because of dim prospects of earning an immediate profit from the intact herd. The use of other resources probably does not fluctuate much over the cattle cycle. Bebout discovered that land committed to calf production remains fairly constant even in periods of low profits.</jats:p>",

Because of the discounting rules applied in evaluating a government investment project by means of the net present value criterion, a decisionmaker inevitably discriminates against the future members of society by giving less weight to their share of benefits (or costs) which will accrue to them at some future date. He does this simply because they are not alive at the precise time when the decision is made. The more distant they are in time from the present generations, the less weight is attached to their shares. As a consequence, in evaluating long-term investment projects, particularly those in which the benefits and costs are separated from each other with a long time interval, the net present value rules guide the decisionmaker to maximise the utility of present generations at the expense of the future ones. If the decisionmaker wishes to treat all generations, present and future equally, as he should, instead of the net present value criterion a different method of appraisal is proposed, and is called ‘the sum of discounted consumption flows’. </jats:p>",

The transfer of economic surplus out of petty commodity production which characterises these relations is important to an understanding of the poverty of the petty producers in the city, whereas the class formation this fosters perpetuates the underdeveloped character of the economy. The same processes also mean that petty commodity production plays an important part in the reproduction of the dominant capitalist sector of production because of the support it unwittingly gives to the wage labour force. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>SUMMARY</jats:title><jats:p>Isodosing is the foundation of radiotherapy treatment planning. Nevertheless, there may be a considerable disparity between the actual biological effect and that predicted by isodose plans. Simple parallel opposed fields are examined to demonstrate this disparity. The biological effects have been determined by calculation of the Equivalent Dose at the peak region, and Survival Fraction at the peak region and at mid separation, for a variety of treatment conditions. It is apparent that when parallel opposed fields are used, isodosing may substantially underestimate the effect towards the peak region compared with that at the centre, especially if only one field is treated daily. The biological effect is critically dependent on separation values, and even when two fields are treated daily, it may be considerably greater than is generally realised at separation values commonly met in clinical practice. The undesirable biological effects arising from this technique can be reduced by the use of multiple fields for whole or part of a course of treatment or by exploiting the advantages of very high energy beams, the full benefits of which are not necessarily demonstrated by isodosing. In addition, radiotherapy planning based on isoeffect rather than isodose would more clearly indicate regions of potential overdose in parallel opposed or multiple field techniques.</jats:p>",

There is less evidence that many of the more formal techniques are effectively used in practice. It can be argued that some of these techniques are very valuable aids to project managers, and to individual team members, if seen as components of leadership style, In this paper a link is made between a number of planning and control methods and the leadership model of Hersey and Blanchard. In conclusion it is argued that the potential value, and hence use, of different methods will be increased if more attention is paid to the contribution they can make to understanding and promoting individual development and project team performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The question of the nature and homogeneity of planners' attitudes and self-image is central to the current debate on planners as urban managers. If planners do possess an ‘institutional mind’ which is closely attuned to the ‘ruling ideas of a ruling elite’, and if their role in determining who gains and who loses in the process of planned urban development is influenced by a coherent professional ideology, then planners can be expected to share distinctive orientations towards the holders of political office, towards the urban environment itself, and towards specific social groups. In this paper we explore this issue, drawing on data from a survey of senior British planners. It is shown that British planners are drawn from a fairly narrowly defined spectrum of society and that they do in fact share distinctive attitudinal orientations. They subscribe to professional roles as mediators, guardians of the physical environment, and, above all, managers of the urban system. It is suggested that the ‘ideal type’ of planning personality centres on a managerial ethos which is directed towards ‘problem solving’ in a rationalist, positivistic way within a strictly defined hierarchy of authority. There is evidence, however, that there exist several subtypes of planning personality within this overall orientation. </jats:p>",

The paper argues for an emphasis, in the future, on research that will help provide better information to clients, families, and service providers, rather than on studies aimed at finding which site or model is best for long term care.</jats:p>",
