The informal planning path runs parallel to or mixes with formal planning, shaping the context of formal planning practice. As the subject of informal planning is very broad and relatively unexplored, this article merely sets the stage for further analysis. It does so by pulling several strands of thought from the literature on the informal planning process, with the aim of understanding and explaining observed socioeconomic and spatial phenomena. The shape, genesis, and causes of informal planning are examined; formal is compared to informal planning; and the design of a typology of informal planning is proposed. To conclude, the main directions of future research on the subject are indicated. </jats:p>",

The goal of the paper is to cultivate interest in combining quantitative and qualitative investigations into mixed-method planning research strategies and to highlight how and why investigators use mixed-method research strategies. </jats:p>",

The overview is based on a series of evaluation studies as well as an extensive literature survey. Three generations of neighborhood remedies identified in all these countries are critically analyzed. The analysis includes a model case of the second generation and a new typology of the third. Based on theoretical understanding of urban processes and the lessons drawn from past experience, the article concludes with constructive proposals for a new generation of neighborhood renewal policies. While former policies benefited either people or areas, the proposals discussed here were developed to promote both and thus, where appropriately implemented, to halt the cycle of distress in neighborhoods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper is an attempt to contribute to studies of landscape production in cultural geography and investigations of the role of texts and discourses in critical planning studies. The main argument is that detailed study of contemporary planning processes overcomes the cruder terms of recent debates over idealism and realism or materialism in cultural geography and permits planning studies to loosen the notion of what texts are important in shaping planning decisions. A detailed case study of a prolonged planning dispute over the production of new landscapes around Lexington, Kentucky provides an empirical basis for the three interrelated theoretical arguments that conclude the paper. These are: (1) to understand landscape and the fundamental role the state plays in it, there must be a recognition of the interwoven nature of discourse and materiality; (2) the fact that state institutions are where different landscape interpretations are articulated allows them to overcome crises of legitimacy and accumulation through the rhetoric of liberal planning; (3) the institutional sites of the state, such as the planning commission, are vitally important spaces in any process of landscape production because their procedures tend to create two ‘sides' in any contest and thus legitimate certain discourses while closing off possibilities for other views to be included in state-sponsored policy documents. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Human service providers and scholars have often touted education and information awareness strategies as necessary elements in overcoming community rejection of human services. However, information can affect perceptions in positive or negative ways. This paper presents an analysis of the first national survey of attitudes toward human services in the United States to explore the linkages between information and acceptance of human service facilities. Mental health care facilities provide the focus for analysis. The findings suggest that most respondents believe that they are not \"very well\" informed about mental disability, that they often do not have personal experience with mental health care, and that the information that they do obtain often emanates from the popular media (particularly television). Ordered logit methods are used to explore the influence of information on attitudes toward group homes for mentally retarded persons and toward mental health outpatient facilities. Implications of this analysis for understanding the NIMBY syndrome are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Change in local land use policy is generally a necessary precursor to future land use changes. Using the recently opened Century Freeway/ Transitway (I-105) in Los Angeles County as a case study, this article examines the land use policy responses of local jurisdictions traversed by a new transportation facility. Focusing on this local policy context, we analyze former and current general plans and zoning ordinances from the 13 jurisdictions near the freeway! transitway and we interview city managers or directors of community development from each jurisdiction. Changes have most often been to foster commercial and mixed use designation. However, our analysis of zoning changes in the corridor area also indicates that some jurisdictions are attempting to deintensify land uses, and this dynamic is even more evident when a wider analysis area of the affected jurisdictions is employed (one mile band). We offer several reasons for these results and comment on relevance to an understanding of accessibility. </jats:p>",

Some might argue that a shifting balance of power in society and in marketing is reflected in developments such as relationship marketing and postmodern marketing which signal a shift away from “male” values, and that we are currently witnessing the resurgence of more “feminine” values. Concludes that despite these grand claims, prevailing “patriarchal” relations of power are still intact.One could argue that such developments are further acts of appropriation of the “female” space. That said, this space can never be totally appropriated. To locate the “female” principle, one must look beyond the regulating structures of society and the academy to the fringe, for this is the domain of the war machine, a territory which cannot be fully occupied by the forces of the social.</jats:p>",

All 106 NCAA Division I‐A athletic departments were surveyed. The response rate was 72 per cent. Findings of this study were as follows: 33 (43.4 per cent) of the athletic departments were classified as strategic planners; insufficient financial resources and time were the factors that highly discouraged the athletic departments from engaging in strategic planning; a strategic planning process model was developed and an analysis of its several components was presented; the extent of strategic planning used by the athletic departments was not related to the type of university, university size, and the background of athletic directors.</jats:p>",

These restrictions are expressed in a rule language. However, in a given planning situation much is known to be fixed, so the rule set can be partially evaluated with respect to this known input.The approach is somewhat novel in that it uses truly static input data as well as static input data where the values are known only to belong to a set of values.The results of the partial evaluation is quite satisfactory: both compilation and running times have decreased by using it. The partial evaluator is now part of the crew scheduling system that Carmen Systems AB markets and which is in use at most of the major European airlines and in daily production.</jats:p>",

Considers the possibility that women may be “natural” internal marketers and that, when they establish and dominate the culture of a business enterprise, this may make for more cohesive organizational arrangements and hence more successful business. Introduces a framework for operating a parallel or collateral organization which focuses on development and improvement and considers its implications for management style. Examines characteristics of the male and female character structure to see how they might impact on communication and management style. Concludes that female managers will be characteristically more at home with the requirements of a marketized enterprise and that this can be of positive benefit to the “health” of members’ working relationships and of overall corporate performance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The British planning system provides for the exercise of discretion in the interpretation of policy and at the operational level processing planning applications. That discretionary space is utilised to negotiate, often over the provision of planning gains. Three applications for commercial uses drawn from different parts of England are taken as case study examples. They are examined within the context of an analytical framework which identifies the activity of negotiation, the influences on it and the actors involved. Consideration is given to the influences on negotiation from both the developers' and the local planning authorities' points of view. Factors relevant to the developer include the structure and nature of developer, their interest, the nature of development, the political culture, the nature of the planning gain and the merits of the gain. Similarly, the local planning authority's approach is influenced by organisational procedures, the degree of delegation, the nature of the negotiations and the preparation undertaken. The authors suggest a negotiating frame which shapes the process of negotiation. The article concludes by highlighting the separate but parallel development control and negotiation processes which both demand managing and integrating. The skill to achieve this integration, to handle knowledge of the law and development process and the judgement to assess others' priorities are all demanded of successful negotiators. </jats:p>",

Geomorphological conservation has been the Cinderella of nature conservation, but has now added Regionally Important Geological/geomorphological Sites (RIGS) to the earth science related Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs). However, it has yet to embrace the need for a wider perspective on landform conservation. Too many topographic changes in the countryside show little respect for local topographic distinctiveness or geomorphological concepts. This is illustrated by many recent golf course designs, low‐level pit restoration schemes, landraising schemes and screening by bunding. However, there are some signs of changes in policy and practice in designing within the existing topographical context, rather than undertaking incongruous land remodelling. The paper concludes by advocating a greater understanding of geomorphology amongst landscape architects, planners and the wider public, so as to achieve greater geomorphological authenticity in developments in the countryside.</jats:p>",

At the same time, however, new urban patterns and changing political and economic circumstances are creating needs that point to the continued validity of the two-tier model. In particular, economic pressures resulting from global competition, and societal pressures associated with the need for sustainable development, are providing a basis for new responsibilities and new expectations with regard to metropolitan governance, and there continues to be a case for two scales of response. A major point of difference from the past is that the metropolitan scale is now much larger in spatial terms, and as a result it is useful to consider the upper tier in terms of regional or mesolevel government, and the concept of city-region, adapted to present-day circumstances, may provide a useful framework for future development.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Contemporary theories of social movements have failed adequately to address the spatiality of collective action. I argue that an analysis of collective action that pays due attention to the spatiality of movement practice can provide an important complement to social movement theories. This spatiality of social movement agency involves an analysis of how spatial processes and relations across a variety of scales, as well as the particularities of specific places, influence the character and emergence of social movements, and how social movements use space strategically. Using the notions of locale, location, and sense of place as an interpretive framework I argue that a spatialized analysis of conflict provides important insights into social movement experience. First, it informs us of the broader spatial context within which social movements are located; second, it informs us of the spatial and cultural specificity of movements; third, it informs us of the cultural expressions of social movement agency; and, fourth, it informs us of how the strategic use of space may constrain or enable collective action. I contextualize these arguments by analyzing the Maoist insurgency of the Naxalite movement, which first emerged in India during the late 1960s. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of regionalism in India have tended to concentrate on the secessionist struggles in Kashmir and Punjab, and on centre-State relations within the federal union. An issue which has received far less attention has been that of nonsecessionist regionalism—the various demands for the creation of new smaller States within India. The persistent tendency of the centre has been to view these movements as threatening and divisive and, therefore, with varying degrees of success, to resist and repress them. However, a number of commentators have suggested that smaller States are one way in which India's federal structure could become more equipoised, decentralised, and participatory. In this paper the author examines the recent mass movement for a separate State of Uttarakhand, an area which currently forms the Himalayan part of the State of Uttar Pradesh. Given the limitations of space, she concentrates on one aspect of the movement, namely how protestors have mobilised particular grammars and strategies of resistance in their struggle to persuade the central government (the final arbiter) that their demands for separation from Uttar Pradesh are justified and that the creation of Uttarakhand would benefit both the region and the country, economically, environmentally, and strategically. </jats:p>",

Major trends in planning practice are characterised and the scope for bargaining processes is critically addressed. The procedural and institutional separation between these systems is emphasised. A contrast is made between the localised nature of planning practice and the independent centralised approach to environmental assessment in Portugal. In this context, a case study of the planning application for a large tourism development condominium, involving the preparation of an environmental assessment, is presented. A contradictory framework for bargaining emerges out of this case. The search for scientific evidence to support the decision-making process is impaired by changing environmental arguments throughout a long administrative process. Diverging local development interests versus national conservation interests are explored and a strong case for a collaborative approach is justified. Finally, evidence is gathered to support the view that the separation between the planning system and the EIA system create a disjointed framework for bargaining, in which the developer is bound to perform a difficult and somehow secondary mitigated role. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The study begins with a review of Green Revolution research in India. A move is charted from a concern with various types of differentiation to an interest in wage-rate trends and opportunities for off-farm diversification. This leads into a discussion of the crucial role of the investment patterns of richer farmers in governing the dynamics of rural industrialisation. Various characterisations of richer farmers are reviewed in this context. The focus then moves to Meerut District, western Uttar Pradesh. A review of the progress of the Green Revolution in this area is followed by a focus on the investment strategies of richer farmers in the district. The particular significance of notions of family is noted and related to social and political changes operating at a number of scales. It is argued, in conclusion, that the next generation of rural development or Green Revolution studies in India will require an attention to both ‘old-fashioned’ rural development issues centring on labour relations and distributive justice and a more novel set of social, cultural, and micropolitical questions relating to how successful farmers imagine their surplus and how its subsequent utilisation might be contested by less affluent groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> <jats:italic>Both scholars and practitioners of environmental and land use planning in Western contexts have been slow to consider the links between planning and gender as they apply to land use reallocations in regions located beyond the city. The purpose of this paper is to spark discussion and inform future research efforts about the gendered implications of land use change. Drawing on research from environmental planning, gender/development planning, and rural resource communities, a conceptualization of feminist environmentalism is developed to interpret how environmental and land use planning represents women's lives and gives meaning to women's perspectives on economic transition in rural resource communities in Canada. Two planning documents are analyzed. First, a regional land use plan and transition strategy proposed by the Commission on Resources and Environment (core) for Vancouver Island in 1994 is examined. It is revealed that this plan contained a narrow interpretation of social sustainability, which resulted in the omission and /or marginalization of important elements of women's lives. Second, a subsequent post‐hoc assessment of the impact of the Vancouver Island plan was reviewed. This report gave voice to women's material realities; however, a nuanced interpretation of the variation in the experiences of women remained elusive. Drawing on insights from both theory and practice, challenges for future research are presented</jats:italic>.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:italic>Les universitaires et les praticiens de I'aménagement du territoire et de I'environnement en contextes occiden‐taux ont résistéà prendre en considération les liens entre la planification du territoire et le genre sexuel tels qu'ils s'appliquent aux re‐allocations de l'utilisation du territoire, particulièrement en régions contiguës aux villes. Le but de cet article et de susciter la discussion et d'informer sur la direction des recherches en considération des implications du genre sexuel et des femmes par rapport a l'utilisation du territoire. À partir de recherches et de la littérature en planification environnementale, en déve‐loppement, en féminisme et en ressources des commu‐nautés rurales, une conceptualisation de I'environ‐nementalisme sensible au genre sexuel est élaborée pour interpréter premièrement, les représentations de la vie des femmes en aménagement du territoire et de I'environnement. Deuxièmement, cet article aborde le sens que cet environnementalisme féministe offre aux perspectives des femmes en lumière des transitions économi‐ques des communautés rurales. Deux documents tirés de la littérature en aménagement sont analysés. Premièrement, nous analysons un plan d'aménagement et de stratégic de transition proposé par la Commission sur les Ressources et I'Environnement (core: Commission on Resources and Environment) pour I'&amp;#x006c;̂le de Vancouver, publié en 1994.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Traffic congestion and transit service deterioration are becoming acute problems in China’s major cities. Based on a case study of Shanghai, this paper examines the growing gap between the supply of urban transportation facilities and the demand for travel, and discusses the planning implications. Because it will take great amounts of time and resources to transform the municipal transportation infrastructure into one suitable for high level mobility and motorization, the supply side is constrained for the short term. Therefore, planning research is directed primarily to the demand side. Transportation surveys indicate that travel demand has been increasing explosively through a combination of more trips, longer trips, and mode shifts away from walk and transit. Population growth, growth of family income, urban expansion and spatial reconfiguration, the emergence of labor and housing markets, and motorization are identified as the main causal factors. The probable future effects of these factors are analyzed and policy options are explored. The paper argues that enhancing accessibility without inducing mobility should be a basic guideline for policy‐making and urban planning. Given the fast pace of urban development and the important role of the municipal government in locating urban activities, land‐use planning can be a highly effective means for improving accessibility. Specific land‐use strategies and complementary policies are proposed. Since Shanghai is in some important ways representative of large metropolises in the developing world, the case study is potentially valuable for other cities as well.</jats:p><jats:p>Les embouteillages et la détérioration des services de transport deviennent des problèmes graves dans les villes importantes de Chine. Basé sur une étude de cas de Shangaïı, cet article examine le décalage grandissant entre la demande et la provision des moyens de transport, et discute les implications pour la planification. La transformation de l’infrastructure des transports municipaux afin qu'elle se prête à la mobilité et motorisation de haut niveau demandera un temps et des ressources considérables, et conséquemment l’approvisionnement est limité dans l'immédiat. La recherche sur la planification se concentre donc principalement sur la demande. Les sondages sur les transports indiquent que la demande de transport a beaucoup augmentéà cause d’une conjonction de trajets plus longs et plus nombreux, et de la baisse de la marche à pied et du transit. L’expansion de la population, l’augmentation des revenus familiaux, la croissance urbaine et la reconfiguration spatiale, l’apparition des marchés du travail et du logement, ainsi que la motorisation, sont identifiées comme les causes principales. Les résultats vraisemblables de ces facteurs pour le futur sont analysés et les options politiques sont explorées. Cet article soutient que l’amélioration de l’accessibilité sans inciter la mobilité devrait être une directive fondamentale pour les décisions politiques et pour la planification urbaine. Etant donné la rapidité du développement urbain et le rôle important de la municipalité dans l’établissement d’activités urbaines, la planification de l’aménagement du territoire peut être une méthode très efficace pour améliorer l’accessibilité. Des stratégies spécifiques d’aménagement du territoire et des directives complémentaires sont proposées. Parceque Shangaï est, à beaucoup d’égards, typique des grandes métropoles du monde en voie de développement, cette étude de cas est potentiellement intéressante pour d’autres villes.</jats:p>",

A detailed discussion on the construction of ‘women’ by colonial and anticolonial forces prior to Independence helps place the post-Independence period in context. Because the issues are complex and intertwined, it is argued that in the Indian context the definition of conventional feminism needs to be substantially enlarged to incorporate the vast canvass covered and the role played by women in realising the aspirations of the common people including women. Thus, the author provides some representative case-study materials on Indian women in struggle (Shahada, anti-arrack, and Chipko, etc) while taking care to point out the too common assumption that these, particularly the last one, are or were women's movements. This is followed by an account of how women have been defined as a problem by various Indian plans and how women's issues are so often written around (or under) the state's desire to control female bodies in the name of national population planning. The discussion here maintains a critical edge in bringing together a narrative of Indian planning around ‘women’ with several remarks on (and drawn from) Western and non-Western feminisms. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We have developed a system for source localization and real‐time planning of interstitial volume implants for intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) using high dose rate remote afterloading techniques. Source localization is realized by using an electromagnetic tracking device, which consists of a transmitter coil, a receiver coil, and a signal processing unit, to generate the coordinates and orientation of the receiver. A drawback of the device is its sensitivity to adjacent metallic objects. Localization accuracy was evaluated in an operating room environment, where the metallic objects closest to the receiver are surgical retractors (that, incidentally, preclude radiographic localization). For achievable separation distances, we found an rms error of 0.7 mm in determining the distance between points 2 cm apart, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the method. The receiver is mounted on a plastic block from which projects a long stylet and the transmitter is located at about 50 cm from the receiver. The stylet is inserted sequentially into source catheters to obtain the location and orientation data that serve as input to treatment planning software. The planning program optimizes source dwell time to make calculated dose conform to the dose prescribed on an ellipsoidal surface to an extent consistent with a certain level of dose uniformity inside the target volume. A least squares method is used that involves minimizing the objective function by a matrix method (nonnegative least squares). We have demonstrated that dwell time optimization can be performed in a short time and that the approach is adequate for the IORT application.</jats:p>",

We first classify sources of motion-planning uncertainty into four cat egories, and argue that the problems addressed in this article belong to a fundamental category that has received little atten tion. We treat the changing environment in a flexible manner by combining traditional configuration-space concepts with a Markov process that models the environment. For this context, we then propose the use of a motion strategy, which provides a motion command for the robot for each contingency that it might confront. We allow the specification of a desired per formance criterion, such as time or distance, and determine a motion strategy that is optimal with respect to that criterion. We demonstrate the breadth of our framework by applying it to a variety of motion-planning problems. Examples are com puted for problems that involve a changing configuration space, hazardous regions and shelters, and processing of random ser vice requests. To achieve this, we have exploited the powerful principle of optimality, which leads to a dynamic programming- based algorithm for determining optimal strategies. In addition, we present several extensions to the basic framework that incorporate additional concerns, such as sensing issues or changes in the geometry of the robot. </jats:p>",

After a review of the arguments made by leading spokespersons of Indian environmentalism, the author provides an alternative framework for understanding the different forms of state intervention in natural-resource management in colonial and postcolonial India. Three factors that have shaped dominant policy phases and strategies of state institutions engaged in resource management are highlighted: major shifts in the political and economic processes that create pressures for state intervention; competing demands on state institutions that shape the ways in which intervention occurs; and conflicts, disputes, and negotiations that redefine the exercise of state control and the forms of resource management. In focusing on the interplay of these three factors, the author illustrates the continuities and major shifts in resource-management strategies adopted by state institutions in India. The inherent weaknesses (and reactionary populism) of Indian environmental debates are discussed, together with the inability of those involved to articulate strategies for moving towards sustainable urban and regional development within the recent policy phase of deregulation and market expansion in India. </jats:p>",

The robot's task is to reach the desti nation in the minimum time while detecting possible routes by vision. Since visual recognition is computationally expensive and the recognition result includes uncertainty, a trade-off must be considered between the cost of visual recognition and the effect of information to be obtained by recognition. Using a probabilistic model of the uncertainty of the recognition result, vision-motion planning is formulated as a recurrence formula. With this formulation, the optimal sequence of observation points is recursively determined. A generated plan is globally optimal, because the planner minimizes the total cost. An effi cient solution strategy is also described that employs a pruning method based on the lower bound of the total cost calculated by assuming perfect sensor information. Simulation results and experiments with an actual mobile robot demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. </jats:p>",

Component aging is one of the critical issues in an increasingly competitive environment, especially in plant components built and installed during the 50s and 60s. Maintenance optimization is also a critical issue for components, such as those that operate in the creep regime, and therefore age quickly. Maximizing the value received for each predictive maintenance/inspection dollar is the key. This article introduces the use of decision analysis to unite engineering analysis and economic evaluation for decision making. To illustrate this idea, examples of this approach applied to chemical facility components will be presented. In addition, the concept of priority‐ranking multiple component maintenance/inspectio projects having maintenance budget and safety constraints in a way that maximizes Net Present Value, will be presented.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this article, the very different cotton production schemes that the state introduced in colonial and post-colonial Mozambique are explored. Three distinct periods in the history of cotton production are examined. In the first, the focus is on the impact of cotton cultivation on the daily lives of peasants trapped in a highly coercive labor regime which Portugal imposed in 1938 and enforced for almost a quarter of a century. An outline of the abortive attempt of the newly independent FRELIMO government to revitalize cotton production from 1977 to 1985 as part of its broader socialist agenda to transform the countryside, is given next, and the study is concluded with a discussion of recent state efforts to promote joint cotton ventures under the guise of the IMF—World Bank structural adjustment program. An analysis of these changing cotton regimes offers a way of exploring a wide set of issues in the sustainability debate, The Mozambican cotton scheme demonstrates the extent to which state development planning often is not only about either social or ecological sustainability but also about control, power, and effectively silencing the rural poor by experts disconnected from the countryside. It is also stressed that the politics of memory is an important dimension of the sustainability debate and the broader ideological struggles which it reflects. Try as they might, neither the colonial state nor the postcolonial state could control how peasants constructed and interpreted the past. The official representations of cotton as a path to progress, whether on a capitalist or a social road, were simply dismissed by most growers who knew better. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author reviews the operation of the most important decisionmaking body in Greece for archaeological and cultural work, as well as for the urban and environmental ethic of heritage protection, the Central Archaeological Council (CAC), functioning in the context of the Ministry of Culture. The CAC is a site of mediation between the state (seen as an entity with many internal contradictions) and various private interests. The author reveals the deeply developmental character of the aesthetic and symbolic presence of monumental landscapes in modern Greece on the basis of research into an extremely rich source of primary materials, the archives of proceedings of the CAC for the period 1974–90, research which included the examination of approximately 16 000 cases. The usual pessimistic view is that state bureaucracy merely promotes the interests of specific socioeconomic powers. But bureaucratic routines can mask deeper and wider processes, such as issues of national development, identity, and self-respect, questions of disciplinary prevalence and aesthetics (as in the case of archaeologists and architects), and problems of coordination of coresponsible state agencies. In Greece such processes take place in the context of an historically established, fierce, Western critique of Greek cultural policies. </jats:p><jats:p> More specifically, the author tries to answer the questions of how outcomes arc mediated by the bureaucratic apparatus, how power relations are internalised in the CAC, and what aspect masks what. It is suggested that the opening up of such bureaucratic processes to wider social strata could free new possibilities of social evolution. This started happening in the subperiod 1981–90 alongside the introduction of new institutions and policies in the context of the Ministry of Culture. </jats:p>",

The complexities of the processes involved suggest that, rather than there being the unidirectional penetration of society by an ‘alien’ developmental state, rural Bengalis are able to make knowing use of the language and structures of modern government for their own ends. I end the paper by suggesting the possible consequences of these findings for Kaviraj's thesis, for accounts of a ‘crisis' of India's developmental state, and for the discursive turn in development studies more broadly. </jats:p>",

In response to the rapidly shrinking funds and subsidy levels transit managements have to focus attention on ways to improve service operations. The management of public transit systems in Saudi Arabia is no exception to this trend. This study is aimed at evaluating the service performance of a sample of regular (fixed-route, fixed schedule) bus transit routes in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Utilizing a microcomputer-based program, the bus transit service operational measures of fare, headway, vehicle size and routing were analyzed. To account for the socio-economic and cultural differences of transit ridership in Riyadh, time/cost elasticities of demand as well as walk time and bus travel time parameters of the model were calibrated. Evaluation of the impact of changes in service operational measures suggested that no change in operational variables could improve the very low productivity of one of the sample study routes. A cost-reduction strategy which includes the use of smaller vehicles and less-frequent service runs should improve the low productivity of this route. Findings also indicated that a small increase in fare would pay for the total operation and maintenance costs of the other routes. The authors, however, do not recommend an increase in fare for a variety of reasons; the low income level of the captive riderships, the enormous financial resources of the country , and the multi-dimentional role of transit systems in providing urban mobility with minimum negative impacts on the  environment.</jats:p>"

A second objective was to assess the suitability of this process for planning such a relatively complex program. SETTING: The project was carried out in 47 primary schools in three local government areas, in the Perth metropolitan area. METHODS: The program was developed, based on extensive needs assessment incorporating formative evaluations. Epidemiological, psychosocial, environmental, educational, and demographic information was gathered, organised, and prioritised. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model was used to identify the relevant behavioural and environmental risk factors associated with child pedestrian injuries in the target areas. Modifiable causes of those behavioural and environmental factors were delineated. A description of how the model facilitated the development of program objectives and subobjectives which were linked to strategy objectives, and strategies is provided. RESULTS: The process used to plan the child pedestrian injury prevention program ensured that a critical assessment was undertaken of all the relevant epidemiological, behavioural, and environmental information. The gathering, organising, and prioritising of the information was facilitated by the process. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a model such as PRECEDE-PROCEED can enhance the development of a child injury prevention program. In particular, the process can facilitate the identification of appropriate objectives which in turn facilitates the development of suitable interventions and evaluation methods.</jats:p>",

The new role assumed by regional governments and authorities in the European Union (EU) system has emerged neither by itself nor by global moves towards decentralization, but has been actively triggered by the European Commission. Particularly through its strategy of policymaking in the framework of the Structural Funds, regions and other decentralized actors have been stimulated to play a more active and independent role. For this purpose, the Commission, constrained by a lack of extensive formal powers and competences, has made wide use of informal or underformalized processes and procedures of decisionmaking and policy implementation. These strategies are analyzed with the author's aim of highlighting the most important innovations resulting from the recent reforms of the Structural Funds. The response of the regions to the policy framework set out by the Commission is highlighted through selected examples. On the basis of empirical material, conclusions are drawn with regard to the future development of the EU system as a whole. It is argued that this system will not so much evolve into a fully fledged three-tier system, but rather will be characterized by new modes of regulation which, in the long run, will transform traditional state intervention at all government levels, and by new modes of exercising power which are based on the skillful pooling and sharing of the power resources of many divergent actors, both public and private. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recently human geographers and sociologists have begun to focus on the prospects for theories without dualisms. As a result of research on technology, animals, and the environment, it has become evident that a human-centred perspective, which continually positions humans as the only significant actors, cannot adequately take into account the various nonhumans which make up our world and upon which we depend. In large part the human-centredness of much social science derives from a sharp divide, a dualism, between nature and society and between the work of natural and human scientists. In this paper I consider one attempt to transgress this divide and assess the prospects for theories of this kind. The focus here is upon actor-network theory (ANT), an approach developed by Michel Callon, Bruno Latour, and John Law within social studies of science. I first outline the social studies which form the background to the development of ANT and then go on to elaborate the main contours of the approach, with particular emphasis on its transgression of the nature—society distinction. I conclude with a critical assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and attempt to show how it might be usefully combined with other, more traditional, social scientific concerns. </jats:p>",

The trajectory planning problem is first formulated as a minimum-control, fixed-time, optimal control problem with no terminal cost. This results in a two-point boundary value problem that is numerically solved using the relaxation method. Some simulation results of the relaxation method are presented. While we cannot claim rigor ously that the trajectories obtained here are globally optimal, there is strong evidence from numerical robustness tests that they are well-isolated extrema, and are possibly the globally optimal solutions. The two-point boundary value problem is also solved analytically. It is shown that the optimal motion of the two-wheeled mobile robot is similiar to the motion of a pendulum in a gravitational field, and as such, is described by four constants of motion. A procedure for solving the constants of motion is discussed. At the end, it is possible to obtain a closed-form solution to the optimal trajectories in terms of Jacobian elliptic functions. </jats:p>",

In this paper we consider the role played by forest struggles and forest intellectuals (notably Guha and Gadgil) in the rewriting of India's forest policies. We also evaluate the utility of a moral economy framework in guiding joint forest management policies in India's Jharkhand. We draw on village-level fieldwork in Ranchi District, Bihar, to highlight the value of an approach to the management of Degraded Protected Forests that offers a key role to active and informed forest citizens (as per the moral economy framework). We also highlight five areas of present concern: the extent of local environmental knowledges, not least among women; questions of territoriality and excludeability in respect of forest protection activities; trust, imagined communities, and forest citizenship; the role of charismatic leaders; and the importance of complementary ‘nonforest’ policies.</jats:p>",

These planners are probabilis tically complete: if a path exists, they will find one with high probability, if we let them run long enough.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Task Group 23 of the AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee has produced a test package for verification of the accuracy of treatment planning for photon external beam therapy. The package includes measured fundamental beam data for 4 and 18 MV x rays, and 13 test cases with measured dose values at selected points, which serve as the reference for determination of calculated dose accuracy. Test cases include three square fields, two rectangular fields, a wedged field, a blocked field, and an irregular field, as well as cases of an off‐center plane, source‐to‐surface distance (SSD) variation, oblique incidence, and lung and bone inhomogeneities. This package was used to evaluate two treatment planning systems. Although average dose variations in most cases were less than 1%, maximum deviations up to 19% were observed in one planning system and up to 11% in the other. Dose deviations greater than 3% were observed for 51 of 532 points (in the 4 MV case) and for 124 of 586 points (in the 18 MV case). An additional component of the test package is an evaluation of radiological field width at different depths. The largest deviation for width was 17.4 mm for 4 MV and 9.1 mm for 18 MV. In 20% of the widths studied, the deviation observed was greater than 3 mm for the 4 MV case. In the 18 MV case 18% of the widths had deviations greater than 3 mm. Our data indicate that the accuracy of the two treatment planning systems tested here warrants improvement, even for simple treatment geometries involving photon beams, which are generally considered to be well understood. As one of the treatment planning systems is widely used in the US, it is concluded that the accuracy of the currently available commercial treatment planning systems is not adequate for achieving the generally stated goal of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp8119-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp8119:mp8119-math-0001\" /> accuracy of dose delivery in radiation therapy. The AAPM Task Group 23 test package provides an extremely useful tool for a quantitative analysis of treatment planning systems for photon beam radiation therapy.</jats:p>",

METHODS: An ecological study design was used. The study population included all persons diagnosed with pertussis from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 1994. Maps of rates were constructed via a geographic information system and clustering was statistically confirmed. Associations between pertussis rates and community characteristics were tested. RESULTS: Mapping and statistical analysis revealed spatial clustering of pertussis. Higher age-adjusted rates of pertussis infection were associated with higher proportions of residents below poverty level. CONCLUSIONS: In urban areas pertussis infection clusters in areas of poverty. </jats:p>",
