      "abstract": "<jats:p>Probably every planner, while reading an article about managing, has felt a twinge of discomfort or gnaw of disbelief over the discrepancy between management as it is written about and management as it is practiced. According to the canons of business literary tradition, management's style and thought processes are presumed to be logical and orderly. Any MBA soon learns that top management does not behave as if it has read the right textbooks. Usually this discrepancy between real operation and literary tradition is dismissed with the Platonic argument that the real is always flawed when compared to the ideal. But last year, Professor Henry Mintzberg of McGill caused a stir in the business community by observing that the textbook version of how managers operate is a fantasy. Managers may pay lip service to planning and tables of organization, pointed out Mintzberg, but they actually function quite well in near chaos. In a subsequent article, he identified managers as holistic, intuitive thinkers “who revel in ambiguity; in complex, mysterious systems with relatively little order.” A record number of readers responded, most of them applauding Mintzberg's revelation. Professor Mintzberg has synthesized data from some evocative physiological brain experiments with his perceptions of management thought processes. Physiologists now believe that each hemisphere of the brain has special abilities. In most people (right‐handed ones) the right hemisphere controls conceptualization, intuition, synthesis, judgment. The left hemisphere employs logic, linear thinking, organizational abilities. According to Mintzberg, much of a manager's work involves such processes as following hunches in the midst of a chaotic problem‐solving process, and this indicates that managers have exceptionally well‐developed right brains. It is this “right‐brainedness” that makes great corporate strategists capable of epoch‐making leaps of conclusion. Planners and other staff aides, who Mintzberg says are left‐brained, are best suited to taking their direction from these masters of strategy and tidying up the logic in the aftermath of the conclusion. It's a rather startling concept of the planner's role, so Planning Review asked Professor Mintzberg to discuss his theories and define his sense of the true function of the planner in more detail.</jats:p>",

These themselves represent a range of spatial, structural, and dynamic economic characteristics of areas for which the data are recorded.

This paper demonstrates that zoning-system effects on parameter values and model performance are nontrivial, and that their magnitude is far larger than was previously thought likely. An approach which is most appropriate in an applied context, where there is also the problem of poor model performance, is to identify a zoning system which will approximately optimise model performance. The paper gives details of how this may be achieved. This method is demonstrated by a series of empirical studies. Finally, there is a brief discussion of the general implications for spatial model building. </jats:p>",

The exercise allows participants to explore the interaction of health roles and the health system's interaction with the larger community system. Originally developed as an air pollution control exercise, it has evolved to be a game about communities and how they operate. In 1972, the Department of Health Education, and Welfare funded the Center for Multidisciplinary Educational Exercises (COMEX), of the University of Southern California to modify Metro-Apex for use with health service planners, health care administrators, and students in programs leading to these positions. The game runs in several rounds of from three to eight hours for groups of from 40 to 120 persons. Used in both educational and training settings, Metro-Apex is found to be a flexible addition to the health educator's tools. </jats:p>",

This incommensurability problem is generally referred to as the multiple objective problem and leads to the notion of tradeoffs. Various approaches to calculating tradeoffs in water resource development have been advocated by several authors. Many have made errors in the context of the conceptural model presented in this paper. It is argued the correct framework for tradeoff analysis is the neoclassical economic model. The relevant tradeoffs, then, are really price ratios. These, in turn, must be calculated in such a manner as to allow comparison of product mixes where the expenditure on resources is the same. This is where several authors have erred. An empirical example which illustrates the correct application of the model is presented.</jats:p>",
