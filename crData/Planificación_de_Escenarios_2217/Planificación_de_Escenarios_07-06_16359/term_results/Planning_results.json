These models address two key policy concerns of housing providers: setting priorities for investments among a variety of affordable housing programs, and choosing locations and configurations for particular affordable housing initiatives. This paper also incorporates elements of location-design models to address various programmatic and physical attributes associated with affordable housing. Computational results based on a case study demonstrate the potential of these models to generate affordable housing strategies that are flexible, meet affordable housing ‘gaps’, and address social benefits and fairness concerns concurrently. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In settler societies such as Australia, the colonial state actively produced its territory to secure it from its former Aboriginal owners. Imperial spatial technologies, including exploration, surveying, mapping, (re)naming, and classification of land and its potential uses, were the primary means of this activity. These were the early foundations of planning as a form of state-based action to secure the ordering of space, the production of knowledge about space, and the organizing of action within space. Through an examination of contemporary environmental planning and its historical roots, this article shows how planning practice continues to be structured by specifically colonial imaginings of place, which serve to continue the erasure of Aboriginal philosophies, knowledge, and relationships with place. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Federal agencies are responsible for the cleanup of thousands of toxic sites in the United States and increasingly rely on Community Advisory Boards (CABs) to provide public participation in cleanup decisions. CABs, designed to function as collaborative and deliberative participatory mechanisms, have the potential to enhance democratic decision making. This study seeks to identify whether they successfully provide for two-way communication between agencies and the public, and to explore potential differences between CABs sponsored by military and civilian agencies. The analysis is based on a general model of information and feedback flows and consists of five comparative case studies of CABs sponsored by the EPA, DOD, and DOE. It focuses on communicative processes recorded in meeting minutes, interviews with participants, and surveys of nonparticipants. The study shows that CABs do not necessarily provide effective deliberative mechanisms: participation is limited by the lack of public awareness of participatory opportunities, CABs emphasize one-way agency-to-CAB communication, and public input does not significantly influence agency decisions. The military culture of secrecy appears to hinder participation at some sites, although the case-study approach and differences between boards do not allow broad generalizations about interagency differences.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> A prominent part of current debates on sprawl involves the relationship between schools and communities. Two key questions on this issue are to what extent considerations about community growth and development influence school boards as they decide, first, whether to renovate an existing school or build new and second, if building new, whether to site the new school in an urban or exurban location. Research on these questions to date has relied largely on case study or anecdotal analysis and has yielded a variety of recommended policy reforms. This paper presents the results of a systematic statewide study of local school board decision making in Michigan. Based primarily on a survey of school district superintendents and a parallel survey of local government officials, along with review of demographic data and selected local plans, the study was designed to test a number of assertions commonly made in the literature about factors influencing school board decision making. The findings suggest that school boards, in general, are influenced most by a sense of competition with neighboring districts and by shifting demographics. Moreover, little meaningful coordination is occurring between school districts and local governments, largely because of the institutional arrangements that shape the school board decision-making process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The usefulness of the informal sector and the survival strategies approaches for understanding African urban economies has been undermined by the transformations in urban livelihood strategies brought about by the continent's economic crises and neoliberal economic reform policies. Contemporary livelihood strategies in many African cities involve participation in multiple economic activities, usually in both the formal and informal sectors. This paper proposes the “multiple modes of livelihood” (MML) approach as a framework for capturing this emerging livelihood strategy and presents evidence to show the magnitude of the strategy and the kind of activities undertaken. Development and planning implications of this strategy include the following: i) planning theories must reflect the changing livelihood in African cities; ii) the different geographies of such activities within and between urban areas, the proliferation of home-based enterprises in the middle- and professional-class neighborhoods, the emergence of nontraditional household arrangements, and the importance of urban agriculture suggest the need to indigenize urban planning in Africa; and iii) the proliferation of multiple livelihood strategies, especially among public sector employees, has significant implications for national development, especially as it relates to the performance of the public sector. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This study reports on a survey of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in the USA to collect information about spatial data transformation, a geographic procedure used to convert data from one set of zones (system A) to a different set of zones (system B), where systems A and B have incompatible zone boundaries. The survey reveals that 60% of MPOs perform spatial data transformation more than once per year, usually using the simplest, most error-prone methods. Given a lag in application of new GIS techniques among planners, it is perhaps not surprising that practising planners tend to favor simpler methods of spatial data transformation, despite the widely documented shortcomings of such techniques in the literature. These findings suggest that the gap between research and application in the utilization of GIS in planning practice will require both more advanced training of planners using GIS, and, perhaps more importantly, greater sophistication among the ‘consumers' of GIS planning analyses—non-GIS planners, public officials, and the general public. </jats:p>",

The aim is to enhance realism in the expected results of communicative planning. Hard trade-offs must be made, as manipulation and exclusion cannot be eliminated from democratic processes while other desirable qualities are retained. Demand-revealing schemes can remove citizens' motives to misrepresent their preferences for public goods and “free-ride” on others' contributions. However, the planners designing these schemes might have motives to behave opportunistically and collect too much money for administering the system. Two proposals for reducing this surplus and correcting the demotivating effects of its collection are studied. Results show that new participatory planning bodies are required to make amendment procedures work. Hence, some efficiency problems in public goods provision can be solved by expanding dialogue. This reveals a noteworthy common interest between communicative planners and economists. </jats:p>",

With nearly 80% household broadband penetration in 2004, Seoul surpassed global cities and ‘technopoles' in speed and comprehensiveness in embracing broadband technology. In this paper I describe the physical development of Seoul's broadband infrastructure and its frequent intersections with daily urban life. As the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the world, Seoul offers a unique case for investigating the intersection of telecommunications policy, development, and culture in large metropolitan regions, as well as the everyday implications of pervasive computing. It also highlights emerging challenges and opportunities presented by the rapid and widespread deployment of digital network infrastructure. </jats:p>",

Significantly, these debates are being played out in different ways in different parts of the post devolutionary UK state. The approach adopted here engages with and develops existing work on state restructuring and sociopolitical rescaling. In doing so we bring struggles over spatial planning to the centre of the analysis, addressing calls for increasing integration across different sectoral policy domains. </jats:p>",

The results suggest that while the spatial pattern of household income became more decentralized and less clustered during the 1990s, the patterns established as of 1990 were highly persistent over the decade. Factors associated with metropolitan area size and growth affected changes in both the degree of centralization and the degree of clustering. Although traditional determinants of suburbanization were associated with increases in income decentralization during the 1990s, densely developed cities with an increase in the percentage of white residents saw increases in income centralization during the decade. Furthermore, changes in the patterns observed were shaped by various policy influences, including the number of Low Income Housing Tax Credit units, urban containment policies, and the degree of local government fragmentation. </jats:p>",

These attempts to embody local feeling in patterns of development are illustrative of the increasing prevalence of a sense of risk in contemporary society. The spatial patterns of risk are also revealed, which owe much to the presence and distribution of industrial infrastructure in the landscape and to the associated contested use of land. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Female genital cutting (FGC) and HIV/AIDS are both highly prevalent in sub‐Saharan Africa, and researchers have speculated that the association may be more than coincidental. Data from 3,167 women aged 15‐49 who participated in the 2003 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) are used to test the direct and indirect associations of FGC with HIV. Our adjusted models suggest that FGC is not associated directly with HIV, but is associated indirectly through several pathways. Cut women are 1.72 times more likely than uncut women to have older partners, and women with older partners are 2.65 times more likely than women with younger partners to test positive for HIV. Cut women have 1.94 times higher odds than uncut women of initiating sexual intercourse before they are 20, and women who experience their sexual debut before age 20 have 1.73 times higher odds than those whose sexual debut comes later of testing positive for HIV. Cut women have 27 percent lower odds of having at least one extra‐union partner, and women with an extra‐union partner have 2.63 times higher odds of testing positive for HIV. Therefore, in Kenya, FGC may be an early life‐course event that indirectly alters women's odds of becoming infected with HIV through protective and harmful practices in adulthood.</jats:p>",

In this paper we characterize the resulting hybrid space as DigiPlace—that is, the use of information ranked and mapped in cyberspace to navigate and understand physical places. We review relevant theories of hybrid combinations of physical and virtual space, how software (code) automatically produces space, and how the politics of code (particularly map generating code) shape the representation of places. The paper concludes with a case study of the DigiPlace created by GoogleMaps that utilizes the same code which powers Google's index of cyberspace. A central argument advanced by the case study concerns how the interactions between culture, code, information, and place construct DigiPlace and shade perceptions of the places that are mapped. </jats:p>",

Numerous case studies of individual sustainable community development projects exist, although almost no literature describes the coordinated federal-level effort to create and implement a sustainable development policy from 1993 to 2000. Case studies of three prominent federal-level sustainable community programs are developed from twenty guided interviews and existing government documents. The analysis of these three cases reveals serious attempts to translate sustainability into federal programs and changes in agency cultures despite institutional barriers. Although the primary outcome of these efforts was a stronger framework for facilitation of planning at the federal level, it still remains unclear why planners were not more involved in this process.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Population‐based, cross‐sectional data from 3,587 ever‐married Ukrainian women aged 17–44 are used to examine the association between physical violence perpetrated by a sexual partner (defined as kicking, hitting, slapping, pushing, or attacking with a weapon) and sexual health knowledge, sexual behavior, and the likelihood of reporting a sexually transmitted infection (STI). Such violence, both past and recent, is found to be associated with increased lifetime risk of acquiring an STI. Women who have been abused by a sexual partner, whether in the past 12 months or less recently, are significantly less likely to use condoms currently, and are significantly more likely to report having had multiple sexual partners in the past year. Findings from the study indicate that physical violence perpetrated by a sexual partner is associated with risky sexual behaviors and increased risk of sexually transmitted infection in Ukraine, and may constitute a barrier to prevention of HIV/STI transmission.</jats:p>",

This article reports on a study of one type of HEF, based in Kirivong Operational Health District (KOD) and operated through local pagoda structures, which demonstrates minimal reliance on external funding and low administrative overheads. We utilize an adapted sustainability assessment framework to assess the ability of pagoda structures to enable financial access for the poorest to public sector health services.

Younger women were two times more likely than older women to have an STI. More empowered women were more likely to have any RTI. Women with six or more children were more than three times more likely to have experienced genital prolapse, compared with those who had fewer children. UTIs were significantly associated with urban residence, being empowered, and having six or more children. A comparative analysis with other countries in the Arab world showed some variations in prevalence and risk factors.

We suggest, given that life-logs have the potential to convert exterior generated oligopticons to an interior panopticon, that an ethics of forgetting needs to be developed and built into the development of life-logging technologies.

The first is planning uncertainty, the uncertainty of identifying tumor from the diagnostic images. This uncertainty may come from tumor's microscopic spread, the image distortion, etc. The second is delivery uncertainty. This includes setup errors, patient intrafraction and interfraction motions. The ICRU adopted a simple solution to the problem, adding hard margins to GTV to form CTV, ITV, and PTV. Margin improves tumor coverage but increases dose to OAR. Attempts have been made to discard the hard margin around CTV and incorporate the delivery uncertainty into the inverse planning and let the optimizer to decide what the best is for patient. However, the planning uncertainty was still handled with hard margins. In this work, we developed a framework that integrates both effect in the same model. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> We establish our study in the dose delivery coordinate system, each voxel has certain probability being tumor, and certain probability being OAR. This probability can be a result of setup error, organ motion/deformation, microscopic spread of tumor, or a combination of all the effects. For each voxel receive certain amount of dose, we calculate its contribution to objective function as tumor weighted by the probability of it being tumor and its contribution as OAR weighted by the probability of it being OAR. This objective function is used for inverse planning. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We proved that our framework is equivalent to previous approaches in handling motion uncertainty. Furthermore, our framework is more computationally efficient than previous approaches. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We developed a unified framework to handle planning uncertainty and delivery uncertainty inside the inverse planning process. This framework allows us to determine the optimized plan for patient with the consideration of all uncertainties. It is a better approach than simply adding a predetermined hard margin.</jats:p>",

The method utilized is the classical step‐down process which takes into consideration the entire set of direct and indirect costs borne by the hospital. Although this approach does not allow to estimate the economic cost of consultations, it is a useful contribution to assess the financial activity of the hospital and improve its performance, financially speaking, through a more relevant user fees policy. The study shows that there are possibilities of cross‐subsidies within the hospital or within services which improve the recovery of some of the current costs. It also leads to several proposals of pricing care while taking into account the constraints, the level of the hospital its specific conditions and equity.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although the current developments in ubiquitous and pervasive computing are driven largely by technological opportunities, they have radical implications not just for technology design but also for the ways in which we experience and interact with computation. In particular, the move of computation ‘off the desktop’ and into the world, whether embedded in the environment around us or carried or worn on our bodies, suggests that computation is beginning to manifest itself in new ways as an aspect of the everyday environment. One particularly interesting issue in this transformation is the move from a concern with virtual spaces to a concern with physical ones. Basically, once computation moves off the desktop, computer science suddenly has to be concerned with where it might have gone. Whereas computer science and human-computer interaction have previously been concerned with disembodied cognition, they must now look more directly at embodied action and bodily encounters between people and technology. In this paper, we explore some of the implications of the development of ubiquitous computing for encounters with space. We look on space here as infrastructure—not just a technological infrastructure, but an infrastructure through which we experience the world. Drawing on studies of both the practical organization of space and the cultural organization of space, we begin to explore the ways in which ubiquitous computing may condition, and be conditioned by, the social organization of everyday space. </jats:p>",

The results show that such radio programs in Malawi reach a broad audience: eight of the 12 programs were heard by at least half of the respondents, although women were less effectively reached than men. For both women and men, the radio programs were found to have a significant impact on family planning discussion with one's partner. The programs’effect on condom use was limited, however. A positive association was found with ever use of condoms, but no association was found with condom use at last intercourse. This limited impact suggests that such radio communication campaigns need to be informed by research identifying the specific constraints to current condom use in Malawi.</jats:p>",

Later conceptualizations utilize Iris Marion Young's view of social justice as an institutional condition that enables participation and overcomes oppression and domination through the achievement of self‐development and self‐determination. These two conceptual paths create a constructive argumentative tension that should underlie contemporary spatial planning in democratic societies. This means that, in order to contribute to more socially just urban societies, planning needs to be focused not only on patterns of distribution, but also on the relational social structures and institutional contexts in which these come about. Comprehensive and functionalist, mainstream planning in Portugal is unmistakably situated within the modernist planning project. We argue that the normative disposition of the identified argumentative tension undermines the theoretical capacity of modernist practices to achieve socially just territories. The aim of this article is to study the validity of this argument by analyzing the Portuguese planning system against a twofold set of social justice criteria.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Résumé</jats:title><jats:p>Les premiers recours à la justice sociale comme guide en matière de théorie et pratique de l’aménagement urbain s’appuyaient sur la tentative de David Harvey d’intégrer des aspects de justice redistributive dans les méthodes d’analyse géographiques. Plus tard, d’autres conceptions se serviront de la perspective d’Iris Marion Young sur la justice sociale comme condition institutionnelle permettant la participation tout en surmontant oppression et domination grâce au développement personnel et à l’autodétermination. Ces deux voies conceptuelles créent une tension argumentaire constructive qui devrait sous‐tendre l’aménagement spatial contemporain dans les sociétés démocratiques. Autrement dit, pour contribuer à des sociétés urbaines plus justes socialement, l’aménagement doit s’attacher, non seulement aux schémas de distribution, mais aussi aux structures sociales relationnelles et cadres institutionnels dans lesquels ses schémas opèrent. L’aménagement urbain portugais, conventionnel, général et fonctionnaliste, se situe immanquablement dans un projet d’urbanisation moderniste. Selon nous, la nature normative de la tension argumentaire établie entrave la capacité théorique des pratiques modernistes à aboutir à des territoires justes au plan social. L’article étudie la validité de cet argument en analysant le système d’aménagement urbain portugais en fonction de deux gammes de critères de justice sociale.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The magnet hospital concept offers some insights into HRM practices that are leading to high commitment. These have been shown to lead to superior performance in not only industrial business firms, but also service industries and the public service. The mechanisms that drive these practices include positive psychological links between managers and staff, organizational commitment and trust. Conditions for successful high commitment management (HiCoM) include health service managers with a strong vision and able to transmit this vision to their staff, appropriate decision spaces for healthcare managers and a pool of reasonable well‐trained health workers. For this, adequate remuneration is the first condition. Equally important are the issues of cultural fit and of ‘commitment’. What would staff expect from management in return for their commitment to the organization? Salary buys indeed time of employees, but other practices ensure their commitment. Only if these drivers are understood will managers be able to make their HRM practices more responsive to the needs and expectations of the health workers.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Axial analysis is one of the fundamental components of space syntax. The space syntax community has suggested that it picks up qualities of configurational relationships between spaces not illuminated by other representations. However, critics have questioned the absolute necessity of axial lines to space syntax, as well as the exact definition of axial lines. Why not another representation? In particular, why not road-centre lines, which are easily available in many countries for use within geographical information systems? Here I propose that a recently introduced method of analysis, angular segment analysis, can marry axial and road-centre line representations, and in doing so reflect a cognitive model of how route choice decisions may be made. I show that angular segment analysis can be applied generally to road-centre line segments or axial segments, through a simple length-weighted normalisation procedure that makes values between the two maps comparable. I make comparative quantitative assessments for a real urban system, not just investigating angular analysis between axial and road-centre line networks, but also including more intuitive measures based on metric (or block) distances between locations. I show that the new angular segment analysis algorithm produces better correlation with observed vehicular flow than both standard axial analysis and metric distance measures. The results imply that there is no reason why space syntax inspired measures cannot be combined with transportation network analysis representations in order to create a new, cognitively coherent, model of movement in the city. </jats:p>",

As one of the Special Economic Zones, Haikou is one of the fastest growing regions among all Chinese cities, owing to rapid real estate development. Using a GIS-based land-use dataset from 1986, 1996, and 2000, in combination with a lacunarity index, we attempt to quantify the spatial pattern in the Haikou metropolitan area. After the landscape structure changes over the periods 1986–96 and 1996–2000 are analyzed, a Markov conversion matrix is applied in order to study the sources and destinations of landscape dynamic changes. The lacunarity index is calculated in order to measure the landscape dynamics, with respect to several major land-use types, at a range of spatial scales. The findings indicate that the leapfrog development of real estate and the rapid economic growth of Haikou City have had a great impact on the dynamic landscape patterns. From 1986 to 1996 urban land expanded dramatically and clustered, while cropland was encroached upon and fragmented. From 1996 to 2000, after the government had implemented the strict cropland protection measures, urban expansion and cropland misuse were controlled to a large degree, and a lot of cropland was reclaimed in certain areas. We investigate the dynamic landscape pattern and process, and their implications in policy and economic development. </jats:p>",

This study analyzes data from a 2002 survey in six villages in rural Bangladesh to test the hypothesis that daughters of women with more education marry later and that daughters‐in‐law of more educated women initiate childbearing at a slower rate. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we find significant associations between the educational level of mothers and the age at marriage of their daughters and between the educational level of mothers‐in‐law and the timing of first birth among their daughters‐in‐law, although the association between the former attenuates when controlling for other variables. We also find that these associations do not appear to be mediated by the senior women's level of empowerment. We conclude that in rural Bangladesh there is a significant relationship between female education in one generation and the timing of marriage and childbearing in the next.</jats:p>",

The fields contain light but viscous paraffinic oils with wax appearance temperatures very close to reservoir temperature. As these were the first Fatehgarh discoveries in the region, no special core analysis (SCAL) information existed for the unusual oil-bearing rocks. A fast-track comprehensive SCAL program to determine wettability, relative permeabilities, capillary pressures, and initial and residual oil saturation was implemented within weeks of the first discovery. This data was critical to the design of waterflood patterns and facilities for these intermediate- to weakly oil-wet reservoirs.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The value of a comprehensive up-front SCAL program is clearly demonstrated. Although acquisition of the SCAL data cost ~US$5million, it played a crucial role in justifying a change in field development plans involving closer well spacing, higher injection volumes and larger surface facilities.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A statistically significant number of SCAL measurements were made on representative Fatehgarh samples. In general, reservoir rocks have the low initial water saturations (Swi~5%), long oil drainage tails and low residual oil saturations (Sorw&amp;lt;15%) typical of intermediate- to weakly oil-wet reservoirs (Amott-Harvey wettability index −0.33 ± 0.27). Early quantification of these characteristics by facies and their implementation into stochastic static and dynamic reservoir models were critical to development of a technically sound field development plan.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The 2004 discoveries in an industrially less-developed part of India are projected to be on production by 2009. Large fast-tracked investments in infrastructure and oilfield development were significantly shaped by the early acquisition of a comprehensive SCAL dataset. The data helped to optimize the different waterflood designs chosen for the different fields (pattern floods vs. edge line drives, well spacings, vertical vs. horizontal wells, etc.) and to quantify the expected oil and water production profiles from these very high-quality intermediate- to weakly oil-wet reservoirs.</jats:p>",

During that time, the committee discussed the meaning and importance of feminist strategic planning and created a distinctive process. After a period of data collection, the group collaboratively arrived at a plan to guide the association for the next five years. The process revealed important details about the organization's demographics and diversity; the balances between praxis and theory; individual activism and academic scholarship; and perceptions of the purpose of NWSA. Ultimately, the committee was significant not only for developing a feminist method for organizational planning, but also for generating a wealth of information that can serve as the basis for additional research on NWSA, Women's Studies, and feminism in the United States. The article discusses the implications of this information for NWSA, individual women's studies programs, and generating feminist theory.  </jats:p>",

Planning the railways for years, months, weeks or days ahead leads to substantially different problems; in this regard railway planning problems can be strategic, tactical, operational and short‐term. Another way to classify railway planning problems is based on their target: they concern the timetable, the rolling stock and the crew. Planning the structure and volume of the rolling stock is a key factor in achieving maximum efficiency of transportation by rail as well as forecasting the demand for these transport facilities. The demand for trains is a time‐dependant variable which in each case should be determined by two main approaches. The first method allows us to determine quantitative parameters of rolling stock (i.e. kilometers logged, efficiency, turnover, etc.). The second is based on specially developed mathematical models relying on qualitative characteristics such as relative expenses, efficiency of the particular train, relative expenditure of resources, cost of the trains, etc.\n\n\nPlanning the volume of the rolling stock the determination of optimal service life of the trains plays an important role. The calculations involve repair costs, number of overhauls, current expenses and operational characteristics.</jats:p>",

In well construction, ideally the operator wishes to be in a position to decide which of these alternatives is the most economic. Engineered solutions, designed to improve wellbore strength and reduce drilling non-productive time due to lost circulation, are directed at managing wellbore stresses (WSM). This fully engineered approach should include means to help prevent lost circulation as well as stop losses. Prevention of lost circulation by improving the wellbore strength is accomplished by designing and applying borehole stress treatments that increase the hoop stress around the wellbore.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The technology development within the industry that led to the applications of these concepts will be discussed. Proprietary hydraulic design software (HDS) can predict the equivalent circulating density (ECD) over an interval in one module, calculate the width of a fracture that may be initiated, and select and design a proper material and particle size distribution that can efficiently prop and plug that fracture in a second module. A third module then predicts the change in rheology resulting from the addition of the specialized lost circulation materials, which then is cycled full circle back to update the ECD calculations.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Contingency chemical sealant (CS) treatment applications are systems designed to react with the drilling fluid itself to create highly viscous and cohesive sealants in the wellbore that are displaced into the lost circulation fractures. Drilling-fluid-reactive systems are not dependent on temperature or pressure, thus removing a significant amount of placement uncertainty present with cross-linked systems.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>This combination of planning and application tools allows the operator to make decisions ahead of time during the \"drilling the well on paper\" phase as to which approach is the most economic – prevention (pay now) or remediation (pay later).</jats:p>",

Using them it is possible to calculate the optimum amount of resources taken from outside or financial expenses for separate operations but it is quite impossible to share internal resources between parallel operations. Instead of these models a new one is introduced. It combines relationships concerning sharing resources‐capacities and works dynamics and perhaps other ones that express the use of materials and funds, inventory control and so on. Non‐strict work precedence conditions may be used as well. The model as a whole slightly differs from the model of resource planning in complex industrial systems proposed by the author and retains its general properties, notably the form of optimality conditions. A decomposition method of the project optimum fulfillment is proposed.</jats:p>",

In regard to the nature of planning, both intern and novice teachers planned as a mental process, conceptualized and prioritized content, and utilized a daily or hourly planning approach.Interns differed from novices in the use of adaptation of lesson planning approaches.In regard to influences on planning, both interns and novices noted knowledge and experience, schedules, school administrators, facilities, technology, and resources, students, personality, and impracticality of planning methods. Further, intern teachers and novice teachers had unique influences on planning based upon their differing contexts, expectations, and teaching experiences.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I discuss Foucault's two recently published courses, Sécurité, Territoire, Population and Naissance de la Biopolitique. Foucault notes that he has undertaken a genealogy of the modern state and its different apparatuses from the perspective of a history of governmental reason, taking into account society, economy, population, security, and liberty. In the “Governmentality” lecture—the fourth of the first course—Foucault says that the series of the title—that is, security, territory, population—becomes “security, population, government”. In other words, territory is removed and government appended. And, yet, the issue of territory continually emerges only to be repeatedly marginalised, eclipsed, and underplayed. A key concern of the course is the politics of calculation which Foucault discusses through the development of political arithmetic, population statistics, and political economy. Explicitly challenging Foucault's readings of Machiavelli and the Peace of Westphalia, I argue that territorial strategies should themselves be read as calculative, with the same kinds of mechanisms brought to bear on populations applied here too. I therefore discuss how Foucault's discussions of political economy, the police, and calculation are useful in thinking the history of the concept of territory. </jats:p>",

However, in practice, plans were rarely implemented. A succession of contingent events left city officials caught between an immediate necessity for basic shelter and grand plans for quite different futures. This also revealed the tension between rationality as the goal of harmony between man and nature, and rationality as the means to get there. Many citizens believed harmony had in fact been destroyed by statist intervention. The revolutionary logic — supposedly natural laws framing rationality — appeared again after the end of the Soviet period. This time, however, the inverse resulted. The emergence of the market was retrospectively rationalized through the bureaucratic form as an inescapable result of historical determinism. </jats:p>",

In a simplified network configuration the well accepted COST-Hata model is considered to assess the path loss. It is shown that increasing the base station density will not generally raise the exposure but can rather help to lower it significantly. The exposure due to base stations is hardly affected by allowing a transmit power reduction at the base station for individual links. In contrast to this, it is demonstrated that transmit power control at the mobile station is a helpful means to lower the exposure efficiently.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>It was not too long ago when CT based treatment planning was reserved for the few patients that was critical to have volumetric imaging, and treatment verification was limited to planar films of mediocre quality from a megavoltage imaging source. Today, we use multi‐modality based planning (CT, MRI, PET etc) and we employ sophisticated imaging tools and techniques to verify the correct delivery of the treatment. Such imaging capabilities include electronic portal imaging devices coupled with megavoltage (MV) or kilovoltage (kV) x‐ray sources, MV and kV cone beam CT, ultrasound guidance, optical systems, MV computed tomography, CT on rails and others. The goal of any in‐room imaging device is to verify that the patient setup is accurate and in accordance to the treatment plan. While some modalities allow for pre‐treatment verification, others can also provide on‐treatment verification feedback. The choice of the modality to use depends largely on user preference but also on the investment the clinic is willing to make to purchase the necessary equipment. Nonetheless, image based treatment verification has become a necessary and valuable aspect of our clinical practice and is enabling us to become a lot more aggressive with the planning and delivery of radiation treatments. Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT) is undoubtedly the future of radiation therapy.</jats:p><jats:p>In this presentation we will discuss some of the most popular methods of imaging for treatment verification techniques.

The goals of imaging for treatment planning are to determine the boundaries and functional information of the tumor and critical normal structures.

In addition, dynamic information can be accurately quantified and incorporated into the treatment planning process through 4D imaging capabilities in CT and repeat MR imaging. Reducing motion artifacts allows improvement in tumor definition. Methods of reducing the interference of motion on image acquisition include suspending the motion, through voluntary or assisted methods, and reducing the imaging session length, through multi‐slice acquisition and parallel imaging. Optimizing imaging sequences and contrast enhancement and timing improves the ability to define the tumor.

The procedure has evolved significantly from a technology perspective with engineering advances yielding greater control of ice formation within the body as well as enhanced visualization. This, coupled with isotherm modeling and treatment planning, has resulted in the ability to accurately target tissue for cryoablation. The organ to which these advances are most often applied is the prostate. This is due to the prostate being a relatively difficult structure to treat. The passage of the urethra through the gland necessitates the use of multiple cryoprobes and the procedure is confounded by the sensitivity of adjacent structures including the neurovascular bundles, external sphincter and rectum. Even with these obstacles, modern prostate cryoablation has emerged both as a primary prostate cancer treatment option and as a salvage therapy following failed radiation therapy.</jats:p><jats:p>This lecture will review the fundamentals of cryobiology and the seminal work which established clinical endpoints. The technological basis of the procedure will be discussed including both fundamentals of cryoprobe design and compatibility imaging modalities.

It explores four interpretations of ‘activation’ in respect of pension planning and retirement policies. However, activation policies need to be carefully evaluated. Labour market demands and a political language that stresses the ‘pension crisis’ and the ‘dependency ratio’ have to be considered in relation to established rights. Thus whilst governments may seek to promote a model of welfare based on the ‘consumer citizen’, in which retirement choices are made by reflexive individuals, the constraints on choice need to be highlighted. These constraints are likely to be unevenly distributed with some social groups experiencing longer working lives, less choice, with more compulsion and with conditions attached to any pension rights they may claim.</jats:p>",

Only influenza A has ever been shown to have the capacity to cause pandemics. Currently A/H5N1, a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, is of particular concern. Outbreaks of this disease in birds, especially domestic poultry, have been detected across Southeast Asia at regular intervals since 2003, and have now affected parts of Africa and Europe. Many unaffected countries across the world are preparing for the possible arrival of HPAI A/H5N1 in wild birds and poultry within their territories. All such countries need to prepare for the rare possibility of a small number of human cases of HPAI A/H5N1, imported through foreign travel. Although it is by no means certain that HPAI A/H5N1 will be the source of the next pandemic, many countries are also preparing for the inevitable occurrence of human pandemic influenza.</jats:p>",

Drawing on Foucauldian governmentality studies, this paper explores how the spaces of ‘free trade’ are produced through neoliberal spatial and political imaginaries and material practices to construct ‘barriers to trade’ as objects of trade rules. These concepts are explored through a case study of rules of origin in PTAs, increasingly long technical footnotes to trade agreements that aim to sort hybrid flows of commodities and services into single nation-state categories. I argue that projects to create spaces of unimpeded trade reconfigure obstacles and barriers in new and sometimes unexpected ways. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Delivery of radiotherapy through hypoperfused pulmonary regions for lung cancer treatment has been shown to result in less pulmonary injury in a single prospective trial. This finding suggests a strategy for image‐guided radiotherapy utilizing physiological images in radiotherapy treatment planning for image guidance to avoid the irradiation of highly functional regions and minimize the injury and/or function loss following thoracic radiotherapy. Patients may have inhomogeneous lung function distribution due to tumor invasion of the airway and vascular structures and/or preexisting pulmonary diseases. Imaging studies have found the prevalence of these hypoperfused regions adjacent to the primary tumor from 43 to 74% in non‐small cell lung cancer cases. However, the current thoracic treatment planning practice has been primarily based on using anatomical information from the treatment planning computed tomography (CT). Therefore, the non‐uniform distribution of regional function of normal lung tissue has not been considered in the process of treatment planning. Imaging modalities that have been reported in treatment planning studies to provide image guidance to identify the highly functional regions include single photon emission computed tomography perfusion, <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp1591-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp1591:mp1591-math-0001\" /> hyperpolarized gas magnetic resonance ventilation, and 4D CT derived ventilation imaging. No prospective studies demonstrating improvement in outcome using these modalities for functional image‐guided radiotherapy have yet been reported. Strategies to incorporate functional image guidance include identification of highly functional regions by an expert for avoidance, automated segmentation of pulmonary regions with the highest function for avoidance, and optimization of functional metrics including the dose function histogram.</jats:p><jats:p>This lecture will provide an overview of the physiologic origins of the functional imaging methods, post‐acquisition processing, and strategies to integrated functional imaging into thoracic treatment planning.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Local control by radiation therapy relates directly to the dose delivered to the diseased tissue, but can be limited by the dose tolerated by adjacent structures. This axiom has guided clinical practice into a number of technological shifts over the past several decades. Intensity‐modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has emerged as an important means to achieve higher doses and to intensify treatment, while simultaneously decreasing the dose in normal tissues. However, the proximity of critical normal organs to disease and geometric uncertainties arising from organ movement continue to present significant challenges in some anatomical sites.</jats:p><jats:p>Advances in image‐guided radiation therapy (IGRT) permit more frequent soft‐tissue imaging in the course of treatment delivery, creating opportunities to enhance the accuracy and precision of treatment. A framework for considering image‐guidance strategies and their implications for treatment planning is required. For example, target localization can improve geometric accuracy in the <jats:italic>on‐line</jats:italic> setting; i.e., during treatment delivery. An <jats:italic>off‐line</jats:italic> statistical analysis of a patient's images can also enhance precision by supporting the adaptation of margins. Even a complete re‐optimization of the plan is possible, in response to systematic anatomical changes accumulated with the progression of treatment. Frequent re‐optimization is potentially inefficient and expensive, within the constraints of current technologies, clinical practices, and QA standards. Clearly, there are trade‐offs between the level of effort required to an exploit IGRT for <jats:italic>adaptive</jats:italic> re‐planning, and the potential benefits of re‐planning. The concept of <jats:italic>robust</jats:italic> optimization points to the possibility designing treatment plans that are tolerant to uncertainties in treatment delivery. Robust plans may reduce the need for routine re‐planning in response to variations in patient setup, organ movement, or progressive changes leading to organ deformation.</jats:p><jats:p>This presentation reviews clinical experience with IGRT, and explores the implications, opportunities and challenges for treatment planning in the era of IGRT.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the powerful relations between mental health and nature are explored with reference to past asylum horticultural practices and to contemporary community gardening schemes for people with mental-health problems in the United Kingdom. Through the use of archival evidence, alongside contemporary voices of experience, understandings of the therapeutic and social dimensions to nature work are outlined and deconstructed. It is argued that particular discourses concerning the powers of nature (work) in managing madness and mental-health problems are largely consistent across time and space (from the asylum to the community). However, in the contemporary era it is particular types of nature work that arguably contribute most directly to state agendas for social inclusion, and therefore to securing the place of people with mental-health problems in mainstream society. By briefly profiling the voices of staff and ‘volunteers’ from two urban garden schemes in England and Scotland, different experiences of garden work as ‘restorative’ and as ‘interventionist’ will be discussed. I conclude by evaluating how embodying and enacting gardening work act as a sustainable vehicle for new versions of social citizenship for people traditionally marginalised in mainstream society. </jats:p>",

Each city was the cultural and economic capital of its respective national community, because of which they were in continual contact and conflict in a manner that often muddied the nationalistically determined boundaries between them. I explore how, beginning with Tel Aviv's establishment in 1909, Zionist leaders deployed a narrative of progress and modernity versus tradition and stagnation to effect a discursive, and ultimately a physical, erasure of the Palestinian Arab population of the region surrounding both towns. I argue that such paradigms, and the ideologies that support them, are fundamental components of globalization, whether in the era of \"high imperialism\" when Jaffa and Tel Aviv's conflict began, or today. Next I move to the contemporary period and explore the intersection of globalization, tourism, and the liberalized market. I conclude by discussing how a \"spatialization\" of the contemporary Jaffa is crucial to understanding the continuing conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs, both within the borders of 1967 Israel and across the Green Line as well. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To develop software which both increases the comprehensiveness of the AAPM recommended treatment planning system (TPS) quality assurance and decreases the time required to complete it. <jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> The AAPM Task Group Report ♯40 recommends a monthly check of the “checksum” or a constancy check of monitor unit (MU) calculations for a subset of all possible beam configurations. An in‐house, Interactive Data Language (IDL) based software program was developed to perform the TPS QA. The program was designed to interface with the Pinnacle TPS to automate these tests. First, a Pinnacle script was developed to calculate a comprehensive set of beams configurations belonging to commissioned machines. After computation the 2×2×2 mm grid for each beam is automatically exported and saved. Second, the IDL software imports this dose grid and compares it on a voxel‐by‐voxel basis to the dose grid created after commissioning. Any nonzero deviation would direct the physicist to the specific beam parameters to check. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For each energy of each machine, the program exports a list of baseline, calculated and their percent difference for various field size and beam modifier combinations. The program is quite sensitive to beam data modification. A slight modification such as 1% change in MU or a 1mm shift in isocenter from their baseline configuration produced an identifiable change in the sum of the dose grid. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Our in‐house software successfully automates the TPS QA process. It maximizes the benefit‐vs‐cost ratio by providing a highly sensitive constancy check of the TPS beam data while minimizing physicist involvement.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The use of mathematical models to summarized clinical or biological endpoints with respect to the distribution of dose throughout an organ or tissue has great appeal. At its best, the overall cumulative effects of all parts of a heterogeneously irradiated object could be summarized in terms of a clinically relevant outcome such as a tumor control probability (TCP) or a normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Further, it could be anticipated that a treatment planner would want to incorporate such information directly into the optimization of treatment planning parameters.</jats:p><jats:p>Despite this appeal, integration of these concepts into mainstream treatment planning has been slow in coming. Parameterization of the models is conceptually simple, requiring input data consisting primarily of dose, volume and outcome information from groups of patients. However, uncertainties in accumulated total effective dose and differential irradiated volumes together with heterogeneities in biological responses can make these determinations difficult. At best, it has been possible to obtain broad “population” based model parameters for some organs and tumors for “groups of similarly‐treated patients”. In general, as used today, these models are not within themselves (i.e., without additional stratification factors) “predictive” of outcome for “individual” subjects, nor can their use be generally extrapolated to the treatment of populations with techniques that vary greatly from those originally used.</jats:p><jats:p>However, disclaimers aside, the appeal remains great, and real progress has been made. In this session we will present some of the basic concepts associated with the models. Examples will be given as to how the models accommodate the responses of different tumor types and so‐called serial and parallel normal tissues. We will show how (as currently used) implementation of the models in evaluation or planning generally first requires reduction of a complex dose distribution (or DVH) into an equivalent “uniform” total (or partial) object dose.</jats:p><jats:p>Examples where the biological models appear to work well to describe the response of groups of patients will be provided. Specifically, the use of NTCP models for planning the treatment of tumors surrounded by volume effect normal tissues will be demonstrated, as will the use of EUD to allow rational heterogeneous irradiation of target volumes.</jats:p><jats:p>Some technical details associated with the implementation of biological models into IMRT planning systems will be discussed. Since mathematical structures of biological models are nonlinear, an optimization algorithm that can explicitly handle nonlinear objective and constraint functions is important. We will describe various ways of incorporating the models into optimization problems.</jats:p><jats:p>This session will be concluded with a short survey of existing software tools that utilize the biological models for dose‐response data analysis, plan evaluation, and IMRT plan optimization.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1. Understand the basis and statistical nature of standard NTCP and TCP models.</jats:p><jats:p>2. Recognized that dose distribution reduction remains a basic component of their implementation and understand how this is accomplished.</jats:p><jats:p>3.

PET imaging shows focal and distributed regions of cancer and its metastases. Initial PET uses in oncology include diagnosis and staging, which are important for determining treatment decisions. Current PET uses now include target definition for radiation planning followed by PET‐based assessment of treatment. Hybrid PET‐CT devices are beginning to be used as radiation treatment simulators. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> F‐18‐labled Fluoro‐deoxyglucose (F‐18 FDG) is the most commonly used PET imaging agent. FDG shows regions of active glucose metabolism, such as local cancer, metastases, non‐cancer inflammation, and normal glucose use. Non‐FDG PET agents can be more specific in cell targeting (binding), and can image different aspects of tumor biology, like hypoxia (FMISO, CuATSM) and cell proliferation (FLT) <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> PET imaging has coarse spatial resolution compared to CT and MR. PET's clinical use is valued because of its great sensitivity for cancer detection. Voxel intensity and image fidelity depend on equipment design, patient size, anatomic site, and imaging study parameters. PET‐CT units enable CT‐based attenuation corrections and inclusion of CT information in a registered PET‐CT dataset. The Standardized Uptake Value (SUV) is a normalized intensity measure for quantitative indication of disease, and can be used to identify disease or possibly for target delineation, with certain limitations. While FDG remains the most promising agent for tumor detection, other, biologically more specific agents (e.g., FMISO, CuATSM for hypoxia imaging or FLT for cell proliferation imaging) might be more appropriate for target delineation and treatment assessment. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This course reviews PET‐CT hybrid scanning devices, uses of FDG and non‐FDG PET for oncology imaging, and quantitative aspects for PET‐based radiation target definition and treatment assessment. Example images demonstrate the potential contributions and limitations of FDG and non‐ FDG PET oncology imaging. This review course is intended for both imaging and radiation oncology physicists.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives</jats:p><jats:p>1.

In a seminal paper, Clark and O'Connor have argued against the ‘end of geography’ thesis and have used information-related factors to hypothesize a complex division of financial labour over different spatial scales. In this paper, the case of Amsterdam during the 1990s is used to test the validity of the Clark-O'Connor framework.

Yet, empirical evidence of the effects of zoning on land values has been conflicting. This paper empirically evaluates the panel data for a district in which two large-scale commercial properties have been developed in a comprehensive development area (CDA) statutorily rezoned from commercial/residential status on land taken by compulsory purchase by a public urban renewal agency in Hong Kong. A price gradient analysis is used to test the effects of such rezoning. The results show that the effect of the new CDA zoning on the prices of housing surrounding the CDA is uncertain. The Pigovian argument for the positive effect of zoning is therefore refuted as a justification for the zone under investigation, and the meaning of the finding for urban renewal planning is discussed. Some urban design factors that may have contributed to the failure of the projects are also discussed. </jats:p>",

It is argued that the object-centric view assists the domain developer in conceptualizing the domain’s structure, and we show how GIPO enables the developer to capture that conceptualization at an appropriate and matching conceptual level. GIPO is an experimental environment which provides a platform for exploring and demonstrating the range and scope of tools required to support the knowledge engineering aspects of creating and validating planning systems, both for classical pre-condition planning and hierarchical planning. GIPO embodies the object-centric view, leading to a range of benefits typically associated with object-oriented methods in other fields of software engineering such as highly visual development methods, code reuse and efficient, reliable development.</jats:p>",

During a hospital's response to a nuclear or radiological emergency, medical health physicists may be asked to (1) evaluate the level of radiological contamination in or on incoming victims; (2) help the medical staff evaluate and understand the significance of the levels of radioactivity with which they are dealing; (3) orient responding medical staff with principles of dealing with radioactive contaminants; (4) provide guidance to staff on decontamination of patients and facilities; and (5) assist local public health authorities in monitoring people who are not injured but who have been or are concerned that they may have been exposed to radioactive materials or radiation as a result of the incident. Medical health physicists may also be called upon to communicate with staff, patients, and the media on radiological issues related to the event. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing guidance in the areas of radiological population monitoring, handling contaminated fatalities, and using hospital equipment for emergency monitoring. CDC is also developing training and information materials that may be useful to medical health physicists who are called upon to assist in developing facility response plans or respond to a nuclear or radiological incident.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Based on the voxel‐to‐voxel correspondence established by the registration, the electron density distribution of the CT images (this can be a diagnostic CT with patient positioned arbitrarily) is mapped onto the MRI and plan is computed based on the modified MR images, which take advantage of the useful features of CT and simulation MRI. To evaluate the accuracy of the MRI‐based dose calculation, six clinical cases, including three brain and three head‐and‐neck cases are studied. For each case, three IMRT plans are computed with the same beam configuration but different image basis: CT, MRI with mapped electron density, and MRI with voxel values replaced by that of water. The dose distributions from the three types of calculations are compared. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In all cases, the MRI with mapped electron density yielded very close dose values as compared with the CT‐based calculation. The maximum discrepancy between the two is found to be less than 2.0% in the high dose region. Compared to the MRI with mapped CT electron density, MRI with uniform water voxel value yielded quite different dose distributions in all regions, and the dose discrepancy can be as large as 3–5% for both brain and H&amp;N cases. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The MR images with mapped CT electron density yield very similar treatment plan compared with the CT‐based calculations. The approach has potential to eliminate simulation CT by planning a patient treatment with only simulation MRI and diagnostic CT data.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To demonstrate that accelerated partial breast brachytherapy using the elliptical MammoSite balloon requires a thorough evaluation of balloon geometry by use of volumetric imaging during the course of treatment, and may require adaptive planning. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Patient was implanted with 4cm×6cm elliptical MammoSite. CT scans were acquired and sent to treatment planning system (TPS). Balloon and CTV (balloon plus 1cm margin, excluding 0.5cm from skin) were contoured. Dwell positions were activated along the catheter. Dwell times were optimized to deliver at least 90% of prescription dose, 340cGy, to greater than 90% of the CTV. Dwell times and positions were used for treatment of first fraction. Treatment was to be delivered in ten fractions, twice daily. The patient was re‐imaged using CT prior to subsequent fractions. We evaluated the effect of using the original treatment plan for subsequent fractions. The repeat scans were sent to TPS for contouring and catheter entry. Dwell times and positions from fraction one were used to recalculate dose distributions on repeat scans. The resulting plans were compared to that from fraction one in terms of target volume coverage, skin dose (&lt;125% of prescription), volume of tissue receiving 150% and 200% of prescription dose (V150&lt;50cc and V200&lt;20cc). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Use of the first fraction plan for treatment of subsequent fractions led to acceptable target volume coverage, V150, and V200. However, skin dose increased due to gradual changes in balloon shape over the course of treatment. Subsequent fractions did require adjustments in dwell time to decrease skin dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> When using the elliptical MammoSite, the appropriateness of using the original plan for treatment of subsequent fractions depends on changes in balloon shape as well as volume, necessitating the acquisition of volumetric images prior to each treatment. Furthermore, volumetric imaging facilitates adaptive planning to account for these changes.</jats:p>",

This paper reviews post 11 September 2001, American planning activities and offers commentary on issues related to these plans. A critical issue is the need for as many people as possible to be aware of plans and preparations already completed and actions still necessary. There is a sizeable disparity within the animal agriculture sector about information known and understood at different levels. Several readiness exercises have highlighted the need for better broad-spectrum communication: communication within disciplines, within agencies, across disciplines, across agencies, and most importantly everyone involved must talk with industry at all levels. The best preparation involves close coordination between law enforcement, industry, governmental agencies at all levels, academia, risk managers and communicators, veterinarians, engineers, economists, game theorists, and others. This paper features issues related to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), highlights some of the lessons learned through these exercises, and discusses a plan of action patterned after the activities of a regional agricultural jurisdictional working group.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> A tacit assumption made in current inverse planning algorithms is that all points within a structure (target or sensitive organ) are equivalent, as reflected by the fact that the dose prescription, weighting factors and dose‐volume constraints are generally imposed <jats:italic>a priori</jats:italic> on a structure‐specific basis. This seriously limits the IMRT solution space and compromises the achievable dose distributions. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel IMRT inverse planning framework with a more general voxel‐specific penalty. <jats:bold>Methods:</jats:bold> Different from conventional inverse planning in which the same penalty (objective) function is used for all voxels, here we assign each voxel a penalty proportional to <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0917-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0917:mp0917-math-0001\" /> where <jats:italic>D<jats:sub>c</jats:sub></jats:italic> and <jats:italic>D</jats:italic><jats:sub>0</jats:sub> are computed and prescribed doses, respectively, and <jats:italic>n<jats:sub>i</jats:sub></jats:italic> is a voxel‐specific exponent. In this way, we “break” the implicit constraint that a structure is a mathematically uniform entity with all voxels having the same “identity”. The seemingly insolvable task of determining a large number of voxel‐specific {<jats:italic>n<jats:sub>i</jats:sub></jats:italic>} is dealt by heuristically relating them to the doses they receive. The optimization starts from a uniform value of <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0917-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0917:mp0917-math-0002\" /> and, during the iterative optimization process, the <jats:italic>n<jats:sub>i</jats:sub></jats:italic>'s are treated as parts of the system variables and are updated together with the beamlet weights. If a voxel is overdosed, for example, it means that the voxel is not penalized sufficiently and the algorithm will automatically increase the value of <jats:italic>n<jats:sub>i</jats:sub></jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>vice versa</jats:italic>. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> A voxel‐dependent penalty scheme is established for IMRT inverse planning. The formalism properly models the intra‐organ tradeoff and allows the optimizer to access solutions that would otherwise be inaccessible. Our phantom and clinical head‐and‐neck case studies show that much superior treatment plans can be obtained as compared with the conventional approaches. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Voxel‐based penalty scheme leads to substantially improved IMRT dose distributions and allows us to maximally utilize the IMRT technology.</jats:p>",

However their clinical use has not been available to many tertiary care centers because of lack of support in paradigm generation, presentation and post processing. Recently, technical advances in 3.0 T clinical MRI scanners, paradigm presentation/post processing, and available medical physics support have made fMRI achievable for clinical MRI settings. The purpose of this study is to utilize 3.0T fMRI study for clinical neurological surgical planning in a tertiary care setting. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> All clinical fMRI are done on a 3.0 T GE Signa scanner using an 8 channel head coil. IFIS/Brainvoyager (MRI Devices) is used for paradigm development/presentations and analysis. Visual, verb generating, left/right motor, passive listening, rhyming, semantic paradigms/protocols are developed for clinical fMRI. Post processing of BOLD fMRI data on the scanner console (Brainwave) communicates with paradigm generating PC directly. Real‐time BOLD fMRI post processing is done with Brainwave (GE Medical Systems). Additional post processing, including 3D rendering of functional activation mapping of the brain, are done on the scanner console using Brainwave, or Brainvoyager on a standalone workstation. DTI is acquired and post processed using Functool MR tractography (GE Medical Systems) for fiber tracking. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> 15 clinical patients have been scanned using both BOLD fMRI and DTI for neurological surgical planning. Diagnostic results from 3.0T fMRI scan had significant impact on the planning of neurological procedures. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Clinical fMRI at 3.0 T has been successfully implemented in a tertiary care center for neurological surgical planning. With the technical advances in clinical 3.0T scanner, paradigm software/hardware options, and medical physics support, fMRI is becoming robust and increasingly available for routine clinical use.</jats:p>",

Though often critical of the tenets of poststructuralism, Marxist geographers have responded with enthusiasm to the imperative that we denaturalize the body, and have demonstrated a capacious store of resources available to this task. Building on recent efforts by geographers to conceptualize a Marxist theory of the body, this paper moves in two directions. Aligning myself with those interested in demonstrating the constructedness of the body, I begin by arguing both that the notion of bodies-as-produced is latent in historical materialism and that we can employ our insights about the production of space in order to think about the production of bodies. I then turn away from this discussion of the production of bodies and consider whether there is, in the bloodline of theoretical Marxism, any notion of the natural body with which we must contend. I argue that evidence of such a body can be found both in deliberate treatises on the subject and in the work of at least one scholar for whom the body was not an explicit object of study. These investigations, moreover, suggest that historical materialism implies not only the production of bodies but also what presupposes and enables this production. I conclude by considering some of the implications of subscribing to a historical materialist theory of the body. </jats:p>",

Particular focus will be applied to the actual and potential clinical impact of MC dose calculation algorithms on patient treatments. Following a brief description of the integration of MC algorithms with commercial planning systems, MC dose re‐calculation results will be compared with plans computed using the conventional commercial treatment planning system algorithms. Specific patient examples where MC computed doses differ significantly from those computed with standard treatment planning system algorithms will be presented, with the causes of the dose discrepancies identified. With this background, the roles that MC has played in actual clinical practice will be described: as a QA tool to validate treatment planning system algorithms, as a QA tool to validate individual IMRT plans, and as a treatment planning tool to improve conformity between optimized and delivered IMRT plans. Strategies to minimize MC dose calculation time during IMRT optimization will be described.</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

Both target(s) and normal structures are considered. IEUD is calculated using the DVHs based on the original planning CT and the daily CT images. To demonstrate feasibility, we have calculated IEUD for selected representative cases in three tumor types: lung, head‐and‐neck and sarcoma, based on daily CT images acquired with a tomotherapy (HiArt, Tomotherapy) and a CT‐on‐Rail (Primatom, Siemens). The clinical target volumes (CTVs) and various normal structures were contoured on a series of daily CTs. The verification DVHs were generated by applying the original (or previous re‐planning) beam setups to the CT set of the day using either the XiO (CMS) planning system (for the patients treated with the Primatom) or the tomotherapy Planned Adaptive software (for those treated with Tomotherapy). <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Significant inter‐fractional anatomic changes were observed on all selected cases, and these changes can be quantified by the values of IEUD. For a soft‐tissue sarcoma at chest, for example, the CTV in the middle of the treatment was found approximately doubled from that on the planning day. Such dramatic volume changes resulted in significant decreases in the CTV coverage (95 reduced to 30%), the IEUD value dropped by 15.6% (compared to that of the original plan), indicating the necessity for re‐planning. Conclusions: Dramatic anatomic changes may be observed during the treatment. The presently proposed EUD‐based indicator, capable of quantifying such changes, can be used to trigger re‐planning for IG‐ART.</jats:p>",

The prostate is delineated on all scans three times by each of three observers. The intersection and union contour of each scan by each observer are computed. The prostate contours from the FBCT scan are mapped onto the daily CBCT scans. Three margin strategies (3 or 5 mm expansions about the intersection and 2 mm expansions about the union of the prostate contours) are used to create three PTV's. The three PTV's from each CBCT are used to create 3D plans. Geometrical overlap (FBCT contours to CBCT contours), FBCT prostate contour coverage by the CBCT plans, rectal and bladder dose indices are evaluated on each CBCT. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The average overlap of the FBCT prostate with CBCT PTV's (with 2 to 5 mm margins) range from 92% to 98% with average coverage of the FBCT prostate contours of 93% to 98% of the prescription dose. FBCT prostate contours may extend in some regions up to 5 mm at the base and apex of the unexpanded CBCT prostate for some cases (possibly due to interfraction prostate deformation). However, 3D plans using PTV's resulting from 3mm (L/R and A/P) and 5mm (S/I) margin expansions cover the FBCT prostate contours with more than 95% of the dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> 3DCRT, CBCT‐based planning of localized prostate carcinoma should include a 2–5 mm expansion of the prostate contour to correct for contouring uncertainties, based on comparisons to FBCT‐based planning. This result includes the influence of transient prostate deformations between imaging sessions and CBCT imaging uncertainties, but does not include intra‐ and inter‐fractional motion considerations.</jats:p>",

Nevertheless, inward investment promotion remains a common component within the economic development strategies of UK peripheral regions. In particular, capturing the potential positive labour market contributions offered by flagship projects has been used by policymakers to legitimate the continued pursuit of inward investment. In this paper I move beyond the static analysis of employment outcomes of investment episodes by investigating the detailed structure of labour-market processes and imprints across workforce formation and dissolution. I use the example of the fluctuating and youthful history of the semiconductor fabrication industry in the old industrial region of the North East of England to illustrate the spatial, occupational, and sectoral labour-market imprints of investment episodes. Using the example of two large-scale high-technology inward-investment projects, Fujitsu and Siemens, I expand our understanding of both the labour-market dynamics associated with volatile flagship investment and the policy implications for peripheral regions.</jats:p>",

When multiple gestures are combined in the conventional method, continuity or matching at the motion level is not considered. As a result, a machinelike impression is produced, such as a return to the upright position each time a gesture is performed. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a method of composite gesture generation which considers continuity of motion and linkage of gestures and generates more natural conversational motions. As the first step in the proposed method, two different networks that represent the continuity and linkage of gestures are constructed. Then the combinations of gestures which are likely for a given conversational sentence are expanded as a tree, and a plan for the series of conversation motions is generated by evaluating the conversational content and gesture continuity. In the proposed method, composite gestures can be generated with allowance for continuity of motion. Consequently, more humanlike conversational motions can be generated while preserving gestures which are important in transmitting the semantics of the conversation, such as nodding while pointing, or scratching the head with one hand while placing the other hand on the hip. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose of this work is to develop an automated optimization tool to eliminate MTEM. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A software package with GUI was developed with Matlab to interface with a commercial planning system (XiO, CMS). The package is capable of (1) accepting inputs of structure contours, prescription, 3D dose maps for each of 16 possible beams (two beam angles, two beam energies, open and 60 degree wedge with anterior, superior and inferior wedge orientations) from XiO, (2) optimizing beam weights to achieve uniform target dose and dose‐volume constraints for critical structures, and (3) outputting optimized beam weights into XiO for final dose calculation. The dose distributions and dose volume histograms generated with the package for five representative whole‐breast irradiation cases are compared with those generated from MTEM by experienced dosimetrists. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> All plans generated by the automated optimization package are equal to or better than those generated by MTEM in terms of their target dose uniformity and normal tissue sparing. Ratio of the uniformity index for the optimization plan and that for the manual plan ranged from 1.0 to 1.04. The average time for the optimization is approximately 15 minutes on a Pentium‐4 3 GHz CPU. The entire process for generating a plan with the automated optimization is about four times faster than MTEM with an experienced dosimetrist. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> A computer automated package that is capable of generating optimized 3DCRT dosimetry plan for breast irradiation is developed. It can generate plans equal to or better than those generated with MTEM but with significantly reduced time and effort. The optimization package is being implemented in the clinic.</jats:p>",

I conclude that so far issues of terrorism and national security have trumped concerns about public access on the National Mall.

The area of dosimetry is an important and basic fundamental concept to be acquired during residency, and pertinent educational tools are few and far between. The purpose of this project was to develop a self-assessment tool to facilitate radiation therapy treatment planning for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We focused our learning module on basic dosimetric and NSCLC treatment planning objectives that radiation oncology residents will encounter during residency. Interactive questions incorporating objective-related concepts were then devised. Treatment planning program templates were developed using the Eclipse software application. Results: A web-based self-directed learning module was developed as the tool's delivery mechanism. The module's questions were divided into the following sections: Chest Anatomy, ICRU Concepts, Beam Modificators, Integrated NSCLC Treatment Plans, Systematic Treatment Planning Approach and Inhomogeneity Corrections. By answering questions via the module, learners receive immediate feedback, corrections and concept-related explanations. A variety of different question techniques were employed, such as multiple choice questions, open-ended questions and associations. Learners are prompted by the system to draw isodoses and volumes on the screen. Other tasks in the module involve identifying structures, setting treatment fields and analyzing dose volume histograms. The website is publicly available in both English and French at: http://www.radiol.umontreal.ca/radio-onco/ . Conclusions: This self-directed learning module is a complementary tool that will help residents gain a solid grasp of NSCLC treatment planning objectives. Other modules covering radiation therapy treatment planning for a variety of anatomical sites, as well as diseases at different stages will eventually be created and added to the website. This educational project aims to facilitate learning and understanding the concepts of treatment planning, according to the different types of cancer. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> A simplified helical‐tomotherapy independent planning system (SHIPS) has been developed for independent verification of the TomoTherapy Hi‐ART (TomoTherapy Inc. Madison, WI) treatment scheme and to provide an alternative method to produce helical tomotherapy plans. The SHIPS program is designed to be simple, so the program can run on a desktop PC, and straightforward, so the delivery scheme is intuitive. Presented here are relationships/equations SHIPS uses to produce delivery parameters and treatment sinogram. Methods and Materials:SHIPS requires the user to input the patient geometry and contours as geometric shapes, e.g. cylinders and ellipsoids. Simplifying the geometry makes the structures in the treatment sinogram more perceptible and speeds the contouring process. The user specifies pitch, field size, and prescribed dose. SHIPS calculates the couch travel length, the number of rotations, couch travel speed, MU, and time of treatment. The required rotation period can be calculated using the prescription, depth to a point of interest, and measured beam data (depth dose output factors, and profile data). The treatment sinogram is created using geometry information, treatment parameters, beam data, and the prescription. SHIPS treatment parameters are compared against values produced from the Hi‐ART system, forty plans are observed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The average deviation of the SHIPS calculated couch travel distance, time of treatment, couch speed, and number of monitor units to the Hi‐ART's values are, respectively, 0.08%, 0.05%, 0.37%, and 0.74%. Simulated imbedded targets(e.g. prostate) and external/convex(e.g. breast) are presented examples of SHIPS treatment plans. The SHIPS treatment plan calculation is less than 30 seconds. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> SHIPS bypasses the Hi‐ART's optimizer, producing independently derived plans. Running SHIPS in parallel with the Hi‐ART's treatment planner provides quality assurance of the entire treatment planning process. Additionally SHIPS can challenge how much inverse planning the Hi‐ART system requires and can be used for basic forward planning.</jats:p>",

Preliminary results from one patient plan showed that Pinnacle and Corvus systems give different results, where Pinnacle system gave a 3.6% higher D95% value in the pGTV and 3.7% higher in the pCTV. The maximum dose to the brainstem and spinal cord in Pinnacle plan were 7.3% and 3.7%, higher respectively.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Semantic computing addresses the transformation of data, both structured and unstructured into information that is useful in application domains. One domain where semantic computing would be extremely effective is evacuation route planning, an area of critical importance in disaster emergency management and homeland defense preparation. Evacuation route planning, which identifies paths in a given transportation network to minimize the time needed to move vulnerable populations to safe destinations, is computationally challenging because the number of evacuees often far exceeds the capacity, i.e. the number of people that can move along the road segments in a unit time. A semantic computing framework would help further the design and development of effective tools in this domain, by providing a better understanding of the underlying data and its interactions with various design techniques. Traditional Linear Programming(LP) based methods using time expanded networks can take hours to days of computation for metropolitan sized problems. In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely a capacity constrained routing planner for evacuation route planning which models capacity as a time series and generalizes shortest path algorithms to incorporate capacity constraints. We describe the building blocks and discuss the implementation of the system. Analytical and experimental evaluations that compare the performance of the proposed system with existing route planners show that the capacity constrained route planner produces solutions that are comparable to those produced by LP based algorithms while significantly reducing the computational cost. </jats:p>",

The workshop was part of a European research project studying the advantages and limitations of different participatory methods in the context of the Water Framework Directive. It involved policy makers, scientists, business representatives, and citizens from different parts of the island. On the first day, participants worked to envision a sustainable development future for the island and its water resources. Discussion was inspired by four alternative water development scenarios prepared by the organizers. Participants' vision statements emphasized a diversified development path and balanced water solutions. On the second day, participants worked to plan the actions needed to realize their common vision. The SW turned out to be a good method to initiate a multipartner dialogue, to include new stakeholders in the water policy debate, and to a certain extent, to promote learning between participants. On the other hand, it did not appear well suited to resolve conflicts and aid decisions in the face of scientific complexity and uncertainty. SW seems to be a good method for the “upstream,” preparatory, capacity‐building tasks of a planning process but not for the production of substantive decision outputs such as consensual agreements or action plans. The Naxos experiment also raised the centrality of framing, participant selection, and facilitation in participatory processes.</jats:p>",

While the cloud of uncertainty associated with defining and localizing targeted tissue has been realized for quite some time, standards for working with this uncertainty are hardly widespread. When looking at the range of variations in target position across a population, it becomes clear that there is quite a range for any given body site, with some patients exhibiting very small variations, and others at extremes far beyond the population mean. The ability to characterize individual patients early on in treatment permits modification of the population assumptions used in planning, providing potential benefit to a subset of patients. Making plans robust to expected variations, especially at the start of treatment, may further aid in this individualization process.

The first step solves an optimization problem which finds a single treatment plan which is close to a set of clinical aspirations. The results of this step are then used to determine mutually satisfiable hard constraints for the subsequent generation of the plan database.

For step‐and‐shoot IMRT plans, the delivery time of a treatment fraction is determined by the number of beam segments, and to a lesser extent by the total number of monitor units (MUs). The objective of this work was to study the segmentation efficiency of the new clinical Siemens KonRad inverse treatment planning system (TPS) and compare it to the CMS XiO TPS. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> For head and neck, liver and prostate cancer patients, step‐and‐shoot IMRT plans were designed using both CMS XiO and Siemens KonRad. Number, direction and energy of beams were the same in both systems. The plans were optimized to achieve the same clinical objectives concerning dose to the target volume and to the relevant organs‐at‐risk. The number of intensity levels were minimized until the clinical objectives could not be achieved anymore. DVHs, EUD, mean‐ and maximum‐doses were compared, as well as the number of beam segments and MUs. Finally the beams of each plan were delivered individually on a MapCheck device to verify the agreement between calculations and measurements to be less than 3%–3 mm distance‐to‐agreement. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Plans optimized with KonRad resulted in fewer segments and lower number of MUs and therefore reduced delivery time, while achieving similar dose distributions. CMS XiO plans exhibited a slightly steeper dose fall‐off outside the target volumes, however the difference was not clinically significant. DVHs to organs‐at‐risk were comparable. All calculated dose distributions passed the 3%–3 mm dose verification check. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Both commercial systems produce clinical similar plans. The sequencer of the KonRad system is more efficient, reducing the number of beam segments and therefore delivery time on average by more than 20%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Treatment planning should be based on a high fidelity representation of the patient's anatomy, as it will be at time of treatment. The imaging setup (couch, immobilization, alignment) should therefore be representative for the treatment situation. When basing a treatment plan on a single scan (which is current clinical practice), the optimal imaging strategy is therefore to create an anatomical model that is as close as possible to the “average” anatomy. For random organ motion, plan optimization can therefore be achieved by averaging the geometry of multiple scans (i.e., adaptive radiotherapy). For periodic motion it has been proposed to use a scan with the organs as close as possible to their time‐weighted average position — by selecting a single scan out of 4DCT. Using these methods, the systematic errors due to treatment preparation are minimized and the dose distributions will be very close to a full 4D planning (using all scans out of a 4DCT scan). Using image guidance some other error sources can be eliminated. However, even with image guidance there are residual errors: such as uncertainty in GTV and CTV delineation, in image registration, and in setup correction and uncertainty due to intra‐fraction motion. Currently, simple margin recipes are used to estimate the correct CTV‐PTV margin such that the net effect of all these uncertainties does not compromise the goal of the treatment: eradicate the tumor while sparing normal tissues. One should be aware, however, that the most simple margin recipes are based on many assumptions: such as Gaussian distributions, penumbra width in water, systematic error SD &gt; random error SD, and plans with a more or less uniform dose distribution. In case of image guidance for lung tumors all of these assumptions break down, and simple recipes typically will overestimate the required margin. Based on a more detailed analysis, it appears that the margin that can be used for hypofractionated lung radiotherapy can be very small (1 cm or less), even for large respiratory amplitudes (2 cm).</jats:p><jats:p>Educational Objectives:</jats:p><jats:p>1.

By estimating binary logit models of land conversion for selected counties in Maryland for both pre-smart-growth and post-smart-growth time periods, we find that the governmental policy has generally been successful in achieving its objective. However, there are significant variations across local counties in terms of policy effectiveness. Planners must pay much closer attention to these interjurisdictional differences in the effectiveness of smart-growth programs, examine the likely causes and consequences, and formulate strategies for making improvement. </jats:p>",

This study evaluates a more accurate approach of obtaining a full volumetric image set for patients that cannot be completely imaged within the available field of view. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Two laterally shifted CT scans of an anthropomorphic pelvic phantom with fiducial markers were acquired, each simulating the CT scan of a large patient with missing anatomy resulting from the limited FOV. A complete scan of the phantom was also performed for comparison purposes. In the TPS, an empty phantom image set was created with very large FOV. Both shifted scans were fused with this image set by aligning the point intersected by the fiducial markers on the CT image to the Dicom origin of the empty set. All the contours can be copied from the CT scans into the empty image set, to provide a complete fused contour set. This method was evaluated by comparing a 3 field plan created on the fused contour set with a similar plan on the complete scan. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The contour set was successfully fused into the empty image set. Partial scan of the phantom can be overlaid inside the contour set to permit visualization of the anatomy. The differences between the two plans in the SSDs for the AP, RtLat, and LtLat fields were 4.0, 1.0, and 1.0 mm, respectively, and the differences in isocentric doses for these fields were 0%, 0.7%, and 0.2% respectively. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Entire patient contours for large patients can be accurately contoured by fusing multiple CT scans, each acquired with different patient positioning. This will allow obtaining accurate 3D dose distribution and DVH for target volumes and critical structures.</jats:p>",

The optimization problem consists of determining the capacities for each time interval that maximize a utility function over the entire time horizon, finite or infinite, where rewards gained from servicing customers are offset by penalties associated with deploying capacities in an interval and with changing capacities among intervals. We derive a state-dependent optimal policy within the context of a particular limiting regime of the optimization problem, and we prove this solution to be a symptotically optimal. Then, under fairly mild conditions, we prove that a similar structural property holds for the optimal solution of the original stochastic optimization problem, and we show how the optimal capacities comprising this solution can be efficiently computed.</jats:p>",

In this paper we explore, first, the role of the past and practices of commemoration in unagreed societies such as Northern Ireland in which consensus appears an unlikely proposition, the focus being on inclusion and exclusion and on the role of the contested nature of a hierarchical victimhood in commemoration. Second, the discussion engages with a succession of interconnected ideas that define the spatiality and landscapes of commemoration and considers the practices and spatialization of commemorating the Troubles within the grounded reality of everyday life and within the pragmatism of politics in Northern Ireland. We argue that processes of remembering and forgetting the dead of the Troubles point, at best, to a democracy shaped by ‘conflictual consensus’, in which the contested heritage of victimhood both constitutes an important resource in ethnonationalist and ethnosectarian politics and undermines the consociational Belfast Agreement and its attempt to elide the burdens of the past. </jats:p>",

We present a duopoly model in which retailers choose prices and variety level in each category and consumers make their store choice between retail stores and a no-purchase alternative based on their utilities from each category. The common practice of category management (CM) is an example of a decentralized regime for controlling assortment because each category manager is responsible for maximizing his or her assigned category’s profit. Alternatively, a retailer can make category decisions across the store with a centralized regime. We show that CM never finds the optimal solution and provides both less variety and higher prices than optimal. In a numerical study, we demonstrate that profit loss due to CM can be significant. Finally, we propose a decentralized regime that uses basket profits, a new metric, rather than accounting profits. Basket profits are easily evaluated using point-of-sale data, and the proposed method produces near-optimal solutions. </jats:p>",

Madison, WI) treatment scheme and to provide an alternative method to produce helical tomotherapy plans. The SHIPS software is designed to be simple, so the program can run a desktop PC, straightforward, so the delivery scheme is intuitive, and streamlined, to speed the treatment planning process. Treatment plans created with SHIPS may be used in cases where the Hi‐ART's inverse planner may be unnecessarily complex. We present the design of SHIPS and compare its results against forty Hi‐ART treatment plans. Several SHIPS derived tomotherapy plans are presented. Methods and Materials:SHIPS produces a treatment delivery scheme based on patient geometry and contours, prescription, delivery settings (e.g. pitch, field size, and modulation factor), and measured beam data. SHIPS calculates a leaf‐sequencing pattern (a treatment sinogram), gantry rotation period (<jats:bold><jats:italic>GRP</jats:italic></jats:bold>), couch speed (<jats:bold><jats:italic>CS</jats:italic></jats:bold>), couch travel length (<jats:bold><jats:italic>CTL</jats:italic></jats:bold>), monitor units (<jats:bold><jats:italic>MU</jats:italic></jats:bold>), and time of treatment (<jats:bold><jats:italic>T</jats:italic></jats:bold>). Treatment plans used to compare against SHIPS consist mostly of prostate patients with some head and neck, pelvis, lung, and phantom cases. SHIPS is used to create example prostate, breast, and brain treatments. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> SHIPS can produce conformal tomotherapy plans for imbedded (i.e. prostate), distal/convex (i.e. breast), and large/shallow (i.e. brain) targets in less than 30 seconds.

SHIPS can be used for quality assurance of the entire treatment planning process. Treatment parameters generated from SHIPS agree within 1% of the Hi‐ART values. SHIPS challenges the degree of which the Hi‐ART's complex inverse‐planning is necessary.</jats:p>",

If an influenza pandemic occurs, it is expected to have dire consequences, including millions of deaths, social disruption, and enormous economic consequences. The Department of Health and Human Resources plan, released in November 2005, clearly affirms the threat of a pandemic. Anticipating a disruption in many factions of society, every segment of the healthcare industry, including nursing homes, will be affected and will need to be self‐sufficient. Disruption of vaccine distribution during the seasonal influenza vaccine shortage during the 2004/05 influenza season is but one example of erratic emergency planning. Nursing homes will have to make vital decisions and provide care to older adults who will not be on the initial priority list for vaccine. At the same time, nursing homes will face an anticipated shortage of antiviral medications and be expected to provide surge capacity for overwhelmed hospitals. This article provides an overview of current recommendations for pandemic preparedness and the potential effect of a pandemic on the nursing home industry. It highlights the need for collaborative planning and dialogue between nursing homes and various stakeholders already heavily invested in pandemic preparedness.</jats:p>",

Current artificial intelligence (AI) planners show impressive performance in many real world and artificial domains, but they all require the definition of an action model. ARMS is aimed at automatically learning action models from observed example plans, where each example plan is a sequence of action traces. These action models can then be used by the human editors to refine. The expectation is that this system will lessen the burden of the human editors in designing action models from scratch. In this paper, we describe the ARMS in detail. To learn action models, ARMS gathers knowledge on the statistical distribution of frequent sets of actions in the example plans. It then builds a weighted propositional satisfiability (weighted SAT) problem and solves it using a weighted MAXSAT solver. Furthermore, we show empirical evidence that ARMS can indeed learn a good approximation of the finally action models effectively.</jats:p>",

While it is possible to achieve similar solutions and desired dose constraints among most patients, there are some cases in which it is difficult, even after using different beam arrangements. Prostatic size and geometrical shape relative to normal tissue (rectum and bladder) and their overlapped regions attribute to sub‐optimal solutions. In this study, we analyze the volumetric information of prostate, bladder, bladder wall, rectum, and rectal wall to understand if some definitive conclusions can be drawn. We planned ten prostate patients with CT scans using IMRT. Each plan consists of five coplanar beams using 15 MV photon beams and similar dose constraints. Each plan was optimized to according to our protocols. Total dose for each plan is 79.2 Gy for 44 fractions. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We calculate dose volume histogram (DVH) for each organ for each optimized plan. We compare the V40, and V60 of rectum, rectal wall, bladder and bladder wall between each patient's plans using the ratio of the volumes of above organs to that of prostate. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> There is a complex relationship between the ratio of normal tissue organs and prostate. However, an overall trends exist that could be to used to reduce the treatment planning time based on what is achievable relative to standardized dose constraints. Among the more significant finding is the reduction of V60 for rectum and bladder as function of the volumetric ratios.</jats:p>",

Surveillance and monitoring have become sufficiently nuanced, granting the everyday bureaucrat powers of differentiation so as to allow certain money to remain fully mobile while other money is subject to increased tracking and suspicion. The war on terrorism finance is queried as an appropriate tactic in the effort to combat terrorism. I discuss the various facets of the discursive associations forged between terrorism finance hawala wire-transfer services and Islamic charities. Drawing upon Judith Butler's notion of ‘deeming’, I make linkages between discursive associations, sovereignty, and contemporary terrorism prevention practices. Finally, I extend David Harvey's theory of accumulation by dispossession to argue that the frameworks of accountability broadened by the PATRIOT Act and related provisions can be and are being mobilized to seize control of undesirable financial flows and to further US economic interests.</jats:p>",

This was motivated by AAPM Report 46 (Task Group 40), which recommends independent calculation of the dose at one point in a treatment plan. Several authors have suggested methods to independently compute doses for Gamma Knife® treatments. Our method takes a different approach by utilizing measurements of the dose‐rate for an array of points within a polystyrene anthropomorphic phantom while keeping each of the points at the center of the Gamma Knife® focus, and normalizing the measurements to the total source activity. Multiple measurements of the dose‐rates were taken along the Z and Y axes throughout the phantom. We have created a program using the computer code MATLAB which calculates the dose delivered to any point within the patient's skull. The program uses patient and treatment specific information from the treatment plan, as well as measured dose rates in the anthropomorphic phantom, to calculate delivered dose at selected points. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Validation of the program was initially performed using a CT of our anthropomorphic phantom that was used to create treatment plans. A maximum error of 2% was observed between point doses computed with our program to those by Gamma Plan. Patient treatment plans were also evaluated with the program, with an error no more than 4%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Our independent dose calculation method for the Gamma Knife® can be easily implemented into a PC based application and used to quickly verify treatment plans before treating patients.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To determine the optimal configuration of radiation detectors for monitoring a hospital entrance to prevent contamination by patients seeking treatment in the event of a disaster. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> A digital area monitor (LUDLUM, model ♯375‐30) with two NaI‐scintillation detectors (LUDLUM, model ♯44‐99) was purchased for each entrance to the hospital. The counts of the detectors are summed and two radiation levels were set to trigger an audible and visual alarm. The sensitivity of the two‐detector combination was measured with a 10 μCi Cesium‐137 source as a function of detector configuration and source position. The configurations evaluated included placing the two detectors 1) with the end of the crystals facing each other horizontally and 2) over the entrance aiming downward. The detectors were then tested with the source moving at different speeds to determine system temporal response and the extent of traffic flow control needed. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Curves of iso‐sensitivity were measured that were bulbous in shape diverging from the face of the crystal. The sensitivity was sufficient to initiate the low alarm for the Cs‐137 source at a distance of about 175 cm in the collimated direction for a single detector. It was determined that for an opposed configuration separated by 10 feet or directly under an overhead mounted detector, an individual walking into the entrance at under 6.5 mph triggered the alarm if contaminated with 10 μCi of Cs‐137. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Utilizing these results and the dimensions of a hospital entrance it was possible to determine an optimized configuration of radiation detectors. For the main hospital entrance, which consisted of two double‐door entryways having a combined width of 129in., the orientation of choice was when both detectors faced one another horizontally. This orientation allowed the detectors to monitor the entire entrance reducing the possibility of radioactive contamination.</jats:p>",

A software platform called Automatic Post‐processing Tool for 4D treatment planning (APT4D) was developed using Matlab 6.5. Demons‐based deformable registration was performed to map the end‐exhale fixed phase (50%) to moving phases such as the end‐inhale phase (0%). The quality of image registration was evaluated by calculating the correlation coefficient slice by slice. Contours were automatically propagated into other phases using the deformation field computed from the image registration. Two indices (the volume intersection and the volume difference) from the manual contour were used to assess the quality of the contour propagation. The dose distribution of the moving phase was transformed to the common fixed phase and averaged with equal weighting factor. The 4D DMLC pattern was written by APT4D ready for the 4D delivery according to the 3D DMLC pattern for each respiratory phase. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The correlation coefficient ranged from 0.992 to 0.999 for the re‐sampled deformed moving phase image against the fixed phase image. Volume intersections between manual and automatic contouring were about 97% and 96%, while volume differences were around 2.5% and 3% for GTV and PTV respectively. Compared with individual phase dose distribution, dosimetric reductions for the spinal cord and total lungs were found for the 4D dose distribution. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> An integrated 4D treatment planning platform, APT4D, was developed and Preliminary test involving a thoracic dynamic phantom demonstrated that APT4D integrates the whole process of 4D treatment planning including deformable image registration, contour propagation, dose map transformation and MLC combination.

In the first two sections we trace the emergence of the networked European municipality from the ad hoc individual connections made during the final decades of the 19th century, through the golden age of municipal internationalism during the interwar years, to the intensive cross-national cooperation pursued in the aftermath of the Second World War. We argue that the historical experience of these municipal connections was an essential prerequisite of the long-term move towards the multilevel networking experienced by European municipalities today. In the final section we focus on Eurocities, the main European municipal lobby group since the late 1980s, to show how municipalities have continued to utilise networking as their main tool within a supranational Europe, in effect to reinvent themselves within a globalised postindustrial economy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Prioritized prescription optimization is a method of IMRT treatment planning which solves the optimization problem step‐wise, first by determining the best performance of a high‐priority objective and then converting it to a constraint as lower priority goals are optimized in turn. This system is fully automated; however, there is a variable value we call ‘slip’ factor which determines the amount of degradation allowed after each priority is addressed. The purpose of this work is to investigate an approach to automating selection of the slip factor. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> We propose a new version of prioritized prescription optimization that, after each step, estimates the desired value of the slip factor for the next step. We estimate, to first order, the rate of change of the objective function with respect to small perturbations in the slip. We then apply the Sensitivity Theorem to analyze the effect of the slip factor. In summary, after solving the first problem and obtaining the solution to the first step, <jats:bold>w</jats:bold><jats:sup>I</jats:sup>, we plug the value of <jats:bold>w</jats:bold><jats:sup>I</jats:sup> into a closed‐form expression of the Lagrange multiplier vector λ(0) to get λ(0), and then use the last element of λ(0) to compute the first‐order approximation model for the optimal objective value with variable slip. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We use the Sensitivity Theorem and Lagrange multipliers to derive a first‐order approximation model for the optimal objective function value for a given slip factor. On this basis, we propose to automatically select slip values based on the expected gain in the objective function. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> We have developed a mathematical theory and framework which allows us to automate the selection of the slip factor in prioritized prescription optimization, based on a local linear approximation.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Expansion of world economy brings changes in the way of thinking which can be seen in customers' demands. This directly influences the increase in demands at designing of a new or modifications of the existing products. Quality Function Deployment is a method directed towards revealing customers' wishes, which guarantees that these wishes have a positive effect on the product design and on the development of manufacturing process. Using and interpreting certain surveys of different types in the right way, additional advantages can be achieved in increasing of competitiveness in free markets. The most significant advantage is the possibility of using those specialists' expressions most often used by potential customers. Another problem of market experts and designers is translation from the \"language\" of customers to the \"language\" of quality characteristics. This problem is solved by using quality matrixes called the \"house of quality\" by Japanese. The \"house of quality\" is very appropriate and clear form of concise presenting of numerous data which refer to quality analysis, planning and decision making. Basically speaking the method of quality function deployment serves to improve customers' satisfaction with the product quality. What can this method contribute in comparison with already achieved results by using traditional methods in quality improvement? In this way the enterprise gets connected with its customers, and within the enterprise itself communication among different departments is improved so the new product has real chances to satisfy demands and needs of the customers. Taking into account that method of quality function deployment uses customers' demands as input data it means that the enterprise understands customers better and their understanding of product quality. Thus, even in the phase of planning, awareness of what should be done is raised in order to increase the degree of customers' satisfaction. Four-stage quality function deployment process in the automotive industry implemented and presented in the paper. A car represents a very complex product. A great number of parts, diversity of applicable materials, numerous and complex technology processes in manufacturing, on the one side, as well as a lot of demands from developed and less developed markets, on the other hand, make car manufacturing very complex in production, economic, and technological sense. Quality Function Deployment method can be used at designing of a new car, but also at solving of some of the existing problems. When carrying out reliability testing we came to the opening of the engine lid during driving the tested car. Taking into account that it was nonconformity which endangers traffic safety, the analysis of the stated problem was carried outimmediately. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Building on previously developed land is a top priority in Dutch compact-city policies. During the 1980s government grants supported building on these locations. In 1990 nonsubsidised housing accounted for only 5% of the housing programme for these inner-city sites. In 1995, as a result of the transformation of the welfare state in the Netherlands, the government abolished grants for the construction of social housing. This had a massive impact on the housing programme; and subsidies, as a proportion of the cost of infrastructure provision, dropped from 68% in 1990 to 30% in 2000. These changes have had a major impact on the role of municipalities and the powers they need to provide new housing on previously developed land. The municipalities' lack of powers and the new market conditions are contributing to the present stagnation of housebuilding in the Netherlands, and both of these factors influence Dutch compact-city policy. </jats:p>",

There is a long tradition of work in AI for developing planners that make use of heuristics that are shown to improve their performance in many real world and artificial domains. The developers of planners have chosen between two extremes when defining those heuristics. The domain-independent planners use domain-independent heuristics, which exploit information only from the ‘syntactic’ structure of the problem space and of the search tree. Therefore, they do not need any ‘semantic’ information from a given domain in order to guide the search. From a knowledge engineering (KE) perspective, the planners that use this type of heuristics have the advantage that the users of this technology need only focus on defining the domain theory and not on defining how to make the planner efficient (how to obtain ‘good’ solutions with the minimal computational resources). However, the domain-dependent planners require users to manually represent knowledge not only about the domain theory, but also about how to make the planner efficient. This approach has the advantage of using either better domain-theory formulations or using domain knowledge for defining the heuristics, thus potentially making them more efficient. However, the efficiency of these domain-dependent planners strongly relies on the KE and planning expertise of the user. When the user is an expert on these two types of knowledge, domain-dependent planners clearly outperform domain-independent planners in terms of number of solved problems and quality of solutions. Machine-learning (ML) techniques applied to solve the planning problems have focused on providing middle-ground solutions as compared to the aforementioned two extremes. Here, the user first defines a domain theory, and then executes the ML techniques that automatically modify or generate new knowledge with respect to both the domain theory and the heuristics. In this paper, we present our work on building a tool, PLTOOL (planning and learning tool), to help users interact with a set of ML techniques and planners. The goal is to provide a KE framework for mixed-initiative generation of efficient and good planning knowledge.</jats:p>",

Depending on the angles of delivery, treatment beams transverse varying thicknesses and densities of the frame. This leads to differential attenuation depending on beam angles. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The frame was first tested by measuring attenuation of a 6MV beam delivered over various gantry angles. An ion chamber was positioned in the center of the frame at isocenter. The dose was measured for various gantry angles, which were compared to the anterior beam (gantry 0°). In order to test the ability of Eclipse TPS to properly account for the frame, a solid homogeneous phantom was placed in the frame and then imaged with a CT scanner. Two plans were generated; one with the frame included in the external “Body” contour and one without. The plans were adjusted to deliver the same MUs. The phantom was then treated and the dose was measured at the isocenter. The measured doses were then compared to the two calculated plans. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The attenuation of the frame was found to be a function of the beam entry point and ranged from 4 to 9%. When the frame and phantom were contoured in Eclipse, the calculated MUs for each field agreed to within 2% of the measured dose. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The Elekta SBF attenuates the radiation beam and must be accounted for in planning. This can be accomplished in the Eclipse TPS by including the frame in the “Body” contouring. If the frame is not taken into account, it will result in an underdose of approximately 5% for each lateral and posterior field, ranging from 4 to 9%.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Current literature on Commonwealth war cemeteries has tended to analyze these spaces of memory either as loci of ‘personal’ mourning or as symbolic manifestations of ‘imperial’ identities. However, as the number of those directly related to the war dwindles, these memorials as sites of bereavement have become less relevant to a new generation. As former colonies break away from the former British empire, these sites as expressions of a landscape that is ‘for ever England’ may also be losing currency. In this paper we focus upon Kranji War Memorial and Cemetery, a site maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission to honour mainly those sacrificed in Singapore during the Second World War. Specifically, we highlight how Singaporeans have, in recent times, reappropriated the meanings of the site ‘from below’—through the contemporization and extraction of counternarratives—in an attempt to keep the resonance of the site for them. This, we argue, has led to the rescaling of remembrance from the level of the ‘personal’ or ‘imperial’ (which initially kept locals away) to one that is ‘national’ or ‘global’ (thus, salient to locals as well). In doing so we suggest how the readings of the site are bound to scales of commemoration, and how mnemonic practices at such memoryscapes may be contested within and across scales. </jats:p>",

At its foundation, the notion of spatial mismatch is driven largely by social justice, as some groups are disproportionately disadvantaged by the patterns of metropolitan growth and development. We offer geographical insights into this dimension of spatial mismatch through an exploratory spatial analysis of metropolitan-scale home and work locations. This is achieved by developing a conceptual framework that synthesizes research on spatial mismatch and jobs–housing balance. Following this, a model is employed to detect home–work imbalances, controlling for race, ethnicity, and the mode of commute. The approach is applied to data on the residential and work locations for commuter groups in the Atlanta, GA metropolitan area. The results reveal how potential commute options differ across commuter groups and show that minority home–work alternatives are more spatially constrained. </jats:p>",

The purpose of this work is to investigate dosimetric accuracy in low‐dose regions from commercial treatment planning systems (TPS) and consequent clinical implications for using IMRT in treating lung and thoracic cancers. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> We retrospectively reviewed thoracic‐cancer patients treated with IMRT at our institution and for whom high‐grade lung complications occurred. These IMRT plans were evaluated and were recomputed using a Monte‐Carlo‐based (MC) treatment planning system (TPS) that explicitly accounts for modeling of the machine head and MLCs. Dose calculations from 2 commercial TPSs (Pinnacle and Corvus systems) were compared with those obtained from the MC system and measurements. Various factors that could contribute to the difference in IMRT dose calculations were analyzed, including tissue heterogeneity effect, MLC modeling, and beam modeling. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Significant dosimetric errors (∼25%) were found in the low‐dose regions below 5 Gy in the commercial TPSs. Accuracy of dose calculations in the high‐dose tumor regions was acceptable (&lt; 5%). In regions &lt; 5 Gy of IMRT plans, MLC transmission, leakage, and scattering were found to be important contributors to the dose. These factors were also spatially variant and field‐size dependent. Without explicit modeling of the MLCs, severe underestimation of the low‐dose volume could occur in commercial TPS. The degree of low‐dose error was particularly greater in IMRT plans with larger target volumes and higher degrees of beam modulation. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Treatment planners should be aware of potentially significant underestimation of low doses in IMRT treatment plans for thoracic and other cancer sites. More accurate modeling of MLCs and low‐dose calculation may be achieved by using a Monte‐Carlo‐based planning system.</jats:p>",

The tests recommended by those documents are classified mainly into acceptance, commissioning (dosimetric and nondosimetric), periodic quality assurance, and patient specific quality assurance tests. The recommendations of both IAEA and AAPM documents are being implemented at the hospital for photon beams produced by two linear accelerators. A Farmer ionization chamber was used in a <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp2779-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp2779:mp2779-math-0001\" /> phantom with a dose rate of 320 monitor unit (MU)/min and 50 MU in the case of the dosimetric tests. The acceptance tests verified hardware, network systems integration, data transfer, and software parameters. The results obtained are in good agreement with the specifications of the manufacturer. For the commissioning dosimetric tests, the absolute dose was measured for simple geometries, such as square and rectangular fields, up to more complex geometries such as off‐axis hard wedges and for behavior in the build up region. Results were analysed by the use of confidence limit as proposed by Venselaar et al. [Radio Ther. Oncol. 60, 191–201 (2001)]. Criteria of acceptability had been applied also for the comparison between the values of MU calculated manually and MU generated by TPS. The results of the dosimetric tests show that work can be reduced by choosing to perform only those that are more crucial, such as oblique incidence, shaped fields, hard wedges, and buildup region behavior. Staff experience with the implementation of the quality assurance program for a commercial TPS is extremely useful as part of a training program.</jats:p>",

Dose profiles taken through the isocenter in the transverse and sagittal planes were analyzed to find the relation of maximum dose gradient (MDG) and reliable rectal dose‐volume constraints for prostate patients. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The steeper dose profile and higher MDG around the posterior direction can be obtained by modifying the planning technique or adjusting rectal DVH control points. The seven‐field plan has a higher MDG than a five‐field plan in the region where the PTV and rectum overlap, and has a much lower dose between 40–70Gy. With the seven‐field plan, there is a natural reduction in the rectal percentage volumes; also it is possible to lower the rectal DVH control points further to obtain a better dose gradient without sacrificing or impacting on other constraints for any of the IMRT plans. The average rectal percentage volumes V<jats:sub>D50</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>D60</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>D70</jats:sub> decrease 37%, 38% and 26%, respectively for the five‐field plan by lowering rectal DVH control points, while for seven‐field plan, the rectal percentage volumes decrease 16%, 19% and 13% respectively. The NTCP was reduced with a higher MDG between PTV and rectum. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Relative to a five‐field plan, the seven‐field plan demonstrates a higher MDG in the posterior direction causing lower rectal complications. To achieve the higher MDG, V<jats:sub>D70</jats:sub>, V<jats:sub>D60</jats:sub> and V<jats:sub>D50</jats:sub> of the rectal DVH are below 21%, 32% and 48%, respectively. These values are lower than RTOG guideline (25%, 35% and 55%, respectively) and do not compromise the dose distribution elsewhere.</jats:p>",

With this, several treatment planning tools have been developed outside of TPS for 4DCT analysis. <jats:bold>Materials and method:</jats:bold> Treatment planning systems have been primarily viewed as dose calculation engines, and only recently have begun introducing rudimentary tools dealing with 4DCT and deformable image registration. Concurrently, there has been a proliferation of imaging software, either in public domain or user‐written, for the new imaging paradigm offered by 4DCT to study organ deformation. There is a disconnect between available treatment planning tools and the state‐of‐art in image processing. While DICOM‐RT standard allows, in theory, for a straightforward transfer of treatment planning data, the clinical experience is generally anything but this. Thus most radiotherapy clinics, without benefit of dedicated programming and imaging science teams and yet treating the majority of patients, are unable to realize the full potential offered by 4DCT or contribute valuable clinical experience. Using a simplified DICOM‐RT export from TPS, we developed several treatment planning tools for enhanced visualization and image analysis of 4DCT data. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Various tools for processing 4DCT data were developed: 1) autosegmentation of normal structures onto phased CTs using a reference 3D CT containing initial manual segmentations; 2) automatic generation of internal target volume (ITV); 3) target motion characterization using center‐of‐mass trajectories; 4) dose volume histograms based either on maximal target motion, or probability density function; and 5) visualization for studying goodness of registration. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Image analysis tools, which supplement available image visualization using software from CERR (Washington University, St. Louis) and RCET (University of Florida), for 4DCT were presented. This approach allows for rapid development and clinical implementation of state‐of‐art image analysis tools in treatment planning.</jats:p>",

They build on the general premise that institutional settings shape actor behaviour, both as constraints and as opportunities. First, they focus on the influence of domestic intergovernmental patterns on the international activities of cities. It is found that the political status of city governments with respect to higher government levels, the strength of regional governments within a national intergovernmental system, and city-regional dynamics, are all factors that shape international urban strategies—in terms both of their orientation and of their coherence. Second, concerning the relationship between international urban strategies and intergovernmental processes linked to European integration, it is found that both ‘download’ and ‘upload’ Europeanisation create a pattern of institutional constraints and opportunities that push cities—especially secondary cities—towards active participation in European networks and the development of a clear international profile. </jats:p>",

Traditional inverse treatment planning consists of an optimization phase followed by a separate leaf‐sequencing phase. With DMPO based optimization, there is no leaf‐sequencing step. As such, the treatment planning time for each IMRT case can potentially be decreased and treatment‐planning throughput could be increased. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> Ten patients (<jats:italic>5 prostate and 5 head &amp; neck</jats:italic>) were randomly selected for a comparative treatment planning study. IMRT treatment plans were created using the standard IMRT optimization algorithm with k‐mean clustering based leaf‐sequencing. A second treatment plan was created for each patient using the DMPO optimization algorithm. The only difference between the two plans for each patient was the optimization algorithm. For each case, the time required to optimize the plans, the number of segments required for step‐and‐shoot delivery, and total monitor units were recorded. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Both the DMPO and IMRT optimizations yielded similar dose distributions. The mean time to perform inverse planning and leaf sequencing for prostate patients was 8.00 minutes, verses 8.85 minutes for DMPO based optimization. In contrast, the efficiency of DMPO for Head &amp; Neck cases is substantially different. The mean time to perform a DMPO optimization for Head &amp; Neck cases was 12.05 minutes, as compared with 28.63 minutes for IMRT optimization. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Over 16 minutes of treatment planning time can be saved per patient by utilizing the DMPO based optimization in Pinnacle for Head &amp; Neck treatment planning. The time advantage can grow to hours saved per patient if multipe treatment plans are created, or if the planners agressively adjust the plan. Depending on the Head &amp; Neck volumes treated, DMPO optimization can increase treatment planning effiency.</jats:p>",

In this work, we have implemented a fast Monte Carlo dose calculation algorithm for SRS/SRT treatment planning with the CyberKnife® system. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Our system employs a superposition Monte Carlo algorithm. Photon mean free paths and interaction types for different materials and energies as well as the tracks of secondary electrons are pre‐simulated using the EGS4 code system. Photon interaction forcing and splitting are applied to the source photons in a patient calculation and the pre‐simulated tracks are repeated with proper corrections based on the tissue density and electron stopping powers. Electron energy is deposited along the tracks and accumulated in every voxel of the simulation geometry. Scattered and bremsstrahlung photons are transported, after applying the Russian Roulette technique, in the same way as the primary photons. Dose calculations are compared with full Monte Carlo simulations and the CyberKnife treatment planning system (TPS) for lung and head &amp; neck treatments. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Comparisons with full Monte Carlo simulations show excellent agreement (within 0.5%). Significant differences in the target dose are found between Monte Carlo simulations and the CyberKnife TPS for SRS lung treatment. The calculation time using our superposition Monte Carlo algorithm is reduced up to 62 times (46 times on average for 10 typical clinical cases) compared to full Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: SRS/SRT dose distributions calculated by simple dose algorithms may be significantly overestimated for small lung target volumes, which can be improved by accurate Monte Carlo dose calculations. Properly implemented fast Monte Carlo algorithms can improve dosimetric accuracy with little or no compromise to computational efficiency.</jats:p>",

Single beam, 3D conformal, and IMRT treatment plans were generated for the lung phantom on each planning system.

For 3D conformal medium sphere plans the largest differences between measured and predicted doses were 2%, 11%, and 13% for Pinnacle, Brainscan, and Xknife respectively.

The quality of each approximation is determined by comparison to the approximation obtained from the one‐billion history experiment. The depth dose curve is approximated by the most accurate polynomial fit from polynomials with degrees ranging from 10 to 45. Such high‐degree polynomials are able to capture the behavior of the depth dose curve, even in the presence of heterogeneous tissues. The lateral penumbra can be modeled as the average of several error function pairs. A Levenberg‐Marquardt quasi‐Newton minimization method is employed to determine the parameters of each error function, as well as the number of error functions required. This method is applicable to both homogeneous and heterogeneous mediums. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Examination of the models obtained for both the depth dose curve and the lateral penumbra show that for both homogeneous and heterogeneous mediums, the models obtained provide satisfactorily accurate approximations using as few as 100 million Monte Carlo histories. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This work indicates that it is possible to obtain very accurate dose deposition coefficients using Monte Carlo techniques in a reasonable amount of time using the smoothing functions methods presented. Because the resulting dose model is smooth, in contrast to the inherently noisy Monte Carlo data, the dose model is suitable for optimization techniques. Further testing and refinement could lead to even fewer required Monte Carlo histories.</jats:p>",

Detailed data analysis of the operation of Audit Commission inspection of English local authorities since April 2000 demonstrates significant variations in inspection scores in different types of authorities, in different years and in different services. These findings raise important questions about the consistency with which inspection criteria are being applied and the reliability of the evidence on which inspectors are basing their judgments about a council's capacity for improvement. This in turn casts doubt on the capacity of the current model of improvement to make service providers more accountable to the public, which central government claims to be one of its key policy objectives.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To evaluate image registration and fusion techniques for multi‐modality microRT treatment planning. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Subject mice were first anesthetized and positioned within the custom microRT couch/head immobilization assembly. The immobilized subjects were then imaged using both a Phillips 64‐slice Brilliance CT scanner and a small‐animal MR imaging scanner built around a 4.7 T Oxford Instruments magnet and a Varian imaging console. The CT data was imported into CERR using the ‘DICOM‐import’ CERR tool, while the MRI data was imported into CERR using a custom Matlab *.FDF‐importer function. Using the CERR contouring tool, CT contours were generated for the brain, lung, and skin, and MRI contours were generated for the liver, lung and skin. The CT images were then registered to the microRTP treatment planning space using a custom Matlab registration algorithm for the microRT couch. Lastly, the resultant MR images were merged and fused to the registered CT plan, both translationally and rotationally, using the CERR ‘image fusion’ tool. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Previously‐published microRT studies have demonstrated the translational and rotational capabilities of CERR image fusion for merged CT plans. As expected, in this study, MRI was qualitatively superior for identifying and contouring target structures that had relatively low contrast variation on CT. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> CT/MRI co‐registration improves microRT treatment planning by providing verification of target positioning for organs contoured on both imaging modalities, as well as by providing increased target definition for soft‐tissue organs visualized effectively using MRI but not CT. CT/MRI phantom validation studies are currently in progress. Future planned studies include rotational MRI evaluation, as well as additional co‐registration studies evaluating the integration of PET, SPECT, and optical imaging modalities.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> For patient‐specific radiotherapy outcomes predictions (i.e., NTCP predictions), the choice of model and its parameters is of utmost importance. Our goal is to develop a software tool which will let clinicians conveniently select the model, understand the effects of the model parameter values, and thereafter predict plan specific outcomes. <jats:bold>Method:</jats:bold> This module has been developed within CERR (Computational Environment for Radiotherapy Research), an open source Matlab‐based software system. Two commonly used NTCP analytical models implemented are the Lyman‐Kutcher‐Burman (LKB) and the Critical volume (CV). The parameters of LKB model include: the exponent for calculating <jats:italic>EUD, D50</jats:italic>, and the slope parameter <jats:italic>m</jats:italic>; whereas the parameters of the CV model include the mean relative damaged volume, critical fraction of FSUs, and interpatient variability. Our interactive outcomes estimation module lets the user change the model and parameters and observe the change in predicted outcome simultaneously. We have also implemented a new model to predict radiation lung injury, which is a logistic regression model with two predictors — mean dose to lung (MDL) and the GTV location (GTV‐superior‐inferior position). We developed an interactive nomogram to let users look at the variation in outcome with respect to MDL and GTV‐SI position. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The interactive outcomes‐prediction module within CERR was tested on sample plans. The user is presented with slider bars to change the parameter values, or the user can input their own values, and the estimated outcome is simultaneously updated. The interface is simple, user‐friendly, and easily extensible to include other outcomes models. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This outcomes prediction module, along with other graphical visualization and analysis capabilities within CERR, may aid clinicians in understanding and using NTCP models for radiation treatment planning.</jats:p><jats:p>This research was partially supported by NIH grant R01CA85181 as well as a grant from TomoTherapy, Inc.</jats:p>",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate 1) the degradation of Hounsfield units (HU) in the extended field of view (eFOV), and 2) the dosimetric impact of ignoring or correcting this degradation within the treatment planning system (TPS). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> CT images were acquired at maximum FOV (82cm) on a diamond‐shaped 30×30×13cm solid‐water phantom, challenging the reconstruction algorithm's ability to model the truncated projection data adequately. A unique dataset was acquired for 19 phantom locations (1cm intervals outside of the nFOV) and each imported into a TPS. Each phantom was contoured using a threshold of −200HU. A single treatment beam with isocenter placed at the center of the phantom was planned to deliver 100cGy to isocenter for each CT data set; dose map comparisons with and without homogenous correction for density (HU&gt;−700 =1gm/cc) were performed relative to the control phantom within the nFOV. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Significant variation of HU was observed as a function of phantom displacement outside the nFOV (range +513 to −873HU); most dramatically ∼5cm beyond the nFOV border. If uncorrected, these changes in HU produced significant dose errors. Plans were compared to control plans and dose difference maps were generated; uncorrected images 3cm outside the nFOV demonstrated &gt;5% difference, where overriding HU values above −700HU maintained &lt;5% error for phantom positions ∼10cm beyond nFOV. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> HU values differ significantly for anatomy 2cm outside the nFOV, can be visualized and should be corrected for dose calculations. These results show &lt;5% dose error can be accomplished for anatomy extending ∼10cm beyond the nFOV (which accounts for 98% of eFOV patients here).</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> To examine potential treatment planning advantages of proton scattered beam and intensity modulated proton therapy over IMRT for pancreas tumors. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Five patients with pancreatic tumors were selected. Treatment plans for the conedown phase of the treatment were developed using three different modalities: IMRT, proton scattered beam, and intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). The motion of the pancreas was compensated for by using margins equal to those used in IMRT planning. A dose of 1440 cGy in 8 fractions was prescribed to the target. The IMRT plan consisted of 5 coplanar fields and was developed using the Eclipse treatment planning system. The single field proton scattered beam plan was computed using the Eclipse system with an IBA proton nozzle, an aperture block, and a compensator. The IMPT plan was calculated through the use of an in‐house method utilizing GEANT4, a validated Monte Carlo method. The IMPT procedure uses a step and shoot “spot scanning” method with Gaussian beams with an initial width of 8 mm FWHM. Plan optimization for the scanning treatment was performed using the Cimmino algorithm, a feasibility method that utilizes upper and lower dose constraints. Dose distributions, dose volume histograms, and dose statistics were calculated and compared for the three modalities. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> All plans provided similar coverage of the target. The proton scattered beam plan exhibited better dose homogeneity than the IMRT plan, while the IMPT plan produced noticeable hot spots. These hot spots are a result of the spacing of the Bragg peaks and are avoidable. Both the proton scattered beam and the IMPT plan provided significant sparing of all organs at risk compared to the IMRT plan. Conclusions: Proton therapy in the forms of both scattered beam and IMPT offers organ sparing advantages over IMRT in the treatment of pancreatic tumors.</jats:p>",

The GTV was delineated on ten 3D CT data sets by independent experts, with a planning margin added corresponding to the 2σ deviation from the mean center‐of‐mass. Tumor trajectories were derived from 4D CT data and fitted to a Fourier series expansion. Intra‐ and inter‐fraction statistical variations in amplitude and period were applied by considering literature estimates of the standard deviations. The couch feedback control system was simulated using second‐order couch dynamics and a first‐order controller. The residual tumor trajectory was calculated by inputting the tumor trajectory to the control system. A 7‐beam IMRT plan was generated on the end‐exhale CT with a prescription dose of 66 Gy.

Drawing on a critique of the glocalisation thesis we show that the design of these strategies can plausibly be explained by the specific characteristics of urban capitalism found in the different cities. Whereas the international strategy of Manchester must be seen as a response to problems of postindustrial restrictions, the importance of the logistic sector in Dutch capitalism strongly shapes Amsterdam's strategy. In Zurich, though, it is argued that the city was already very well prepared for the transformation towards a post-Fordist regime, and so did not need any strategy at all. We conclude that varieties of glocalisation trajectories are a major factor driving and shaping the characteristics of international urban strategies. </jats:p>",

In this we paper analyze the recent rise of a designer fashion industry in Auckland, New Zealand. The designer fashion industry has emerged as an unlikely success story as the New Zealand economy has globalized. Together with other creative industries, designer fashion is seen as an industry that can revamp New Zealand's international image and in doing so foster additional foreign investment. As the industry has succeeded, Auckland has disproportionately benefited, with sustained industry agglomeration and increasing infrastructural development in this city. However, the symbolic benefits of the designer fashion industry have proved more elusive. We show that the New Zealand designer fashion industry borrows symbolic capital from the global cities of designer fashion. We argue that this borrowing of symbolic capital underlines the need to think more carefully about the geographical specificity of the material, political, and symbolic processes associated with globalization and the cultural economy. </jats:p>",

Our user-centered design approach guided the development of an appropriate interface and an evaluation methodology to test the overall usability of the system.

DPM is only used for in‐phantom calculations; however, we have included beam modifiers such as Jaws, MLCs and now applicators within the code to improve its clinical applicability. Varian 21EX (Type III) was modeled for beam energies (6, 9 and 12 MeV) using the BEAMnrc MC code. The patient‐independent components were simulated once and the phase space (PS) is stored just below the ion chamber. As a first approximation, a preliminary model of the applicator blocks all the particles through the applicators but allows those in the open beam region. Verification of the beam modifier model with diode measurements and full PS simulations was performed using percent depth doses (PDDs) and profiles for various energies for the standard 15×15 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> cutout, and for square and rectangular cutouts from 4×4 to 25×25 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> in a homogeneous geometry. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> PDD calculations with DPM beam modifiers showed agreement within 2% with measurements and full PS simulation for the 6MeV beam. The 9 and 12 MeV PDD calculations showed discrepancies up to 4% in the surface buildup region, and a slightly larger difference in the tail.

Between the period of June 2005 and November 2006, 20 patients received HDR boost dose of 19 Gy in two fractions to the prostate in addition to an external beam dose of 45 Gy with IMRT technique. 3D Brachytherapy treatment plans were generated using Plato Version 14.2.3. Dosimetry was obtained for the following optimization schemes in Plato, for the same dose constraints for all the patients treated during this time period: Anatomy based IPSA optimization, Geometric optimization on volume and Dose Point optimization on volume. Dose volume histograms were generated for PTV and organs at risk for each optimization method, from which V75 volumes for Rectum, Bladder, and V125 volume for Urethra were determined. Also dose homogeneity index as well as conformal index for the PTV was calculated for each optimization technique. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Despite suboptimal needle placement in some implants, using the same dose constraints on all patients, IPSA algorithm was able to comply with the tight RTOG dose constraints for 90% of the patients in this study, whereas it was only 30 % for DPO and only 5% for GO. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Anatomy based IPSA optimization proved to be the overall best and fast technique for reducing the dose to organs at risk without compromising target coverage.</jats:p>",

Data was acquired to model and commission four treatment planning systems (Philips Pinnacle, CMS Xio, Nomos Corvus, and Siemens Konrad). Comparisons included: TPS model parameters w/ and w/o flattening filter, measured and computed %dd and profiles, conventional and IMRT dose distributions both via planning and delivery measurements in phantom. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Beam energy spectrum characteristics show only a modest softening in the beam since beam tuning matched the filtered 6 MV. Differences are seen in the off‐axis fluence and off‐axis energy softening: the fluence is reduced linearly away from the central axis and the energy spectrum is only slightly reduced by comparison. Dose profiles and %dd were accurately modeled to within 2% and 2mm for all field sizes 2–40 cm. When applied to IMRT treatment plans, the model produced equivalent dose distributions for head‐and‐neck, CNS, and prostate plans; the number of monitor units was slightly increased (∼15%) but the number of segments was identical. Delivery times at 1000 MU/min were shorter (20% reduction), and the IMRT plans delivered had a 30–50% reduction in the number of pixels showing dose‐differences beyond 5%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Treatment planning systems are not only capable of modeling the dose distributions produced without flattening filters, they perform superior than with the filter present, and can reduce common dosimetric errors observed in IMRT phantom studies.</jats:p><jats:p>Research sponsored by Siemens Medical Solutions corporation.</jats:p>",

These systems include — besides a radiographic and fluoroscopic mode — CT functionality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the future potential of such a cone beam CT option for therapy planning purposes allowing dynamic adaptation for target volume changes. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The Varian On‐Board Imager™ (OBI) Cone Beam CT (CBCT) option consists of a kV‐source and kV‐Imager mounted on robotic arms perpendicular to the MV therapy beam. In a single 360° rotation a volumetric CT data set can be acquired with a 25 or 45 cm field‐of‐view. In order to calibrate the system with regard to HU a special phantom has been designed to include the whole imager area. Removable inserts allow the measurement of central axis doses. A planning study has been carried out to determine the usability of CBCT data and compare these to with diagnostic CT date. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Comparisons of data between a diagnostic CT scanner and the 3D‐calibrated Cone Beam CT with regard to image quality and hounsfield units representation for an humanoid phantom (RSD Alderson) indicate good accordance. Central axis doses applied during the acquisition of one volumetric data set are between 1 and 3 cGy depending on the geometry. Results with real patient data show appropriate image quality. Relative dose distributions in CBCT‐based plans show minor differences to plans calculated using a diagnostic CT image dataset (p=0.002) and absolute dosage deviations are within 1% (p=0.001). <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> This work illustrates that a properly calibrated Cone Beam CT option allows off‐line treatment planning. Furthermore the image quality is sufficient for contouring of target outlines. CBCT can serve as control CT in order to adapt the target volume and resize the treatment fields and/or optimize the treatment plan.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years local leaders have become simultaneously intensely local, in fostering partnerships with local players, and intensely global, in going abroad to get resources, be they political, cognitive, or financial, to implement large urban projects; they have become ‘glocal’ leaders. At the same time, local stakeholders such as metropolitan or regional authorities, chambers of commerce, firms, or civil society organizations have pursued their own international objectives independently. Not all cities have therefore developed such a thing as a strategy. Nor have they all played the same hand in the international game. From this, two questions immediately arise: (i) why have some cities succeeded in carrying out an international strategy and others not? (ii) why have the successful ones chosen different paths? By focusing on local political leadership patterns in three European case studies, we argue that along with their institutional strengths the personal traits of the mayors are more than crucial to understanding why some cities have strategically played the international game and how they have played it. But this does not tell the whole story. One needs to make a detour via place-specific governance patterns, and more precisely the key local stakeholders to be convinced, persuaded, or cajoled, to properly assess the urban international strategies. With these major findings, we conclude that the ‘new international city era’ phenomenon tends to personalize local power. </jats:p>",

However, the maximum collimator length in the inf/sup direction is 16 cm when most of the head and neck target sizes have a larger dimension. This study used a multi‐isocenter IMRT planning technique with overlapping fields generated using inverse planning. Measurements have been taken to evaluate plans in terms of volume dose and delivery accuracy. The total monitor units for this technique were compared with a standard IMRT plan. <jats:bold>Methods and Materials:</jats:bold> Ten patients were planned with multiple beam arrangements; eight beam directions for the upper tumor volume without the supraclav and three to four beam arrangements for the lower tumor volume and supraclav. Treatment planning was performed on a CMS/XiO workstation. Treatment fields were delivered on a flat acrylic phantom containing EDR2 film. Isodose distributions were exported from XiO and compared to the measured data using Omni‐Pro software. <jats:bold>Results and Conclusions:</jats:bold> Multi‐isocenter techniques provide good coverage to the tumor volume while sparing organs at risk. Film distributions show that XiO does not model the effective tongue and groove that is evident in the film measurement. The magnitude of the tongue‐and‐groove dose decrease is on the order of up to 10%. An analysis of the gamma values shows that even with this discrepancy the agreements between plan and measurement were acceptable. The plans are not significantly degraded with small table inaccuracies on the order of 2mm. The total monitor units for multi‐centered plan increased 20% compared to single isocenter delivery.</jats:p><jats:p>IMRT planning techniques using two or more isocenters for this collimator show clinically acceptable results when splitting the geometry.</jats:p>",

We have developed interactive Pinnacle scripts and external C++ codes to aid the user in optimizing frame placement. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Given a set of lesions to be treated, the GKVF software currently provides the ability to 1) interactively place a 3D mesh representation of the Leksell frame on a patient's MR study and test for clinical tenability using a fast collision detection algorithm — accessible regions for various GK modalities are indicated with computed surface meshes — and 2) “paint” virtual fiducials onto DICOM MR copies of the patient's original study based on the current virtual frame location, which, together with the GKVF system's ability to generate virtual “skull and frame” measurements, facilitates LGP dose planning on the painted image sets. <jats:bold>Outlook:</jats:bold> Currently under development is a quantitative mechanism to guide the neurosurgeon in actual frame placement.</jats:p>",

The goal is to minimize the total tardiness. The optimal policy possesses the following properties: Under arbitrary maintenance plan when jobs have common processing time, and different due dates, the optimal production schedule is to order the jobs by earliest due date first rule; and when jobs have common due date and different processing times, the optimal production schedule is shortest processing time first. The optimal maintenance plan is of control limit type under any arbitrary production schedule when machine is exposed under a cumulative damage failure process. Numerical studies on the optimal maintenance control limit of the maintenance plan indicate that as the number of jobs to be scheduled increases, the effect of jobs due dates on the optimal maintenance control limit diminishes. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Manually created integration and test plans are often not optimal regarding time‐to‐market. Furthermore, creating and maintaining these plans costs a lot of effort. In this paper, we introduce a method that allows to automatically create optimal integration and test plans. This method can be used by intelligent enterprises to shorten the time‐to‐market of a system and to reduce the effort needed to create and maintain integration and test plans. We illustrate this method with two cases studies related to the development of ASML lithographic machines (ASML 2006).</jats:p>",

The aim of this study was to utilize ultrasound (US)‐CT to guide a more accurate prostate segmentation for prostate IMRT planning. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> In US‐CT modality, the ultrasound system (Restitu™, Resonant Medical System, Montreal, Canada) was integrated with CT‐Sim through an optic camera system, which was calibrated to the intersection point of wall lasers of CT‐Sim and was able to trace the position of ultrasound probe in real‐time. Thus, for each patient, the CT scan and ultrasound scan can take place at the same position and almost the same time. After compensating for the mechanical inaccuracy of CT‐sim and the image distortion of 3‐D US images due to inconsistent ultrasound wave propagation speed in different tissue types, 3‐D CT and 3‐D US images can be superimposed together naturally, since they share the same spatial coordinate system. Thus, the prostate contour drawn on 3‐D Ultrasound images can be transferred into CT images for IMRT planning. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Five patients underwent 3‐D US‐CT scan in this study. First, a physician contoured the target volumes and surrounding critical organs on CT images. Then the prostate was contoured on US images for comparison. The fused US‐CT images revealed that the discrepancy between the prostate volume drawn on CT images and ultrasound images takes place mostly at the lateral surface of prostate and the interface between prostate and rectum. The volume of the prostate drawn on US images is 30%∼50% less than that obtained from CT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Ultrasound‐CT, a new multi‐modality imaging system, has a potential to provide a more accurate prostate anatomy definition for prostate IMRT planning thereby reducing radiation dose to surrounding critical structures.</jats:p>",

The objective of this study was to survey the extent of self-reported financial relationships with industry amongst abstracts, speakers, and planning committee members at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting. Methods: We used the 2005 and 2006 ASCO meeting program books to tally the total number of abstracts (all types), speakers for education (faculty) and abstract sessions (discussant), as well as planning committee (education and scientific) members (data available only for 2006). The number and nature of financial disclosures were noted. COI categories include: employment, consultant role, stock ownership, honoraria, research funding, expert testimony, or other remuneration. Results are presented as an average over 2 years whenever appropriate. Results: There were approximately 4,396 abstracts presented, 678 speakers, and 301 planners each year. COI were reported in 27%, 46.8%, and 67.4% amongst abstracts presented, speakers, and planners, respectively. Within reported COI, the most common were consultant or advisory role (24.6%), honoraria (21.7%), research funding (21.7%), employment (15.2%), and stock ownership (12.6%). Amongst abstracts with COI, 27.4%, 27.1%, and 45.5% reported 1, 2, or ≥ 3 COI, respectively. Amongst speakers and planners with COI, 35.9%, 38.1%, and 26% reported 1, 2, or ≥ 3 COI, respectively. Notably, COI disclosure was not provided by 14.8% of the speakers on time for the program book publication. Conclusions: Financial COI are prevalent amongst presentations and more so amongst speakers and planners at the ASCO annual meeting. A large proportion of speakers failed to provide disclosure on time. The overwhelming majority of the disclosures were COI other than research funding. While the actual impact of COI on the clinical and research practices of oncologists and researchers cannot be determined from our study, the potential for such influence is significant. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

The planning procedure includes: 1. Calculating patient‐specific dose deposition coefficients (DDCs) for beamlets of selected energies by Monte Carlo simulation, 2. Optimizing beamlet weights (first optimization) and generating the intensity (beamlet weight) map and step‐and‐shoot leaf sequences (segments), 3. Calculating DDCs of those segments with scatter and transmission from eMLC, 4. Optimizing segment weights (second optimization), 5. Resetting weights in leaf sequences for each segment and calculating final dose. To investigate treatment planning in clinic scenarios for breast treatments, MERT plans were generated for a breast phantom, which mimics the geometry and densities of the breast cancer patient and for breast cancer patient previously treated with IMRT. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The results of MERT plan based on the breast phantom show that the differences in dose volume histograms (DVH) for the plans before and after the second optimization is significant due to eMLC scattering. The second optimization reduces the effect due to eMLC scatter and transmission, leading to an optimal, deliverable plan. For the patient case, dose distributions and DVHs of the MERT plan were compared with the photon IMRT and show significant advantages for sparing the organs at risk (OARs). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Our Monte Carlo based inverse planning procedure with two‐time optimizations is capable of generating optimal and deliverable MERT plans using realistic 3D phantom/patient geometries, demonstrating the potential of MERT as an alternative treatment modality for shallow tumor treatments.</jats:p>",

The measured dose distributions for two photon energies (6 MV and 15 MV) are compared to calculations with Pencil Beam (PB), Collapsed Cone (CC) and Monte Carlo (MC). <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The phantom is made of solid water slices and styrodur. The center of the phantom contains a solid water cylinder modeling the planning target volume (PTV). Radiographic films are placed between the slices. Treatment plans consisting of 9 conformal beams with directions uniformly distributed around the PTV cylinder and two different photon energies (6 MV and 15MV) of a standard linear accelerator are created. Dose calculations are performed with the three algorithms. The calculated dose distributions are compared to dose profiles extracted from the film exposure after irradiating the phantom. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The best agreement (independent on the energy) can be observed between the film and MC profiles. The PB algorithm fails to reproduce the measured dose distribution. The CC results show good agreement for 6 MV and an acceptable agreement for 15 MV inside the PTV cylinder. The CC dose outside of the PTV in the styrodur material is overestimated for 15 MV. Both, MC and CC algorithms predict the absolute dose measured with ionization chamber at the isocenter with an accuracy of at least 3%. The absolute dose deviation of the PB algorithm is 4% for 6 MV and 10% for 15 MV. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> For treatment planning of patients with small lung tumors the use of PB algorithms should be avoided.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Treatment planning study for proton passive, active beam with and without bolus and aperture. <jats:bold>Method and materials:</jats:bold> Most beam delivery systems in proton therapy use passive beam spreading techniques to conform the dose to the target. Chordoma, meningioma, GBM and other head and neck cases are routinely treated with passively scattered beams at many proton centers. Patched fields are often used in sparing normal tissues surrounding the targets. This is achieved by matching the distal edge of one beam with the lateral edge of another beam to get good target coverage and reduce normal tissue doses. Boluses are used to compensate for the distal contour of the target and tissue density variations upstream of the target. This modality offers distinct advantages over conventional (X‐ray) radiation therapy, viz., no dose to the normal structures distal to the tumor and easy avoidance of normal structures surrounding the tumor; resulting in low integral dose to the patient. Passively scattered proton beams offer limited treatment field size, necessitating the use of matching fields to cover larger targets, e.g., medulloblastoma, and cranio‐spinal irradiation. Also there is increased risk of neutron contamination for passively scattered proton beams. Active beam scanning eliminates these limitations. This technique can, in principle, be used without the use of boluses and apertures. However, comparing with passively scattered beam, the increased penumbra of the active scanning beam for a shallower target may compromise treatment delivery by giving increased dose to the healthy tissues. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In this study, we compare the passively scattered beam and active scanning beam plans for the extra‐medullary plasmacytoma of the right maxilla, a head and neck tumor. <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> A significant reduction in dose to healthy tissues can be achieved by using the scanning beam technique in conjunction with a limited use of apertures and boluses.</jats:p>",

IMRT plans for two patients (prostate cancer and parotid cancer disease sites) were generated for both ES and ES‐S. Planning CTs were obtained using Philips AcQSim and CT data were transferred into Pinnacle3 TPS 8.0. IMRT plans for each patient were calculated with two machine models, ES‐S and ES, with minimum segment areas of 1.6×1.6 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> and 2×2 cm<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> respectively. All other calculation configurations are the same. Dose volume histograms (DVH) were generated and exported into Excel for comparison. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> For prostate site, PTV DVH for ES‐S demonstrates more conformality than that for ES, possibly because ES‐S has smaller segment area. However, in the low dose region, bladder and rectum DVHs show higher doses from ES‐S versus ES. This may be due to more scatter and leakage doses from MLC of ES‐S. Same trend is observed for the parotid patient. While PTV DVH for ES‐S is slightly more conformal than that for ES, doses for cord expansion, left parotid, and brain stem expansion for ES‐S are slightly higher in low dose region compared to corresponding DVHs for ES. Conclusions: Preliminary results indicate IMRT plans with ES‐S provide slightly better conformality for target volume but slightly higher doses for critical structures in low dose region. For these two sites, there does not appear to be clinically significant differences for IMRT plans between Elekta Synergy‐S and Elekta Synergy. More case example studies are planned and findings will be discussed in depth including practical considerations such as transfer of treatment plans between the two types of machines.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Waste management in Ireland has been dramatically transformed over the past 10 years from over 90% reliance on landfill towards a fully integrated approach. According to the latest EPA National Database Report in 2007 our municipal (household and commercial but excluding construction and demolition) recycling rate was 35% in 2005. This has been achieved through the implementation of 10 regional waste management plans all prepared within a new national planning framework in accordance with the Waste Management Act 1996 and Government policy document `Changing Our Ways', published in 1998 by the Irish Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The principal drivers of the waste management plans and strategies are the EU Waste Framework Directive (recently revised), the EU Packaging Directive and the EU Landfill Directive. In addition, there were substantial political and environmental drivers due to the relatively poor standard of landfills in Ireland. Strict landfill regulation by the Environment Protection Agency commenced in 1997and led to many closures of poor facilities and new standards of siting design and operation. This has led to very high landfill charges that are only now beginning to stabilize. The key to improving public attitudes to the greatly improving waste management system has been the degree and content of stakeholder involvement programmes. These programmes are now consolidated into a national `Race against Waste' programme (www.raceagainstwaste.ie). The purpose of the programme is to create awareness and deal with many of the misconceptions in the public mind attached to waste treatment methods especially incineration. Waste management is after all about people. </jats:p>",

The impact is even greater if the works are carried out in an urban area resulting in serious traffic congestion as well as pollution, dust and noise. This paper proposes a model for the management of such works and is applied to a case study based on the new port at Laredo (Spain). The model optimises the distribution of loads between lorries and barges with the aim of minimising the total economic, social and environmental costs. The total cost of the system was calculated from the costs used in operating the lorries and barges as well as from a social cost represented by the costs to private transport users caused by the increased congestion due to the activity of lorries on the road network. All of this is limited by environmental restrictions aimed at keeping the emissions of both private and works vehicles within the established pollution and noise standards. Finally, a series of interesting conclusions are presented for the correct planning of the transport system that was analysed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper opens with an identification of the phenomenon of employment relocation (runaway production) from Hollywood and the concomitant formation of satellite production centers in other parts of the world. A brief theoretical analysis of this issue is provided, emphasizing the role of scale effects and transactions costs. The empirical record of the decentralization of film-shooting activities from Hollywood over the period from the early 1980s to the early 2000s is reviewed. We describe the effects of these activities on the rise and consolidation of the Vancouver film-production complex, and we engage in a broad discussion of the spatial and economic structure of the complex. We subsequently show that many places in other countries (for example, Australia, New Zealand, Romania, the Czech Republic, Mexico, South Africa, and elsewhere) are now competing strongly with Vancouver for film-shooting activities from Hollywood. We predict that this competition is likely to intensify greatly over the next decade or so, and that the global geography of film-shooting activities will almost certainly become increasingly more variegated as new studio complexes open up around the world. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 2044 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Irradiation remains the cornerstone of management for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Guidelines adopted by the RTOG and EORTC advocate encompassing the primary tumor (sometimes with edema), and a 2 cm margin in the high dose volume. These recommendations have emerged from imaging studies and post-mortem analyses. A shortcoming of this approach is the exposure of critical structures (e.g. optic apparatus) to doses of radiation that may exceed organ tolerance. We sought to determine whether the temporal bone (rather than the aforementioned 2 cm radius) serves as a barrier to tumor spread when regarded as the anterior margin for temporal lobe lesions. We hypothesized that toxicity could be reduced without compromising tumor control. Methods: During the period 2003–2006, 250 patients with GBM were treated with surgery and primary irradiation at our institution. Chemotherapy (e.g., Stupp regimen) was given to approximately one-third of patients. 31 patients had lesions confined to the temporal lobe. All patients had MRI at baseline and at monthly intervals following a course of 60 Gy delivered by conformal techniques. The Clinical Target Volume included the primary lesion, the edema when present and a 2 cm margin except in the direction of the temporal bone. At follow-up (median = 10 months), patients were judged to have stable disease, local progression (i.e. failure within the temporal lobe), distant progression (i.e., brain failure beyond the temporal lobe) or combinations of the latter 2. Results: 11 patients have remained with stable disease. 17 have failed locally. 3 have manifested distant failure. Of the latter, only one patient failed in the infratemporal fossa. Conclusions: An acceptable level of recurrence (e.g., &lt;5% beyond the temporal bone) is seen when the temporal bone, rather than a 2 cm margin is employed as the anterior border of the CTV. As GBM patients live longer in the era of combined modality therapy, a greater opportunity will exist to express radiation damage. The strategy proposed herein provides tumor control while respecting optic tolerance without resorting to complex, expensive approaches such as IMRT. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

For both strategies, smearing, proximal and distal margins were adjusted to improve the target dose coverage for 10 phases of 4D CT. For an esophagus patient with large diaphragm motion (∼5cm), a treatment plan was designed based on strategies (1) and (2). The same treatment plan was recalculated in all 10 phases of the 4D CT. <jats:bold>Result:</jats:bold> For strategy (1), internal target volume (ITV) prescription dose coverage at inspiration/expiration phase decreased/increased from 99.3%/91.5% to 94.6%/99.6% when the smearing margin was increased from 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm. Adjusting the distal and proximal margin had not effect on the ITV coverage. For strategy (2), using the smearing margin 3.5 cm and an increased distal margin for one of the three beams, the ITV prescription dose coverage is at least 99.5% for all ten phases of 4D CT. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> By designing a proton treatment plan on the inspiration phase with slightly adjusted planning parameters, it is possible to have the target adequately covered for the esophagus cancer patient with large diaphragm motion.</jats:p>",

The benchmark is based on detailed measurements of the source, geometry, relative output factors and dose distributions of clinical electron beams of a single clinical linear accelerator, including the largest available field with no applicator, along with a precision Monte Carlo simulation of the treatment head. Fluence is divided into direct electrons and those scattered from collimators, including the applicator and insert. This benchmark is used to determine the accuracy of fluence calculated with a beam model in a commercial treatment planning system commissioned with measurements done on the same accelerator used to develop the clinical benchmark. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Energy and spatial distributions of fluence for direct and indirect electrons are generally in good agreement between the benchmark data sets and the commercial beam model. Differences include lower resolution in the beam model than in the actual beam in the penumbra and differences in the relative contribution of direct and indirect electrons to the total fluence. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The new benchmark is very useful in determining the accuracy of models of clinical electron beams. The benchmark is not only an excellent benchmark for the large, open field, which is seldom used for treatment. It is useful for any applicator and SSD, assuming Monte Carlo can accurately account for the jaws, applicator and insert in the somewhat simplified geometry used in the simulation. The work, currently limited to the linac from a single vendor, is to be expanded to included linacs from other vendors.</jats:p><jats:p>Support from NIH R01 CA104777‐01A2 and Nucletron.</jats:p>",

We highlight the importance of and present a basis for electing a microsite planning approach for conservation and development in areas characterized by (1) high ethnic diversity, (2) high human population densities, and (3) endangered, land-dependent large mammal populations that pose economic risks.

For each case, a planning target volume (PTV) and the spinal cord were contoured. A 5 mm margin was added to the spinal cord to create a planning organ‐at‐risk volume (PRV). Plans were developed to deliver 60 Gy to 95% of the PTV while minimizing PRV dose. For DMLC delivery, 7 fields in the transverse plane were used. Plans were developed for two secondary collimator configurations, one in which the collimators were set by the optimization engine (DMLC STD) and one in which the PRV was always blocked by a collimator jaw (DMLC BLOCK). For both DMLC STD and TOMO, the optimization parameters were adjusted to minimize the PRV dose without exceeding 69 Gy to a volume of tissue &gt;1 cc. DMLC BLOCK plans were optimized using the same parameters as the DMLC STD plans. The PTV D<jats:sub>1cc</jats:sub>, spinal cord D<jats:sub>0.5cc</jats:sub>, and non‐specified normal tissue D<jats:sub>1cc</jats:sub> were calculated. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The TOMO plans were able to both minimize the spinal cord dose and limit the hotspot. The DMLC plans were not able to limit the hotspot to the extent of the TOMO plans. The DMLC BLOCK plans achieved equivalent cord sparing, but with increased dose heterogeneity. The mean spinal cord D<jats:sub>0.5cc</jats:sub>, was 8.8, 16, and 8.4 Gy for the TOMO, DMLC STD, and DMLC BLOCK plans respectively.

However, with current technology, the sparing is at the expense of PTV heterogeneity and larger doses to small volumes of normal tissue.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The question of whether primary schools in Kenya can take on community-based activities beyond their day-to-day functioning, emerged from a larger HIV/AIDS education and prevention program—Primary School Action for Better Health (PSABH). The methodology involved both quantitative and qualitative approaches. The quantitative component was based on 163 schools, which were involved in the larger PSABH program. Qualitative analysis was based on consultative meetings with twenty key informants and follow-up focus-group discussions with representatives from eight schools involved in community-based activities. The results suggest that in this context schools have strong community ties, with most of them willing to take up community-based organization (CBO)-related activities beyond their day-to-day functioning. Schools were more likely to take on CBO-related activities, such as support for orphans, if they had a higher proportion of female teachers, a school sponsor that was involved in the selection of the head teacher, more Parent Teacher Association meetings, and if HIV/AIDS was incorporated into community festivals. A school's involvement was reinforced if it performed well in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education examination, if the school's head teacher was committed, and if most of the teachers were from the local community. Despite several challenges, the findings point to the need to take schools seriously in their duty as CBOs which can have a positive impact in mitigating not only the effects of HIV/AIDS, but also other community-development activities in ravaged sub-Saharan African countries. The proposed expansion of PSABH further puts Kenyan schools in a stronger position to be involved in their communities through CBO-related activities. </jats:p>",

In this study, we evaluated prostate cancer incidence, anatomic distribution, Gleason score profile and tumor burden in patients diagnosed by transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy (TTSB). Methods: One hundred and seventeen patients underwent TTSB. TTSB was performed under general anesthesia. All but one patient had undergone at least one prior negative TRUS biopsy. Criteria for inclusion included an elevated PSA and/or the diagnosis of ASAP or high-grade PIN on prior biopsy. The prostate gland was divided into 24 regional biopsy locations with 1–3 biopsies per region. The median number of biopsy cores was 50. Multiple clinical parameters were evaluated as predictors for prostate cancer diagnosis. Results: The mean patient age was 64.8 years with a mean PSA of 9.1 ng/mL and a prostate volume of 78.6 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup>. On average, patients had undergone 2.1 prior negative TRUS biopsies with a mean of 22.4 core biopsies. Prostate cancer was diagnosed in 49 patients (41.9%) with a Gleason score distribution of 6–9. Patients with a prostate volume of = 60 cm<jats:sup>3</jats:sup> had a higher rate of cancer diagnosis compared to patients with larger glands (66% vs. 30%). Although no anatomic region of the prostate gland was spared of cancer, there was a preponderance of anterior-based malignancies. In patients with prostate cancer, an average of 9.9 cores were involved. In multivariate analysis, pre-saturation biopsy diagnosis and prostate volume were the best predictors for prostate cancer diagnosis. Conclusions: Transperineal template-guided saturation biopsy diagnosed prostate cancer in 41.9% of previously biopsied patients. Considerable anatomic variability in prostate cancer distribution was documented. Based on this and other reports, cancer eradication will be dependent on treatment of the entire prostate gland. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

Major toxicity including radiation pneumonitis and esophagitis were analyzed. In the process of IMRT inverse planning, methodologies of selecting appropriate beam angles and planning objectives were developed to limit the spread of beam angles and low‐dose radiation in protecting normal lung and other critical structures. Important IMRT planning parameters and their guidelines were derived, e.g. on the number of beams, beam angles, degree of intensity modulation, and DVH constraints for normal tissues. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> We reviewed 68 locally advanced lung cancer cases treated with IMRT and with adequate clinical followup time. The rate of grade ⩾ 3 TRP at 12 months was reduced to 8% in IMRT patients in contrast to 32% in 3D‐CRT patients treated historically, despite larger GTV sizes in the IMRT cohort. Mean lung dose and the volume of low‐dose radiation to healthy lung may be important factors affecting the risk of radiation pneumonitis. In achieving quality IMRT plans, 6 beams were used in average, with the optimal beam angles being most frequently along the anterior‐posterior direction of the thorax; the number of MLC segments per beam was confined to be less than 15 with the total MU per fraction approximately 3 times of the prescribed tumor dose. Conclusions: With proper considerations given to treatment planning methodology and other technical issues involved, IMRT may be an effective and safe modality in radiation therapy of locally advanced lung cancers.</jats:p>",

It is hypothesized that (1) thorough business planning at the beginning of a project creates a basis for proficient project and risk planning; (2) the proficiency of project planning, risk planning, and process management activities each improves innovation performance directly; (3) the relationship of planning and success is mediated by process management; and (4) the strength of these relationships is moderated by uncertainty, as determined by the degree of innovativeness. To test the hypotheses, data from 132 NPD projects were collected and analyzed. A measurement model was used to establish valid and reliable constructs, a path model to test the main effects, and a multiple‐moderated regression analysis for the moderator hypotheses. The results suggest that the proficiency of project planning and process management is important predictors of NPD performance. Specifically, project risk planning and goal stability throughout the development process are found to enhance performance significantly. Business planning proves to be an important antecedent of the more development‐related planning activities such as project planning and risk planning. Additionally, the results lend support to the hypotheses regarding the mediating role of process management in the planning–performance relationship. Project planning and risk planning support the quality of process management and thus impact NPD performance indirectly. Only to a limited extent are the strengths of these relationships moderated by the degree of innovativeness of the NPD project.</jats:p>",

In this paper we aim to explore some characteristics of this expansion from the perspective of the organizational dynamics of global production networks. We found that foreign brand-name companies have played a key role in propelling this wave of investment in the GSA by Taiwanese IT companies. At the same time, their business strategies have influenced the mechanisms governing these Taiwanese companies' supply chains and have forged the dynamics of spatial agglomeration. We argue that the transborder extension of the production networks is interwoven with the exercise of power between enterprise organizations. Our findings suggest that interdependence among firms in close geographical proximity is inseparable from the asymmetrical power relations embodied in global commodity chains; a point emphasized by economic geographers as the main reason for transborder production shifts that result in the formation of new industrial spaces in developing countries. However, if these production networks can respond collectively to such a strict environment through instituting suitable organizational governance, then their competitive advantage will be enhanced, while also benefiting the host region's development through localization. </jats:p>",

Each plan was performed using 3D‐CRT (4‐ and 6 field) and IMRT techniques. For IMRT plans, systematic dose errors were estimated as follows: <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0932-math-0001.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0932:mp0932-math-0001\" />, where the superscript, “air” assumes the true air density in the rectal balloon and indicates the dataset upon which beam weights were optimized. The subscript represents the final dose calculation dataset based on the optimized beam weights. The convergence dose error may be approximated as follows: <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/mp0932-math-0002.png\" xlink:title=\"urn:x-wiley:00942405:media:mp0932:mp0932-math-0002\" />, where the final dose calculation dataset is equivalent (assumes air density) while the initial dataset, upon which beam weights are optimized, is changed between the water‐based and air densities. DVHs, and biological dose indices, generalized EUD (gEUD), and NTCP were used to assess the dosimetric consequences of assigning unit‐density to the air in the rectal balloon. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Although the posterior aspect of the prostate (prostate/rectum junction) was consistently under‐dosed when air‐densities were assigned to the rectal balloon, these differences did not significantly affect the prostate gEUD. Average differences were approximately 0.5 Gy, with a maximum difference of 1.5 Gy observed in one IMRT plan. Rectal %NTCPs sometimes differed significantly (up to 7%) between the water‐ and air‐density assignment and were more pronounced for the 3D‐CRT plans. IMRT systematic dose errors were generally found to be larger than convergence errors, with the greatest effect observed in the rectum where NTCP differences ranged from 1 to 5%. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> Tissue heterogeneity effects resulting from use of endorectal balloons may be dosimetrically important and must be considered for accurate 3D‐CRT and IMRT prostate cancer planning.</jats:p>",

Preferences among our respondents fell in favor of services carried out in general classroom settings at elementary schools, reflecting egalitarian attitudes. We found misconceptions, compared to empirical evidence, for notions about tutoring practices and academic acceleration. In their response rates to items, undergraduates previously served as gifted differed only occasionally from those not served as gifted. We discuss implications of our findings in terms of the need for proponents of gifted programs to address some misconceptions that appear to be related to school reform and appropriate services for children who are gifted. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> The surgical operation to remove the tumor is the premier treatment method for rectal cancer, and the radiation therapy is an auxiliary but important way. The radiation treatments for rectal cancer include preoperative irradiation and postoperative irradiation. The purpose of this study is to compare different treatment planning techniques for preoperative pelvic irradiation of rectal cancer. The comparisons include three‐field vs four‐field (box) techniques and the treatment planning with full bladder vs post voiding bladder. <jats:bold>Method and Materials:</jats:bold> The different planning techniques for the same patient were compared via score function of TCP (Tumor Control Probability) and NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability). The organs contoured include femoral head, intestine, and urinary bladder walls with full bladder and with post voiding bladder for the same PTV. All patients were treated with preoperative irradiation at VGH‐Taipei. These patients include 6 male and 3 female with a mean age of 51.67 (28–76). The clinical stages for all patients are stage II and III rectal cancer (AJCC T<jats:sub>2–4</jats:sub> N<jats:sub>0–2</jats:sub> M<jats:sub>0</jats:sub>). The total dose was 4500 cGy with a fraction size of 225 cGy. ANOVA (F‐test) was performed for the results analysis <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The results from score function show the treatment with 3‐field is better than that with 4‐field. It also shows the treatment with full bladder is better than that with post voiding bladder. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> In the F test, the P value of field factor (3‐field vs 4‐field) is 0.00024. It means the field factor is a significant factor. The P value of the bladder‐status factor (full or empty bladder) is 0.59 (&lt;0.95). It means the bladder‐status factor isn't significant. Therefore, we conclude the treatment field is a treatment planning factor, but not bladder‐status. However, we need more patients to make a much solid conclusion for the bladder‐status factor.</jats:p>",

The system uses a commercial treatment planning system with an analytical dose algorithm to design the treatment plans. A DICOM‐RT‐ION interface was developed to allow automated data transfer between the treatment planning system and the MC system. The MC model included all major components of a passively‐scattered proton treatment unit and a CT‐based patient model. A suite of programs converted the prescriptive data (e.g., range, modulation width, field size) and patient CT data into a MC input file, including coordinate system transformations for arbitrary treatment beam orientations. The radiation transport calculations are performed with the MCNPX Monte Carlo system running on a cluster of 512 64‐bit CPUs. For each treatment field, multiple simulation output files were postprocessed and the resulting MC dose matrix was written to the DICOM‐RT‐ION plan. The plan was then imported into the commercial planning system for visualization. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> The MC simulations and pencil beam dose distributions are in good agreement for a two‐field prostate plan and a three‐field lung plan. The prostate plan required 1.6 hours and the lung plan required 14 hours using 512 CPUs to achieve &lt; 2 % statistical uncertainty in the total dose at isocenter. The computing time was directly related to the number of voxels in the patient model. Timing studies revealed that the simulation speed for this system scales almost linearly with the inverse number of CPUs. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The results of this study strongly suggest that it is feasible to implement a fast and easy‐to‐use MC treatment planning dose engine with currently available computing technologies and resources.</jats:p>",

To validate the EDW models, dose profiles of 6− and 10−MV photon beams from a Clinac 2100C/D were measured in water for depths from near‐surface to 31.5 cm for a wide range of field sizes and wedge angles using a linear detector array of 25 energy‐compensated diodes (LDA‐25) to integrate the dose at multiple points in the EDW field for each exposure. The EDW output factors for square fields from 4 to 20 cm wide were measured in solid water using a cylindrical ionization chamber at a depth of 10 cm on central axis. The 6− and 10−MV photon beams emerging from the treatment head of the Clinac 2100C/D were fully simulated using the BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc was used to calculate the central‐axis percentage depth doses and dose profiles for the open and dynamically‐wedged fields in a water phantom.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 4559 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Accurate inguinal and pelvic nodal staging in anal cancer is important for prognosis and planning of (chemo)radiation fields. There is strong evidence for the impact of FDG-PET in staging and management of cancer, with early reports of an increasing role in outcome prognostication for a number of tumours. We aimed to determine the impact of FDG-PET on the nodal staging, radiotherapy planning and prognostication of patients with primary anal cancer. Methods: Sixty-two consecutive patients with anal cancer referred to a single tertiary oncology centre between August 1997 and November 2005 were staged with conventional imaging (CIm), computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and chest x-ray and by FDG-PET. The stage determined by CIm and the proposed management plan was prospectively recorded and changes in stage and management as a result of FDG-PET assessed. Patients were treated using uniform radiotherapy technique and dose. The accuracy of changes and prognostication of FDG-PET was validated by subsequent clinical follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess survival for the cohort and by FDG-PET and CIm stage. Results: The TNM stage group was changed in 23% (14/62) as a result of FDG-PET (15% up-staged, 8% down-staged). Fourteen percent of T1 patients (3/22), 42% of T2 patients (10/24) and 38% of T3–4 patients (6/16), assessed using CIm, had a change in their N or M stage following FDG-PET. Sensitivity for nodal disease by FDG-PET and CIm was 92% and 72% respectively. The staging FDG-PET scan altered management intent in 3% (2/62), and altered radiotherapy fields in 13% (8/62). Estimated 5 year overall survival and progression free survival (PFS) for the cohort was 77.3% (95% CI 55.3%-90.4%) and 72.2% (95% CI 51.5%-86.4%) respectively. Estimated 5 year PFS for FDG-PET and CIm staged N2–3 disease was 70% (95% CI 42.8%-87.9%) and 55.3% (95% CI 23.3%-83.4%) respectively. Conclusions: FDG-PET shows increased sensitivity over CIm for staging nodal disease in anal cancer and changes treatment intent or radiotherapy fields in a significant proportion of patients. Improved 5 year PFS for FDG-PET staged N2–3 disease could be consistent with more accurate nodal staging and radiotherapy targeting. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p>",

(2)To deduce the analytical equations for the quick estimation of the irradiated volume based on the distances obtained from the digitally reconstructed radiographs. Methods: Between August 2002–2006, 162 postmastectomy patients underwent 5wk course of tangential CW irradiation ± Axillary / SCL radiation to a total dose of 50gy/25#. After adequate immobilization on the CT compatable breast board, CT scans with 1cm slice intervalsof the chest were performed, covering lung apex to lung base. The ipsilateral total lung area and the lung area included within the treatment port were countered on each CT slice.It is multiplied by slice thickness, and then integrated in all CT slices to give volumes.Parameters used to deduce irradited lung volume (n=104) studied from the DRR included Central lung distance-CLD, Maximum perpendicular distance-MPD, Length of the lung-L &amp; Parameters related to heart are measured only in left breast irradiation (n=58) included: Maximum heart distance-MHD, Maximum heart length MHL.Linear regression analysis is applied to test relationship between the percentage of ipsilateral lung volume involved and the CLD / MPD / L and similarly between MHD / MHL and the cardiac volume in irradiation. Results: Predicted irradiated volume for: Right Lung = 4.0118+6.6474(CLD) OR -5.965 + 6.827(MLD) Left Lung = 6.6395(CLD) OR 5.431(MLD) Heart = 7.325(MHD) OR 6.742(CLD) Conclusions: The conclusion of the present study, to the best of our knowledge, is the largest series reported so far in the literature.

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>Purpose:</jats:bold> Dynamic multileaf collimator (DMLC) and static multileaf collimator (SMLC) along with three dimensional treatment planning system (3DTPS) opens the possibility of tissue compensation. A method using electronic tissue compensator (ETC) has been implemented in Eclipse 3DTPS at our centre. The ETC was tested for head and neck conformal RT planning. The purpose of this study was to verify the feasibility of DMLC and SMLC in head and neck field irradiation, simultaneously delivering homogeneous dose at depth. In addition, the emphasis was given on the dosimetric aspects in commissioning ETC in Eclipse. Methods and Materials: A Head and Neck Phantom (The Phantom Laboratory, USA) was used for the dosimetric verification. Planning was carried out for both DMLC and SMLC ETC plans. The point dose calculated at central axis by Eclipse with DMLC and SMLC was noted. This was compared with the measured dose on machine with ion chamber and TLD. The calculated idsodoses and profiles were also compared with the measured one. The line dose profiles from Eclipse were also compared with the profile obtained from Amorphous Silicon (AS500) Electronic portal imaging device (EPID) on Clinac 6EX machine. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> In uniform dose regions, measured dose values resulted in agreements with the calculated doses within 3%. Distance to agreement between calculated and measured isodoses in dose gradient zone was within 3 mm. Both the comparison of isodoses and the profile were in good agreement and acceptable. The measured and the calculated line dose profiles were flat for both DMLC and SMLC. <jats:bold>Conclusion:</jats:bold> The dosimetric verification of ETC for both the linacs demonstrated the feasibility and the accuracy of the ETC treatment modality for achieving uniform dose distributions. Therefore ETC can be used as a new tool in head and neck treatment planning optimization for improved dose uniformity.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 9026 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: HSCT carries an increased risk of mortality. Thus, patients are encouraged to have ACP. However, discussions about ACP is not a casual process since it may elicit undue anxiety to the patients and their families. Anecdotally, pts fear that discussion of the possibility of death is inconsistent with hoping for the best outcome. We therefore compared the outcomes of pts with or without ACP who received HSCT for cancer. Methods: ACP was defined as having living will, power of attorney for health care, or life-support instructions conducted prior to transplant. ACP were reviewed in pts who were at least 19 yo and received first allogeneic or autologous HSCT for cancer between 2001 and 2003. Pts were classified into: 1) No ACP, 2) ACP prior to cancer dx, 3) ACP after cancer dx but prior to HSCT. Multivariate analysis (MVA) was done to evaluate the relative risk of mortality at 1 year according to ACP while adjusting for other prognostic factors. Results: 343 pts were included in the study: 172 (50%) did not have ACP, while 171 (50%) pts had ACP. Of those with ACP, 127 pts (74%) were available for review. Characteristics were similar between pts with and without reviewable ACP. 28 pts had ACP prior to cancer dx, 87 had ACP prior to HSCT, while 12 had ACP after HSCT. 64% of pts with ACP had both power of attorney and a living will, 16% had a living will alone and 19% had power of attorney alone. Older pts (p &lt;0.001) and Caucasians (p = 0.04) were more likely to have ACP. MVA were confined to the 172 pts with no ACP and 115 who had ACP before HSCT and showed that pts with ACP prior to HSCT had a significantly lower risk of mortality (see table ). Conclusions: Despite a diagnosis of cancer and hospitalization for HSCT, only 50% of patients had engaged in ACP. ACP at any time before HSCT was associated with higher one-year survival. Engagement in ACP is not necessarily inconsistent with hoping for the best outcome in HSCT. Further study is warranted to explore the reasons for engaging or not in ACP. </jats:p><jats:p> No significant financial relationships to disclose. </jats:p><jats:p> [Table: see text] </jats:p>",

Isocenter was 6 cm posterior to the tip of pubic‐arch and 1 cm inferior to the pubic‐brim. IMRT plans were prepared. Contours were exported to BAT‐system. Patients were positioned on couch using skin marks. US‐probe was used to obtain US‐images of prostate, bladder and rectum and aligned with CT‐images. Shifts in XYZ directions as recommended by BAT‐system were made and recorded. 4698 couch‐shifts for 42 patients were analyzed to study a correlation between prostate shifts vs. bladder and rectum volumes and prostate volume/location <jats:bold>on CT‐day</jats:bold>. Spatial location of prostate was defined as distance of prostate base to isocenter. Dose to 50% of bladder vs. volume was also studied. Pearson's correlation coefficient r, and P values were used for statistical analysis. <jats:bold>Results:</jats:bold> Mean and range of volumes (cc): bladder: 179, 42–582, rectum: 108, 28–223 and prostate: 55, 21–154. Mean prostate shifts (cm, ±SD): R/L (X): −0.047±0.16, AP/PA (Y): 0.14±0.3 and S/I (Z): 0.19±0.26. Lateral, AP/PA and S/I shifts were not correlated with volumes of bladder, rectum and prostate; bladder and prostate; and bladder and rectum, (P&gt;0.2), respectively. Smaller the rectal volume (P&lt;0.001) or diameter (P&lt;0.05) of rectum, larger was the anterior shift and vice‐versa. Smaller the prostate base distance to isocenter or volume, larger was superior shift and vice‐versa (P&lt;0.05). Dose to bladder decreased with increase in volume up to 300cc, reaching a plateau with further increase in volume (P&lt;0.001). <jats:bold>Conclusions:</jats:bold> Prostate location/volume and rectal‐volume, but not bladder‐volume on CT‐day influence prostate position. Bladder with 200–300cc volume, but not full bladder, would be optimum for patient comfort, minimizing bladder dose and US‐image quality.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> 2037 </jats:p><jats:p> Background: Motexafin gadolinium (MGd) is a novel anti-cancer agent that selectively localizes in tumors and is detectable by MRI. Previous studies of patients (pts) with brain metastases (BM) demonstrated the detection of occult lesions after MGd administration not visible with gadolinium MRI contrast. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if MRI scanning after MGd improves SRS treatment-planning and treatment outcome by identifying and better defining lesions that can be treated with the SRS boost. Methods: Pts with 1–4 BM (&lt; 4 cm diameter, or, if multiple, &lt; 3cm) received WBRT (37.5 Gy) and MGd, 5 mg/kg/day during weeks 2–3 of WBRT, plus MGd, 5 mg/kg prior to treatment planning MRI and prior to SRS (21 Gy for lesions = 2 cm, 18 Gy for lesions 2.1–3.0 cm, and 15 Gy for lesions 3.1–4.0 cm). MRI was obtained within 4 weeks prior to enrollment with standard contrast, and after WBRT for SRS treatment planning with MGd and standard contrast. Patients were followed for neurologic progression and survival. Results: 45 patients with either lung cancer (76%), breast cancer (11%), melanoma (7%), or other cancers (7%), a median age of 58 years (range 42–74), and a median of 2 BM (range 1–4) were evaluable. In 9 of 42 patients (21%) with MRI data available, the MGd-based treatment planning MRI demonstrated at least one occult lesion not visualized on the screening MRI. The MGd-based treatment planning MRI detected 1 occult lesion in 6 pts, 2 occult lesions in 1 patient, and 3 occult lesions in 2 patients. Median survival for evaluable pts is 10 months; median time to neurologic progression or radiologic progresssion is not reached at 15 months. Grade 3+ neurotoxicity was limited to 1 pt with tumor necrosis and 1 pt with motor weakness. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events were pneumonia (9%) and DVT (9%). Conclusions: MGd-based treatment planning MRI for SRS identified occult BM that are amenable to SRS and are undetected with standard gadolinium contrast agents in 21% of the pts enrolled in this phase II trial. Treatment with MGd, WBRT and SRS to all lesions visualized resulted in improved survival and local control compared with historical results. </jats:p><jats:p> [Table: see text] </jats:p>",
