The regional model is first tested in 10 yr of simulation with boundary forcing taken from observations and is shown to produce a reasonably good representation of the observed statistics of tropical cyclone numbers and locations. The model was then run for 10 yr with forcing from a present-day control run of the CCSM2 and then for 10 yr with forcing fields taken from the end of a long run with 6 times the present-day atmospheric CO2 concentration. The global-mean surface air temperature warming in the perturbed run is 4.5 K, while the surface warming in the tropical western North Pacific is about 3 K. The results of these experiments reveal no statistically significant change in basinwide tropical cyclone numbers in the peak season from July to October in response to the CO2 increase. However, a pronounced and statistically significant increase in tropical cyclone occurrence in the South China Sea is found. While the basinwide total number of storms remains nearly unchanged in the warm climate, there is a statistically significant increase in the average strength of the cyclones and in the number of the storms in the strongest wind categories.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>During the last decade, numerous studies have been carried out to predict future climate based on climatic models run on the global scale and fed by plausible scenarios about anthropogenic forcing to climate. Based on climatic model output, hydrologic models attempt then to predict future hydrologic regimes at regional scales. Much less systematic work has been done to estimate climatic uncertainty and to assess the climatic and hydrologic model outputs within an uncertainty perspective. In this study, a stochastic framework for future climatic uncertainty is proposed, based on the following lines: 1) climate is not constant but rather varying in time and expressed by the long-term (e.g., 30 yr) time average of a natural process, defined on a finescale; 2) the evolution of climate is represented as a stochastic process; 3) the distributional parameters of a process, marginal and dependence, are estimated from an available sample by statistical methods; 4) the climatic uncertainty is the result of at least two factors, the climatic variability and the uncertainty of parameter estimation; 5) a climatic process exhibits a scaling behavior, also known as long-range dependence or the Hurst phenomenon; and 6) because of this dependence, the uncertainty limits of the future are affected by the available observations of the past. The last two lines differ from classical statistical considerations and produce uncertainty limits that eventually are much wider than those of classical statistics. A combination of analytical and Monte Carlo methods is developed to determine uncertainty limits for the nontrivial scaling case. The framework developed is applied with temperature, rainfall, and runoff data from a catchment in Greece, for which data exist for about a century. The uncertainty limits are then superimposed onto deterministic projections up to 2050, obtained for several scenarios and climatic models combined with a hydrologic model. These projections indicate a significant increase of temperature in the future, beyond uncertainty bands, and no significant change of rainfall and runoff as they lie well within uncertainty limits.</jats:p>",

The workshop was part of a European research project studying the advantages and limitations of different participatory methods in the context of the Water Framework Directive. It involved policy makers, scientists, business representatives, and citizens from different parts of the island. On the first day, participants worked to envision a sustainable development future for the island and its water resources. Discussion was inspired by four alternative water development scenarios prepared by the organizers. Participants' vision statements emphasized a diversified development path and balanced water solutions. On the second day, participants worked to plan the actions needed to realize their common vision. The SW turned out to be a good method to initiate a multipartner dialogue, to include new stakeholders in the water policy debate, and to a certain extent, to promote learning between participants. On the other hand, it did not appear well suited to resolve conflicts and aid decisions in the face of scientific complexity and uncertainty. SW seems to be a good method for the “upstream,” preparatory, capacity‐building tasks of a planning process but not for the production of substantive decision outputs such as consensual agreements or action plans. The Naxos experiment also raised the centrality of framing, participant selection, and facilitation in participatory processes.</jats:p>",

Presently, architecture frameworks and methods within systems engineering often lacks support for mediating the credibility of the analyses made. This paper presents a method for enterprise architecture analyses that employs an evidential reasoning algorithm for multi‐attribute decision analysis. By doing this, the quality of the analyses as decision support is demonstrated. The method includes an assessment framework, based on established theories, for evaluating architecture scenarios functional and non‐functional qualities. The paper also presents a full scale case study where method has been employed at a large European power company.</jats:p>",

Plasmas 66, 062308 (2005)] {see also the previous work of Tushentsov et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 275002 (2001)]} were seen to lead to dynamic penetration of an ultrahigh intensity laser pulse into an overdense plasma. Two qualitatively different scenarios for the penetration of laser pulse into the overdense plasma were presented depending on the background density. In the first one, the penetration of laser energy occurs by soliton-like structures moving into the plasma. In the last one, electron cavitation occurs and the penetration is possible over a finite length only. A kinetic extension is made in this paper using Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. Vlasov simulations revealed a rich variety of new phenomena associated with the trapped particle dynamics, which cannot be described in fluid models. Most notably is the observation, during the penetration phase of the pump electromagnetic wave, of a beat-wave heating scenario induced by the Doppler shift on the reflected wave at the (moving) wave front. This beat-wave generates low-frequency acoustic-like electron modes characterized by coherent trapping-type structures in phase space leading to an efficient (nonstochastic) heating process.</jats:p>",

Three methods for analyzing uncertainty are explored to better allow their application to optimization of remediation designs: scenario analysis combined with one‐way sensitivity analysis, factorial analysis, and fractional factorial analysis. The three methods are analyzed using a deterministic optimization model for design of a permeable reactive barrier (PRB) to remediate nitrate contamination. Although the combined scenario/one‐way sensitivity approach is simpler than the factorial approaches, it has the comparative disadvantage of missing potentially important interactions between design inputs. Fractional factorial analysis is shown to have the added advantage of being useful in screening the importance of a number of model inputs without a large number of computer experiments. Hypothetical examples highlight the likely importance of uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity when choosing the optimal PRB design specification and the potential interaction of this input and the incoming pollutant concentration.</jats:p>",

The land scheme explicitly treats soil freezing/thawing processes, surface energy exchange, and water fluxes, including snow cover effects. Modeled soil temperature showed large cold biases in the cold seasons, especially in high latitudes, which likely resulted from shallow and simplified soil column with zero heat flux condition at the bottom and insufficient snow representation. Two types of frozen ground were classified according to monthly soil temperatures: “permafrost” for regions with the maximum active layer thickness less than 4 m and “seasonally frozen ground.” Simulated present‐day (1980–1999) distribution is in good agreement with observational estimates for both. Under climatic warming forcing, projected change in land and subterranean hydrothermal regimes shows amplification in higher latitudes. Approximately 60% of the present‐day permafrost regions would degrade into seasonally frozen ground by 2100. In the circum‐Arctic basins, increased precipitation would lead to a 13.7% increase in freshwater discharge into the Arctic Ocean. The limitations of the current model configuration and the implied reliability of the results are discussed, and the future improvements and potentials of such modeling approach are also presented. A medium‐resolution (∼2.8° mesh) ensemble produces qualitatively similar results for the hydrothermal regimes in the cold regions, although some local features were inevitably smoothed out, giving different quantitative estimates.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Water stress is a very important limiting factor for cotton cultivation in Jeneponto District, South Sulawesi Provine. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize water resources. One alternative is to obtain potency of water resources using soil-climate-crop simulation model to calculate ETR/ETM ratio (water satisfaction index). ETR/ETM ratio describing efficiency of water used by the plant. Based on the ratio, scenario of proper planting period can be predicted to minimize drought risk. Based on this idea, an experiment was conducted to mapping of planting periods and water used to enhance the expansion of cotton plantation. The results of research show that potential planting period for Bangkala and West Bangkala districts start from the 3rd dekad of September until the 1st dekad of January, while the best period is on the 1st dekad of November. Potential of planting period for Bontoramba and Turatea districts starts from the 3rd dekad of September until the 1st dekad of May, while the best period is on the 3rd dekad of November. In addition, the appropriate planting period for Batang, Kelara, and Rumbia districts start from the 3rd dekad of September until the 3rd dekad of April, while the best period is on the 1st dekad of December. Requirement for supplementary irrigation for 140 days after planting is about 180-304 mm. However, common necessity of cotton supplementary irrigation for 1-35 day is about 25 – 51 mm, while that is during flowering and fruiting (35 -60 day after planting), ripening (60-105 day after planting), and ripening (105-140 day after planting), are about 40-62, 115-135, 0-68 mm, respectively. It is concluded, deficit and surplus of water for less than 60 dap is not significantly influence plant production, but that is for 60 – 105 day after planting significantly reduces yield of the plant.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>"

Global climate model scenarios are evaluated and selected based on historic 20th century simulations. A statistical downscaling method is then applied to produce a regional data set. To facilitate the use of climate projections in hydrologic assessment, additional statistical mapping may be applied to generate synthetic station time series. Finally, results are presented from a regional climate model that indicate important differences in the regional climate response from what is captured by global models and statistical downscaling.
