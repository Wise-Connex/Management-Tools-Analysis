Process emphasizes diversity, openness, and consensus but is not fully equipped to offer a shared vision in political arenas dominated by fragmentation and conflict. Newurbanism has revived the idea that planning is about physical design, but this concept does not fully embrace a holistic vision of community building. This article explains howsustainable development extends the positive attributes of the first two approaches and offers a multigenerational vision of community building. This vision integrates multiple societal values and enhances local imagination, understanding, and commitment to defining solutions for the common good. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The installation and operation of public facilities, such as schools or hospitals, involve important amounts of public spending, and therefore need to be carefully planned. Research efforts made since the early 1960s led to the development of a rich collection of optimization models and solution methods for public facility planning problems. It must be recognized, however, that the practical impact of the efforts made up to now is rather weak. This paper presents an interactive, user-friendly decision-support tool for public facility planning where the capabilities of geographic information systems and advanced optimization methods are put together. We hope that it will contribute to bridge the gap between research and practice that characterizes the way public facility planning is made at present. The application of the decision-support tool is illustrated for a real-world setting. </jats:p>",

This paper reports on research undertaken for the Assembly on the preparation of the spatial planning framework and identifies the initial stages in that process. The research itself draws upon a study of policy documents relevant to Wales, a comparative review of strategic spatial planning practices in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and the identification of the expectations of stakeholders for the framework. The paper illustrates how the concept of ‘spatial planning’ is being addressed and defined in the process of preparing the framework. The material provides an interesting insight into the emergent practice of spatial planning in the United Kingdom through a case study of Wales with wider relevance for spatial planning activity in Europe. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last two decades shifting human resources, socioeconomic potentials, and innovations in information technology and communication have all but overthrown the formal order of the planning and management of urban systems. The authors trace the causes to misplaced priorities in urban governance and related issues, via the interface of infrastructure systems and land use. They survey some major theoretical and applied decision-support systems collaborative planning systems, and collaborative decision-support systems which have been advanced to date, indicating their strengths and weaknesses with regard to their ability to anchor public participation and professional collaboration in key planning and management issues. They highlight the fact that, although relevant multivariate, disaggregated, and incoherent small-scale researches do yield high dividends, their lack of cohesive interrelationship is related to the fragmentation of urban systems—despite various attempts at bringing about sustainable development. They suggest that decisionmaking can be effective when all aspects involved are visually related and collectively executed. They conclude by emphasizing that a comprehensive approach needs to be adopted for the planning and management of urban centers in order to enhance systems performance, human interaction, and contained developments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors describe the nature of the planning policies relating to the container industry of Hong Kong, a major international container trade centre, at territorial and district planning levels. Informed by the concepts of transaction costs, the authors attempt to ascertain whether the planning permission system in Hong Kong is promarket, antimarket, or market-neutral with respect to the container industry, and whether the stated statutory district planning policy of permitting and concentrating open storage in specifically designated Open Storage (OS) zones has been followed. A probit model is developed to evaluate 195 sets of nonaggregate and cross-sectional data regarding planning applications to the Town Planning Board for the years 1991 to 1998. The evaluation is conducted in terms of two refutable empirical hypotheses regarding the container industry. The findings suggest that the Hong Kong planning permission mechanism is market neutral towards the container industry and that the statutory district forward planning policy for that industry has not been followed in the development control process. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> As the Internet grows in popularity, telecommunications infrastructure in the United States continues to increase in capacity and geographic reach to meet market demand. Important components of this infrastructure include the commercial fiber-optic backbones used to transport digital information between locations. The spatial organization of commercial Internet backbones reflects an increasingly competitive privatized market for service provision, in which certain locations are more accessible and better connected than others. The authors have three objectives. First, they explore the current state of the telecommunications industry, paying special attention to current trends, mergers, and new company business models. Second, they use a standardized methodology to examine the topological structure of the US commercial Internet and the resulting differences in city accessibility. Third, this methodology is put to the test by an exploration of an empirical database of 41 network providers in the United States. Results suggest that significant changes in city accessibility to the commercial Internet occurred between 1997 and 2000. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> First Nations treaty negotiations and land-claim settlements require the valuation of large areas of land for diverse land uses, including usage which is difficult to quantify in absolute or monetary terms. The authors report an attempt to develop a methodology for seeking consensus on land values for the latter land-use activities, using Gestalt valuation. They offer an alternative to planner-driven land valuation, placing the valuation responsibility instead on stakeholders. The methodology is justified and explained. The authors introduce different types of decision-support information products that can be derived to facilitate consensus building. They summarise experience gained in an evaluation of the proposed methodological procedure, in which university students were used as a sample. They conclude that computing technology has advanced sufficiently to make it reasonably straightforward to collect information about individual stakeholders' land valuations, and that the resultant information can be packaged effectively in a collaborative spatial decision support system to facilitate consensus building. Ongoing research is introduced. </jats:p>",

Particular emphasis was placed upon the comparison of evaluation results produced by the two methods within a geographic information system (GIS). This comparison highlighted the advantages of the GIS-fuzzy set approach as follows. First, it was revealed that the fuzzy set approach could reduce excessive abstraction or exaggeration in environmental phenomena. Hence, without the loss of valuable information, more accurate decisionmaking can be rendered. Second, by integrating membership functions into GIS, greater efficiency of the entire evaluation process was achieved. </jats:p>",

EB models consider householders as separate entities, whose residential behavior is defined by the properties of the surrounding infrastructure and of other householders. The power of the EB approach lies in its ability to interpret directly different forms of decisionmaker behavior in the model's terms. Several scenarios of residential interactions between members of local ethnic groups are compared on the basis of detailed georeferenced data taken from Israel's 1995 Population Census. The model simulates very closely the residential dynamics during the period 1955–95; the importance of the qualitative aspects of residential choice, as captured by the EB approach, is demonstrated by this correspondence. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Gibson's ecological theory of perception has received considerable attention within psychology literature, as well as in computer vision and robotics. However, few have applied Gibson's approach to agent-based models of human movement, because the ecological theory requires that individuals have a vision-based mental model of the world, and for large numbers of agents this becomes extremely expensive computationally. Thus, within current pedestrian models, path evaluation is based on calibration from observed data or on sophisticated but deterministic route-choice mechanisms; there is little open-ended behavioural modelling of human-movement patterns. One solution which allows individuals rapid concurrent access to the visual information within an environment is an ‘exosomatic visual architecture’, where the connections between mutually visible locations within a configuration are prestored in a lookup table. Here we demonstrate that, with the aid of an exosomatic visual architecture, it is possible to develop behavioural models in which movement rules originating from Gibson's principle of affordance are utilised. We apply large numbers of agents programmed with these rules to a built-environment example and show that, by varying parameters such as destination selection, field of view, and steps taken between decision points, it is possible to generate aggregate movement levels very similar to those found in an actual building context. </jats:p>",

It focuses on two important organizational features: the chief executive officer and the planning activities adopted by Greek firms. The study attempts first, to describe and identify the CEO’s characteristics, opinions, and predisposition towards planning, and second, to illustrate the strategic planning process in Greece. The paper argues that country environments in transition may have a profound effect on executives’ predisposition into designing planning process. Although it was found that both CEOs and top management teams intensively participate in the planning process, which was perceived as highly formalized and sophisticated, the lack of advanced tools and techniques creates serious questions of whether planning is a valuable resource for the Greek companies or companies operating in other highly uncertain environments.</jats:p>",

Außer traditionellen wissenschaftlichen, universitären und schulischen Gebieten pflegen das lebendige Latein verschiedene internationale Organisationen mit vielfältigen Aktivitäten, von wissenschaftlichen Kongressen bis zu lustigen Ferien.

We refer to these encodings as hybrid encodings. An investigation of these encodings is important, because this can give insights into what kinds of planning problems can be solved faster with hybrid encodings.</jats:p><jats:p>Encodings based on partial–order planning and state–space planning have been reported in previous research. We propose a new type of encoding called a <jats:italic>unifying encoding</jats:italic> that subsumes these two encodings. We also report on several other hybrid encodings. Next, we show how the satisfiability framework can be extended to incremental planning. State–space encoding is attractive because of its lower size and causal encoding is attractive because of its highest flexibility in reordering steps. We show that hybrid encodings have a higher size and a lower flexibility in step reordering and, thus, do not combine the best of these encodings. We discuss in detail several specific planning scenarios where hybrid encodings are likely to be superior to nonhybrid encodings.</jats:p>",

It explores the potential for Web‐enabling enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for small and medium‐sized companies on a per‐seat, per‐month basis. Findings from field research suggest that, while the ASP business model offers many advantages for customers, few companies are prepared to outsource their mission‐critical ERP systems to ASPs. This situation has led to many large and small ASP vendors to re‐think their strategic business plans, with some high profile failures. Evaluating the situation from a market, organizational and technical analysis of the ASP industry, this paper argues that, while the ASP model is currently immature, the next three years will see the emergence of more clearly defined enterprise ASP offerings from key players in the software and computing services industry.</jats:p>",

Using linked data from surveys conducted in four counties of northern China in 1991 and 1994, we compare reproductive behavior against prior fertility preferences and show when and where women change from wanting to not wanting more children. The acceptance of policy-sanctioned family size follows a development gradient and reflects the degree of enforcement. High acceptance occurs in the most urban, industrialized county and in the county with the most rigid family planning policy. Acceptance is weaker among women living in the poorest county and in the county where enforcement is most lenient.</jats:p>",

Although not all computers will necessarily have the type fonts to print all characters, at least all computers will be able to recognize what characters are required for proper display of text in almost any language. However the Unicode standard presupposes that each language has a script consisting of a finite number of agreed-upon characters. Some languages still lack such agreement. As planning has gone forward for Unicode, more and more code points are being assigned, leaving ever less conveniently accessed code points for future expansion. This article describes the Unicode project. Then it describes the special challenge of encoding Chinese characters. Finally it uses the example of Hokkien, a “dialect” of Chinese spoken by most people in Taiwan, to explore the problem of unorthodox, unstable, or unofficial scripts. Political forces and technical considerations make it difficult to include such scripts in Unicode. As Unicode becomes the “de facto” standard for writing human languages, script innovations will presumably become less and less likely to receive wide use.</jats:p>",

I propose that the experience of ‘mixed race’ identity can offer opportunities for the performance of racialized identities. Drawing from qualitative interviews, I suggest that some ‘mixed race’ women put into play racialized performances, demonstrating a desire to create new meanings out of imposed hierarchical and dualistic racial orders. They effectively take advantage of multiple, dynamic, and ambiguous racialized spaces. I begin by critiquing recent examinations of performativity in geography, pointing out that, although they contribute towards a greater understanding of the relationship between gender and performance, processes of racialization in regards to performativity have not yet been fully unravelled. Through the stories of some ‘mixed race’ women, I chronicle racialized performances in the social landscape in order to ground the notion of performativity through a racialized lens. </jats:p>",

In the longer term, an emerging power (eg, China) may come to challenge American supremacy and with it the dominant position of English. However, even in the event of such a realignment, the language of that emerging power (eg, Chinese) may not succeed in arresting the advantage English already derives from critical mass. To have any chance of global spread, a challenger would need to possess structural characteristics — namely, minimal inflectional morphology, non-tonal phonology, and a non-logographic script — that would facilitate its acquisition by individuals with largely utilitarian motivations. Alternatively, to evolve these characteristics, a challenger would need to be subjected to minimal standardization and be allowed the freedom to accommodate user-driven change, including indigenization. Finally, it would need to be perceived as a vehicle for modernizing values. While hypothetical challengers (eg, Chinese, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Russian, Arabic, or Esperanto) all exhibit some of these characteristics, only English exhibits all of them at present and for the foreseeable future. For these reasons, the worldwide dominance of English is likely to survive even a hypothetical passing of the American Era.</jats:p>",

A special penalty function, mutation, crossover probabilities, and a special accuracy of the stopping criterion were used to get the global minimum of the problem. The minimum drilling depth is achieved at the minimum values for kick-point, inclination, and angle build-up and drop-off rates. The minimum parameters reduce the dogleg severity, which in turn reduce the chances for operational problems like high torque and drag. The optimized design has been compared with the conventional design (based on trial and error method) and WELLDES program (based on Sequential Unconstraint minimization Technique) for a well drilled in the Gulf of Suez (application I) and with conventional design for a theoretical well (Application II). Results of the comparison have been validated by genetic algorithm software. The optimization model reduced the total drilling length of the two applications. This was achieved while all other operational parameters were kept within the limiting constraints and casing setting depths were taken into consideration. In contrast, WELLDES program and conventional design have some variables within their constraint limits and the casing setting depths are outside their consideration.</jats:p>",

Firms are the primary units through which these processes operate. I reinterpret portfolio theory to provide a novel way of explaining and modeling the spatial implications of control structures and organizational decisions within and between firms. In this paper, I argue that each activity of the firm is like an asset with an expected rate of return and a level of risk. Firms implement spatial strategies to manage risk that trade profits for reductions in risk. These strategies encourage geographic switching and perpetuate regional disequilibria in production technology and employment. Risk management and the structure of control in a production chain explain the geographic distribution of economic activity better than do transaction costs, flexible specialization, or agglomeration economies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>A formalism for an independent dose verification of the Gamma Knife treatment planning is developed. It is based on the approximation that isodose distribution for a single shot is in the shape of an ellipsoid in three‐dimensional space. The dose profiles for a phantom along each of the three major axes are fitted to a function which contains the terms that represent the contributions from a point source, an extrafocal scattering, and a flat background. The fitting parameters are extracted for all four helmet collimators, at various shot locations, and with different skull shapes. The 33 parameters of a patient's skull shape obtained from the Skull Scaling Instrument measurements are modeled for individual patients. The relative doses for a treatment volume in the form of 31×31×31 matrix of points are extracted from the treatment planning system, the Leksell GammaPlan (LGP). Our model evaluates the relative doses using the same input parameters as in the LGP, which are skull measurement data, shot location, weight, γ‐angle of the head frame, and helmet collimator size. For 29 single‐shot cases, the discrepancy of dose at the focus point between the calculation and the LGP is found to be within −1% to 2%. For multi‐shot cases, the value and the coordinate of the maximum dose point from the calculation agree within ±7% and ±3 mm with the LGP results. In general, the calculated doses agree with the LGP calculations within ±10% for the off‐center locations. Results of calculation with this method for the dimension and location of the 50% isodose line are in good agreement with results from Leksell GammaPlan. Therefore, this method can be served as a useful tool for secondary quality assurance of Gamma Knife treatment plans.</jats:p>",

In this paper a solution that would allow collaboration on a wide scale is presented. The forecasting approach is called “rank and share” and uses input from the retailer’s existing planning process – the category management process. The benefit of using category management as the basis is that the retailer can scale up collaboration with a large number of suppliers without increasing planning resources. For the supplier the benefit is point of sales forecasts at the time of the assortment decision. To support this collaborative forecasting process there is a need for more robust replenishment solutions, new measures to illustrate benefits, and for a distributed planning architecture and software. Potential solutions for these are also discussed in the paper.</jats:p>",

The historical reasons for the dominance of English in this sphere are well known: the language’s imperial history, its status as a world language, its role as a medium for political opposition during the apartheid conflict, and the accumulation of capital and economic influence by English-speakers from the mid-nineteenth century onward. However, the day-to-day economic basis for the continuing dominance of English at the apex of South African society has hardly been considered.</jats:p>",

Overall, the countryside showed a higher population increase than the municipality centres. Smaller population centres suffered a population decline. The increase in population in the countryside was strongest in areas surrounding the metropolises and around regional centres. Statistical analysis showed that population change outside population centres mainly varies with the average income, labour-market access, and taxation values or housing costs in the municipalities. This process of change has run directly counter to the policy that was formulated for small municipalities from the end of the 1960s onwards. The growth in rural population was spontaneous for the most part, and more or less in conflict with the plans of the municipalities. </jats:p>",

The brief comparison of formal problems concerning sludge disposal in Poland and Sweden is also discussed. Requirements of phosphorus recovery and recycling of phosphorus to the phosphate industry make sludge fractionation in combination with product recovery a new development in wastewater handling. Phosphorus recovery from sludges with chemical bound phosphorus requires complex and expensive process technology and may therefore lead to increased regional sludge management with a central sludge treatment plant.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Studies of resistance challenge overly structural conceptions of social systems by emphasizing the various forms of creative practice operating within hegemonic space. Yet, by illustrating the different ways that agents respond to a dominant system, resistance theory inadvertently establishes that system as a preestablished entity. Thus, although resistance theory endeavours to recognize the ongoing deconstructs of systems, it simultaneously reifies the system as primary. In response, I argue that this problem is not indicative of a flaw in resistance theory per se, but rather of a flaw in the conception of systems it operates with. Drawing upon Butler's work on performativity, I develop an alternative theory of systems that accounts for social coherence and stratified relations of power through creative forms of social practice alone. Rather than depending on sociostructural concepts such as ideology, hegemony, and normative space, a performative theory of systems situates creative social practice as the engine of social coherence. In this framework theories of resistance are redundant because creative practices are the rule of systems rather than a challenge to their stability. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Over the last decade there has been a surge in academic and scientific inquiry into disparities in environmental hazards among diverse communities. Much of the evidence points to a general pattern of disproportionate exposures to toxics among communities of color and the poor, with racial differences often persisting across economic strata. Although results have implications for the politics of environmental decisionmaking, most of these analyses are limited to illustrating how inequities in exposures and health risks are spread across the landscape, while shedding little light on their origins or the reasons for their persistence. Previous attempts to theorize the causes of environmental inequality have focused on procedural justice in the regulatory arena, emphasizing civil rights jurisprudence and social theories on individual and institutional discrimination. Although these approaches offer insights into the epistemology of environmental inequality, they fail adequately to account for the political economy of discrimination relating to industrial location behavior and racialized labor markets. By integrating relevant social and legal theories with a spatialized economic critique, this paper formulates a more supple theory of environmental discrimination. How the political economy of place shapes distributions of people and pollution and ultimately gives rise to environmental inequality are revealed by exploring the following factors: historical patterns of industrial development and racialized labor markets; suburbanization and segregation; and economic restructuring. This multidisciplinary approach to theorizing the dynamic of environmental discrimination provides a new framework for future policymaking and community organizing to address environmental and economic justice. Implications of this broader framework for policy and politics are discussed in the conclusion. </jats:p>",

Interventions by critical geographers such as Ian Maxey, and feminist geographers, including Cindi Kate, Heidi Nast, Gillian Rose, and J-K Gibson-Graham, have provided important insights into the political commitment geographers bring to their research, critical and reflexive forms of engagement, and the politics of fieldwork, representational strategies, and collaborative research. This paper examines the author's collaborative critical engagement with two organizations—the Goa Foundation and the Jagrut Goenkaranchi Fouz (Vigilant Goan Army)—involved in resisting tourism development in Goa, India. Collaboration took several forms, particularly the author masquerading as a tour operator, Walter Kurtz, in order to elicit information concerning the contravention of Goan environmental laws by hotel developers. Drawing, in particular, upon the insights of the aforementioned feminist geographers concerning identity, difference, and power in the conducting of fieldwork, I examine the problematic ethical and power relations that were encountered during the performance of collaborative research. In so doing, I argue for a relational and reflexive ethics of research that is attentive to difference in seeking a common ground with resisting others. </jats:p>",

The ambiguity surrounding the choice of legal basis for environmental acts based in Articles 130s and 100a opened the way for a ‘legal-basis game’, where EU institutions chose the legal basis partly on the basis of political considerations. In the period 1987–93, the two most important legal bases for environmental acts (Articles 130s and 100a) were subject to very different procedures for adoption (unanimity and qualified majority voting, respectively). From 1993 onwards, both articles were subject to qualified majority voting. After a general discussion of the choice of legal basis and its significance for policy, this paper examines the choice of legal basis for environmental legislation during the period 1987–99. I conclude that, although the legal-basis game is played out with respect to certain acts, there is little evidence that it is a regular and systematic feature of the policy process in the EU. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I address two issues of general relevance to contemporary debates in economic geography: first, the organisational and spatial implications of new information technologies for the economic landscape; and, second, the enduring role of place to digital capitalism. Specifically, I examine the organisational evolution of multichannel retailing in Toronto from a geographical perspective. Bricks-and-mortar retailers are increasingly pursuing a multichannel strategy by operating an Internet-based web store alongside the existing network of physical retail outlets. I therefore evaluate the organisational implications of the adoption of business-to-consumer e-commerce (e-tailing) technology for six Canadian bricks-and-mortar retailers based in Toronto and assess how the associated changes in business structure have been inscribed upon the urban landscape. The argument is developed in three sections. First, I discuss how the formula for competitive advantage in the new (r)etail markets of the developed world has shifted from a pure play to a multichannel organisational paradigm. Second, I provide a background to the development of Canadian e-commerce and an overview of the empirical methodologies employed during the research. Third, the focus of the paper moves ‘behind the web store’ to spatialise the physical places that constitute the fulfilment infrastructure of e-tailing as sequentially linked stages in Internet commodity chains. I evaluate the impact of the Internet commodity chain upon the geographical organisation of each retailer, and, in particular, consider whether the unique logistical requirements of e-tailing have stimulated spatial processes of disintermediation and reintermediation. It is argued that, when read through the lens of Toronto, e-tailing has incurred limited organisational disruption and is characterised by a distinctive geography of integration between online and offline retailing services within the urban space of the city. I conclude the paper by contextualising the findings within themes for conceptual debate in economic geography. </jats:p>",

Travel time has received less attention—an unfortunate oversight in our view, as people's travel decisions are determined by time rather than by distance. By using data from the 1998 Netherlands National Travel Survey, we have considered travel time associated with trip purpose and transport mode, and have shown that sociodemographic factors and residential context influence daily travel time. Gender, number of workers in the household, age, and education all have a significant impact on travel time. The effects of car ownership and household income are only indirect, operating through mode choice and activity participation. Travel time for car drivers tends to rise with the degree of urbanisation of the residential environment. Further, in the polycentric metropolitan region of the Randstad, travel times by car are greater than in the monocentric regions of the country. It is also shown that in the Netherlands cycling and walking are still important travel modes, especially for shopping purposes. These results may be attributed to the long history of urbanisation and to planning policy in the Netherlands. </jats:p>",

The data was analysed to assess the association between growth and low growth firms and their use of 'planning' or 'emergent' alternatives within the seven aspects. Some planning approaches were associated with growth. Using a written business plan, however, was not.

We tested these hypotheses in a longitudinal study of a utility company undergoing reengineering planning. The findings supported the proposition that reactions to planning change depend upon perceptions of procedural justice in that employee obligations and intention to remain were only adversely affected by planning when employees perceived the process as unjust. Surprisingly, planning change did not significantly affect trust for employees who perceived the process as unjust and actually resulted in an increase in trust for employees who perceived the process as just.

In this study of 174 affected adults, the overall quality of life was reported to be adequate, although it was significantly decreased within the spiritual/psychological domain. Approximately 62% agreed that having Marfan syndrome significantly affected their reproductive decision‐making. This view was correlated with age of diagnosis, mitral valve prolapse, and the view that Marfan syndrome has adverse consequences on life. Sixty‐nine percent reported personal interest in prenatal testing for Marfan syndrome. Respondents most commonly cited increased worries about personal health and the recurrence risk as ways that Marfan syndrome affects their reproductive decisions. Age, striae, back pain, and low quality of life were each independently correlated with lack of sex drive. These results affirm the importance of both clinical and psychosocial issues on affected adults' reproductive decision‐making and sexual well‐being. Genetic professionals are ideally positioned to discuss concerns about quality of life and reproduction with patients with Marfan syndrome and refer those with significant concerns for further evaluation and management.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we explain why the Hong Kong Housing Authority (HKHA) is embarking upon a substantial programme of management reform to outsource the management and maintenance of 600 000 units of public rental housing. An international management-reform analytical framework is developed which classifies reforms under the headings of finance, management, ownership, and performance. The application of this framework to reform at the HKHA indicates that the emphasis is upon market-led approaches. The management-reform framework is able to explain aspects of the HKHA approach in relation to searches for reduced costs, downsizing, clearer standards, higher quality, and more customer-responsive services. Alone, however, it is unable to explain fully the reform programme. The housing-policy reforms and the government's aim to increase levels of home-ownership are shown to be major contributory factors to the direction adopted by the HKHA. These case-study findings assert the importance of policy processes for the explanation of management reforms and have implications for the analysis of management reforms in many settings. </jats:p>",

It combines a delayed picture-naming task with a priming procedure. While participants prepared the production of a depicted object's name, they heard an auditory target word. If the prepared picture name and the target word were semantically or phonologically related, the ERP waveform to the target word tended less towards the negative when compared to an unrelated control. These effects were widely distributed. By contrast, if participants performed a nonlinguistic task on the depicted object (natural size judgment), the semantic effect was still obtained while the phonological effect disappeared. This suggests that the former effect indexes semantic activation involved in object processing while the latter effect indexes word-form activation specific to lexical processing. The data are discussed in the context of models of lexical access in speech production.</jats:p>",

The educational development of deprived groups and regions is therefore a matter of serious concern for policy planners, especially in countries like India which have a federal structure and a democratic polity Of the available educational methods, open and distance learning (ODL) is considered to be the cheapest and most accessible, due mainly to its innovative and flexible characteristics that allow appropriate media choices for student-centred approaches to teaching and learning. ODL extends the benefits of new knowledge and technical know-how and is thus a powerful instrument in the equalization of educational opportunities and in broadening the base of human capital formation. Against this background, the performance of ODL in India over the past four decades is reviewed. The author analyses the evidence and demonstrates the extent to which ODL has succeeded in improving access and equity in the provision of services. The factors that help or hinder in extending the reach of education among deprived groups and regions are identified, and the implications for policy planning are discussed. The implementation of the recommended policy measures would contribute to the educational development of disadvantaged groups, raise the overall competence levels and earnings of the working population, improve the quality of life, and reduce disparities. These goals are critical to ensure social harmony, political stability and sustainable development. </jats:p>",

We use four key elements of employability (employability assets, the deployment of assets, the presentation of assets, and context) as an analytical framework in order to analyse the manner in which job seekers' personal characteristics, social and family circumstances, and perceptions of the labour market affect their ability to pursue employment opportunities. The results of interviews carried out with 115 long-term unemployed job seekers show that individual and family circumstances and attitudes towards work and job seeking are likely to be increasingly important barriers given the context of a relative lack of demand-side problems and the availability of lower-skilled jobs in expanding industries. In particular, many long-term unemployed job seekers were reluctant to seek jobs in the expanding service sectors of the local economy. Although the concept of employability provides a useful theoretical and policy framework for analysing long-term unemployment issues, models based upon an employability framework should be expanded to incorporate the role of employers and so integrate supply-side and demand-side perspectives. </jats:p>",

It is remarkable that despite government legislationand research, which stretches back over 20 years in both Europe and North America, discharge planning remains problematic. Furthermore, it is an activity that requires collaboration between health and social care agencies. In the United Kingdom there is a new emphasis and incentive on managing acute hospital beds, which in turn results in shorter stays in hospital. In London, discharge planners face additional problems because of social, economic and environmental factors.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Method.</jats:bold>  Using a case study design, 19 nurses were interviewed using the critical incident approach to obtain their perceptions of the discharge process.

It is essential that social and medical diagnoses run parallel and that accurate information is collated and communicated within the multidisciplinary team. Further research into the impact of time pressures on communication, interprofessional working and the discharge process is needed.</jats:p>",

These migrant peoples occupy an ambiguous social space within Auckland: they represent the visible face of the world's largest Polynesian city, yet are occupants of some of the city's poorest and least health-promoting housing. Through considering the balance between choice and constraint, we examine how housing costs, poverty, and cultural practices converge to influence household expenditure decisions. Specifically, we are interested in the ways health-promoting behaviours (for example, obtaining fresh food) and utilising health care services are ‘discounted’ (that is, postponed or substituted with cheaper alternatives) because of costs associated with structural changes in housing and the broader policy context. We draw on narratives gathered from in-depth interviews conducted with seventeen Samoan and Cook Island families undertaken in the South Auckland suburb of Otara in mid-2000. Our findings illustrate a lack of ‘fit’ between state housing stock and its occupants. We conclude that, although a recent return to a policy of income-related rents may alleviate these conditions, further longitudinal and community-supported research is required to monitor whether health inequalities are in fact lessened through income-related interventions alone. </jats:p>",

With regard to the development of regional science as a field of enquiry with its own theoretical and empirical postulates, attention focuses on what David Harvey has referred to as a “utopianism of spatial form”, defined by the idea that spatial constructs can serve to control social processes in positive ways, thus using space to evade historical change. In building bridges from the Isardian promise of the past of regional science to its multiple futures, we suggest that the field today may break out of its current ‘isolated state’ by entering into creative dialogue with the metaphors animating three research streams: (1) an ‘analytical turn’ in Marxist economic geography; (2) a Marshallian ‘New Regionalism’; and (3) a ‘cultural turn’ perceived to be occurring within the field of radical political economy. Each stream, addressed here as a successive and broader departure from the more orthodox “utopianism of spatial form” in spatial and regional science, is briefly surveyed in turn. Drawing on the metaphor of borders and border-lands, we conclude by arguing that rather than view each research strand as an ‘improvement’ on its predecessor they should be viewed as the grounds for a potentially rich cross-fertilization between spatial science and various fields of nonorthodox economics. </jats:p>",

This study characterizes special-needs households that are located in the vicinity of a chemical weapons storage site in Alabama. For this study, a special-needs household is defined as a residence having at least one person with physical or mental problems, a transportation dependence, or a child who is home alone at limes and requires assistance from outside the family or current circle of relatives, friends, and neighbors to take specific protective actions. The special-needs households were identified throngh a myriad of collection methods, including random sampling, saturation mailing/self-registration, targeted distribution/self-registration, agency and support provider lists, and referrals. Attitudes toward specific protective actions and an assessment of the ability of the special-needs household to take those actions were also sought out. Approximately 9 percent of the community's households were identified as containing persons with special needs who require assistance during emergencies. The study also identified the highly perishable nature of special-needs population records maintained by emergency management agencies. During a data verification process conducted 3 months after the data collection effort concluded, almost half of the previously identified 3,294 individuals with special needs had their situation change or could not be reached for verification. Concurrently, 1,090 new persons with special needs identified themselves as needing assistance. Recommendations are made to the emergency planning community for addressing the support needs of special populations. </jats:p>",

Current methods are slow, inefficient, and costly. Scientific techniques have not been fully implemented within the planning process, yet such plans are increasingly needed to meet water quality and Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) requirements. The objectives of this study are to (a) utilize the web for accessing an integrated science‐based land use decision support system; (b) link decision tools, models, and databases to the user via the web; (c) link distributed models and databases for enhanced planning efficiency; and (d) integrate the above into an easily usable and readily accessible system. The procedures resulting in the initial design involved planning expertise and focus groups' input. The system was developed in partnership with the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and several state agencies. A survey of 150 certified conservation planners, the end users, was conducted to identify the data sets and planning tools needed. Data, tools, and models then were selected and integrated into a web accessible system. Specifically, the first generation used a web interactive Geographic Information System (GIS) that overlaid onto digital orthoquads and/or soils polygons field boundaries, transportation, hydrologic features (such as drains, rivers, lakes, etc.), and high pesticide risk runoff or infiltration areas. Conservation planners found they could save time with the system. Clients could access the system quickly to help them prepare for meeting with their planner. Previously acquiring GIS maps in some cases had been a lengthy process that limited use of the information in land use decisions.</jats:p>",

In this paper we examine ways in which urban regeneration schemes in Britain are attempting to incorporate consideration of health impact into their planning and development. It concentrates especially on diverse ways that different stakeholders perceive the outcomes of these schemes and the significance for health. The paper is based on two case studies of urban development projects, focusing on housing improvement and training for unemployed people, in a London borough where levels of deprivation are high and various forms of social exclusion affect large numbers of people. The methods used aimed to represent the views of different types of stakeholders, by means of interviews and focus groups with a range of stakeholders in these schemes. Health impact assessment needs to be evidence based. We discuss the evidence for potential health impact of regeneration projects through effects on housing and employment as determinants of health. We focus especially on the ways in which this evidence can be viewed and used by different stakeholders, and how far their perceptions seemed to match with research findings from public health. We consider the potential and the limitations for health improvement associated with urban regeneration in view of the case studies presented here. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Remote sensing technology has great potential for acquisition of detailed and accurate land-use information for management and planning of urban regions. However, the determination of land-use data with high geometric and thematic accuracy is generally limited by the availability of adequate remote sensing data, in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and digital image analysis techniques. This study introduces a methodology using information on image spatial form—landscape metrics—to describe urban land-use structures and land-cover changes that result from urban growth. The analysis is based on spatial analysis of land-cover structures mapped from digitally classified aerial photographs of the urban region Santa Barbara, CA. Landscape metrics were calculated for segmented areas of homogeneous urban land use to allow a further characterization of the land use of these areas. The results show a useful separation and characterization of three urban land-use types: commercial development, high-density residential, and low-density residential. Several important structural land-cover features were identified for this study. These were: the dominant general land cover (built up or vegetation), the housing density, the mean structure and plot size, and the spatial aggregation of built-up areas. For two test areas in the Santa Barbara region, changes (urban growth) in the urban spatial land-use structure can be described and quantified with landscape metrics. In order to discriminate more accurately between the three land-cover types of interest, the landscape metrics were further refined into what are termed ‘landscape metric signatures’ for the land-use categories. The analysis shows the importance of the spatial measurements as second-order image information that can contribute to more detailed mapping of urban areas and towards a more accurate characterization of spatial urban growth pattern. </jats:p>",

The method explicitly considers three sources of uncertainty: path ambiguity, velocity uncertainty, and observation uncertainty. In the uncertainty model, the position of an obstacle at a certain time point is represented by a probabilistic distribution over possible positions on each possible path of the moving obstacle. Using this model, the best robot motion is selected in a decision-theoretic way. By considering the distribution, not the range, of uncertainty, more efficient behavior of the robot is realized.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT:</jats:bold> Since 1989, the government of Pierce County, Washington, has prepared four watershed action plans. The watersheds cover almost 800,000 acres and include about 600,000 residents and diverse land uses, from the city of Tacoma to Mount Rainier National Park. The primary purpose of these plans was to address water quality impacts from nonpoint sources of pollution and to protect beneficial uses of water. Pierce County has experienced problems such as shellfish bed closures and the Federal Clean Water Act Section 303(d) listing of local water bodies as a result of declining water quality. Pierce County achieved improvements by engaging diverse groups of stakeholders in generating solutions to nonpoint sources of water pollution through our watershed planning process. Using participatory methods borrowed from private industry, Pierce County was able to reach consensus, build trust, maximize participation, facilitate learning, encourage creativity, develop partnerships, shorten time frames for the planning processes, and increase the level of commitment participants had to implementing the plans. As a result, the earliest plans have a high rate of voluntary implementation. This indicates that the process and methodology used to develop watershed plans has a significant, if not critical, impact on their success.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Background: Despite the logic behind instrumented gait analysis, its specific contribution to clinical and surgical decision making is not well known. Our purpose in this study was to determine the influence of gait analysis with dynamic electromyography upon surgical planning in patients with upper motor neuron syndrome and gait dysfunction. </jats:p><jats:p> Methods: Two surgeons prospectively evaluated 36 consecutive adult patients with a spastic equinovarus deformity of the foot and ankle. After an initial history and physical exam, each surgeon independently formulated a surgical plan. Surgical treatment options for each individual muscle/tendon unit crossing the ankle included lengthening, transfer, release or no surgery. After the initial clinical evaluation and surgical planning, all patients then underwent instrumented gait analysis collecting kinetic, kinematic and poly-EMG data using a standard protocol by a single experienced physiatrist. Each surgeon reviewed the gait studies and patients independently and again formulated a surgical plan. The surgical plans were compared for each surgeon before and after gait study. The agreement between the two surgeon's surgical plans was also compared before and after gait study. Each patient was evaluated for the clinical outcome of surgery. </jats:p><jats:p> Results: Overall a change was made in 64% of the surgical plans after the gait study. The frequency of changing the surgical plan was not significantly different between the more and less experienced surgeons. The agreement between surgeons increased from 0.34 to 0.76 (p = 0.009) after the gait study. The number of surgical procedures planned by each surgeon converged after the gait studies. Correction of the varus deformity was seen in all patients that underwent surgical treatment. </jats:p><jats:p> Conclusion: Instrumented gait analysis alters surgical planning for patients with equinovarus deformity of the foot and ankle and can produce higher agreement between surgeons in surgical planning. </jats:p><jats:p> Clinical Relevance: The equinovarus deformity is due to a variety of deforming forces and a single, best operation does not exist to correct all equinovarus deformities. Rather, a muscle specific approach that identifies the deforming forces will produce the best outcomes when treating the spastic equinovarus deformity. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is grounded in VALSE (VALuation for Sustainable Environment) methodology, which seeks to understand the ways that concerned people express the ‘values’ of environment. In our research we aim to assess the importance of maintaining these values, and to test the integration of the valuation statements within a real decisionmaking process. The study of the combination of institutional analysis and democratic perspective in land-use conflict in the Canary Islands was used for such assessment and testing. An institutional analysis was carried out in order to account for recent changes in the notion of landownership (through the introduction of environmental and landscape values) and corresponding changes in the institutional framework. A democratic perspective was applied in order to include public expression, debate, and deliberation as valid ways of generating and exchanging knowledge, and as a means of reaching a satisfactory environmental decision. The problem of land use associated with the environmental valuation issue can be adequately understood by studying the social processes responsible for the different land uses. To think in terms of social processes for environmental valuation of the landscape implies concern over a process of collective understanding: the ways values and interests are formed and the way the conflict gives rise to different notions and rules of the game, and to different manners of conceiving and implementing decisionmaking processes and solutions to environmental problems. </jats:p>",
