Planning institutions inform public opinion about long-term prospects. They provide the country with frameworks for designing and announcing policies or reforms. They offer guidelines for government intervention and references for private decision-making. Also, they often play a monitoring role within the public sector, focusing on the overall efficiency of economic decisions made by public agents.The institutional nature of planning that we discuss traditionally meant in the context of market economies. The chapter will thus concern not where long-term decisions are made, but rather where the economic rationale for alternative options is scrutinized before decisions are made, where long-term views and projections are prepared and where resulting programmes are explained.</jats:p>",

The Forest Department subsequently undertook a 5-year programme of biological inventory and socioeconomic evaluation to select appropriate areas for designation. Sixty-five of the country's principal forests (including five now designated as National Parks) were systematically evaluated for biodiversity, focusing on five ‘indicator’ taxa (woody plants, birds, small mammals, butterflies and large moths). A scoring system was developed to compare and rank sites according to their suitability for nature reserve establishment and 11 key sites were identified, which, when combined with the country's 10 national parks, account for more than 95 per cent of Uganda's species. In order to satisfy multiple-use management objectives, the Man and the Biosphere model of reserve design is being applied at each forest, by designating a centrally located core area as SNR, with increasingly intensive resource use permitted towards the periphery of each reserve and adjacent rural communities.</jats:p>",

The fetishization of these terms, and the general overuse of abstract spatial metaphors such as ‘third space’, can lead to theories and politics which neglect the everyday, grounded practices and economic relations in which social identities and narratives of race and nation unfold. Without denying the potential for resistance, it is argued in this paper that these abstract liminal spaces are easily appropriated by reactionary forces, and can be used for the purposes of capital accumulation quite as effectively as for the intervention in hegemonic narratives of race and nation. </jats:p>",

One of the most serious problems (and uncertainty) in field development plan optimisation and reservoir management in these freshwater environments, have always been high initial water saturation (with wide range of saturation values), inconsistent residual oil saturation results and lack of quality reservoir dynamic, mechanical and petrophysical properties data. To address these data uncertainty issues, a special drilling, core recovery and core analysis program was conducted on three key wells in the Malay Basin's Dulang Field, applying the latest technology, field-proven low-invasion core heads, bland water-base mud (WBM) and a low-toxicity, bland oil-base mud (LT-OBM). A minimum-flushing LT-OBM coring facilitated a more accurate determination of initial water saturation (Swi) required for recalibration of downhole log calculations and a more accurate estimation of reserves. A maximum-flushing WBM sponge-coring permitted an accurate determination of residual oil saturation (Sor). A sophisticated tracer technology was implemented using hexachloroethane tracer that provided accurate invasion profiles. The 210 meters of fresh, preserved cores recovered from the three wells, covering over 70% of the stacked reservoir system, were subjected to a comprehensive laboratory special core analysis program.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>The results obtained from the core analysis program indicate a considerable narrowing (reduction) of the Swi range, from 19–61% to 20–43%. Water saturation exponent n has been improved from 1.89 to 1.64, and cementation exponent, \"m\" from 1.72 to 1.77. The impact of these improved parameter definition on reserves has been quantified through the computation of hydrocarbon-pore-volume of the cored wells. The results have shown an increase of 28.9% in HCPV, which translates to higher reserves; and have shown better-defined capillary pressure and relative permeability curves. The Swi and Sor data have been used to calculate recovery factors and expected ultimate recovery, the results of which duplicate those of computer simulation studies. All these provide greater confidence in further development and reservoir management of the field. This paper will discuss only details of the saturation results, including the quality assurance and quality control programs which validate the core recovery, core analysis and core-log data integration.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The success of defining an optimum field development plan and reservoir management strategy for any field is critically dependent upon our knowledge and understanding of the reservoir rock and fluid properties, heterogeneity and the overall internal geometry / architecture of the reservoir system. Thus, the only sound basis for optimum development planning is a comprehensive, relevant and cost-effective data acquisition program. However, there are special problems associated with formation evaluation of fresh-water environments such as the Malay Basin. The reservoir quality of the reservoir sands is quite variable and primarily controlled by texture (grain size, sorting, angularity, etc), mineralogy (clay types, abundance, morphology, and location, and cements), degree of bioturbation and diagenesis. The salinities of formation waters are generally low and vary from less than 5,000 to 30,000 ppm. P. 411^</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

Economic and energy-saving characteristics are evaluated using an optimal planning method, which determines capacities and operational strategies of constituent equipment from their many alternatives so as to minimize the annual total cost. Through a case study, advantages of a super waste incineration cogeneration plant are shown in comparison with a conventional one. A parametric study is also carried out with respect to the amounts of waste collected and energy distributed.</jats:p>",

The research involved 20 carers of patients with dementia having carer‐held records at home for a 6‐month period. The aims of the research were: to assess carers' satisfaction with the system; to evaluate the actual use made of the documents by both carers and professionals; to assess the suitability of the document design; and to assess carers' roles as partners with professionals in care planning via use of the record. Both quantitative and qualitative data were obtained by use of a questionnaire that used quantitative scales of measurement and allowed carers to express views. The results showed that carers reported benefits of the system and felt more empowered and valued by service providers because of use of the documentation. However, there were design faults in the document itself, which were addressed as a result of the pilot study. A need for preparatory and on‐going education of clients and professionals was also identified regarding the best use of the document for all parties. A follow‐up three‐year longitudial study is planned in which health outcomes of the use of carer‐held records will be quantitatively measured. The problems identified in this pilot study will be addressed before the launch of the main study; several potential confounding variables have been recognized and can be controlled.</jats:p>",

A regionally differentiated downturn in construction activity has hit Scotland less severely than parts of England but the Scottish experience may nonetheless be able to shed light on prospects for the future. In the paper we use a structure-conduct-performance paradigm to classify the industry and to see where and by how much it departs from competitive market behaviour. It is clear from the evidence that the industry is restructuring and experiencing problems in a number of areas. With this in mind we discuss a range of short-run and medium-term policy directions that might change the future path of the sector. We conclude with a call for further industrial organisation research in this area, utilising the neoinstitutional economics insights of transactions costs, etc. </jats:p>",

Rather than being posited as irreconcilable conceptions, these versions of power and their articulations can be seen as initial coordinates in the mapping of the complexities of the experiences of time and space in late modernity. </jats:p>",

In the region of central Brazil which I discuss in this paper, capitalist farmers have converted huge amounts of land in former frontier regions to the production of soybeans, largely for Asian and European markets. This integration to the world economy is not automatic or unchallenged, however. The conversion to export-oriented agriculture has created the contradictory demand for a flexible yet dependable and skilled work force to operate and care for costly farm machinery and to conform to the pace and quality of world-class production. I show that urban-based institutions and households in agricultural regions are challenging the crossover to international markets by offering agricultural workers alternative sources of income and political power. Agricultural entrepreneurs in Brazil are being forced to yield many concessions to the families of day laborers and semipermanent wage workers in order to guarantee a supply of predictable and reliable labor. </jats:p>",

Most neural network approaches to this problem are for the situation in which only local knowledge about the configuration space is available. The main goal of the paper is to show that neural networks are also suitable tools in situations with complete knowledge of the configuration space. </jats:p><jats:p> In this paper we present an approach that combines a neural network and deterministic techniques. We define a colored version of Kohonen's self-organizing map that consists of two different classes of nodes. The network is presented with random configurations of the robot and, from this information, it constructs a road map of possible motions in the work space. The map is a growing network, and different nodes are used to approximate boundaries of obstacles and the Voronoi diagram of the obstacles, respectively. </jats:p><jats:p> In a second phase, the positions of the two kinds of nodes are combined to obtain the road map. In this way a number of typical problems with small obstacles and passages are avoided, and the required number of nodes for a given accuracy is within reasonable limits. This road map is searched to find a motion connecting the given source and goal configurations of the robot. </jats:p><jats:p> The algorithm is simple and general; the only specific computation that is required is a check for intersection of two polygons. We implemented the algorithm for planar robots allowing both translation and rotation and experiments show that compared to conventional techniques it performs well, even for difficult motion planning scenes. </jats:p>",

The overall problem scope was to develop an algorithm to handle major factors bearing on the combat mission planning problem while providing hook-ups for the JSTOCHWAR architecture. Other aspects of the problem included finding the appropriate level of detail, developing a fast solving technique, and attempting to use existing data. The problem was handled by using some ideas from existing aircraft allocation algorithms and by adding some new techniques. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed air mission planning algorithm supplies the optimum degree of force for campaign objectives by using a mixed integer program (MIP) to allocate the optimum number and type of aircraft and munitions against each target. The MIP takes advantage of the force multiplying effects of mass and mutual support through its use of strike packages with air defense suppression and air-to-air escort aircraft. Additionally, a decision tree algorithm determines the best plan in light of the uncertainties of weather and weather forecasts. </jats:p><jats:p> This air mission planning algorithm omits many of the details in the actual aircraft tasking process, but in its continuous variable version, provides fast, nearly optimal solutions that should approximate real-world tasking results. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In Malaysia under state-led economic restructuring, government interventions in cultural heritage landscapes reflect divergent priorities between local place-based conservation interests and forces of political and economic restructuring at broader spatial scales. I examine a major land-use conflict, between economic development interests and a grass-roots preservation movement with links to the national opposition party, to assess how preservation activists mobilised place-based constructions of cultural identity and representations of state nationalism to halt development plans for a historic landscape, These issues arc examined by negotiating the relationship between locally based cultures of place, and political and economic forces seeking to appropriate space, in a piece of historic land in Melaka, Malaysia. I work through two lines of approach. The theoretical framework applies Lefebvre's work on spatial processes and spatial categories to conceptualise the significance of the historic landscape, and utilises Merrifield's reading of Lefebvre to write between the place—space dualism. A social construction approach is adopted to demonstrate how people actively create meaning about place in space, and work out the dialectic of preservationist intervention between local and state-level land-use goals. The social construction approach shows how cultural identity may be place based, and therefore the basis of a powerful localised social movement. Through the movement generated by this debate, a monumental traditional Chinese burial ground became local park and ‘nationscape’, a site-specific distillation of half a millenium of Malaysian history.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Like most European and North American metropolitan regions, that of Paris has for several decades been subject to a set of transformations. These have concerned urban spatial structures (population deconcentration, dispersion of employment, and the growth of new economic poles in the peripheral area), but also the sociodemographic structure of the population (rise in female labour participation rates, increasing importance of a highly qualified high-earning population, etc), and individual behaviour (desire for homeownership as well as the renewed interest of affluent groups for city-centre living, etc). Increased daily mobility in general and commuting in particular cannot be explained without reference to these different phenomena operating at both the microlevel and the macrolevel. For example, the sociodemographic characteristics of individuals have a considerable influence on the probability of the individuals being able to work near their home (or to live near their workplace). Account also has to be taken of the residential strategies of individuals, which are in turn linked to social position and life-cycle stage: choosing a place of residence in the urban periphery, in particular, has an impact on commuting patterns. But we can only understand the effects of residential strategies on commuting by analyzing the structures of the Île-de-France region (and in particular the housing market and sociogeographical pattern of employment). </jats:p>",

However, the implementation of a first well of this type in an area requires careful planning if operational and commercial success is to be ensured, particularly if there are known geological and/or drilling difficulties. This paper describes the approach taken by ECOPETROL, the Colombian State Oil Company, to optimise the planning of the first horizontal well in the Llanos Basin, in a field some 50 km East of the tectonically active Eastern Cordillera of the Andes in Colombia, South America.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>ECOPETROL were planning to drill a horizontal well in the APIAY Field of the Llanos Basin in Colombia (Fig. 1). The well, GUATIQUIA 3H (G-3H), is needed to drain the reservoir sands in a structure trending approximately N20E in an area (Fig. 2) where there was no previous experience of drilling high angle or horizontal wells. Examining all aspects of the challenge associated with completing this well was essential if operational and commercial success was to be ensured. Recent experience has shown how difficult drilling in the nearby foothills can be, even in vertical wells. Hole instability there has been severe, and in general horizontal holes pose additional risk. Given the similarity of the rocks in the APlAY area, the troubles encountered in drilling the off-set vertical wells, and the potential similarity in the stresses, there had been conjecture that G-3H could not be drilled. With this background. ECOPETROL decided to commission an assessment of the rock mechanical and hole stability issues that were likely to impact the drilling of the well.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>From a reservoir management point of view, the direction and length of a horizontal section through the pay zone will usually be selected on the basis of optimising overall reservoir performance. This will include considerations' such as the geometry of the structure, maximum drainage area and potential interference with the drainage pattern of other wells. These are clearly very important issues which directly impact the economic assessment of the well. Indeed, based on reservoir simulation and the proximity to existing surface infra-structure. the early conceptual designs had the proposed G-3H well being drilled from the south along the crest of the structure (N20E). However, integration of reservoir engineering considerations with potential drilling and completion difficulties may prompt the need to compromise to reduce overall operational risk.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Wellbore Stability Considerations</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Wellbore instability can lead to drilling difficulties such as lost circulation where tensile rock failure has occurred to spalling and/or hole closure in the case of compressive rock failure. In severe cases hole instability can lead to stuck pipe and eventually loss of the open hole section. Conventional wellbore stability theory shows there are many factors that are likely to influence the competency of the wellbore wall, including formation pressure, depth, formation strength, stress state, mud weight, mud cake efficiency and time. Furthermore, the theoretical impact of well trajectory with respect to stress orientation is well understood, and demonstrates the need to carefully consider the well trajectory when planning high angle or horizontal well sections.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Formations are generally subjected to stresses derived from the weight of the overburden rocks, and any regional tectonic loading that exists. The stresses can be resolved into three principal components. which in most cases are the vertical, minimum horizontal and maximum horizontal stresses (Fig. 3). In passive sedimentary basins such as the North Sea the vertical stress is usually considered to be the largest (Fig. 3a).</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>P. 359^</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

The goals of traditional land use and occupancy mapping in these FMAs include collection and preservation of traditional environmental knowledge, integration of this knowledge into forest planning and management and, for the Aboriginal communities, active participation in decision-making processes in order to attain sustainable forest management. While the first goal is often met in mapping projects, goals two and three are proving harder to achieve because of conflicting government policy agendas, differing paradigms of community development in society at large, and the lack of recognition and legal protection for Treaty and Aboriginal rights.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Family planning services represent one of the most common managed care services, particularly in the case of Medicaid. In 1986, Congress enacted legislation exempting family planning services from mandatory managed care requirements. The effect of this legislation was to permit beneficiaries enrolled in mandatory managed care plans to continue to obtain family planning benefits from the providers of their choice, regardless of the providers’ network status. The purpose of the law was to assure that managed care would not impede individuals’ access to benefits. Subsequent experiences surrounding implementation of this provision indicated that the Health Care Financing Administration failed either to define the scope of the exemption or to provide guidance to states regarding the various issues that would have to be resolved in exempting certain primary care services from mandatory managed care. States, in turn, developed working definitions of exempt family planning services that omitted treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and also delegated to their managed care contractors the responsibility to design implementation and payment arrangements. This systematic failure to articulate the scope and functional elements of the exemption consequently led to nonpayment of providers, and ultimately, to denial of care in some cases. Moreover, plans and community providers alike relied on the exemption to justify their failure to come to grips with the requirements and challenges of managed care. We conclude that exempting primary care services from managed care requirements may raise as many questions as it answers, and instead recommend that states, plans, and community providers focus on developing managed care systems that are responsive to patient needs.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We are concerned at one level in this paper with the debate over car-boot sales and their regulation. At another we are concerned with making connections between this and broader debates on retail regulation. After outlining briefly the literature on retail regulation, we argue that this work could benefit from thinking about spaces of exchange which are not dominated by ‘big’ retail capital. Car-boot sales represent one such space. We proceed by charting briefly the growth of the car-boot-sale phenomenon in Britain before going on to examine in detail the content of this debate, in which car-boot sales are represented as an enterprise culture out of control, as highly successful, characterised by a cast of petty criminals, and in desperate need of tighter regulation. In the remainder of the paper we argue that this representation, although it touches base with certain facets of car-boot sales, serves to legitimate the case for greater car-boot-sale regulation, and is intrinsically linked to political debate over deregulation and contracting out, particularly to the current monopolistic market operating environments enjoyed by many metropolitan authorities. We show that, although problematic to implement, the current regulatory environment is one which allows many local authorities both to exclude car-boot-sale operators from their area, and to exert a degree of control over their activities. Drawing on a number of case-study examples, we show that many local authorities have been exceedingly proactive in car-boot-sale regulation—using market law, planning law, partnerships, and ‘the market’ to control car-boot-sale operations. We then return to debates over retail regulation, maintaining that although this literature offers some conceptual purchase on the debate over car-boot-sale regulation, it has notable and important lacunae, particularly in terms of the conceptualisation of regulatory power. Moreover, we argue that the same literature would benefit from engaging with debates over exclusion and displacement: we argue here that the debate over car-boot-sale regulation needs to be interpreted more broadly as yet another instance of excluding ‘undesirable others' from certain spaces and spheres of exchange, and that such ideas could usefully be applied within the arena of conventional retail spaces. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Sharecropping is neglected in the analysis of land use and rural change in modern western economies. Notwithstanding the Marxist classification of sharecropping as a form of wage labor, it is conceptualized in this paper as simple commodity production, based on the unity of household and enterprise. The organization of sharecropping is examined with the use of this conceptualization, although the review incorporates economic and other perspectives. Sharemilking in New Zealand is used to evaluate this framework at two scales, on representative dairy farms of average size and on large dairy farms owned by corporations. It is found to be a mutually beneficial relationship that promotes efficient production and high output. It also facilitates intergenerational transfer, provides a rung on the dairying ladder, and contributes to the reproduction of family-based dairying in New Zealand. Sharemilking is also the preferred means for recent corporate entrants to the industry to operate their large dairy farms. Currently, sharemilking is playing a role in the penetration of agriculture by capital. </jats:p>",

We use multiple regression analysis to address a central research question: what variables predict the location of pollution emissions? Data were extracted from the 1993 National Pollutant Release Inventory and the 1991 Census of Canada to assess relationships among socioeconomic class variables, industrial and land-use variables, and pollution emissions. The results agree with the findings of recent US studies. Manufacturing employment, urbanization variables, dwelling value, and household income were all significantly related to pollution emissions. These relationships took the same direction as in most of the US studies. In total, the four variables account for about 63% of the variation in pollution emissions (adjusted R<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 0.626, p&lt; 0.0001). Contrary to a hypothesis of environmental inequity, the household income variable displayed a positive relationship with pollution emissions. A conceptual model of the development process is formulated to explain the positive relationship between pollution emissions and income levels. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Recent studies of the ‘greening’ process in contemporary agricultural policy have been focused chiefly on its outcomes, rather than on an assessment of the public policy significance of the underlying process. We address this question by conceptualising how greening has been mediated by agricultural policy precepts of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU). We examine how farmers' responsibilities pertaining to environmental protection and nature conservation were formalised by policy elites at the supranational level to be supportive of the core principles of the CAP. We suggest that this formalisation, culminating in 1992 with the EU's agri-environment Regulation, has enabled farming interests to use their new environmental management brief as a key element in the industry's struggle to legitimise its historic policy entitlements in the postproduction area. The theoretical basis of this paper draws upon Majone's discourse model of policy change, founded on political science and social learning literatures. We use the explanatory concepts of this model to clarify the evolution of the agri-environment initiative through textual analysis of published and confidential EU agriculture documents from the period 1973–91. Documentary evidence is corroborated by responses from semistructured interviews with senior European Commission officials in the agriculture Directorate, Directorate-General VI, involved in the policy's initiation. The core principles of the CAP emerge as crucial in shaping evolution of the EU agri-environment policy. We define the most important of these principles as occupancy of agricultural land with the aim of ensuring rural stability; and the perceived centrality of the small-scale and family farmer to the (re)structuring of rural space. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper, a grey integer-programming (GIP) formulation for the capacity planning of an integrated waste management system under uncertainty is applied to a North American case study. The GIP model is formulated by introducing concepts of grey systems and grey decisions into a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) framework. The approach has an advantage in that uncertain information (presented as interval numbers) can be effectively communicated into the optimization processes and resulting solutions, such that feasible decision alternatives can be generated through interpretation and analysis of the grey solutions according to projected applicable system conditions. Moreover, the GIP solution algorithm does not lead to more complicated intermediate models, and thus has lower computational re quirements than other integer-programming methods that deal with uncertainties. </jats:p><jats:p> The proposed model is used for the long-term planning of waste management facility expansion/utilization in the Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth (RMHW), Ontario, Canada. The binary decision variables in the model represent the ranges of facility expansion/development alternatives within a multi-period, multi-facility and multi-scale context, and the grey continuous variables represent waste flows along the routes connecting the municipalities and the waste management facilities. The results indicate that reasonable solutions have been generated through this grey mathematical programming approach. The case study results are potentially useful for MSW decision-makers in the RMHW for the long-term planning of the Region's waste management activities and for formulating related local policies/ regulations regarding waste generation and management, and may stimulate the interest of waste management professionals in other jurisdictions on the use of this type of modelling approach for their specific long-range planning applications. © 1997 ISWA </jats:p>",
