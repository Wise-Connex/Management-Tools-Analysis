      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article reviews recent research on the link between women’s commuting and labor force participation and identifies five key themes in the literature. Women’s shorter work trips have been explained in terms of women’s low wages, the need to coordinate dual roles as mothers and wage earners, and as a reflection of a more even distribution of jobs that traditionally hire women. Short work trips may also reflect spatial entrapment in highly localized labor markets. Finally, shorter work trips may reflect a spatial mismatch between low-income and minority women’s residential locations and entry-level jobs; thus, employment may entail much longer commutes for inner-city residents. This article evaluates research within each theme, identifies future research needs, and explores the implications for current policy debates over welfare reform. </jats:p>",

First, it points to the existence of at least two different kinds of preference schedule. Second, it supports a type of decision making procedure to be used in ‘multiple-client situations’ different from the one envisioned by Hare.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographic information systems (GISs) are being introduced into many planning agencies in the United States and abroad. Urban planners find GISs to be effective tools that can help with information management, processing, dissemination, and communication. Yet, initial evidence on the implementation of GIS technology in local governments and planning agencies points to difficulties in getting the systems established and in realizing expected benefits. Technological, database, and organizational factors make it most challenging to get a GIS to fit and adapt to the needs of planning practice. The main sources of evidence to guide the mutual adjustment between GIS technology and planning are evaluative studies of existing systems that examine how these GISs affect planning processes and functions. To date, these studies are scarce. To promote and facilitate assessment of GIS technology in the planning context, this article reviews the frameworks, methods, and criteria that are employed in the fields of organizational studies, information management, and decision support systems. </jats:p>",

The current experiences of the Institute for Tourism (Zagreb) point out the importance of the continuous monitoring of the SMPs implementation in practice and further methodology improvements.</jats:p>",

With more than a decade since the publication of those results many researchers have attempted to demonstrate the efficacy, or not, of the SERVQUAL instrument, or to develop their own measurement methods. This paper reviews this debate in relation to six key aspects: the purpose of the measurement instrument; the definition of service quality; models for service quality measurement; the dimensionality of service quality; issues relating to expectations; and the format of the measurement instrument. The main areas of agreement and disagreement are identified. As a result the continued use of the SERVQUAL instrument is called into question, and areas for further research are identified.</jats:p>",

Plans for these children need to be made to ensure not only a stable, consistent environment that provides love and nurturing, but also the medical and social interventions necessary to cope with the tragic loss. Pediatricians should become aware of local laws and community resources and initiate discussion early in the course of parental illness to facilitate planning for the future care and custody of the children.

The findings indicate that outcomes are instrumental in teachers’ planning; that they are stated differentially according to subject; that they are stated more in relation to skills than knowledge or values; that they are stated for short‐term intent rather than long‐term intent, and that they have not significantly changed the nature of classroom pedagogy.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The gap between wealthy and poor is widening, in part due to the epochal rise in the value of financial assets. Middle‐class savers channel their monthly contributions into mutual funds, which in turn invest the money in stocks and bonds. These accounts then accumulate, and the gains are largely tax‐free until they are liquidated. Savers who began contributing early, or who set aside more each month before the stock market rally, are now massively ahead of those in their cohort who did not. The accumulated stock market holdings, and the hair‐trigger switches from one mutual fund to another, make the stock market a mammoth and fickle force. Over the next 20 years the value of financial assets may exceed five times the value of world output. Its power to reward and punish corporate managers and governments is unprecedented. The financial wealth accumulation dynamic is now entrenched, and will continue. Managers can assess its implications, and adjust their plans accordingly.</jats:p>",

In a discussion of this, it is concluded that any integration of disparate RM theories implied by these findings is at best superficial and at worst misleading. It is further suggested that “true” and complete integration of RM theory must wait until a coherent understanding of these fundamental concepts has been developed. From the 26 definitions listed, one is judged as being more comprehensive and generally acceptable, and a new definition is presented as an inducement to further discussion.</jats:p>",

Some of the results can be used when creating noise prediction methods for planning purposes. From a planning point of view, it is necessary to use prediction algorithms and noise descriptors which are relevant in terms of community disturbance and annoyance. Our knowledge of community noise response is largely based on social surveys, and the results are mainly related to fairly simple noise descriptors. There is often a striking contrast between the available knowledge relating to human response, and the detailed nature of sound propagation studies. There is a clear need for prediction improvements, but not necessarily in directions that seem to dominate present research. For planning purposes, it is appropriate to use the noise impact foundation to identify potential prediction improvements and related research topics. The consequences of this point of view will be discussed.</jats:p>",

I consider the relationship between culture and language use by drawing on the later philosophy of Wittgenstein, whose work explores the concepts of shared understanding and rule-following. Wittgenstein's approach assists in avoiding the type of misconceptions apparent in representationalist criticisms of influential theories of practice like those of Giddens and Bourdieu. A more fruitful way of dealing with practices is also suggested, which connects rules to the use of language and thereby to geographically specific cultures. Although several problems are identified in employing a Wittgensteinian analysis of practice, its applicability to human geography is considered in relation to the subjects of embodiment and place, as well as to the delineation of cultures and to issues of epistemology. </jats:p>",

Rockefeller 3rd. The establishment of the comm1ss10n m 1969 fulfilled Rockefeller’s decade-long dream. Rockefeller hoped that this comm1ss10n might further awaken the public and policy makers to the problems of overpopulation in America. Rockefeller’s high hopes for the commission crashed, however, in a political environment increasingly polarized over civil rights, war in Vietnam, and abortion. Support for the commission’s work was hindered by divisions \\Within the population movement itself over the efficacy of voluntary family planning programs. Critical of voluntarism, more radical activists such as Paul Ehrlich and Garrett Hardin suggested that coercive family plannmg measures to protect the general interest of society needed to be explored. Furthermore, maternal divisions within the comm1ss10n itself played havoc as meetings turned mto acnmonious debates over immigration, abortion, and the very purpose of the commission. The continuing decline in the American birthrate belied the urgency of the comm1ss10n. By the time its final report was issued in 1972, the political climate had changed significantly.</jats:p>",

Kennedy’s assassination, Lyndon Bames Johnson £ launched the Great Society to eliminate poverty m the United States. Family plannmg became integral to his War on Poverty. Because Johnson feared a political backlash from Roman Catholics and Afncan-Amencans, his administration quietly pursued a policy of funding family planning programs through existing federal agencies. Congress proved much more willing to press ahead on family planning legislation, even without \\Vhite House approval. Understanding the political situation, the population lobby worked actively to educate the nation about the threat of overpopulation, while cultivating liberal opinion within the Catholic Church. At the same time, leaders of the population movement undertook an extensive lobbymg campaign to expand federal family planning programs as a means of reducing welfare costs and the number of out-of-wedlock births among the poor. In 1967 Congress enacted the first e&amp;gt;.l)licit family plannmg legislation through the Social Security amendments that mandated specific federal expenditures for family planning. This legislation went generally unnoticed, however, when Congress became caught up in an acrimonious debate over welfare reform also embodied in the Social Security legislation. By the time Johnson left office in 1968, a policy revolution in federal family planning had occurred, setting the stage for the further expansion of family planning programs under Richard Nixon.</jats:p>",

There were those, however, who remamed less sangume about the future. A new enemy threatened humanity: rampant population growth. The fundamental cause of war, these people held, lay in a Malthusian paradox: as civilization advances, population grows at a geometric rate and eventually outdistances food supplies and natural resources. The consequence is famine, war, and death. While the exact population of the world remained unknown in 1945 (demography itself was a much less exact science at the time), it was apparent that many nations, especially in Asia and Africa, suffered from a population cnsis. The Second World war proved all too clearly the consequences of what happens when nations experience food and natural resource shortages and the lack of livmg space to support the1r populations. That there was a circularity to this reasonmg-the last war proved that there was a population crisis, and a population cnsis led to world conflict-did little to dissuade these neo-Malthusians from predicting an impending population explosion that would inevitably create the conditions for global political, social, and economic instability. To make the world safe for American democracy, global population needed to be controlled. American know-how and technology were needed to avert another war.</jats:p>",

In the 1990s, in addition to generating the largest flows of, mostly male, transnational migrants, these areas have become the most important garment producers in Mexico. Exploring the interconnectedness of industrial change, gendered patterns of migration, and gendered relations of production, the author provides a short history of garment production, followed by a discussion of distinct production trajectories (by women in rural putting-out systems and/or urban microenterprises; and by men, sometimes in partnership with their wives, in workshops and factories). Both drew primarily on female labour, embedded in varied social relations; however, over time women's entrepreneurial capacity has lost ground. Fieldwork from Aguascalientes in the 1990s is used to analyse the way different parts of the garment industry have responded to economic recession and trade liberalisation, revealing three different survival strategies. Whereas maquila factories (which act as subcontractors to US and European firms) and large urban workshops have struggled, small-scale enterprises at a distance from large towns have thrived. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper a rapprochement is attempted between epistemological skepticism and ontological realism, two positions hitherto understood to be incompatible by most sociospatial theorists. It is done by recontextualizing key aspects of these two positions within an analysis of individual human finitude. Avoiding both individualism' and ‘decisionism’, and taking full account of poststructuralist insights concerning fragmented or multiple subjectivity, the analysis calls attention to the constraints imposed upon discourses concerning what is real and how we can know the real by the inherent limitations of the human individuals through which such discourses are unavoidably mediated. After arguing for the continuing relevance of ‘the epistemological subject’, I present an abstract heuristic model of this subject in order to clarify the concepts of ‘finitude of scope’ and finitude of faculties', which are defined with reference to the work of David Harvey, Marcus Doel, Noel Castree, and Donna Haraway. These two concepts are then employed in a critical reading of Roy Bhaskar's ‘critical realism’, where I argue that, in an important sense, critical realism would be more consistent and truer to its founding principles if it were understood as a skeptical realism. In the final section, I sketch some of the implications which might flow from such a rapprochement of skepticism and realism. The most important of these implications would be felt less in the substance of sociospatial research than in the ethics of debate and discourse. I close with a brief discussion of the recent work of J K Gibson-Graham, which implicitly incorporates some of the key components of skeptical realism, and (perhaps) offers a preview of things to come. </jats:p>",

Viel häufiger als bisher vermutet, sind Kombinationen mit vaskulärer-, Lewy-Körper-, fronto-temporaler- und anders verursachter Demenz, die trotz leichten Alzheimerveränderungen im Gehirn in der Kombination zu schweren Demenzen führen. Dies ist wichtig, weil auch bei kombinierter Ätiologie von einer cholinergen Therapie ein ähnlicher Erfolg zu erwarten ist wie bei M. Alzheimer. Da die bisherigen Demenz-Pharmaka nur von beschränkter Wirkung sind, mit einer Verzögerung der Krankheit von sechs bis zehn Monaten, ist eine Kombination mit intensiver Angehörigenschulung und Betreuungsplanung inklusive systematischer Entlastungsangebote unbedingt nötig.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we address two problems related to what can be claimed about the powers of decentralised business networks. The first concerns the role of tacit knowledge and proximity in securing competitive advantage. Recently, in a strand of the literature concerned with the differences between tacit and codified knowledge, it has begun to be claimed that the superiority of relational and geographic proximity (for example, intense face-to-face contact, local industrial clusters, and districts) over formally constituted and distantiated networks of knowledge and learning. In the first part of the paper we dissent from this interpretation by questioning the separability of the two forms of knowledge and by suggesting that business networks largely dependent on local tacit knowledge and incremental learning may prove to be inadaptable in the face of radical shifts in markets and technologies. The second problem regards the relationship between knowledge and the organisational structure of firms and business networks. In the second half of the paper we focus on the challenge facing competence-based large firms which draw on localised sources of knowledge to argue that competitive advantage is crucially influenced by the ability of firms to mobilise and integrate diversified forms of knowledge (tacit and codified), rather than to specialise in one form. We also argue that the imperative to sustain continuous learning is adding a new architecture of organisation and governance to that traditionally associated with the reduction of transaction costs, rather than replacing it, as is implied in the new literature which privileges the firm as a nexus of competencies. Thus, a dual structure seems to be emerging, which is composed of a decentralised network of reflexive and interactive centres to advance core competencies and learning and overlaid upon a more traditional hierarchical structure for the regulation of noncore activities. </jats:p>",

In line with earlier research in the educational management area, the major personal characteristics examined (in addition to age, length of service, etc.) related to the individual headteacher’s management style; specifically whether he or she was particularly autocratic, consultative, democratic or innovative. Responses to the questionnaire were factor analysed and tested for construct reliability. A stepwise regression procedure was then applied to assess the influences of various sets of variables on attitudes and behaviour. The results indicated that within Greater London the commercial sponsorship of schools is widespread and expanding. Extreme democrats were less likely to desire large amounts of additional sponsorship for their schools than were autocrats. Schools located in prosperous areas were far more proactive in their approaches to sponsorship and employed headteachers with more positive attitudes towards marketing and sponsorship than schools in poorer neighbourhoods.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> It is well known that Georg Simmel observed a series of parallels between the circulation of money in a mature economy, in particular its pace and rhythm, and cultural forms of interaction in early twentieth century metropolitan life, In this paper we are concerned to build upon Simmers insights with specific reference to the relationships drawn between mobility, movement, and culture, The intention is not to endorse Simmel's universalistic claims about culture, but rather to use his approach as a way of understanding how, today, processes of circulation are endowed with meaning through peoples interpretation and experience of mobility and movement, The paper falls into three parts. Drawing upon the work of Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, the first part seeks to demonstrate the importance of mobility and movement to the formation of subjectivities and to the possibility of shared systems of meaning around money. Following this, Simmel's The Philosophy of Money is used as a starting point to consider how the circulation of money, in particular the deployment of derivatives, has produced a series of cultural identifications on the basis of different impressions of space-time, In the final part, examples of shared systems of symbolic meaning in relation to the movement and mobility of money are outlined in support of the argument and to ground the possibility of money cultures. </jats:p>",

When, in 1973, the EU began systematically to address environmental concerns there was little expectation that the environment would develop into one of the largest areas of common activity. Twenty-five years on, the EU has some of the most progressive environmental policies of any state in the world although it is not itself a state. At the same time, the preexisting environmental policies of the member states have undergone a progressive change through their involvement in EU environmental policymaking. In other words, the member states have created an institutional entity to perform certain tasks which has in turn deeply affected the way they themselves perceive and act against environmental problems. This theme issue of Government and Policy offers a retrospective analysis of these developments. The purpose of this introductory essay is to describe the historical evolution of EU environmental policy and to identify the most salient themes.</jats:p>",

She suggests that the prevailing conceptualization of poor urban women as ‘survivors/victims’ within national society, social science discourse, and development praxis reveals a gender bias that is operationalized in the widespread exclusion of women from mainstream programs of microenterprise development. In arguing for a reconceptualization of poor urban women as ‘survivors/producers’ and/or ‘survivors/entrepreneurs’ in a way that highlights the empowering dimension of this identity, the diverse productive and reproductive activities that constitute women's daily experiences are seen as a self-directed act of resistance to the disenfranchising impact of structural adjustment. From an analysis of the impact of five microenterprise development programs on the lives of participating women, it is concluded that gender-focused programs of microenterprise assistance open a new space for poor urban women to create and negotiate alternative, more empowering identities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Starting in the 1970s, the production of cut flowers for export has spread in Colombia's central high land, the Sabana de Bogotá. Creating some 75 000 jobs by the mid-1990s, the Colombian flower industry has been described by the World Bank as one of the major development success stories of the last two decades. In the first part of the paper the author examines possible reasons for this success, considering Colombia's position on the global market as well as economic restructuring, demographic, and social changes in Colombia which explain not only why flower production fits well into government restructuring plans, but also the availability of cheap labour—one of the key factors in international competition. As 60% to 80% of the workers in the cut-flower industry are female, the main focus is on the rising number of women seeking employment. In the second part of the paper the author attempts to show how the benefits and costs of employment by the flower industry are perceived by the different local actors. Drawing on monographs written by local researchers, focus-group interviews with workers, and expert interviews, she discusses different themes, for example, employment practices, working conditions at the farms, and housing conditions in the worker's communities, changing gender relations, and women's emancipation and their new dependency on the firm. The flower industry is shown to draw on economic and social changes in wider Colombian society and to reinforce some of these changes. The women workers, although gaining income and status and finding industrial-type working relations, pay with a double work load and by living in difficult social and environmental conditions entailing constant health and unemployment risks. </jats:p>",

A nationwide management plan for the Italian wolf population is being prepared, and a zoning system with connecting corridors has been suggested. We developed a large‐scale probabilistic model of wolf distribution as a contribution to the planning process. Thirteen environmental variables related to wolf needs and human presence were analyzed in 12 well‐studied wolf territories and in 100 areas where the species has been absent for the past 25 years. These two areas were used as a training set in a discriminant analysis to evaluate potential wolf presence throughout the entire country. We used the Mahalanobis distance statistic as an index of environmental quality, calculated as the distance from the average environmental conditions of the wolf territories. Based on the Mahalanobis distance statistics, we constructed an actual and potential spatial distribution of the wolf for all of peninsular Italy. The jackknife procedure was used to assess the stability of the distance model and showed good confidence in our model (coefficient of variation ≤ 13%). Distance from the wolf territories’ centroid as an index of environmental quality for the wolf was tested using 287 locations where wolves have been found dead in the past 25 years as a consequence of human action (poison, shotgun, car accidents). A useful contribution to conservation planning resulted from comparing the frequency distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the dead wolf locations with the percentage of study area within each distance class. This showed how the number of wolf casualties would greatly decrease with protection of only a minor part of the study area and indicated the usefulness of our approach for evaluation of other conservation options, such as core areas and corridor identification.</jats:p>",

We employ a network flow model, instead of the traditional shortest path formulation, to capture the multicommodity, multiple origin–destination nature of the problem. An efficient two-phase solution approach is proposed. The proposed solution methodology is illustrated through a single hazmat problem followed by a large scale case study of the marine transportation system of oil products in the Gulf of Mexico. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Throughout the mid-1990s, considerable misgivings have emerged about the value of regulation theory for concrete research. Whilst acknowledging much of this critique, I seek to operationalize some recent interpretations of the ‘geography of regulation’ and regulation-theoretic state theory towards an analysis of the governance of economic development in Lowland Scotland. I argue that, when suitably contextualized, these approaches help to foreground some complex issues of scale, particularly the interactions between national, regional, and local levels, as well as to highlight the integral politics which surround the governance of urban and regional spaces. In substantive terms, this paper focuses on the decision to replace the Scottish Development Agency with the Scottish Enterprise Network. The latter was heralded by the Conservative government as a new private-sector-led hegemon within Lowland Scotland's emerging form of ‘entrepreneurial’ governance. However, the discussion below demonstrates two key factors. First, that the formation of such ‘local enterprise’ was a highly politicized endeavour; one which needs to be understood within the context of the broader dynamics of a (then) centralizing British state. And, second, a key net effect of the new structure is that the informal networks and partnerships which characterized the mode of governance in the 1980s under the hegemony of the Scottish Development Agency have been jeopardized in and through the ‘turf wars’ which have accompanied the post-1991 institutional milieu. This political shaping of privatism within one of the United Kingdom's more institutionally endowed and relatively autonomous spaces thereby provides some lessons for a New Labour government committed towards reconfiguring the contours of regional economic development in the regions and nations of the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

By deploying concepts of the ‘heterotopia’ and of ‘micropolities’, I examine the extent to which advocates of LETS as a resistant space have developed a micropolitical tool that enables the realisation of resistant conceptions of money and exchange, of livelihood, community, and cooperation. A fourfold conception of the heterotopia is developed to examine, first, the multiplicity of resistant conceptions of money and work developed by participants. Second, LETS is held to be effective micropolitics if these benefits are realisable, irrespective of the attitudes of elites, for any length of time within this resistant space. Third, I consider whether participation in LETS transforms the values of network members who do not initially share these changed cultural codes, and, if not, whether, fourth, LETS is consequently best thought of as a vision of a presently ‘impossible’—that is, unrealisable—space. In conclusion, it is argued that LETS is a resistant social movement that has developed an effective micropolitical technology which enables members temporarily but discernably to actualise their changed cultural codes within this resistant space, restricted by exclusion from the access to economic resources beyond participants' private ownership or control. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Typically research on employment and the negotiation of gender in Latin America has focused on private sector jobs in metropolitan urban centres. Two distinct groups of women have become the main focus of this research: single, young women tied into different manifestations of global production networks, and a second group who occupy different spaces within the so-called ‘informal sector’ (these women are often, although not exclusively female heads of households living in mctropolitan urban areas). This paper is an attempt to break with these traditions by suggesting that processes of globalisation and economic adjustment are not only manifest in the gendering of employment in export processing zones and/or informal sectors across the world but are also apparent in changes in public sector employment. I highlight the regendering of employment in the public sector in Latin America and focus on one new area of public sector work—the widespread implementation of state-backed work programmes. The analysis specifically focuses on women working in the Peruvian PAIT programme in the provincial town of Andahuaylas. It is argued that by looking at older, provincial, often married women, in ‘women-maintained households’ new light can be cast on the ways in which power relations and gender identities are negotiated via seemingly ordinary and gender-stereotyped activities. I examine processes of decisionmaking, budgeting, and the acquisition of skills, and focus on the relationship between Andean women's racialised and class-based identities. I trace the ways symbolic value and representation intertwine with material need to create positive environments for negotiation with male partners. </jats:p>",

In particular, they focus on the detrimental consequences of the informal process of land apportionment, which has virtually overridden the formal process in recent years. They also cautiously scrutinize the underlying reasons for land misapportionment. They argue that the informal process is difficult to control and it will continue to impede the normal and healthy development of China's land market in the foreseeable future. </jats:p>",

On the basis of data collected in 1994 among women working in a free trade zone, I show that structural adjustment increases the need for women to work, because of cuts in government programs, declining real wages, growing inflation, and a deterioration in male employment, which weakens the man's role as principal breadwinner and increases the importance and visibility of women's contribution to the household economy. This change in the gender composition of the labor force has encouraged some women to resist marriage and/or remarriage because the ‘marriage market’ of eligible men willing and able to support a family has been reduced, contributing to greater marital instability. </jats:p>",

The system was designed to optimize the intensity patterns required to treat a specified target volume with specified normal structure constraints. A beam model that uses the convolution of pencil beams was used to compute the dose distributions. A multileaf collimator leaf‐setting sequence intended to produce the intensity pattern was computed along with the monitor units required to deliver each of a number of fixed‐gantry modulated fields. Computer calculations are commonly verified using an independent manual procedure. It is difficult to calculate treatment delivery monitor units for this variant of IMRT using manual methods. Since manual calculations are not feasible, it is important both to understand and to verify the calculation of treatment monitor units by the planning system algorithm. A formal analysis was made of the dose calculation model and the monitor unit calculation embedded in the algorithm. Experimental verification of the dose delivered by plans computed with the methodology demonstrated an agreement of better than 4% between the dose model and measurements.</jats:p>",

This case study of Ecuador provides a template for examining how gender identities are constituted in the physical and discursive sites of paid work. Neoliberal restructuring in Ecuador has wrought dramatic changes on work and daily life in Quito. Specifically, economic restructuring is producing new spaces of work in garment production and this presents a moment for examining how existing gender divisions of garment work are being maintained or reworked. This study sets the context for an analysis of the social construction of occupational segmentation by examining how the political-economy of neoliberalism is producing new sites of work. Within this context, I examine how gendered discourses of skill are reproduced or transformed with changing demand for workers, and I examine how workers narrate their gender identities as revealed through in-depth discussions of their jobs and their households. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reports the results of primary research which was carried out in July 1995 with respect to business planning within first, second, third and fourth wave National Health Service (NHS) Trusts. The purpose of the research was to examine current practice in these Trusts in three areas – namely, the levels of responsibility for business planning in general, the business planning processes applied by these Trusts, and the tools and techniques used by business planning managers in the compilation of business plans. The research, based on a 37.5% response rate, concludes that, as a general rule, business planning in first, second, third and fourth wave NHS Trusts tends to be a board-level activity, where senior managers have a job title which reflects this function. Secondly, the research shows that by far the greatest challenge for Trusts lies in the external marketplace. In areas such as patient needs forecasting, competitive (Trust) intelligence, purchaser and general practice fundholder requirements, data are difficult to acquire. Finally, the evidence suggests that there is a significant gap between what is regarded as business planning practice in the NHS and what is actually applied as best practice. The report concludes that business planning in the NHS Trusts sampled appears to be an art rather than a science, and that many assumptions made by business planning managers are founded on qualitative information rather than on specific, measurable data derived from the external and internal market. </jats:p>",

Assembly and process planning are seen as two crucial manufacturing applications and a formal structure for their representation in a feature-based design system is presented. This research addresses two basic questions relating to the lack of a unified definition for features and the establishment of a feature-based representation for assembly. Thus the concept of designing with features is extended by incorporating assembly and process planning information with the geometrical and topological details of component parts. A prototype system has been implemented using an object-oriented programming technique which provides a convenient method for adding functionality to the geometric reasoning process of features and the complex relationships between the parts that make up the assembly. The feature-based model is embedded in the ACIS object-oriented solid modeller kernel. </jats:p>",

Major findings of the comparison were as follows: (1) Under the proposed analysis, the width between the maximum and minimum of the predicted model was nearer to the width of the dependent variable than that of possibilistic linear regression analysis, (2) the representative prediction by the proposed analysis was also nearer to that of the dependent variable, compared to that of possibilistic linear regression analysis.</jats:p>",
