Manpower planning as a subset of corporate planning does not command the same degree of respect in many organizations and hence is considerably less in evidence. It is not surprising, therefore, to find that the integration of these two important functions is not often achieved. Several rationales can be found for this: there are too many variables to provide a workable forecast; the right people will come along anyway; we can always go to the marketplace and buy the talents we need.</jats:p>",

New designs for fixed platforms, subsea components, and floating production/storage facilities, as wei I as new development concepts involving combinations of surface and subsea technology, are constantly being introduced. As a result, offshore development planning has become much more complicated. Numerous technical Iyfeasible alternative methods of development must be evaluated economically in order to select an optimal plan. But each of these alternatives involves a great deal of uncertainty as to investment requirements, timing, and operating expense. In addition, uncertainty exists in the estimate of recoverable reserves and production rates, and oil and gas prices.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Because of the magnitude of these uncertainties and their impact upon profitabi lity, it is desirable that they be included in the economic evaluation. By doing so, it is possible to quantify the economic risk associated with each alternative, and to identify the development plan which offers both the highest Net Present Worth (NPW) and the lowest economic risk.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>This paper describes an Offshore Development Planning Model which is designed to evaluate numerous alternative methods of developing an offshore discovery. A decision tree approach is employed to organize the sequence of inter-related decisions involved in drilling, production and transport of 011 and gas. Each path through thedecision tree represents a particular development plan or alternative. A closed-form method of calculating the expected value and the variance of NPW for each alternative is used, and a measure of economic risk is obtained using these values. Comparison of the NPW and the risk values for each development plan provides a convenient method of ranking the alternatives.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>An example of an offshore field development in 1000 ft. water depth in the Gulf of Mexico II lustrates the use of the model. Alternative development pians include the fixed platform, guyed tower, floating production facilities and several subsea/ surface combinations.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Higher oil and gas prices and the increased instability of imported oil supplies have accelerated the search for new oil and gas resources throughout the world. Offshore discoveries In water depths of 1000 feet or more, and in remote areas and harsh environments have brought about vast advances in offshore production technology. New designs for offshore structures, subsea equipment, floating processing facilities, and on-site storage and offloading systems are constantly being introduced. Entirely new offshore development concepts utilizing this technology have emerged. As a result, offshore development planning has become much more complicated. In order to insure that a discovery Is brought into production whenever possible, numerous alternative methods of development are being proposed and evaluated for each particular situation.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

I think that that parallel is still true, although in many ways we are all now looking for a respectable and viable practical activity. Planners, like librarians, are still in search of an identity; even, in many cases, in search of a recognisable professional job. There are rumours that the new technology, the micro, the chip and so on will render librarians unnecessary: a recent paper by Dr Dennis Lewis of ICI Plastics Division asserts that ‘ … the days of the information officer and library worker as we know them are numbered’. ‘ … in the year 2,000’, he says, ‘the information scientist and the librarian will have gone the way of the brontosaurus’. Clearly, librarians need to re‐examine their role in the developing world of information technology and to adapt and change to meet changing circumstances and needs. It is perhaps not quite so obvious, but it is equally necessary, that they should change and adapt to meet changing patterns and sources of information and to accommodate new developments in the structure of the information they are accustomed to handling.</jats:p>",

The data for these are also obtained from the hedonic regressions. All of the methodology (hedonic regressions, demand estimations, linear assignment optimizations) is currently operational. The usefulness of the approach is further underscored by the ability to track welfare effects over space and over time; surplusses accruing to each renter and owner group (maximum willingness to pay less actual price paid) are computed from the dual of the optimization. </jats:p>",

This law provides for individualized educational programs (IEP) for students and emphasizes that the development of an IEP should include a statement of the present levels of educational performance of the child based on appropriate assessment procedures. This paper emphasizes the importance of planning communication individualized education programs (CIEP) for all deaf students if they are to achieve their communication and academic potentials. The rationale for CIEP planning for deaf students is explained and demonstrated in terms of the great variation in potential and achieved student expressive and receptive communication skill levels. Communication assessment instruments appropriate for deaf students at both the secondary and postsecondary levels are recommended. These recommendations are based on data from assessments performed with more than 1,000 entering students at the National Technical Institute for the Deaf (NTID)1 at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) and a field test of 420 secondary-level students at two residential schools for the deaf. Finally, strategies for developing CIEPs for students are discussed in terms of a team approach and application of communication assessment and other communication-related information. A sample CIEP is developed for a deaf secondary-level student to demonstrate the efficacy of this approach to communication program planning.</jats:p>",

The planning is to be done by a regional health systems planning agency, which sets or enforces standards of accessibility and acceptability to be achieved through a modification of the current system, particularly the allocation of beds to the population-at-risk. The allocation is defined in terms of matching beds to demand, where demand is classified by geographical areas and by level of care required. The allocation is to be done such that the planning goals, expressed in constraints on accessibility and acceptability of the inpatient service, are satisfied. In particular, the population within the region should have access to an adequate supply of beds, and the inpatient service should be of appropriate level and quality to meet the demand of the population. </jats:p><jats:p> The planning problem is formulated as a mixed integer mathematical programming model in which changes to the system are described in terms of the location, number, conformance, and level of beds. There are two types of input to the model—estimates of demand by geographic area and level, and a description of the current state of the hospital service in the region. The current state of the hospital service is described by the location, size, level, and conformance of the service at existing hospitals and the location of possible new sites. The solution to the model is the lowest cost modification to the system that satisfies the constraints, where “cost” is a measure of the resources needed to change the system. Results from applying the model to the medical-surgical service in a region with 15 hospitals are discussed. </jats:p>",

For example, specific skill requirements, the added costs of training inherent in hiring new workers, and the absolute demand for labour may stimulate firms to minimize labour turnover. One way of reducing turnover is for the individual firm to raise its wage rates. However, depending upon the relative tightness of the local labour market (reflected in the rates of hiring and unemployment), this could result in widespread wage competition amongst employers and general increases in the aggregate local wage rate. The significance of quits, hires, and unemployment are explored, in an attempt to explain differential urban wage inflation in the United States. Emphasis is placed on Hicks's model of labour turnover which emphasizes the firm's management of its labour needs. This model is analysed in a time-series framework over the period 1970–1979; a decade of rapid inflation and general stagnation in the United States. </jats:p>",

First, to measure the similarity the distance between two sets of clusters is defined. Second, a statistical method is formulated to test whether or not the distance between two sets of clusters is close. Third, the concept of spatially well-grouped clusters is defined in conjunction with the above statistical test, and it is shown that this concept is useful for regional analysis. Last, the sets of regional clusters in the Kyushu region is studied by the above statistical test and concept. </jats:p>",

An evaluation of the training demonstrated that the subject's ability to observe and design environments was significantly greater than comparable students not receiving the training. The study demonstrated that children as young as eight or nine can be systematically taught to participate in the designing of their own environments. </jats:p>",

In this note it is shown that this is not necessarily always the case, and two different conditions are identified, one that gives rise to jump behaviours, and another that does not.

In contrast to the conclusions drawn from several econometric studies by Gordon inter alia the following hypotheses are suggested: </jats:p><jats:p> There is no spatial stability in the relationship between flow levels and geographic distance with respect to particular commodity groups because of historical and geographical particularities in connection with product heterogeneity and oligopolistic market structure. If at all, a distance variable may explain the patterns of production and trade on an aggregate level. This factor of distance is neither equivalent to the transportation costs of today, nor does it fully represent the communication costs of today. It rather reflects the influence of the past on the contemporary spatial pattern of production and trade. With respect to international trade the impact of distance is of minor importance compared to the influence of cultural and linguistic affinity of spatial association and political relationship. These hypotheses are supported by quoting the results of several studies of the Institut für Regionalforschung der Universität Kiel arrived at in the past few years. All this research work centred on the question of how the spatial pattern of production and trade was influenced by national borders and geographic distance in the course of the European economic integration process. The final conclusion of the paper is the need for a theoretical reorientation. </jats:p>",

The study region is the East North Central region, the observation units are counties, and the outlays examined are for the Departments of Agriculture, and Health, Education and Welfare (to investigate the effects of political representatives), as well as total outlay levels (for evaluating responsiveness to social needs). The study's conclusions are that total outlays are poorly related to social needs, although outlays for specific departments (Agriculture and Health, Education and Welfare) are strongly related, and that political representation has little impact on the distribution of Agriculture, and Health, Education and Welfare outlays in the study area. </jats:p>",
