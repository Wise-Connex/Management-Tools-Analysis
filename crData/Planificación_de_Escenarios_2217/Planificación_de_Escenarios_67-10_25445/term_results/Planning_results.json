Permission to copy is restricted to an abstract of not more than 300 words. Illustrations may not be copied. The abstract should contain conspicuous acknowledgment of where and by whom the paper is presented. Publication elsewhere after publication in the JOURNAL OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY or the SOCIETY OF PETROLEUM ENGINEERS JOURNAL is usually granted upon request to the Editor of the appropriate journal provided agreement to give proper credit is made.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Discussion of this paper is invited. Three copies of any discussion should be sent to the Society of Petroleum Engineers office. Such discussion may be presented at the above meeting and, with the paper, may be considered for publication in one of the two SPE magazines.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The problems encountered in drilling deep abnormally pressured wells are generally known. Conclusions from a study of this subject were applied to design a deep well drilling program. More significant parts of the program are presented, excluding those parts already covered by previous published papers.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>Drilling deep wells which encounter abnormally pressured formations is an expensive venture and problems, such as stuck drill pipe, ruptured casing, lost circulation, gas kicks or salt water flows, may add greatly to this cost. Drilling practices that apply to shallow normally pressured wells are unsafe and inefficient beyond the high pressure transition of a deep well. As the strength limits of equipment, casing, and borehole rock are approached, every detail of drilling procedure becomes more critical. Judgments based on past experience alone are often in error without proper consideration of depth. Simple operations such as selecting proper mud weight and viscosity, pulling and running drill string and casing wear are major factors contributing to failure.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>It is not sufficient for the engineer to calculate force magnitude, design and present a well prognosis. The critical forces should be calculated then graphically demonstrated so that it can be easily and clearly understood. Once understanding is established, company and service personnel can be directed to the common objective. A meeting of all personnel directly responsible for drilling a well provides an excellent opportunity to discuss the program and establish communication. Coordination and communication are critical responsibilities of the drilling supervisor.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>INITIAL ENGINEERING AND PLANNING</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>The starting point for any drilling plan is with the well location. Geological and seismic data are studied with particular attention to faulting. Logs and drilling records of all wells drilled around the proposed location are studied. Shale pore pressure and formation fracture gradient of wells are calculated and correlated in reference to the proposed location. Fig. 1 illustrates pore pressures and calculated formation fracture pressures of a South Louisiana well which penetrated deep into abnormally pressured formations.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",

A variety of reservoir behavior and economic models were employed to achieve a suitable design. The models selected for each portion of the work and typical results are described. It is concluded that by judiciously selecting analytical techniques the timely design of a development plan for a major oil reserve may be accomplished.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:sec>\n                     <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                     <jats:p>In August, 1965, reservoir engineers serving the Long Beach Unit initiated an investigation which would ultimately provide a waterflood plan for development of the major zone in the nation's largest undeveloped oil reserve. The planning of the Ranger zone flood represented an unprecedented opportunity to utilize a variety of classical modeling techniques in a single engineering design problem. The purpose of this paper is to describe this application of reservoir and economic models and to review the rationale for selecting particular methods.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>At the time these studies were initiated, a minor portion of the zone had been developed. Therefore, the primary objective of the studies was to create a spacing plan for a pressure maintenance waterflood with specific completion interval and location information for each well to be drilled. A second objective was to provide estimates of injection and production rates for facility sizing and estimates of future capital requirements.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>Since the Long Beach Unit and the Field Contractor were new entities, there did not exist an established repertoire of computing techniques or facilities. Therefore, models used in these studies were obtained from several sources. A linear program and a detailed economic simulator were contributed by two of the Unit participants. Large reservoir simulators were purchased from or used in conjunction with independent firms. Finally, an optimization technique and a simplified reservoir simulator were developed to satisfy specific requirements.</jats:p>\n                     <jats:p>While many facets of the development of the Ranger zone are unusual or novel, for example the elaborate drilling islands, the reservoir engineering techniques employed were not.</jats:p>\n                  </jats:sec>\n               </jats:sec>",
