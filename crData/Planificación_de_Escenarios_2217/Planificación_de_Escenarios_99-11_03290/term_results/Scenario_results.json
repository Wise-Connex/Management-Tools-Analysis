      "abstract": "<jats:p> Between 1992 and 1996, a small number of women in the UK were forced by the courts to undergo caesarean section against their expressed refusal. Analysis of the reported cases reveals the blanket assumption of maternal incompetence and the widespread use of thinly veiled coercion. Such attitudes and practices are themselves frequently compounded by inadequate communication. Medical discretion in such problematic cases seems to err on the side of safety and so appears to favour the life of the fetus over maternal autonomy. Despite current policy’s placement of the pregnant woman at the centre of maternity care, obstetricians’ concerns appear to lie more with the unborn fetus. In other words, there seems to be a point at which the value of fetal life begins to outweigh, not so much the life of the woman, but her right to self-determination, her plans and her choices. While it is important to acknowledge that these court ordered caesareans represent an unusual extreme within contemporary maternity care in this country, that they have happened brings into sharp relief some of the stereotypical assumptions about women. These are assumptions that underlie much of current medical practice and may compromise or disempower women in other ways during their experience of pregnancy and labour. </jats:p><jats:p> Using the first and last of the six reported cases as contextual illustrations, this article focuses on the complex interplay of processes that have brought the medical profession to a position in which their own self-conviction and determination to do what they believe is best for their patients has resulted in gross denial of women’s autonomy and the use of the law to override pregnant women’s refusal of consent. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This study addresses the issue of designing farming systems for low input conditions. By focusing on the problem of feed (resource) allocation in livestock systems it provides clues for the design of alternative agricultural systems and systems in general. Linear programming (LP) is used to examine system behaviour under conditions of varying feed resource qualities, for individual animal production levels that range from 0.75 to 3.00 times maintenance. Milk yield, animal numbers and amounts of feed offered or refused are measures of system performance in two hypothetical cases representative for actual farming systems. Case 1 considers available feed as one aggregated resource, with an average nutritive value ranging from that of straw to that of high quality forage. It establishes the individual animal output level that is required to achieve maximum total system output from a given feed resource. In Case 2, animals of different production levels are allowed to select between two feed resources that, through proper definition of the their proportions on offer, on average represent the same feed quality scale as in Case 1. The possibility of selection, however, allows the nutritive value of the actual intake to differ from the average nutritive value of feed offered. Better feed and higher (potential) individual animal output tend to increase total system output in terms of milk, by reducing the number of animals. Nevertheless, the term 'damning objective' is introduced to express that high targets for subsystem output reduces total system output if subsystem requirements exceed resource availability. Moreover, heterogeneity of (feed) resources can increase system output by using more production units with lower individual output. The results are tested against farmers' practice and situations reported in literature. Implications for the design of sustainable systems and further research are discussed.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Our objective was to assess the effect of changes in rainfall amount and distribution on CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions and dissolved organic C (DOC) leaching. We manipulated soil moisture, using a roof constructed below the canopy of a 65‐yr‐old Norway spruce plantation [<jats:italic>Picea abies</jats:italic>(L.) Karst.] at Solling, Germany. We simulated two scenarios: a prolonged summer drought of 172 d followed by a rewetting period of 19 d and a shorter summer drought of 108 d followed by a rewetting period of 33 d. Soil CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emission, DOC, soil matric potential, and soil temperature were monitored in situ for 2 yr. On an annual basis no significant influence of the droughts on DOC leaching rates below the rhizosphere was observed. Although not significantly, the droughts tended to reduce soil respiration. Rewetting increased CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions in the first 30 d by 48% (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0.08) in 1993 and 144% (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0.01) in 1994. The CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>flush during rewetting was highest at high soil temperatures and strongly affected the annual soil respiration rate. The annual emission rate from the drought plot was not affected by the drought and rewetting treatments in 1993 (2981 kg C ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>), but increased by 51% (<jats:italic>P</jats:italic>&lt; 0.05) to 4813 kg C ha<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>yr<jats:sup>−1</jats:sup>in 1994. Our results suggest that reduction of rainfall or changes in rainfall distribution due to climate change will affect soil CO<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>emissions and possibly C storage in temperate forest ecosystems.</jats:p>",
