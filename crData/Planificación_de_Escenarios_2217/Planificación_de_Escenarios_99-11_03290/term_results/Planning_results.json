Accordingly, it would be useful for planners to have access to the body of empirical literature that has been published on the demographic effects in environmental aesthetics. A literature review found 107 relevant references. These references covered more than 19,000 respondents and 3,281 environmental scenes. Overall, the correlation of preferences between different demographic groups was r = .82. Correlations are also reported for the following factors: multiculturalism, designers and other people, students and other people, children and adults, gender, and special interest groups. Correlations were very high except for children, designers and others for avant-garde architecture, and special interest groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> State sponsorship of regional and statewide growth management programs is now four decades old. Surprisingly, much variation exists among scholarly accounts of the quiet revolution and the second wave of state growth management program history. The literature has expanded rapidly as state growth management programs have evolved in the 1990s into new phases of program history: a third wave and now a subsequent era called “smart growth.” As we look ahead to newer state programs that are designed to curb sprawl and promote sustainability, it is useful to take a comprehensive look at where we have been. The state growth management literature deserves consolidation, reconsideration, and reconciliation. With almost three hundred annotated entries, this bibliography provides a thorough, but not exhaustive, review of the literature on state growth management programs. The bibliography’s primary purpose is to identify the states that are considered, or should be considered, growth management states. </jats:p>",

Decomposition and reconstitution problems are discussed for building a prototype fixture planning system.

Since major manufacturing costs of a product are committed in product specification and design, it is critical to be able to assess manufacturability and cost as early as possible in the design process. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Design and Process Planning Integration (DPPI) project addresses the need for improving communication between conceptual design and conceptual process planning activities. Documenting the DPPI foundation, this paper provides a definition of conceptual process planning and describes its functions in an activity model. Also, this paper describes the conceptual process planning prototype system that has been implemented and integrated with a conceptual design system. The prototype system validates the definition, the activity model, and the integration between process planning and design in the early product development stage.</jats:p>",

The college was founded on its present site in 1284, but it was not Peterhouse that established the boundary. The college took over the site of the Friars of the Sack (sacked by the Pope for reasons that do not concern us), but it was not the Friars that established the boundary. They, in turn, had taken over houses in a ribbon development along the main road south of Cambridge, but it was not the house-owners that established the boundary. The house-plots were successors to arable strips laid out between the road and the town fen as part of an exercise in country planning in the Norman or Anglo-Saxon period. The owners of these strips had disturbed the originally regular plan by pushing out their back fences into the fen (usque ad mariscum) —farmers, then as now, were not above encroaching on public land (Hall and Lovatt 1989).</jats:p>",

The Protestant work ethic, with its emphasis on ever‐increasing levels of production, contributed to the rise of the consumption culture and the legitimation of the market society. It appears that the very premise which facilitates the market society – specialization and the production of consumption – also paves the way for a post‐materialist revolution. This paper advocates a macro, more humanistic, and socially relevant perspective of consumer research.</jats:p>",

The desired smoothness of the trajectory is imposed through limits on the actuator jerks. The third derivative of the path parameter with respect to time, the pseudo-jerk, is the controlled input. The limits on the actuator torques translate into state-dependent limits on the pseudo-acceleration. The time-optimal control objective is cast as an optimization problem by using cubic splines to parameterize the state space trajectory. The optimization problem is solved using the flexible tolerance method.</jats:p>",

By conducting a survey of 55 UK marketing managers in computer and financial industries, this study examines the current practice of the strategic function of marketing, and the application of information systems in supporting the strategic function. Reveals that the strategic function of marketing has been perceived important by marketing managers, and many companies perform some of the strategic functions, such as market segmentation/targeting, competition and market analysis. Yet, the application of MkIS does not keep abreast with the current practice of marketing strategic function. Suggests that a knowledge‐enriched, strategic oriented MkIS with an emphasis on environmental scanning, competition mapping, market positioning, and SWOT analysis needs to be developed through advanced computing technology.</jats:p>",

The framework created as a result of this, incorporated adaptive and innovative stylistic differences in responding to messages delivered by negative and positive sources. A quota sample of 120 respondents has highlighted a number of key issues which are of both conceptual and practical significance. On a conceptual level the knowledge of adaptors being more source oriented extends the existing theoretical framework to include variations in the attitude change processes and on a practical level this aids the advertiser to consider different messages and delivery modes. Also important, although statistically insignificant, is the finding that innovators have a propensity to be influenced by a negative rather than a positive source.</jats:p>",

The system is used for developing urban development alternatives based on real‐world data. Results show that, by integrating knowledge‐based systems, artificial neural networks and fuzzy systems, the system achieves improvements in the implementation of each respective system as well as an increase in the breadth of functionality within the application. With this approach, the best of three technologies can be compiled together to solve complex urban problems. We discuss the structure of the combined technologies, as well as providing examples of its application in the field of urban development.</jats:p>",

Many large companies in Asia are turning to market intelligence for input into their strategic management system and decision making. The marketing intelligence cycle typically consists of directing, collecting, compiling, cataloguing, analysing and communicating data. The processing stage of intelligence gathering is the critical stage where the raw material is recorded and analyzed. In this article we use the SWOT framework for the analysis of a manufacturing industry – the lawn mower. This case illustrates how market intelligence could be used as an important and effective instrument for management planning, implementation and control.</jats:p>",

Directed graph is extended to represent feature/ dimension/tolerance relationships (FTG) and datum/machining feature relationships (DMG). According to different production schemes and manufacturing resource capabilities, setup planning principles and algorithms are explored to automatically extract DMG from FTG. Under the true positioning frame (ANSI Y14.5), tolerance decomposition models are concluded to partition a tolerance into interoperable machining errors, such as locating error, tool alignment error, random process error. The setup plan with allowable locating tolerance specifications is the basis for fixture design. The proposed method is verified in a genuine manufacturing enterprise.</jats:p>",

The proposed method is composed of two hierarchical stages. At the outer stage, equipment capacities and utility maximum demands of the brewery’s energy supply plant are optimized together with values of control parameters of thermal storage tanks by the sequential linear programming method. At the inner stage, the equipment operation of the plant for given energy demands is simulated on the basis of control rules using LabVIEW. Both two stages are interconnected so as to be compatible with each other. Through a numerical study, it is investigated how equipment capacities, utility maximum demands, and control parameters of thermal storage tanks influence the long-term economics of the plant. From the results, it is ascertained that the long-term economics can be improved using the proposed method.</jats:p>",

We hypothesized that performance ratings would be negatively related to setting development goals, that supervisor ratings would have a greater effect than ratings from peers or subordinates in the selection of developmental goals, and that self‐other discrepancies would be related to goal selection. Data from 2,163 managers showed that multi‐source feedback contributed to the selection of developmental goals. However, contrary to expectations, subordinate ratings were most important to goal setting compared to ratings from any other sources. Direct feedback itself affected goal selection, not its relationship to self‐perceptions. For several goals, the relationship between performance ratings and goal selection was stronger for lower level managers. Implications of the results for the practice of 360‐degree feedback and related research are discussed.</jats:p>",

Since this is proving increasingly cumbersome for planning agencies, several methods have been developed to determine the effects of new land-use plans on the societal risk. These methods give the uniform population density from a certain distance around the establishment at which the indicative limit for the societal risk is not exceeded. Correction factors are determined for non-uniform population distributions around the establishment, non-continuous residence times and alternative societal risk limits. Using these methods allows decision-making without the necessity of repeating quantified risk analyses for each alternative proposal.</jats:p>",

In contrast to the extensive literature on sampling properties, bias, and precision of loads estimated from monitoring data, the unconstrained and often inconsistent alternatives for choosing “representative” runoff volumes and concentrations for use in planning level estimates limit the opportunities of generalizing analytical results on the properties of these estimators. The ease with which these simple load estimates can be calculated belies their inherent uncertainty, motivating this examination of their bias and variability. The mean and variance of planning level load estimators are derived both under mild parametric assumptions and using a distribution free approximation. Common use of the mean, median, or geometric mean of event concentrations is shown to result, in general, in biased estimates of the mean annual load. Sensitivity analysis of the mean and variance demonstrates the need to incorporate the relative variance as well as the correlation of cumulative discharge and characteristic concentration in planning level load estimates. While analogous to load estimation from monitoring data, the results presented here are distinct and unrelated to retransformation or sampling biases that have been well documented in the river load literature. Substantive implications for regional assessments, planning, and watershed management are illustrated with a simple example drawn from Chesapeake Bay.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors argue that research and policy debates on urban social marginalisation have largely neglected important restructuring trends in a range of essential private services, for example, food retailing, energy, telephony, and personal financial services. Using the case of the United Kingdom, they focus on two case studies carried out in the marginalised neighbourhoods of Benwell, in Newcastle upon Tyne, and Netherly Valley, in Liverpool. It is argued that parallel restructuring trends in these services are having compound exclusionary effects in places of concentrated social exclusion. A model of such compound exclusion effects is presented with supporting ethnographic evidence from residents of both case-study areas, to explore how the affects of marginalisation from financial services, food retailing, energy, and telephony interact in place. The authors finish the paper by exploring the implications of restructuring in private consumer services for urban social theory, for debates about urban marginalisation, and for policies which attempt to address such marginalisation. </jats:p>",

Drawing on material from 60 case studies in the United Kingdom, they examine three central claims made for the social economy: that it is empowering, economically sustainable, and capable of providing a real alternative to the ‘mainstream’ public and private sector economies. They argue that the empirical evidence offers only ambiguous support for these claims and that the full potential of the UK social economy is not being realised. They identify several factors currently inhibiting the development of effective local social economy projects in the United Kingdom. They conclude by proposing a range of measures that could remove the financial and practical barriers currently constraining the development of an effective and lasting social economy in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

In the mid-1980s, the most advanced planners were barely able to compute collision-free paths for objects crawling in planar workspaces. Today, planners efficiently deal with robots with many degrees of freedom in complex environments. Techniques also exist to generate quasioptimal trajectories, coordinate multiple robots, deal with dynamic and kinematic constraints, and handle dynamic environments. This paper describes some of these achievements, presents new problems that have recently emerged, discusses applications likely to motivate future research, and finally gives expectations for the coming years. It stresses the fact that nonrobotics applications (e.g., graphic animation, surgical planning, computational biology) are growing in importance and are likely to shape future motion-planning research more than robotics itself. </jats:p>",

The behaviour of this monopolist is then shown to be similar to that of a monopolistic competitor in a market with many suppliers. The effects of entry and exit are studied in relation to restrictions on opening hours in a market with many identical firms. It is shown that the welfare effects of upper limits on opening hours are negative when new firms enter the market. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The conjoint preference approach, measuring individual preferences, has a long history in the study of residential decisionmaking processes. Residential choice behaviour, however, is often the result of a group decisionmaking process. In this paper we investigate whether conjoint preference models derived from group responses are different from and predict better than conventional conjoint models derived from the responses of individuals who do not interact during the data-collection process. In particular, we propose a new approach to modelling group preferences for residential choice alternatives that extends previous work of Timmermans et al. The new approach is illustrated in an application among 193 families with children. The results confirm that preference structures of individual family members differ from group preference structures and that the proposed group-based model predicts family preferences for new residential environments better than do conventional models. </jats:p>",

The locational characteristics of the recorded music industry are discussed, and it is shown that, although there is a wide scattering of companies across the entire United States, the main centers of production are in Los Angeles, New York, and Nashville. It is then demonstrated that Los Angeles and New York have a capacity to produce hit records that far exceeds their relative significance in terms of number of recording companies, even after abstracting away the effects of the majors. This capacity is conceptualized in terms of the creative field that is brought into existence by the dense agglomeration of many different specialized firms and workers interacting together in one place in the tasks of economic and cultural production. </jats:p>",

An underground railway heading east from Westminster was first proposed in 1943, but it was not until die mid 1960s that plans for the Fleet Line to New Cross were finalized. However, shortly after it reached Charing Cross in 1979—and got renamed the Jubilee Line along the way—the unexpected proposals to create 150 000 new jobs in London's Docklands and the offer of private funding led to a change of plan. This paper describes the complex and continually evolving planning processes that led to creation of one of the world's most sophisticated urban transport systems. </jats:p>",

The model contains, for each zone and each category of population and employment, a population potential and an employment potential that measure the relative attractiveness of the zone in the study area with respect to residents' choice of home location and business setup (which generates employment opportunities), respectively. The calibration procedure comprises three stages. In the first stage, a genetic algorithm is employed to calibrate the population and employment potentials, together with the coefficients associated with the travel impedance function for different market segments. In the second stage, the relationships between the calibrated potentials and various land-use variables are investigated by means of a multivariate stepwise regression analysis. The significant land-use variables are identified and equations relating these variables to the potentials for each category of population and employment are established. The third stage is model refinement, in which the model parameters obtained from the first two stages are fine-tuned to reduce further the discrepancy between the observed and modeled distributions of population and employment. A case study of Hong Kong is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. </jats:p>",

By analysing data from the Bangor Longitudinal Study of Ageing (BLSA) she tests the proposition that two of the typologies that have been used to categorise older people's moves are not supported by empirical evidence from the BLSA. It is hypothesised that the best-fitting model has a greater number of types of move than the three proposed by Litwak and Longino in their behavioural model, but fewer than the eight suggested by Wiseman in his developmental model. By using latent class analysis the author develops a classification of types of move from the relationships between combinations of observable factors. Probabilistic equations are devised to give the relationship of factors to each other, and a set of theoretical statements are formulated to describe each category of migration. The two aforementioned models are rejected in favour of a five-class model in which moves are classified as long-distance amenity, wide-choice local amenity, narrow-choice local amenity, low levels of assistance, and high levels of assistance. </jats:p>",

Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to identify the brain tumors; PET imaging after injection of [<jats:sup>18</jats:sup>F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), [<jats:sup>11</jats:sup>C]<jats:sc>l</jats:sc>-methionine (CMET), or a combination of the two was performed to grade the tumors; and a [<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>O] H<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O uptake study was used to characterize the anatomical relationships of the tumors to functional cortex. The cortical activation maps were obtained during control periods and during behavioral tasks and were used to document motor, visual, and speech and language organizational areas. Wada tests were performed in two patients. Language and speech activation was concordant with the results of Wada testing.</jats:p><jats:p content-type=\"fine-print\"><jats:italic>Conclusions.</jats:italic> Functional brain mapping using PET scans and coregistered MR images provided the neurosurgeon with precise definitions of structural and functional cortical areas; this altered surgical management in some cases and/or was used to predict outcome. The combination of PET imaging with FDG and/or CMET and measurements of [<jats:sup>15</jats:sup>O] water uptake was useful in characterizing and grading tumors and instrumental in achieving effective neurosurgical planning. Postoperative results in the five cases suggest that preoperative functional brain mapping has the potential to improve outcome by defining a surgical plan to maximize resection and minimize the risk of neurological sequelae.</jats:p>",

Transvaginal colour Doppler ultrasound was performed before surgery to search for arterial blood flow signals within the tumours. Tumours with a measurable intra‐tumoural resistance index were defined as tumour with detectable blood flow and the others as tumour with undetectable blood flow. The microvessel density of the excised tumour was assessed immunohistochemically. The women's clinical and pathologic data were recorded.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results\n\t\t\t\t\t</jats:bold> There were 60 tumours (58%) exhibiting detectable intra‐tumoural blood flow signals. Tumours with detectable blood flow were larger, had deeper cervical stromal invasion, a higher incidence of parametrial invasion and pelvic lymph node metastases, and a higher microvessel density, when compared with those without detectable blood flow. Cervical cancers with deep cervical stromal invasion, parametrial invasion, and pelvic lymph node metastasis had higher microvessel density than those with superficial stromal invasion, no parametrial invasion, or no lymph node metastasis. Microvessel density correlated well with lymph node metastases and parametrial invasion by multiple regression analysis, while intra‐tumoural blood signals only showed correlation with parametrial invasion. In the prediction of pelvic lymph node metastases and parametrial invasion, colour flow Doppler had a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.48 in predicting lymph node metastases, and sensitivity of 0–91 and specificity of 0.57 in predicting parametrial invasion.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Conclusions\n\t\t\t\t\t</jats:bold> The characteristics of blood flow signals in cervical carcinoma detected by colour Doppler ultrasound are associated with tumour angiogenesis and could reflect the likelihood of parametrial invasion and lymph node metastases in cervical carcinoma. The intra‐tumoural blood flow signals might be used as a screening test in predicting parametrial invasion and pelvic lymph node metastases. These findings may be helpful in planning treatment for women with Stage I and II cervical carcinoma.</jats:p>",
