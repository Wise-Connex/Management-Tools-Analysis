      "abstract": "<jats:p>This paper is concerned with strategic planning in the public services, in particular that sector where no market price exists and where the community expresses some demands. The National Health Service, the Social Services, Education Authorities or Local Authorities are examples. Because the consumer does not directly pay for the service at the point of consumption, demand cannot be expressed in monetary terms. The supply of services is some reflection of community need tempered by its willingness to provide the resources of people, equipment, facilities and money to satisfy that need. Strategic planning or policy making is a complex not to say emotive process, because no obvious measure of success or of community satisfaction exists. It is often difficult to measure satisfaction of a single need, let alone define a policy which “best” satisfies the conglomerate of often conflicting community needs. Nevertheless, this is the task confronting policy makers in the public sector services. The quantity and allocation of these services are not usually directly determined by the community itself but by some section of the community; commonly politicians, economists, planners and occasionally representatives of the community. Within these planning bodies each individual conception of the “best” policy is in conflict with all others. It is not possible to resolve this conflict by deriving a policy which maximises the satisfaction and, hence, minimising the regret of the policy making body. Yet a compromise, or at least a single, policy must be reached. The aim of this paper is to suggest a method of arriving at the most acceptable single policy without making assumptions or deriving definitions of where that compromise ought to lie given the initial postures of the policy makers. The paper is in two sections. The first describes the method in general terms. The second demonstrates, through a small model of the maternity services, its use in practice. The community or surrogate of the community is referred to throughout as the decision makers, policy makers or planning body.</jats:p>",

The model presented here uses computer simulation to generate and evaluate samples from this population, with the objective of obtaining some observations from the vicinity of the over-all optimum.

Accordingly, this model was designed to satisfy a very real practical need.</jats:p>"

This paper considers the planning and implementation of the ground investigation under conditions normally prevailing in the British Isles.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>Various procedures are described for boring in soils and rocks, for trial excavations, for probing, and for geophysical surveying. Sampling procedures are considered on the basis of the quality of the sample thus obtained. Sample quality ranges between almost fully-undisturbed soil samples as taken by a thin-wall piston sampler, and fully disturbed samples taken from the drill tools.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The choice of procedure for boring and sampling is determined by the technical requirements of the investigation, by the practical problems arising from site conditions and by economy. It is considered that investigations should start using standard equipment and that the more sophisticated and expensive procedures should be employed only when the nature of the geotechnical problem has been determined.</jats:p>\n          <jats:p>The paper concludes with a discussion of the management and organization of site investigations.</jats:p>",

Of particular interest is the changing nature of these occupations in recent years. At one time, production oriented curricula sufficed for the vast majority of horticulture students. Today’s occupations, however, require a student to have a broad background in such areas as business, management, economics, education, and sociology. It is not rare in today’s agricultural job market to find employers who may wish to hire a horticulturist, but may relegate his knowledge of horticulture to a position secondary to that of business knowledge, or some other specialty. The changing nature of employment from the predominantly production oriented jobs of some years ago has also resulted in pressures upon the academic world to constantly re-evaluate horticulture curricula and re-tailor it to a rapidly changing job market.</jats:p>",

All of the reservoirs have different water drive strengths, so the erect of producing rate on ultimate recovery is different for each reservoir. This is a key consideration in total-field optimization.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>The Katy gas field is presently under a 20-year gas sales contract, begun in 1967, and is in the last stages of gas cycling, begun in 1943. The field is located 35 miles west of downtown Houston, covers an areal extent of 50 sq miles, and comprises 12 reservoirs in the Cockfield formation, located at depths ranging from 6,000 to 7,400 ft subsea. Each reservoir has a different water-drive strength, depending on rock permeability, sand thickness, ratio of aquifer radius permeability, sand thickness, ratio of aquifer radius to reservoir radius, and reservoir geometry in general. Thus, the effect of the producing rate on ultimate recovery is different for each reservoir, and is a key consideration for total field optimization. Reservoirs with weak water drives exhibit high recoveries as a result of the combined action of pressure depletion and water influx over a long production life. Reservoirs with strong water drives are more sensitive to the producing rate, and should be depleted very quickly in order to maximize ultimate recovery.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>To determine the optimum production and investment schedules for the entire Katy gas field it was first necessary to develop mathematical models for each reservoir from pressure-production performance over the past 27 years. Anomalies caused by interreservoir communication and pressure interference from other fields producing from the Cockfield formation were considered in developing these models so that reasonably accurate predictions could be made regarding future reservoir pressure and well deliverability. Water influx data for reservoirs that have already undergone a significant amount of blowdown was determined by volumetric balance calculations. For the reservoirs that have experienced little or no depletion, however, these factors had to be estimated.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>After reasonable reservoir models were determined, it was necessary to impose certain constraints on the long-range blowdown scheduling. Two of the reservoirs have an associated thin rim-type oil column that must be essentially depleted before full-scale gas blowdown can occur. In addition, certain reservoirs are separated by very thin shale barriers and therefore must be depleted simultaneously to prevent large pressure differentials across these thin barriers. This precaution minimizes potential interreservoir communication and thus conserves potential interreservoir communication and thus conserves reservoir energy.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Since most of the existing wellbores penetrate the productive areas of all the Katy reservoirs, it was productive areas of all the Katy reservoirs, it was necessary to develop models for estimating, the time at which wells water out and are available for recompletion to other zones. Wells now used for gas cycling in four of the upper reservoirs are also made available for recompletion as they drop out of the cycling program. Other factors to be considered for total field optimization are liquid recovery factors for each reservoir and development of sufficient deliverability to meet contract sales rates and peaking requirements. peaking requirements.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 145</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

To determine this area realistically both stochastic demand for and stochastic supply of water should be taken into account. In turn, these factors involve the need to know the best area to plant as a function of beginning‐season reservoir levels and the best way to allocate a given quantity of water over an irrigation season. Incorporating the results of models that give solutions to these latter problems into a simulation model and applying it to a hypothetical situation produced estimates of the best acreage to develop for irrigation. The result is sensitive to changes in the fixed costs of the system, and the penalty arising from choosing suboptimal acreages is much greater than the likely costs of applying the model. Although this application of the model has limitations, the basic approach is capable of useful elaboration.</jats:p>",
