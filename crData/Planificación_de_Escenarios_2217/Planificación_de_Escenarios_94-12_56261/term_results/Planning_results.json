He argued for the development of linear cities as opposed to the traditional compact form of nuclear development, based on their superior efficiency in transport and service provision. The idea of linear development is applied to an infrastructure plan for the Central Region of Chile around Santiago. Linear development is seen as a natural extension of the traditional form rather than its opposite. Existing cities are expanded through the use of integrated corridors within which urban land use follows transport provision. The plan is seen as a rationalisation of the use of infrastructure and is implemented through an efficient system of investment, pricing, and regulation. The plan was formulated and evaluated through the use of MEPLAN land-use and transport interaction model. </jats:p>",

The clearest of these are computer models based on cellular automata (CA) and their recent generalization in evolutionary biology and artificial life. Here we show how such models can be used to simulate urban growth and form, thus linking our exposition to the longer tradition of ideas in studies of built form emanating from the ‘Cambridge School’. We first review developments of CA in general and then in urban systems in particular. We propose a general class of CA models for urban simulation and illustrate two simple applications, the first a simulation of the development of the historical ‘cell’ city of Savannah, Georgia, the second, a generic hypothetical application. We then show how this generic model can be used to simulate the growth dynamics of a suburban area of a mid-sized North American city, thus illustrating how this approach provides insights into the way microprocesses lead to aggregate development patterns. </jats:p>",

The speculations relate to the classification of building types by activities and forms; to criteria of room size and lighting for classifying built forms; to possible regularities in the relationships of wall area to floor area in forms so classified; and to the modelling of hybrid assemblies of different types of forms. Connections are drawn throughout to the land-use and built form studies pioneered by March and Martin at Cambridge in the 1970s, which have provided the starting point for many of the ideas put forward here. </jats:p>",

It contains suggestions of what the author considers more fruitful directions for research in connection with the issues raised. The first two fallacies are very general. The first of these treats design as a monolithic, indivisible process that cannot be decomposed and thus partially supported. The second one insists that computer aids support current practice as it stands and rejects approaches that challenge that practice. The last two fallacies are very specific. The first of these occurs when shape grammars and related mechanisms are criticized for being based on a ‘linguistic analogy’. The last one deals with a specific version of appeals to authority that treats Heidegger as the ultimate arbiter in resolving philosophical issues in connection with computer-aided architectural design. </jats:p>",

Seventy‐eight Turkish university students from two different proficiency levels (intermediate and advanced) wrote on three different assigned topics: a Turkish culture‐specific topic, a topic related to American/British culture, and a more general topic. The study investigated: 1) if there were differences between the plans written in Turkish and English and the resulting compositions which correlate with the topic and proficiency level; 2) If there were differences between higher‐ and lower‐proficiency writers in terms of plan and composition scores for the three topics and if so, whether these differences could be attributed not only to the proficiency level but also to the language used for the plan. In addition, student responses to a questionnaire about their writing experiences in Turkish and English and their attitudes towards planning in Turkish or in English were analyzed. The findings indicate that the language used for the plan did not make a significant difference in the quality of the plans written by higher‐proficiency students on the three topics but did have an effect on the plans written by lower‐proficiency students on the Turkish and American/British culture‐specific topics. Moreover, the language of the plan did not make a significant difference to the resulting compositions for either group on any of the three topics. Furthermore, as was expected, proficiency level affected the quality of plans and compositions, but the language used for the plan had no significant effect on the differences between higher‐ and lower‐proficiency writers in terms of plan and composition scores. Student questionnaire responses helped to explain the results of this study.</jats:p>",

It is because that although family planning services are consumed\n      by private individuals it is accompanied by significant external\n      benefits/costs. This constitutes the reason on efficiency grouod for\n      public provision of family planning services. There are equity grounds\n      as well for public provision of these services. The public provision of\n      family planning services is based on paternalistic argument that\n      individual ought to consume them but are not acting in their own\n      self-interest and are not ready to purchase them without substantial\n      subsidisation. It may be one of the reasons for public provision of\n      family planning, but, on normative grounds it is hard to justify the\n      provision of merit good and still maintain the two basic premises of\n      classical welfare economics: that individuals are rational and that\n      individuals know their own interest best. In the context, of developing\n      countries these arguments however, take a different dimension. First, in\n      the absence of a democratic welfare state with high rate of\n      unemployment, lack of unemployment insurance and social security, lack\n      of old age security and pension a pertinent question to ask is: are\n      individuals particularly from middle and lower income groups acting\n      irrationally by demanding more children if children are perceived as a\n      source of social and economic support in old age as well as being a\n      source of additional family income.</jats:p>"

A design process is envisioned where the engineer specifies individual part geometries and relates parts to each other to create assemblies. A computerized tool then analyzes the design and suggests sequences for assembling the product. The high-level modeling scheme is described first. Parts are represented in terms of their features, while products consist of parts related to each other through mating conditions. Automatic reasoning processes applied to the design representation plan selected assembly sequences in two stages: A graph transformation method generates an exploded view of the product and a rule-based procedure derives selected assembly sequences. An implementation for triaxial assemblies is described and demonstrated. </jats:p>",

Only in the past few years   has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles   underlying this paradigm.  In this paper, we present a rigorous   comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by   focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We   show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the   wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of   partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority ofpartial-order   planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the   structure of the search space.  Understanding the underlying   assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.</jats:p>"

Telematics - the result of the convergence of telecommunications and computing technologies - are important facilitating technologies behind current processes of urban restructuring. But they are also a prime focus of current urban policy innovation. Three particular areas of such innovation are discussed in this paper: using telematics for urban economic development, developing social and community telematics applications, and networking between different cities. A wide range of policy experience is analysed in each area. The paper concludes by highlighting the continued importance of national policies in shaping urban policy in this area, and suggests how this new wave of urban telematics policies may play an important role in developing a place-based politics for shaping progressive urban change in the new global era.</jats:p>"

In contrast large companies do not have\nconsumer intelligence plugged in at the very top. Market research\nusually reports well down the organization, often to a functional\ndepartment like marketing. The failure to use consumer information\nproperly cuts companies off from opportunities and is a major reason for\nthe massive corporate failure seen at General Motors, IBM and Sears.\nFortunately failure on this scale is relatively rare; nevertheless\nconsumer information is not used well even in fast‐moving consumer goods\ncompanies. This is because information collection and analysis is\ndirected from too low down in the organization and consequently is\ndirected at tactical and not strategic issues. Spectacular business\nsuccess can occur when consumer information is understood and acted on\nby business leaders. Taco Bell is one such example. Concludes that\nthere is a need for CEOs who understand the centrality of consumer\nmotivation to planning strategy for their whole business. Moreover CEOs\nneed a creative strategic analyst who knows how to synthesize\ninformation to produce creative strategies which mobilize and\nco‐ordinate the company′s resources to motivate consumers to buy the\ncompany′s products and services.</jats:p>",

All TNA participants provided information about how the program may help to motivate, facilitate and enhance teacher’ communication skills in the classroom. The use of the TNA was an effort to collaborate with teachers rather than criticize them for their level of signing skills. The case study demonstrated that staff development alone was not the remedy for performance problems and that other factors contributed to teacher performance.\n\t</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I examine the achievements and lessons of the Bretton Woods System (BWS) fifty years after its founding in 1944. I do so with particular reference to propositions associated with hegemonic stability theories. In section 2 I challenge the view that the BWS was successful because it was a unique embodiment of US ‘benign hegemony’. I join with Walter, Strange, and other revisionist historians in arguing that the BWS was less a formal monetary system than a broad set of guidelines that was adopted and adapted by member states quite flexibly. The BWS was the product of a series of compromises reached by the USA and its West European allies in the period between 1944 and 1971. The Golden Age of Capitalism that coincided with the BWS in the advanced industrial world was also the product of factors that cannot be reduced to the BWS. US hegemony in the 1950s and 1960s was most obviously embedded in its military commitments overseas. I further suggest that international economic disorder after 1971 cannot be explained with reference to the alleged disappearance of a hegemonic power in the world economy. The USA has remained broadly hegemonic since 1971, but the nature of hegemony is changing in a changing global political economy. In section 3 I consider the claim that the international economy must become more unstable in the absence of a benign hegemon. The concept of order or instability is rendered problematic, and a model of ‘ordered disorder’ is set out. I suggest that a degree of order is being maintained in a dispersed hegemonic core at the cost of increased disorder in peripheral regions and communities that cannot positively access the emerging circuits of transnational capitalism or liberalism. Section 4 concludes the paper with some reflections on the lessons of Bretton Woods in the wake of the changes described in sections 2 and 3. </jats:p>",

In this paper, we draw on Butler's notion of gender identity as a regulatory fiction to investigate the consequences of the specificity of embodiment and gendered performances. Drawing on three case studies in the City of London, we explore the differential fictions constructed by men and women engaged in interactive service work in a professional capacity in merchant banks. We examine the ways in which women are embodied and/or represented as ‘woman’ in the workplace, comparing women's sense of themselves and their everyday workplace experiences with those of men doing the same job. Our aim is to establish whether the necessity of selling oneself as part of the product in such service sector employment challenges the idealisation of male workers as disembodied rational subjects, while not necessarily disrupting the inferior position of embodied women. </jats:p>",

Superficially at least, the Japanese case would seem to be (regulation-)theoretically intractable, given the country's unique postwar development path and given the apparent inconsistency of its growth pattern with classic notions of (Atlantic) Fordism, As such, the Japanese experience raises questions about conventional treatments of the historical geography of capitalist restructuring within (different readings of) regulation theory. Regulation theory, it is argued, represents an evolving political-economic method, not a rigid transition model. By implication, the idiosyncrasies of the Japanese experience present an opportunity to interrogate and develop regulationist categories. Critically reviewing the recent regulationist literature from and on Japan, the authors argue that the tension between the theory and this ambiguous case can be rendered a creative one. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The components of productivity change in manufacturing industry over the regions of Greece in the 1980s are examined. Regional differences in productivity are significant in two respects. They reflect the outcomes of different production processes in space where labour is supplied and combined with various sorts of capital and where specific technologies are used. They also reflect opportunities for developing efficient business operations in space, in that they indicate one important aspect of a region's comparative advantage. Change in value added in manufacturing is represented by change in the factor inputs of capital, labour, and technology. Some of this change in output is accounted for by constant returns to scale. The rest is a result of variable returns to scale, such as produced by agglomeration economies or diseconomies, different levels of infrastructure provision, etc, and technological change. Total factor productivity represents these sources of nonconstant returns to scale. It is shown that for Greece the largest gains in total factor productivity are to be found in the noncentral regions, and especially in those having industrial area projects and industrial grants and incentives. These results are in line with research undertaken in other contexts. Those areas with the most significant productivity gains from the deployment of new technology tend to be the well-established centres housing medium-sized populations. There is some evidence to suggest that new employment opportunities are associated with increases in total factor productivity, although rarely with advances in the use of new technology. </jats:p>",

These plans faced fierce opposition from those who sought to have the local character of the area, its ‘heritage’, preserved and enhanced. The controversy culminated in the 1980s, a period during which the City and its surrounds were under massive redevelopment pressure in response to various restructurings. The paper provides a contextualised reading of the discursive and representational terrain generated by this controversy. Ostensibly, this was a battle of the old against the new and presents an example of the workings of heritage within contemporary urban settings. But it also marks out the complex intersections between heritage, capital, and identity. This redevelopment struggle became an arena for the expression of the role and status of the City during a time when it was negotiating transformations in its built form and its social fabric as a result of challenging adjustments in its international standing. </jats:p>",

A graphical flowsheet editor enables an easy and flexible composition or change of plant configurations and their relevant data by using fundamental data registered in a database. Plant data composed by the editor are arranged automatically to carry out an optimization calculation, in which the operational strategy is determined so as to minimize an objective function, such as operational cost subject to energy demand requirements and other operational restraints. An application example shows that the system is a useful tool for the operational planning of energy supply plants from the viewpoints, not only of rationality, but also of task and time reduction.</jats:p>",

However, other empirical evidence fails to find a relationship (Robinson and Pearce, 1983). These differences are due to methodological and theoretical problems facing research in this domain. This paper attempts to improve on both issues. The hypothesis that ‘formal planning is not associated with better‐than‐average performance’ is tested on a sample of SMEs, controlled by sector, using a 5‐year operating period. Five measures of financial performance are utilized, including both the arithmetic and geometric measurements of central tendency as appropriate. Moreover, perceptions of CEOs, rather than the aggregation of scale‐based measurements of organizational variables, are used to prescribe the measure of formality used in the analysis.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>In one of the previous publications, the main indicators of the quality of diabetes care in our country have already been analyzed. One of the main (if not the main) reasons for its unsatisfactory quality, in our opinion, is inconsistency of theory and practice with the modern world scientific and clinical level of diabetology. A number of provisions of domestic diabetology are still based on the approaches of the 50-70s. For some recommendations, it is generally impossible to find scientific justifications in either foreign or domestic literature. They are transmitted orally from endocrinologists of the older generation to the young, like legends, without being scientifically proven. The only justification for them is the statement this is our school or this is how practice shows.&#x0D;\nAny approaches are really tested by practice. That is why unsatisfactory indicators of compensation and acute complications and disability for diabetes mellitus indicate significant shortcomings in domestic diabetology. When an endocrinologist says that he repeatedly had to note, for example, the appearance of acetonuria in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus after a fatty meal, or the ophthalmologist discovers a positive dynamics of the state of the retina while taking angioprotectors, these facts in themselves, observations, even numerous ones, do not prove the existence of a causal relationship between the two phenomena. Even the ancients said: \"After this - does not mean therefore.\" Due to the selectivity of attention and memory, the opposite cases, which are no less (in our example, the absence of acetonuria after a fatty meal or the preservation of hemorrhages, despite the many months of taking angioprotectors), prefer to not notice.&#x0D;\nThat is why it seems appropriate to discuss strictly defined principles and rules of evidence-based scientific and clinical research existing in the world practice. The main objective of this article is to help scientists avoid methodological errors in research, learn how to plan them correctly, and practical doctors to critically and thoughtfully understand the publications of medical journals. Programs of medical faculties of many countries include special courses on the formation of a critical type of medical thinking and the ability to reasoned analysis (the course medical logic, decision analysis, critical analysis of the postulates of medicine, etc.), which also address research planning problems. For clarity, this publication will focus on clinical trials conducted with the participation of patients and with the goal, as a rule, of studying the effectiveness of a treatment method or an individual drug, the characteristics of the course of the disease under certain conditions, etc.</jats:p>"

In this paper, by means of extensive secondary data sources, some facets of these links in relation to the transnational operations of Hong Kong firms and their foreign direct investment (FDI) flows in ASEAN countries are examined. It is found that out of thirty leading Hong Kong transnational corporations (TNCs), nineteen have together more than forty-three operations in ASEAN. Hong Kong TNCs in the tertiary sector are particularly inclined to establish cross-border operations in the ASEAN region. Any explanation of the operations of these TNCs in ASEAN must take into consideration ongoing network relations embedded in peculiar historical contexts and geographical confines. In terms of equity capital inflows, Hong Kong FDI in the ASEAN region regained its momentum after 1985. Indonesia and Thailand are the most favoured destinations for Hong Kong FDI. In these two countries, Hong Kong FDI ranks, respectively, as the second and third largest foreign investment. Future studies need to address the issue of Hong Kong's uncertainty over the ‘1997’ question and of theory-building in international business. </jats:p>",

Respondents rank ordered the appropriateness of four discharge options (i.e., outpatient clinic, housekeeping/chore, home health nursing, and nursing home care) for each case. Eighty chronically ill hospitalized patients from two VA hospitals served as subjects. Patient living arrangement, home assistance needs, and personal assistance needs had strong relationships with the perceived appropriateness of outpatient and nursing home care. When patient status was good, nursing home care was clearly an inappropriate solution from the patients' perspective. Outpatient care was ranked as less appropriate when patient status deteriorated. The only significant association with home health care was personal assistance needs. Medication complexity had no significant association with the four discharge options. </jats:p>",

This paper discusses how breastfeeding contributes to child spacing and reduced fertility; the appropriate and timely introduction of complementary family planning methods during breastfeeding; issues and controversies in the support of breastfeeding as a family planning issue in the context of women's concerns, including the concept of exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months, the encouragement and support to maintain breastfeeding after 6 months, and the use of the Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM) and other family planning methods in the early postpartum period; and the role of family planning programs in supporting women's informed reproductive health choices.</jats:p></jats:sec>",

The site is located in the Clark Fork River (CFR) basin of western Montana, and consists of 160 km (100 miles) of the CFR and an 820-acre wetland at Milltown Reservoir. The focus of the assessment was to identify chronic risks to ecological receptors from metals-contaminated sediments that have deposited in aquatic and terrestrial habitats of the site. Lack of established sediment or soil quality criteria, the extent of habitats within the watershed, and anticipated complex sediment and soil chemistry led to a unique laboratory and field-based approach for the baseline risk assessment. Study tasks evaluated aquatic, wetland, and terrestrial habitats across multiple trophic levels. The risk assessment integrated the results of these studies as a triad of chemical, toxicological, and ecological information. The comprehensive nature of the risk assessment was designed to help determine a remedial action for the wetland operable unit and set the basis for additional studies in the upper Clark Fork River watershed. As the problem formulation step in the EPA's risk assessment methodology, this article describes the background of the site, the approach and conceptual model for the risk assessment, and the planning process for implementing the various field and laboratory studies.</jats:p>",

Serious government investment can provide a base for much expanded service sector employment in neighborhoods in the central city and aging suburbs. Agglomeration effects in expanding service industries remain important for productivity, in spite of decentralization. Furthermore, the costs of decentralization impose constraints on further suburban growth. Urban neighborhoods can provide relatively high-productivity locales for service industries, because of existing infrastructure, a large labor force, proximity to downtowns, local entrepreneurs, and the enduring advantages of density. However, programs are needed to improve public infrastructure to increase productivity; invest in human capital; and strengthen the competitive position of neighborhoods through quality-of-life improvements. </jats:p>",

It demonstrates that the most well designed program can fail if staff charged with implementation are not committed to its goals. In the current racially charged environment of the country, this barrier to implementation is likely to affect many new government programs throughout the 1990s.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we analyse the ‘ordering’ of the international financial system in the 20th century, focusing upon the making and breaking of ‘Bretton Woods’. We argue for a more reflective, reflexive, and historical economic geography and for the need to take economic discourse seriously. This argument is developed by providing two accounts of the rise and fall of the Bretton Woods System. The first of these accounts is drawn from regulation theory, the second from neo-Gramscian political economy. These alternative accounts of the creation of the Bretton Woods System, and of the later reactions to its crisis, focus attention upon the central role of economic discourse in ordering economic processes in general and financial processes in particular. In making sense of the making and breaking of Bretton Woods, regulationist and neo-Gramscian approaches have afforded greater importance to issues of discursivity and have been more attentive to matters of money and finance. These developments are seen to be constituent of one another. The world of money is increasingly one of interpretative power struggles, where competing sets of scripts and discourses conjure up alternative plausible ‘orderings’ of the economic world. Moreover, the speed at which the discursive world of money and finance transforms itself continues to accelerate, so that the time—space horizons of the financial world are now at odds with those of conventional political thinking and of extant political institutions. This ontological disjuncture signifies an important imbalance between the social power of financial capital and those who would wish to bring about a ‘reordering’ of the economic world in favour of less powerful social groups. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Influenced possibly more by volume than substance, some scholars have concluded that significant progress is being realized in state-level land-use regulation in the United States. In truth, more time must pass before a definitive evaluation of the more comprehensive efforts can be made. In this critical paper I examine the statewide growth-management legislation of the four states having tripartite (local—regional—state) administrative hierarchies: Florida, Vermont, Maine, and Georgia. There and elsewhere, numerous structural compromises have won adoption. Bold declarations of regulatory intent are found here often to be wrapped around ambiguous and easily subverted administrative mechanisms and standards. With prima facie evidence of significant structural shortcomings in hand, I then restore focus on the founding debates in search of a synthesis that might be more supportive of regional growth management. </jats:p><jats:p> Using the theory of local autonomy as a starting point, I disentangle the normative foundations of the Liberal ethic of local participation and ‘control’, and of private rights in property. The centralization of growth management is seen by its proponents as a means to regionalize the ‘public interest’ in land use, positing a new and more expansive norm defining the public's interest in private property. Opponents, on the other hand, resist the public encumbrance of private land, and find in centralization a regionalized ‘public’ desirous of greater control and less amenable to private influence. In these opposing views, however, lies the possibility of less conflicted, more efficacious regional growth-management enactments. Centralization, I conclude, can actually deepen the capacity for ‘local’ participation yet at the same time extend its domain to matters of regional concern. The result can improve the capability of the local state to manage spillovers, achieve more sustainable patterns of growth, and facilitate more satisfactory templates of private investment and equity accumulation. </jats:p>",

Although the Hong Kong government has assumed an important position in the course of economic development in the territory, especially in terms of land-related economic activities, it has little vested interest and experience in directing industrial developments. It was not until the 1990s that the government switched from a ‘positive nonintervention’ to a ‘minimum intervention with maximum support’ industrial policy and began to play a more active role in facilitating industrial upgrading. The effectiveness of the changing industrial policy and the prospects for high-tech development in the territory are reviewed by examining the challenges and opportunities faced by the Hong Kong government in facilitating high-tech industrial development. </jats:p>",

In the second, a database relating to English wards is used to investigate the sensitivity of deprivation payments to the statistical transformation and standardisation in the specification of the deprivation index. It is argued that the aggregation and specification issues should be confronted directly in the conceptual and practical developments of current approaches. </jats:p>",

The specific learning technique was AQ15, which constructs rules by classifying sample data according to features or characteristics. The validity of the resulting rules was tested by obtaining a measure of performance called an estimate of the error rate. The machine‐derived rules were then compared to rules made by human experts and by two other versions of AQ15. Although not statistically significant, the machine‐learning version of AQ15 using hypotheses from human experts outperformed the other methods of rule construction.</jats:p>",

The solution is given by a parallel and iterative computation and described as a set of control points of a uniform B-spline. This algorithm can also be applied to solving problems with some constraints, if we introduce an additional component, namely the potential function, corresponding to constraints in the original objective function. The algorithm is very simple and easily applicable to various engineering problems. As an application, trajectory planning of a manipulator with redundant degrees of freedom is considered under the conditions that the end effector path, the smoothness of movement, and the constraints of the control or the state variables are specified. The validity of the algorithm is well confirmed by numerical examples.</jats:p>",
