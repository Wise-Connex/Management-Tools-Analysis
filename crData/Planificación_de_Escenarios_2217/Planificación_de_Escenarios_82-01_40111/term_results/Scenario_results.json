In addition to other results these models allow us to study the main properties of the formation of WR stars as post-red supergiants (Maeder, 1981c). Three grids of models have been computed: one for constant mass evolution (grid A) and the other two (B and C) with mass loss. As there exists no unique parametrization representing, over the various spectral types, the mass loss rates <jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" mime-subtype=\"gif\" xlink:type=\"simple\" xlink:href=\"S0074180900029090_inline1\" /> as a function of basic stellar parameters, we have used mass loss rates fitted on the observations, applying different laws for a) OB stars, b) B-G supergiants, c) red supergiants (RSG) and d) WR stars. At a given luminosity, the rates in grid C are twice as large as in grid B and both grids encompass the central bulk of the observed mass loss rates.</jats:p>"

Computerized systems of education and networks of such systems are now technically possible. Although capital resources for such systems may be scarce, eventually the substitution of capital for the even more expensive human labour may force the use of greater technology in education.
