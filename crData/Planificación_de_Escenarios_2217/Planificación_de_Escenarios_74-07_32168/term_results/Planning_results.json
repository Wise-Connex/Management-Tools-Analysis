      "abstract": "<jats:p> The planning of a community's development and opera tions, whether for a small town or an international project, requires the allocation of resources to various areas of endeavor. These resources can best be allocated if a reasonably accurate estimate is made of the needs for corrective action and the effectiveness of it as a function of the type and amount of expenditure. For example, an estimate may be made of the amount of pollution and social conflict which may develop and of the effectiveness of various physical and human countermeasures (sewage disposal facilities, air pollution control, police, hospitals, etc.); on this basis a reasonable allocation may be made. Such a procedure forces one to establish value systems in order to assess social costs on a basis compatible with real costs. This is difficult. Few planners understand the philosophical and long- term implications of their actions. </jats:p><jats:p> The approach adopted in this paper bears great similarity to optimal process control by computer, but it cannot solve problems unless suitable value systems can be established. Even when values cannot be adequately established, however, this approach to examining community problems allows decision- makers to better understand the implications of their actions. This approach helps educators to better plan programs which differ from the tradi tionally narrow engineering curricula and to intro duce the concept that technical tools and techniques have important applications in politics and philosophy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Here is a statistical analysis of fault damage based on 165 workovers through wells cut by active faults. Damage was found in wells cemented through the faults and was correlated with the age of the well, depth of intersection, type of well (single or dual), year of workover, and years on gas lift. Also discussed are effective workover techniques and means of preventing damage to new wells.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Introduction</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Casing damage resulting from slippage along active fault planes is a serious problem in workover operations in the South Pass Block 27 field at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Approximately 250 producing wells in this field intersect one of four producing wells in this field intersect one of four major field faults in a depth range where damage has been noted. Through Dec. 1, 1971, damage had been encountered in 54 of 165 workovers on fault-cut wells, resulting in the forced abandonment of 21 boreholes.Fault movement produced a casing centerline shift over a fairly short interval (less than 10 ft). Damage was normally not evident until a major workover was under way and full-gauge tools could not be worked through the casing opposite the fault zone. Swaging or milling was then required before workover operations could proceed. In cases where damage was severe, it was sometimes impossible to recover the tubing string opposite the fault, or to successfully mill through the damage without milling outside the casing. When this occurred, it was impossible to regain access to the wellbore below the fault, and the well was lost.The two primary goals of this study were:to develop a method of predicting damage in any fault-cut well before starting workover operations, andto determine a method of combating fault movement in both new wells and existing wells.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>Realization of these goals enabled implementation of a more effective workover program, and minimized economic loss from continued fault movement.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Evaluation of Potential Damage To Fault-Cut Wells</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>All four of the faults that caused the damage were normal contemporaneous growth faults. Faults 1 and 3 have growth indices (ratio of downthrown section thickness to upthrown section thickness) from 1.1 to 1.3 throughout the depth range where damage had been noted. Fault 2 has a growth index ranging from 1.3 at 4,000 ft to more than 1.6 at 8,000 ft, and the growth index for Fault 34 ranges from 1.7 above 2,000 ft to more than 2.0 at 6,500 ft. Faults 1 and 2 are buried at approximately 3,000 ft. Fault 34 is active to the surface; mud slides have been noted along the marine outcrop of this fault.Faults 2 and 34, with higher growth indices, exhibited the most severe damage; 47 of the damaged wells and all 21 forced abandonments resulted from these two faults. Movement along Faults 1 and 3 appeared less severe, resulting in only 7 damaged wells in 44 workovers. In view of this fact, Fault 2 and Fault 34 were investigated separately. Faults 1 and 3 were not analyzed in detail.As a preliminary step, damage trends of these faults were plotted vs variables of the original mechanical condition of the fault-cut wells in question to determine what factors could be correlated with occurrence and severity of damage. The interrelationship of these factors was then explored with a statistical analysis computer program. On the basis of this, the probability of encountering damage or losing the well probability of encountering damage or losing the well was estimated for wells cut by these faults.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>JPT</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 739</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

Some early applications are described in [2] [7]. Cloonan has employed simulation in examination of the salesman routing problem [3] [4]. Lodish, in CALLPLAN, has devised an interactive call planning system designed to assist sales management and/or salesmen in allocating sales call time more efficiently [6]. Armstrong has devised a system he labels SCHEDULE which estimates the value of calls on accounts [1]. Hess and Samuels have designed a computer based sales districting model which is an analogue of a legislative apportionment model [5]. The objective of this paper is to explore the nature of a call planning system entitled ALLOCATE. ALLOCATE was designed to be employed by upper sales management either as an input device for sales management decisions such as sales‐territory‐size, or as a vehicle for determining the effects of alternative call allocation strategies on territorial revenue over multiple time periods.</jats:p>",

To be sure it resembles its siblings, but there are striking differences, largely modernizations. The decade since 1962 has witnessed some remarkable advances-some scientific, others socio-medical-in Obstetrics.\" These advances, and the solid principles of obstetrics upon which they are based, are presented here with just the right mixture of authority and familiarity for the lay-but always inquisitive -audience addressed.</jats:p>",
