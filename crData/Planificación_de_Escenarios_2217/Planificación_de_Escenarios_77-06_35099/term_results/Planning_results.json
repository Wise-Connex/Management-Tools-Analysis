The system is paying for itself, at a cost of about 20 dollars per employee per year. The HRIS makes it possible to rapidly gather, store, update, retrieve, and display an endless variety of data on people and their jobs. The system ingests information via machine readable documents such as employee profiles and position profiles. It produces standard and special purpose reports for use by the personnel department and line management in problem solving. The corporation can process the data in countless ways to learn what is happening to the work force, enabling it to run the organization more effectively on a day to day basis. The HRIS has substantial potential as a long range planning tool. This enables a company to respond quickly and effectively to changes in its strategic objectives with corresponding changes in human resource management.</jats:p>",

In order\n      to examine the implica¬tion of these projections it is of interest to\n      look at almost all aspects of the country's economic and socio-political\n      structure. This paper focuses primarily on just one part of the overall\n      picture-namely some options that might be considered on the demand side\n      of the economy. Ideally one would like to understand each individual's\n      milieu and characteristics to try and project his future behaviour as a\n      consumer with reasonable accuracy. In practice this is, of course, not\n      feasible so that one must strive for a balance between a manageable\n      amount of data and yet capture enough of the key features of market\n      behaviour to produce meaningful results. These features should ideally\n      reflect socio-economic status, and regional and seasonal variations.\n      Largely because of the type of data readily available, this paper tends\n      to emphasize the first class of features and for the most part ignores\n      the other two.</jats:p>"

Rules typically represent inferential knowledge applicable to a given domain of discourse. Given a question-answering system containing a large number of such rules, a crucial problem arises in selecting those rules that are relevant and needed to answer particular input queries. A planning process has been implemented to find chains of rules that deductively infer the desired conclusions. The processes of forward chaining from assumptions and backward chaining from goals are combined to form middle-term chains which provide the basis of the planning mechanism. The applicability and generality of these techniques for use in other rule-based systems is also discussed.</jats:p>",

It extends the formal logic of growth-center-based development to show that the conditions necessary for reducing intraregional development inequalities are highly unlikely under any center-based spatial investment strategy. The strategy of growth paths is introduced as an alternative. The strategy argues that urban-tied services can be mobilized along a path, which would allow for a more equitable and possibly more efficient provision of public services. Roads positively affect the transition to development of those in proximity to them. This has always been a passive benefit of transport development. The growth-path strategy speculates that this transition can be actively encouraged. </jats:p>",

Population dynamics have been studied for cases where the structural parameters, namely the age-specific rates of fertility, mortality, and migration, are fixed. This paper addresses the question of how the system behaves under changing structural parameters. By applying the technique of matrix differentiation, sensitivity functions are derived which link changes in multiregional life-table statistics and in population projections to changes in the age-specific rates. A review of the technique, which may be used for the sensitivity analysis of any matrix model, is given in the appendix. </jats:p>",

Not infrequently, however, procurement aspects are difficult to model because of their relatively complex and evanescent nature. This raises the issue of how to build an overall logistics model in spite of such difficulties. This paper offers some suggestions toward this end which enable the procurement side of a model to be simplified via commodity aggregation in a “controlled” way, that is, in such a manner that the modeler can know and control in advance of solving his model how much loss of accuracy will be incurred for the solutions to the (aggregated) overall model.</jats:p>",

Working from these multi-project demands for skill group services, Bayesian decision analysis is used to produce a composite forecast of total skill group manpower demand. Options in the model provide for selectively varying the number and level of detail of the multi-project demand curves. The output of the model is useful for further manpower planning. </jats:p>",

A procedure is described which facilitates the selection of service processing centres from a number of possible alternatives and the identification of the most efficient system of connecting links with the objective of minimizing the total system cost. These costs may be associated with both the processing and transportation aspects of the process, and may include both capital and recurring annual costs over the economic life of the system. The problem is presented as the minimization of a nonlinear, separable concave objective function subject to a set of linear constraints in terms of the design or decision variables. A technique is described involving the iterative application of a linear programming algorithm, and a description is given of a package of FORTRAN subroutines by means of which econometric models of this type may be easily set up for networks of different types and which incorporate user-defined cost functions. The package is suitable for both batch and time-sharing use, but emphasis is placed on the latter for greater interaction with the planner or designer. Details are given of program availability and application to a typical problem is illustrated. </jats:p>",

Then, from ratings of similarity-dissimilarity by 300 raters, a matrix was generated of mean distances between all 861 possible factor pairs; the matrix was analyzed by computer-based multidimensional scaling techniques to determine the underlying dimensional structure. Finally, using procedures that paralleled those for determining factor similarity-dissimilarity, a value reflecting social importance was developed for each of the 42 factors and for the 5 basic dimensions which emerged from the multidimensional analysis. These values were found to cover a wide range; however, values for the same factors and dimensions were found to be nearly identical among different subgroups of people, even those with potentially divergent viewpoints, such as behavioral scientists and water-works professionals. </jats:p>",

However, there have been few attempts to measure residents' perceptions of the effect of alternative transportation proposals on their environment. The study reported here draws up a conceptual framework for measuring firstly the perceived attributes of a residential environment, and secondly how a population evaluates such an environment under different transportation options. In each instance the conceptual framework is tested by making use of case study data. At the first stage it is demonstrated how Kelly's Personal Construct Theory and related procedures can be applied to elicit cognised environmental components of urban places. One urban place is selected and population clusters which are ‘homogeneous' in socioeconomic characteristics and activity patterns are defined. The INDSCAL model is then specified and applied to determine whether members of each population cluster evaluate the attributes of their environment in the same way under alternative transportation proposals. The measures of environmental utility for each proposal which the model produces show considerable variation within the groups. However, the model successfully defines each group's response to the effects of different transportation options. </jats:p>",

Experimenting with the approach has led to the conclusion that it is very useful for planning and controlling development projects but we do not think it serves a real purpose when applied to basic research with a high level of technical content. Support is provided for the view that the RPD notation should be used to give prominence to decisions and that it can be employed as a communications link between different functions in a business area responsible for the successful completion of a project. The paper explains how the RPD notation is used on a routine basis in the management of development projects and describes the benefits that have been derived from its implementation. An illustration is included to show how the notation has been modified to permit criteria and data, relevant to the analysis of key decisions, to be added to the diagram.</jats:p>",

The model uses a modified transportation matrix formulated with nonlinear cost functions as the basic subregional model and the goal coordination method for multilevel decomposition and optimization of the overall regional system. The model is applied to projected water requirements for Salt Lake County in 1985. Sources of water supply ‐ surface water, ground water, import water, and reuse of reclaimed wastewater on a restricted basis ‐ are available to satisfy water requirements for municipal, industrial, and agricultural sectors in four subregions. The conjugate gradient projection method is used to optimize the first level subregional models having cost functions of the form of C = aX<jats:sup>b</jats:sup>, and the second level problem is solved using the conjugate gradient method.</jats:p>",
