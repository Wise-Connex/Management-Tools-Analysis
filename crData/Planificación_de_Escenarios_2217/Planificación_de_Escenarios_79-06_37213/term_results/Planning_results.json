There was a period in the late '50s when growing interest in the subject made “planning” a buzz word, but by the early '60s, many executives had come to feel that planning was a ritual with no measurable pay‐off. This attitude caused a rebirth in more serious planning, resulting in what today is known as strategic planning. In the early '70s, planning again fell into disrepute as planners were blamed for not foreseeing many of the problems that faced business. Today, as we approach the end of the '70s, planning is again an important function for management, but the task of the planner has evolved to include the conversion of plans to meaningful action—a challenge that has resided implicitly with the planner, but has seldom been successfully realized.</jats:p>",

I will have the baby sliced in two, and I will give each of you half.” “Good idea,” said one of the women. “Oh, sir, please don't do that,” wailed the other, “I'd rather you give the baby to this other woman.” Because of her concern, Solomon assumed the woman to be the rightful mother, and, giving the whole infant to her, he banished the woman who would have had the child divided, and thus ends the tale.</jats:p>",

How do you put the new systems into service? What are the implications for the company as a whole? Will it maintain or improve service levels, and how flexible are the systems currently available? The first paper, by Harry O'Brien, deals specifically with the load planning function. There is a resumé of this function and its objectives, a discussion of the respective roles of the load planner and computer, and a development of this theme by asking about the further possible role for computers now that they are interactive.</jats:p>",

Over-supply of library/information workers in a period of economic stringency; organisational marginality of the profession from the viewpoint of many employers; consequences of over-optismistic forecasting of future demand during the prosperous late 60's, all underline this need. </jats:p><jats:p> The two rather different disciplines of national UK economic and labour force \"prediction\" and of company manpower planning are outside the scope of this study. Total labour force projections do have relevance as influences on, and scenarios for, the library scene. Company manpower planning would obviously become relevant at the implement ation stage of any emergent national policies for library/ information manpower. This paper is primarily concerned with the secondary level of manpower planning and forecast ing - for specific occupations or industries, on a nation-wide basis. </jats:p>",

Frequently, these processes turned managers into efficient caretakers, unable to adapt to the constantly changing business environment. Part of the problem was the approaches were based on extrapolations of a business environment of relative plenty, one in which crises were operational rather than strategic. There had been little thought given to developing the means to deal with planning for shortages, for instance, or other important threats to the company's long‐term strategies.</jats:p>",

The area‐allocation model is a linear optimization model which maximizes gross margin from yields of crops under consideration subject to total water supply, maximum amount of water that can be delivered for irrigation purposes on any date of irrigation, and irrigation labor. The land area to be allocated to each crop for planting is the decision variable. Results from the area‐allocation model include cropping pattern, gross margin, total irrigation depth on each date of irrigation, total irrigation labor, and crop yield. Sensitivity analysis is performed to study the effect of changes in crop prices on the optimal results.</jats:p>",

The methodology has a deterministic aspect which yields the time evolution of the number of users for a transportation mode and it is based on certain assumptions about the attractivities of each mode, but it is always subject to fluctuations in human behavior. The problem then is to find the solutions of the deterministic equations describing the system and to examine the evolutionary path the system will take. Two models of competition between transportation-mode choice are developed to illustrate the methodology and to justify the dynamic approach to travel choice. </jats:p>",

The model is used to study the effects of the decentralization of basic employment in the Los Angeles metropolitan region from its central core to a suburban location in Orange County. Advantage is taken of the fact that the study region comprises a large number of separate fiscal jurisdictions, and so the model is extended to measure the fiscal impacts of the derived population and employment changes associated with this decentralization. It is shown that net impacts hide significant gross expansions and declines that occur at the geographically disaggregated level. The relocation of a given number of basic jobs from Los Angeles to peripheral Orange County has a marked impact on jobs, population, and public expenditures in individual cities, depending on their relative proximity to the sources of basic-employment change. Although the relationship between the central city and the suburbs is highly competitive, the central city may gain from spatial-multiplier impacts if the suburbs (especially close-in suburbs) attract jobs from outside the region. </jats:p>",

The material is provided by the 1971 National Fertility Survey of Korea, 23,635 retrospective birth records of 6,285 women. The findings suggest that prior to the introduction of a national family planning program, the influence of infant death was limited to the biological effect resulting from a shortened lactational period. Since fertility regulation methods have been made available throughout the country, motivational effects to replace the lost child appeared to emerge. The proportion of excess births attributable to infant deaths has increased in recent years. However, because of the lowered infant mortality, the overall impact of infant death on the national fertility level appears to be small. </jats:p>",

Breiten Raum nimmt in diesen Forschungen die wirtschaftliche Ausplünderung der okku- pierten Gebiete und der mit Hitlerdeutschland verbündeten Staaten ein. Leider zu wenig beachtet wurden, auch in der Geschichtswissenschaft der DDR, die Probleme des institutionellen Mechanismus, durch den die Wirtschaftspolitik und Wirtschaftsstrategie dos deutsehen Imperialismus in Gang gesetzt oder überhaupt erst initiiert und konzipiert wurde. Die Frage lautet: Wer waren die Personen, Interessengruppierungen, Klassenkräfte und Institutionen staatlicher oder privatwirtschaftlicher Provenienz, die Politik entworfen und umgesetzt haben? Welche Absichten und Ziele haben sie verfolgt, wer hat am meisten davon profitiert, und zwar im weitesten Sinne, nicht nur im Hinblick auf die Erzielung eines Maximalprofits. Aus neueren Forschungen über die deutsche Kriegswirtschaft in den Jahren 1943 - 1945 soll hier versucht werden, erste Ergebnisse vorzulegen, die allerdings nicht den Anspruch auf Vollständigkeit erheben können, weil die Arbeiten noch nicht abgeschlossen sind.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p><jats:bold>ABSTRACT: </jats:bold> Private lakeshore development usually precedes establishment of public lake access. As a result, the best access areas are often occupied before public access is provided. The public then has a problem to provide access for nonriparian citizens. This problem can be anticipated and prevented by classifying undeveloped lakeshore areas according to suitability for both private and public uses, and incorporating appropriate recommendations into the municipal, comprehensive land use plan. To accomplish this, a site evaluation system has been developed which numerically rates the lakeshore for each of four public uses: public beaches, picnic areas, boat access areas, and public marinas; and two private uses: private marinas and vacation homes. Ratings are developed for: slope, soil suitability, shoreland type, water quality, site location, scenery, and road access. These ratings are combined with a statement of public goals developed from attitude surveys to produce a lakeshore land use plan. The plan recommends that lakeshore areas best suited for private development are so used, and areas best suited for public use are reserved for that purpose. This site evaluation system is demonstrated by a case study on Lake Champlain in Ferrisburg, Vermont.</jats:p>",
