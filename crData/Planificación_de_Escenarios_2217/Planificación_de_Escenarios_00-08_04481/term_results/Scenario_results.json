The problem lies in the software development process. In this book John Carroll shows how a pervasive but underused element of design practice, the scenario, can transform information systems design. Traditional textbook approaches manage the complexity of the design process via abstraction, treating design problems as if they were composites of puzzles. Scenario-based design uses concretization. A scenario is a concrete story about use. For example: \"A person turned on a computer; the screen displayed a button labeled Start; the person used the mouse to select the button.\" Scenarios are a vocabulary for coordinating the central tasks of system development—understanding people's needs, envisioning new activities and technologies, designing effective systems and software, and drawing general lessons from systems as they are developed and used. Instead of designing software by listing requirements, functions, and code modules, the designer focuses first on the activities that need to be supported and then allows descriptions of those activities to drive everything else. In addition to a comprehensive discussion of the principles of scenario-based design, the book includes in-depth examples of its application.</jats:p>",

But we argue that rapid warming in recent decades has been driven mainly by non-CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            greenhouse gases (GHGs), such as chlorofluorocarbons, CH\n            <jats:sub>4</jats:sub>\n            , and N\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            O, not by the products of fossil fuel burning, CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            and aerosols, the positive and negative climate forcings of which are partially offsetting. The growth rate of non-CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            GHGs has declined in the past decade. If sources of CH\n            <jats:sub>4</jats:sub>\n            and O\n            <jats:sub>3</jats:sub>\n            precursors were reduced in the future, the change in climate forcing by non-CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            GHGs in the next 50 years could be near zero. Combined with a reduction of black carbon emissions and plausible success in slowing CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            emissions, this reduction of non-CO\n            <jats:sub>2</jats:sub>\n            GHGs could lead to a decline in the rate of global warming, reducing the danger of dramatic climate change. Such a focus on air pollution has practical benefits that unite the interests of developed and developing countries. However, assessment of ongoing and future climate change requires composition-specific long-term global monitoring of aerosol properties.\n          </jats:p>",
