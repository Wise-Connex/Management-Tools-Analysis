The concept of quality of life is examined in general terms through definitions, concepts, models, and methods. Following this are discussions on quality of life as it relates to places or geographic areas, primarily urban ones, but also rural areas and neighborhoods; the role of quality of life in human migration; the impact of quality of life on firm location; and the relationship between quality of life and regional economic growth. The authors conclude that quality of life will increasingly play a significant role in various planning dimensions, but that role is likely to be a complex one. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We live in increasingly planned and controlled environments. The places we live, work, interact, visit, and travel through are the products of designers and planning regulations. The planners, designers, and others in the property development industry, employ a wide range of means by which to identify the needs and aspirations of the clients, the property owners, and the potential users of such spaces. But this paper is interested in a “single-user” group that has not often been routinely consulted as to its use of our everyday spaces. Children live and interact in neighbourhoods, and many of these spaces have been expressly designed as “child-centred” or “child-rearing” landscapes. Yet how can planners and designers learn more from children about their use of, and needs in, such neighbourhood spaces? Following a review of the literatures on cognitive mapping and some of the limitations and possibilities in using these types of techniques with young children, we recount here a project called KIDSMAP in which children draw mental or cognitive “maps”. Although there are limitations in the application of cognitive map work with children, we have found that they do work hard at representing places which are important to them. In this paper we review the children's maps against Lynch's well-known typology of urban design elements. Through this illustration, we hope to show how cognitive map techniques may provide one way to collect information on what is really of interest and importance to this often overlooked user “constituency”.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The challenge for managing urban change is to identify ways in which to build up a capacity for governance and for capturing opportunities, the active construction of arenas for informed policy debate, and the development of a coherent local view on the process of “place-making”. Such considerations were brought into sharp focus by the bombing of Manchester City Centre and the destruction of its commercial core in June 1996. The paper focuses on the impact of this disaster for the promoting of the city's entrepreneurial credentials, and the rapid response to the challenges of rebuilding. The promotion of established collaborative arrangements and network linkages culminated in the rapid emergence of both a master plan and an implementation agenda, encompassing a range of programmes and projects that collectively aim to enhance the vitality and competitiveness of the core. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper we propose numerical measures for evaluating the aesthetic interest of simple patterns. The patterns consist of elements (symbols, pixels, etc) in regular square arrays. The measures depend on two characteristics of the patterns: the number of different types of element, and the number of symmetries in their arrangement. We define two complementary composite measures L and C for the degree of pattern in a design, and compute them here for 2 × 2 and 6 × 6 arrays. The results distinguish simple from high-variation cases. We suspect that the measure L corresponds to the degree that human beings intuitively feel a design to be “interesting”, so this model would aid in quantifying the visual connection of two-dimensional designs with viewers. The other composite measure C based on these numerical properties characterizes the extent of randomness of an array. Combining symbol variety with symmetry calculations allows us to employ hierarchical scaling to count the relative impact of different levels of scale. By identifying substructures we can distinguish between organized patterns and disorganized complexity. The measures described here are related to verbal descriptors derived from work by psychologists on responses to visual environments. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Can neighborhood design improve traffic? Although a fair question in its own right, several influential planning strategies, including “the new urbanism,”“smart growth,” and the “livability agenda” take the answer more or less for granted. But what do we really know, and how can we improve our knowledge on this key issue? The article first proposes a scheme for categorizing research addressing these and related questions. It then presents a detailed discussion of key studies of urban form and travel behavior. The research strategies employed and the data, methods, and results of these studies are evaluated in detail. The article concludes that although this body of research is improving in several respects and should be encouraged by policy makers and scholars alike, our current understanding of this complex group of relationships remains tentative. The basis for using land use and urban design to selectively change travel behavior thus appears limited in the near term, whereas research opportunities abound. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the historically close relationship between GIS and land-use studies, there has been little constructive dialogue on the relationship between GIS theory and land-use analysis. The distinctive feature of land-use studies is their grounding in the idea of social purpose. “Purpose”—the telic dimension—is one of four dimensions of meaning discussed by Moravcsik and based ultimately on the work of Aristotle. So far in GIS, however, only the formal dimension has been emphasised. In this paper we draw on the work of philosophers such as Searle and Goodman to show the significance of the telic and constitutive dimensions of meaning for GIS and land-use studies. We also consider the relationship between terms in natural language and GIS-based analysis. Against this background we consider how GIS applications can be classified in relation to their treatment of language — purpose” and “space — time”. We conclude by suggesting that familiar GIS problems such as the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy are instances of more general philosophical problems and that insights from linguistic philosophy can contribute to GIS development. </jats:p>",

In particular, the use of visualisation in design control has been of interest in opening up the planning process to those outside the design profession with a view to improving decisionmaking. Despite research demonstrating that this occurs, implementation of visualisation on a routine basis within planning authorities remains limited. In this paper a literature review is presented concerning visualisation of urban environments to explore the reasons for this lack of implementation. The interrelation of abstraction, accuracy, and realism in visualisation is used as a framework for this examination. </jats:p>",

In this case, the cells grow in an irregular pattern and can change in number and state, and the roads direct the growth pattern of the urban cluster and stimulate cell generation. The coupled effects of a cellular mechanism and a road network and the long-distance effects determined by spatial mobility are presented in two forms: first in a theoretical framework, and then through numerical simulation in which various sets of key parameters are utilised. A model is proposed in which growth is related to the fractal dimension of the cluster. Finally, conclusions are drawn for the long-run effects of morphology modification in relation to land use and to spatial pattern. </jats:p>",

Their fractal dimension increased with time. However, the metropolis as a whole can be said to be fractal only after 1985.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> When using the rating and weighting (RAW) method in land suitability assessment, planners often substitute the theoretical weight-value range [0, 1] with a weight-value set, an ordered set of discrete values reduced from the continuous weight-value range. In constructing such a weight-value set, one needs to decide on how many weight values should be used (size of the value set) and where in the value range they should be placed (the choice of weight values). At present, one must make these decisions and defend their credibility on the basis of “professional judgments”, as a theoretical framework for such purposes is simply not available. Can a theoretical framework be established so that one can make these decisions systematically? If so, is it advantageous to use such a framework, instead of the existing methods, in constructing weight-value sets? In this paper these two issues are explored. I found that the theoretical weight-value range [0, 1] is actually sliced into segments; that in producing land suitability scores, weight-value sets that are constructed from these segments function just as effectively as the weight-value range; and that a five-rule framework comprised of these weight-value sets offers a higher level of efficiency and greater transparency than existing methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Mediation has now been canvassed for use in the settlement of planning disputes. But does mediation have a role to play here? In the literature on alternative dispute resolution some authors have argued that there are general rules for deciding which types of dispute would be suitable for mediation and which would not. The rule of ‘presumptive mediation’ has been advocated; that as long as certain conditions are satisfied, mediation should be the first procedure used. If mediation is not successful, the mediator can then make an informed recommendation for a different procedure. But is the utility of mediation so ubiquitous? Is the rule of presumptive mediation appropriate, even safe, in all circumstances? We investigate the role of mediation in one particular field of dispute resolution, where the circumstances are, on the face of it, markedly different to the ‘normal’ situation for which mediation has been used and proved successful; where the disputes concern specific proposals for the development of land and, in particular, where the dispute is between local planning authorities, private developers, and community groups. We attempt to analyse the conditions under which mediation may serve a useful function in this particular field of dispute resolution and investigate how ‘fitting the forum to the fuss’ may be dealt with in relation to the specific circumstances and context of so-called planning disputes. </jats:p>",

In particular, two network models, cohesion and structural equivalence, are explored in the context of the emerging Greek GIS community. A map of this community based on GIS teams and linkages is put forward, and two social constructs, institutional setting and disciplinary background, are used to highlight the heterogeneous context within which GIS are embedded across a whole country. The findings suggest that specific actors such as the Greek ESRI vendor and relevant social groups such as the teams with a surveying engineering background take centre stage in the diffusion of GIS innovations in Greece in the early 1990s. </jats:p>",

Some cultures had no written language and used past stories to save their history and values. For example, writing did not exist for the New Zealand Maoris, or other Polynesian cultures, until the Christian missionaries set about reducing their language to written form. The narrative was their only option other than petroglyphs. Many corporate cultures such as 3M and Hewlett- Packard have used stories to explain the importance of innovation to the corporation. Lessons are learned from these stories, such as when 3M scientists kept their new product ideas alive even when counter to their superior’s orders. At Hewlett-Packard they tell stories of their most famous entrepreneurs, Bill and Dave. Personally, I collected a group of our stories at 3M and published them so that they would not be lost (Shaw 1998).</jats:p>",

Such resource allocation decisions are predominantly made by government. When this function is spread across three levels of government each with their own departments of state and other agencies this task is made more difficult. Integrated planning involves the coordinated delivery of Commonwealth, State, Local Government and private sector investment to implement an agreed plan. The level of government in both Canada and Australia best placed to initiate, formulate and guide the implementation of such integrated plans is local government. This is despite the fact that it has no constitutional recognition and, in both revenue raising and expenditure terms, it remains very much the third tier of government.</jats:p>"

It is, however, contended that the approach they adopt may be perfectly rational and effective when account is taken of the context within which they are starting‐up. The research found that very few potential owner‐managers adopted an approach involving the formulation of business plans and formal market research. Also little use was made of networks. Instead, most owner‐managers utilised informally absorbed information obtained through previous experience. They also adopted risk minimising strategies that involved an incremental approach to start‐up. This article argues that trainers and others involved with business inception need to take into account that businesses will often successfully adopt such methods at start‐up.</jats:p>",

With respect to terminology, this book suggests that to be relevant and sustainable, current LP would have to define its mission as the deregulation of access to specialised knowledge, and correspondingly be founded on substantially different methods and theoretical bases: epistemology and ontology of specialised domains; research on language for special purposes (LSP) and collocations; corpus linguistics; knowledge extraction and knowledge representation; language engineering technologies. On the one hand, the book recommends itself to decision-makers and language planning project managers. On the other, it should be of interest to students of LSP and terminology, language planning, concept and object theories, knowledge modelling, artificial intelligence, text and corpus management, translation process analysis, text and African linguistics.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Drawing on Judith Butler's notion of performativity I examine some of the ambivalences and contradictions surrounding the exposure of pregnant bodies in public places. I focus on a bikini contest that was held on 7 October 1998 for pregnant women in Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand. I also focus on the narratives of thirty-one women who were pregnant for the first time and living in Hamilton, Aotearoa/New Zealand. There are normative expectations that women will do pregnancy in specific ways. For example, when occupying public places they are expected to act in a manner that is demure and modest. Such behaviours are repeated over time, eventually taking on the appearance of being ‘natural’. The pregnant women who entered the bikini contest momentarily destabilised these expected behaviours causing ‘pregnancy trouble’. The contestants were described by organisers of the contest as “pregnant women with attitude”. Parodying more normative beauty pageants the contestants (im)pregnated the streets. Yet at the same time the contestants reiterated hegemonic discourses of pregnancy by celebrating motherhood as a glorious and beautiful thing. This indicates the multiple ways in which pregnant women and others negotiate pregnancy resulting in a variety of complex subject positionings. </jats:p>",

An action-learning intervention in a municipality provides the stage for observing several metaphors at work in advancing learning within the planning group. The aim of the paper is to explore the role of language in producing and expressing situated knowledge and to further the interpretation of metaphors as organizational artifacts instead of linguistic or mental materials. The understanding of metaphors is always a creative endeavour, and metaphors can be both facilitators of learning and the tangible manifestation of something learnt. Understanding metaphors as the dreamwork of language collapses the traditional distinction among metaphors either as heuristic or generative. </jats:p>",

This has two major effects on transportation: (1) telecommunications partially substitute for travel to the workplace and to some other preexisting destinations; and (2) often indirectly, telecommunications stimulate new activities and generate extra travel. In this paper, I first develop an analytical framework for understanding changes in residential location flexibility that result from the direct travel substitution effect. I then apply this analytical tool to an exploration of the emerging urban spatial structure in the information age; alternative scenarios of telecommunications usage are simulated in a hypothetical metropolitan setting, and insightful results are obtained. The simulation is followed by a discussion of the role of urban planning in shaping the future pattern of residential growth. In an effort to stimulate further thinking and research, I point out in the conclusion that the analytical approach should be extended by taking into account the travel generation effect of telecommunications, and could be incorporated into land-use models.</jats:p>",

In this paper I report research to define a set of localities intended to provide an up-to-date and relevant definition of local communities across Britain for the very varied purposes of academic social scientists. First, the multidimensional nature of modern localities are outlined. Three established types of regionalisation procedure are then reviewed, leading to the identification of an appropriate method for analysing a suitable dataset. At the same time, it is concluded that a broadly based set of boundary definitions requires a more innovative approach in order to collate the many strands of evidence which are relevant to locality definitions. The response here is the development of synthetic data which codifies the critical information in any boundary set into a form which can then be combined with other, similar evidence. This leads to the first empirical challenge, which is to collect or create boundary sets which each provide a relevant strand of evidence for locality definitions. I apply the preferred regionalisation method to the synthetic data which has been created, and illustrate the localities which have been defined on this basis. I end by suggesting some other ways in which synthetic data might be analysed to provide insights into patterns of spatial association at the local scale. </jats:p>",

Forests were generated using four age-class distributions, nominally called immature, regulated, overmature, and old-growth. Management planning problems with adjacency constraints were formulated for these forests in Model 1 format based on a planning horizon consisting of three 20 yr periods. The problems also included flow constraints and minimum average age requirements for the ending forest. For all age-class distributions, the Type I ND constraint type resulted in significantly lower solution times than either the Pairwise or the NOAM constraint types. NOAM constraints performed better than Pairwise constraints for immature forest problems, but Pairwise constraints performed better than NOAM constraints for overmature and old-growth forest problems. There was no difference between these two constraint types for regulated forest problems. Results also show that the age-class distribution of the forest is one of the most important factors determining the time needed to solve forest management problems with adjacency constraints. In general, the more mature the forest, the harder the problem is to solve. In particular, problems based on the old-growth age-class distribution typically took much longer to solve than comparable problems based on the other age-class distributions. FOR.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>One of the characteristics of modern industrial development is the emergence of a new typology of accidents whose effects can be spread, in space as well as in time, well beyond the borders of the installations where they occur, sometimes impacting the local population and the environment in a catastrophic fashion. This is the result of a number of factors that have changed the risk profile of modern industrial activities. For a number of reasons, the developing countries have proved to be more vulnerable to industrial disasters. Three of the most catastrophic industrial accidents—Bhopal, San Juan de Ixhuatepec, and Cubatão—occurred in developing countries, claiming thousands of lives. During the 1970s and 1980s the higher degree of public visibility of industrial hazards as a result of serious accidents, led to the creation, especially in the more industrialized countries, of regulations for greater control over industrial activities, either by means of new laws or by updating existing legislation. Some of these regulations were designed to improve the response to accidents with potential impacts outside the industrial sites. This article attempts to describe the current status and identify the shortcomings of off‐site emergency planning for hazardous industrial areas in Brazil. The most important problems are the lack of specific legislation and the absence of awareness and active participation of public authorities. The experience of an off‐site emergency planning process for a Brazilian industrial area is presented. This experience illustrates how difficult it is to prepare and implement emergency planning processes in an industrializing country.</jats:p>",

The author uses quasi-experimental control-group methods to assess the economic impacts of these facilities on US counties during the period 1972–94. It is shown that few real negative effects can in fact be attributed to LULUs. However, only interstate highways measurably stimulate aggregate employment. </jats:p>",

The author examines how these aspects of embodiment have been marginalised within social analysis and the effects of this marginalisation in understandings of subjectification. Describing the processes of subjectification in terms of ‘habit’ and ‘style’, the author suggests that the disclosive and performative in the everyday have been ignored in favour of a search for the foundations of the everyday and the subject. An argument is put forward for the groundlessness of being in terms of its potential to be otherwise. The above discussions are described in terms of the ability of collectives to make sense from the fleeting and ephemeral feelings and experiences of everyday on-going comportment. Finally it is suggested that through a consideration of the performative, collective, and material nature of embodiment contemplations of everyday life should be understood in terms of enaction and immanence. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper is concerned with exploring the potential of performance and performativity as conceptual tools for a critical human geography. We begin by emphasising the importance of recognising the different ways in which performance can be theorised, and their very different critical effects. We then argue that, although the geographical literature is apparently characterised by two contrasting discussions of performance (those of Goffman and of Butler), these accounts form a consensus around Goffman. By contrast, and along with Butler, we maintain that performance is subsumed within and must always be connected to performativity—that is, to the citational practices which produce and subvert discourse and knowledge, and which at the same time enable and discipline subjects and their performances. But we also take Butler elsewhere, arguing that spaces too need to be thought of as performative, and that more needs to be made of the complexity and instability of performances and performed spaces. To illustrate our general arguments, but also to show how they work out rather differently in the specificities of particular social practices, we draw on two very different pieces of research which we have separately been involved in: a study of community arts workers and projects in Edinburgh and another on car-boot sales as alternative spaces of consumption. We conclude the paper by arguing for the necessity of extending our arguments to encompass academic performances and performativity, reflecting on our own production, both through particular academic performances of our respective research projects and this paper. </jats:p>",

The paper provides empirical evidence supporting the proposed model using data on manufacturing productivity growth across 178 NUTS2 regions of the European Union.

In centring my arguments within the corpus of Deleuze's philosophy of difference I advocate academic production as creative of thought. This is to suggest a performative thinking and doing that unfolds our way of looking at our social, corporeal, human dramas and the technologies by which we feel able to analyse something, and in so doing, enact its constitution. Coursing underneath this issue of performativity is the problematisation of the term of the subject—what if the event was more important? What do we understand of the event if not through a sense of subjectivity? Insinuated within the confrontation with performativity are fundamental implications associated with the timing of something as it happens, the centrality of the material and visceral body to this, and the settings through which events take place. Arguing through this triality I extract three symptomatic themes of performativity: that it speaks of irretrievability, indeterminacy, and excess. Ethically, and in conclusion, emphasis is placed on the empiricism of life in its doing—the present moment of immediate uncertain happening as we are continually enacted out of ‘knowing’ how to go on within concrete, material circumstances. </jats:p>",

In particular the study focused on the information and practical advice and support they received in hospital and how much this facilitated them in caring at home following the patient’s discharge from hospital. The study used a convenience sample of 12 patients and carers referred to a specialist palliative care service in an acute teaching hospital. The data were collected using semi-structured interviews. Qualitative analysis identified an overarching theme and related categories on coping with caring at home. The findings are supported by Folkman’s (1997) model of stress and coping and corroborated by other research on carers’ needs (Davies et al, 1994; Fakhoury et al, 1997). Interventions that may enable health professionals to facilitate carers to cope more effectively in caring at home and recommendations for further study are discussed. </jats:p>",

Drawing on related qualitative and quantitative survey evidence, the author first argues that owner-occupiers have experienced and also perceive considerable labour-market insecurity. However, analysis of the large-scale survey suggests only weak linkages between indicators of insecurity and the choices that owners make in the housing market. This apparent inconsistency is explored with the aid of the qualitative data which suggest that perception of insecurity and attitude to risk intersect to create strategies that may not bear any direct connection to measurable and objective labour-market characteristics or risks. The author concludes by arguing that this evidence suggests that the current policy aim of leaving owners to insure themselves against labour-market risk will leave some owners unprotected, and that this gap is likely to persist in the long term. </jats:p>",

This trend seems likely to continue, so that they will become widely used in geography and in urban and regional planning. We present an overview of examples of these models in the life sciences, economics, planning, sociology, and archaeology. We conclude that ABMs strongly tend towards an individualist view of the social world. This point is reinforced by closer consideration of particular examples. This discussion pays attention to the inadequacy of an individualist model of society with reference to debates in social theory. We argue that because models are closed representations of an open world it is important that institutions and other social structures be explicitly included, or that their omission be explained. A tentative explanation for the bias of ABMs is offered, based on an examination of early research in artificial intelligence and distributed artificial intelligence from which disciplines the approach is derived. Some implications of these findings are discussed. We indicate some useful research directions which are beginning to tackle the individualism issue directly. We further note that the underlying assumptions of ABMs are often hidden in the implementation details. We conclude that such models must be subject to critical examination of their assumptions, and that model builders should engage with social theory if the approach is to realise its full potential. </jats:p>",

Coinciding as it has with concerns about the future viability of many of these centres, the promotion of leisure and tourism businesses—and the concomitant conversion of property—has become a core strategy for many local authorities and town-centre managers. Informed by the work of Sharon Zukin, the authors argue that, rather than reflecting the increasing strength of urban areas, the opposite may be the case, particularly in smaller provincial towns. Using case-study data, the authors show that, rather than compete for space, most new leisure businesses employ opportunist strategies, colonising areas no longer required by other occupiers—whether retail, commercial, or industrial. As a result, they argue, the emergence of concentrations of leisure-based property occupiers in town centres signals little more than a delay in the economic restructuring of the area. </jats:p>",

Rather than being the product of disembedded market forces, this new global political economy is organized by specialized forms of intelligence gathering and judgment determination inside the new global finance (NGF). These embedded knowledge networks (EKNs) include the major bond-rating agencies, such as Moody's Investors Service, and Standard and Poor's (both based in New York, but increasingly operating internationally). The author analyzes central features of EKNs, including their relationship to social interests, epistemic authority (the consequences that follow from EKN reputational assets), market coordination (the policy implications of EKN transformation of uncertainty into risk), and the complexities that characterize the interaction between EKNs and governments. The author argues that rather than disappearing with the increasing freedom of global market forces in the NGF, authority has been reinvented—characteristically in the form of EKNs—altering the postwar balance of public and private influence on policy formation. </jats:p>",

Also, recent developments show that most software projects require knowledge and skills in a lot of areas. Since the necessary expertise often cannot be found at one development site, the necessity arises to distribute projects among several sites, or form \"virtual\" corporations, where software development is shared between several companies. The first point makes it necessary to support changes by identifying and notifying the people affected by a change. The second point emphasizes this necessity, while also complicating project planning and management: changes in one development site or company might necessitate replanning in several locations. In this paper, we introduce the MILOS approach, which provides concepts to integrate process modeling, planning, scheduling and enactment in one system. Thus dynamic plan changes, as well as automated feedback from execution to the project plan can be supported. </jats:p>",

He argues that the contemporary ethical project involves a derationalisation of ethics through a recorporealisation of space. There is a move away from the abstract space of liberal-individualist notions of justice to more enclosed and local spaces of communitarian loyalties and intersubjective communication. Postmodern interventions into the ethical realm lead us to a corporealised, intimate space that recognises difference and is heavy with phenomenological presence. The author argues that the conception of agency which explains adherence to community norms and the acknowledgement of difference is strategically rational self-interest. Situated practices and understandings of the other rely on rational assumptions. The time-space conditions of late modernity bring unlike others into more regular contact and open up the possibilities for more universalist forms of strong (ethical) social coordination based on expanded strategic rationality. </jats:p>",

It is found that there are serious problems concerning public participation when it comes to projects which extend beyond the local level and which play an important part in the regional economy.

In the case of a small-sized platform, the mobile manipulator may tip over when moving at high speed or executing tasks in the presence of disturbances. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously consider both stabilization and manipulation while coordinating vehicle motion and manipulator motion. In this paper, we first present the concept of the valid stable region to evaluate stability in the presence of disturbances. Next, we propose a method for coordinating vehicle motion planning including manipulator configuration, and manipulator motion planning including platform stability. Then, the optimal problem of vehicle motion is formulated, taking into account vehicle dynamics, manipulator workspace, and system stability. Also, the manipulator motion is derived, considering stability compensation and manipulator configuration. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation examples. </jats:p>",

Based on an empirical analysis of national environmental policy plans and sustainability strategies in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, this article comes to the conclusion that although only few of the existing green plans fully explore the theoretical potential of this new approach to environmental policymaking, it has proven an effective mechanism to deal with and reduce at least some of the uncertainties with which environmental policymakers are confronted. The greatest potential of strategic planning lies in increasing the political system's capacity to deal with those problems of long‐term environmental degradation, which in spite of the past successes of environmental protection remain largely unsolved.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although many studies in the problem-solving literature have considered the factors that might determine the strategies that are employed to solve well-structured problems, these have typically focused upon variants of means-end analysis. In general, such models imply that strategies unfold in a temporally forward direction, that problem solvers typically restrict forward-planning activities to just one or two moves ahead of the current problem state, and that one important heuristic is the avoidance of previous moves. Although studies have demonstrated the importance of such anti-looping heuristics, few have systematically explored the possibility that problem solvers may also plan retrospectively in order to try and assess whether a move might take them back to a state that they have previously visited. Those models of problem solving that promote the role of an anti-looping heuristic have assumed that the ability to use such a heuristic is based upon memory for previous states, but other interpretations are possible. In this paper several studies are reported that attempt systematically to explore participants’ attempts to recognize previously visited problem solving states. The findings suggest that there is a systematic relationship between the success of this process, the time taken to make this judgement, and distance from the current state. It is also demonstrated that estimations about where future positions are likely to occur are symmetrical to estimations about past positions. It is suggested that this provides evidence that problem solvers engage in retrospective planning processes in order to try and avoid previous moves, and that this strategy may not be based straightforwardly upon their ability to remember previous problem states. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Enhancement of the management capabilities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has attracted increasing policy attention in recent years. Many of the mechanisms used by government agencies involve the provision of external expertise in the form of advice, training, and subsidised consultancy. These schemes face various difficulties in addressing the diverse needs of SMEs effectively. Some of these difficulties are reflections of the different organisational cultures of the public and private sectors. The authors examine a major policy initiative in Scotland which constitutes an attempt to overcome some of them: the Expert Help Scheme. This scheme has achieved significant take-up through developing links with existing business support agencies and active promotion by consultants. The scheme's broad scope and flexibility have simplified this task. Client companies have generally been very satisfied with the quality of the service: it seems to have had a beneficial effect on some of their capabilities, and on the sales turnover and employment of several firms. There is scope for improvement through greater targeting and focusing of the scheme in order to enhance its additionality. There is also a case for closer integration with local business agencies in order to provide a more comprehensive package of support, enabling real developmental relationships to be created with companies. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The author aims to develop a framework to explain local-level implementation of post-socialist environmental policies, and provides some case study evidence from Hungary. He starts by examining the evidence on environmental policy implementation in advanced capitalist North America and Western Europe as an indication of the possibilities compatible with certain forms of capitalism, and on the patterns under state socialism as a possible source of ‘legacy’ effects. A number of similarities are shown to exist despite the very different socioeconomic systems involved. He goes on to outline a set of hypotheses concerning the interrelation between local level actors—enterprises, local governments, branches of national ministries, and the public (organised and unorganised)—and the local power structures thus created, as the immediate determinants of local-level environmental policy in postsocialist conditions. Recent studies on this subject are summarised, and the author concludes by examining evidence from a case study of Dunaujvaros, a ‘steel town’ in Hungary. Although the emphasis is on the openness of the possibilities and forces which are likely to shape the actual pattern of implementation, it is suggested that the patterns likely to be found in post-socialist Eastern Europe may not be dissimilar from those in advanced capitalist conditions because of the similarity between legacy effects of the old system and emergent effects of the new system. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The rapidly rising inflow of foreign migrants confronts policymakers with many socio-economic problems. The negative externalities of uncontrolled immigration are well known and often hard to cope with. Recent years have seen the appearance of many policy initiatives based on self-reliance principles for ethnic groups. Against this background, ethnic entrepreneurship has become a popular strategy as it stimulates and encourages migrants to look after themselves with only limited support from the government: such policies are becoming increasingly important in many large cities. In addition to the conventional educational support and training programmes, such strategies need to implement policies aimed at self-employment. An emphasis on ethnic entrepreneurship is an attempt to exploit the economic potential and opportunities of foreign migrants, instead of focusing on the problems which minorities encounter when entering the labour market. In ethnic entrepreneurship this potential can be utilised in a creative way, especially if well-organised projects and initiatives are set up. </jats:p><jats:p> The authors compare various assistance programmes and urban policies in several European cities, which are aimed at favouring ethnic entrepreneurship, with the aim of drawing lessons for effective labour-market policies. Their approach is to employ a systematic information base concerning self-employment strategies in the cities under investigation. A newly developed comparative statistical method for categorical information, namely, rough-set analysis, is used in order to identify critical success factors. The results suggest that utilisation of social networks is most helpful in enhancing self-employment among ethnic minorities. The authors offer some lessons for the establishment of sociocultural and ethnic networks, for strategies for improving training and education, and for improving access to facilities and financial resources. </jats:p>",

Data from the British Social Attitudes Survey are used to analyse the implications of the government's new transport policy for the relative welfare of different social and demographic groups. The results suggest that car dependency, which the government is hoping to tackle, is widespread and is particularly strong among men, people with higher incomes, those aged between 25 and 59 years, people with children, the nonmanual social classes, and those living in rural areas. These classes and groups share most of the responsibility for the negative impacts of motor transport, and are often the least concerned about them. They are also the people most opposed to the idea of government intervention to ameliorate the problems. </jats:p>",

Recent drought episodes and the widespread drought conditions in 1996, 1998, and 1999 emphasized this vulnerability and the need for a more proactive, risk management approach to drought management that would place greater emphasis on preparedness planning and mitigation actions. Drought planning has become a principal tool of states and other levels of government to improve their response to droughts. For example, since 1982, the number of states with drought plans has increased from 3 to 29. Many local governments have also adopted drought or water shortage plans. Unfortunately, most state drought plans were established during the 1980s and early 1990s and emphasize emergency response or crisis management rather than risk management. This paper presents a substantive revision of a 10‐step drought planning process that has been applied widely in the United States and elsewhere. The revised planning process places more weight on risk assessment and the development and implementation of mitigation actions and programs. The goal of this paper is to encourage states to adopt this planning process in the revision of existing drought plans or, for states without plans, in the development of new plans.</jats:p>",

Methods: The techniques and programs used by the authors and others in assisting in EM development in other countries to date are described. Conclusions: Some aspects of EM system development have applicability to most countries, but other aspects must be decided by planners based on country‐specific factors. Because of the very recent initiation of many EM system development efforts in other countries, to the authors' knowledge there have not yet been extensive evaluative reports of the efficacy of these efforts. Further studies are needed on the relative effectiveness and cost‐benefit of different EM development efforts.</jats:p>",

In this field, main research is to generate the motion for specific robot and task without previously acquired motions. We research the motion planning reusing knowledge. It is our objective to realize hierarchical knowledge with reuse. In this paper, we adopt tree-based representation for expressing the knowledge of the motion and adopt genetic programming as a learning method. We construct the motion planning system using hierarchical knowledge. We apply the proposed method to the six-legged locomotion robot to show its availability.</jats:p>",
