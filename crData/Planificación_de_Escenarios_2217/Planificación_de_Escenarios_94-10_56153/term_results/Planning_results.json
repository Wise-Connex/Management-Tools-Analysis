For many years racial segregation and conflict influenced patterns of city residence, public housing, and renewal policies. Racial unrest and the civil rights movements helped generate \"social\" and advocacy planning. In the last two decades, the status of black urban life has become an increasingly important issue for those who plan central cities and metropolitan areas. It is time to recognize these linkages and address them more forthrightly. This is a particularly important area of concern for planning educators. </jats:p>",

The contingent valuation (CV) method has been institutionalized as a method for coping with this problem. This paper is about the validity of CV and issues planners encounter in applications. The results of a survey of homeowners and environmentalists are used to 1) counter critics who argue that CV estimates are inherently implausible, 2) refute the argument that respondents consciously refuse to participate in CV surveys because they object to the idea of valuing the environment, and 3) add to evidence that CV surveys can provide data useful for decision making. An example of how planners might use CV data to inform decision making is provided. </jats:p>",

The level of congestion that arises in a transportation system in the absence of policy intervention is contrasted with the optimum planner's-solution. Four alternative policies are evaluated: do nothing, expand supply, restrict demand, and implement tolls. The presentation offered here differs from that found in traditional urban textbooks in three ways. First, eleven diagrams are used instead of the usual two or three. Second, the entire analysis is encapsulated within this article so prior training in economics is not required. Third, a persistent reference is made to the planner's point of view. </jats:p>",

This article uses survey data collected in conjunction with an Indonesian self‐sufficiency program to assess the differential magnitudes of contraceptive usage responses to price differentials between sample‐wide and relatively poor households, and for both subsidized and full private‐sector prices. We find a much more substantial response among poor households. As prices move up toward full cost‐recovery, the effect is magnified.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Apparent inconsistencies and irrational decisions can be found in all organizations and they often point to underlying attitudes and assumptions among staff, about the organization and the way it works. Concepts such as ‘negotiated order’ and ‘values in use’ have been suggested in recent literature on organization theory to describe the important role of individual, and social, needs and expectations upon the functioning of organizations. This article presents the apparently common assumptions made about government service, as encountered during research into the management of district public health services in Nepal. It argues that, when taken together, these form a wide and coherent system of ‘values in use’, or an ‘implicit theory’ which appears to guide many of the bureaucracy's actions</jats:p><jats:p>The way in which staff are selected and promoted, common attitudes towards work, the shortcomings of the reporting systems, all appear to be part of an ‘implicit’ theory which is based on the fundamental belief that it is the main purpose of the district public health service to provide incomes for its staff. Thus, most posts do not have job descriptions and staff are recruited to them on the basis of factors other than the skills or knowledge required. Training and supervision are seen commonly as means of earning extra allowances, and service quality is not seen as a priority. This contrasts with the ‘official’ theory which is that the organization exists to provide health services to the community and that it is the purpose of the staff to provide those services</jats:p><jats:p>Such an implicit ‘theory’, recognized and accepted by staff but never acknowledged, and based on very different values and expectations to those assumed in a ‘rational’, task‐oriented bureaucracy, obviously has implications for the success of development programmes. It explains why training so rarely results in improved performance and why the bureaucracy is so resistant to change which does not satisfy the implicit theory. While the implicit theory described here is specific to Nepal, the phenomenon may be widespread. The failure to take account of such ‘theories in use’, guiding the actions of staff and hence organizations, could explain the failure of many attempts to improve government health services.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although popular settlements in the cities of developing countries exist wholly or partially outside of the legal framework of the state, they must nonetheless follow some sort of rule of law. In the case of quasi-legal or informal land ownership claims, the sale and transfer of land rights must be guaranteed in order for a land market to exist. To fully understand this \"rule of law outside the law,\" it is important to inquire as to the source of legal authority in what is essentially an extralegal situation. An examination of the literature on the subject shows that, in the case of urban residential land markets, three types of extralegal authority may be discerned in practice. This paper examines the case of land regulation in Jakarta, Indonesia, in terms of these models and stresses the value of this type of analysis in the setting of policies for land regularization. </jats:p>",

The gross domestic product fell in 1975‐1976 and again in 1982‐1983; at both times, the public expenditure on health care followed those falls. In addition, the sources of financing public expenditure and the patterns of health expenditure changed during the decades under study. Several indicators of health care activity, and of health and nutrition status consistently suggest an impact which results from the economic difficulties. Staffing levels and pay factors apparently played a role as intervening variables. The differences between the two crises are discussed, and reveal that the organization and programmes of the public health system seem to have been seriously affected. At the same time, they may still have played an important role in protecting the people—particularly, mothers and small children—from further damage.</jats:p>",

These are: information system development; management training; use of planning and evaluation methodologies; and, health sector reform. As part of a collaborative research project based in Kisarawe District, Tanzania, we tested the hypothesis that a combination of the first three of these approaches would be sufficient to ensure that decisions and actions were taken to bring about major improvements in the management of health services. It was assumed that the decentralization, which took place as part of the 1982 reorganization of local government responsibilities, had provided managers with sufficient decision‐making autonomy to allow them to bring about improvement in health service performance, provided that the other conditions were met</jats:p><jats:p>In fact, it was found that despite being presented with clear evidence of serious inefficiencies and inequities in the allocation of health resources, managers were often highly reluctant to decide upon actions which would alleviate the problems in situations where there were potential losers as well as winners, even if the benefits greatly outweighed the costs</jats:p><jats:p>This article argues that interventions based solely on training, information systems, or planning and evaluation protocols will make only <jats:italic>marginal</jats:italic> improvements to health service management, and that changes to the system as a whole are needed in order to provide managers and health professionals with incentives to rectify performance failings. Some ideas for health sector reform, to give managers power and incentives for improving efficiency and quality of care, are put forward. Since it is likely that the systemic problems of the health sector in Tanzania are shared by many other developing countries, the lessons drawn from this study probably have more general applicability.</jats:p>",

Two surveys were conducted to measure the changes in productivity and adoption (knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation) of health center staff over time. In addition, a third survey was conducted to measure the effects of HMIS on the level of satisfaction perceived by the visitors, by comparing the satisfaction level between the study health center and a similar health center identified as a control. The results suggest that HMIS increased the productivity and satisfaction of the staff but did not increase their persuasion and decision levels; and, that it also succeeded in increasing the levels of visitors' satisfaction with the services provided.</jats:p>",

Gas and condensate kr and their dependence on IFT control the time or pressure at which condensate buildup becomes significant and gas productivity drops. Tight reservoirs with lean gas-condensates may pose early and drastic productivity problems.

Sonar is the standard method of\nobstacle avoidance systems which is largely limited by the reliability of the\nsensors used. Path planning however is limited by two things: the\nalgorithms used and the quality of the data available to planners. Concludes\nthat it is now possible to produce path planning and obstacle avoidance\nsystems that can be used in practical robotic systems.</jats:p>",

A database of information is needed for the area concerned which may include up to 100 wastewater treatment plants of varying size. Sludge quantities and quality have to be assessed now and into the future. Disposal options for sludge have to be analysed by an environmental assessment approach which studies the accessibility of all outlets, environmental legislation and attitudes of collaborating agencies and the public at large. Other wastes which may compete with sludge for disposal outlets must be considered. Outlets which involve recycling and beneficial use of sludge are advantageous but may not be practical. Sludge treatment must be evaluated in relation to the disposal options available. Sludge treatment centres, treating sludge from several surrounding wastewater plants, may be required especially if thermal drying or incineration are likely options. Economic evaluation has to consider capital and operating costs of sludge treatment and transport and other costs associated with disposal. The paper discusses how to evaluate all the information and options and find a suitable sludge treatment and disposal strategy.</jats:p>",

These shifts in emphasis, while laudable, should not result in loss of focus on the fundamental importance of population information. Suitable habitat, although a prime necessity, is not sufficient for wildlife preservation. Species may not occupy otherwise suitable habitat because of internal (predation, interspecific competition, disease) or external (adverse climate, exploitation, disturbance, impact of exotic species, pollution and toxicants) factors. Historical impacts may persist for many years, and may require active restoration. Forest management plans must consider population data on a metapopulation scale. Data for common species can be at the reconnaissance level whereas for threatened or sensitive species they need to be more detailed. To evaluate sustainability, population data must be integrated with forest stand data in projection models to predict habitat-population mosaics at various times in the future. These models must be developed and improved over time in an adaptive management approach. </jats:p>",

Many of the prior approaches to motion planning problems assume that the obstacles always exist in the environ ment, whether they are stationary or in motion. In this article, I consider the case that the environment contains obstacles whose existing periods are dependent on time (i.e., they can appear and disappear in the environment). This formulation allows us to model a variety of time-varying situations that can arise in application domains. A concept similar to that of visibility is used to solve the problem. An algorithm is pre sented to generate a motion in such a dynamic domain, its time-minimality is proved, and computation time is analyzed. </jats:p>",

After explaining why this is currently the most fruitful perspective in the field of gender planning, it then goes on to explore two central problems of the empowerment approach. The first problem is the conceptualization of women's gender interests. The distinction between women's practical and strategic gender interests was introduced by Molyneux and popularized by Moser. It is argued here that this distinction is theoretically unfounded and empirically untenable. Secondly, gender planners tend towards a preference for simplified tools and quantifiable targets. Here it is argued that women's realities should not be bent into this planning framework but that instead planners, working from an empowerment perspective, should demonstrate flexibility and theoretical grounding, and be aware of the political dimensions of their work.</jats:p>",

The urban spaces of Kathmandu and Patan were two of the most important sites within which power was contested, and terrains upon which space itself was contested. As I will show, the location of struggle emerged from conscious movement choices (as to tactics, efficacy of mobilization, etc) and influenced the character of collective action. An analysis of the spatial mediation of social movement agency provides us with what 1 term the ‘terrain of resistance’—the specific geographical, historical, political, economic, ecological, and cultural context of movement agency. Such analysis can provide us with important insights into why movements occur where they do, the spatiocultural specificity of movement practice, and the language by which people articulate their discontent, understood through the ‘cultural expressions of resistance’. </jats:p>",

Using Derrida's critique of Saussure, in the first part of the paper I interweave the problem of meaning with the discourse of geography so as to write on the concepts of ‘the map’ and ‘geography’. In the second part of the paper I explore the implications of this writing on or displacing for the analysis of geographical discourse and/in global politics. I concentrate on three issues: (1) problemattzing the traditional conceptual maps of ‘geopolitics’, (2) speculating on the historical problematic of geography and governmentality, and (3) suggesting a typology for the study of geo-politics which pays particular attention to how places are sighted/sited/cited by governmental institutions (geo-political sites). </jats:p>",

Wir schätzen verschiedene Versionen des Modells mit einem bivariaten dynamischen Random-Effects-Probit-Modell unter Berücksichtigung einer verallgemeinerten kontemporären Korrelationsstruktur. Außerdem kontrollieren wir für eine mögliche Korrelation von Erklärungsvariablen mit den unbeobachteten firmenspezifischen Effekten. Hierzu verwenden wir Paneldaten aus dem Ifo-Konjunkturtest, die wir mit den entsprechenden VGR- und Konzentrationsbranchendaten verknüpft haben. Es stellt sich heraus, daß dynamische Spillovers und unbeobachtete Heterogenitäten den Prozeß signifikant beeinflussen. Die absolute Betriebsgröße übt einen maßgeblichen Einfluß auf das Innovationsverhalten aus, wogegen die Konzentrationsmaße als unbedeutend erscheinen.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the early 1990s a new generation of scholars has tackled matters of feminist perspectives on war, peace, and specifically the academic discipline of international relations. A similar confrontation between traditional scholarly themes and gender-sensitive analyses within critical geopolitics is now obviously necessary. Although authors such as Cynthia Enloc have written about global politics and the role of women in international relations in ways that are sensitive to the geographic dimension, many theoretical and practical implications of a gender-sensitive approach to geopolitics remain to be worked out. In this paper I argue that, among other issues, investigating the gendered assumptions in the study of international relations and foreign policy-making, in addition to more explicitly geopolitical reasoning, shows how political spatialisations render women vulnerable. In addition, examining the implications of militarised definitions of (territorial) citizenship, the use of masculinist notions of power, space, and security, and the representation of women in global conflicts, sheds light on the ‘taken-for-granted’ spatial aspects of the routine operation of power. By enlarging the scope of critical geopolitical analysis, greater attention to gender issues enhances the explanatory power of ‘big picture’ political geography, not least by focusing on the practical everyday implications of geopolitics for those who are so often written out of its scripts. </jats:p>",

There were 10 phonologically delayed children who used sound–pattern errors typical of chronologically aged younger children (delayed group); 10 children whose phonological system was characterised by the consistent use of non‐developmental phonological processes (deviant consistent group); and 10 children whose production of specific lexical items and phonological features was variable (inconsistent group). The groups were compared on tasks that assessed simple and complex motor planning for hand movements and expressive and receptive novel‐word learning. The groups did not differ on a simple task of motor planning for hand movements. However, the inconsistent group performed more poorly than all the other groups on a more complex, timed motor‐planning task. Although the groups performed equally well on a task assessing receptive novel‐word learning, the inconsistent group performed more poorly than all the other groups on an expressive novel‐word learning task. The results provide support for the hypothesis that speech‐disordered children with different surface error patterns have different underlying deficits in the speech‐processing chain. Specifically, inconsistent error patterns are associated with a deficit in some aspects of fine motor planning.</jats:p><jats:p>La capacité de programmation motrice de 3 sous‐groupes d'enfants ayant des troubles de la parole a été comparée à celle de groupes de contrôle d'enfants normaux, apparillés selon l'âge et la compréhension: 10 enfants retardés sur le plan phonologique utilisaient les erreurs phoniques typiques des enfants normaux plus jeunes (groupe ‘retardés’); 10 enfants dont le système phonologique était caracterisé par l'emploi cohérent de processus phonologiques non‐développementaux (groupe ‘déviants cohérents’); enfin 10 enfants dont la production d'items lexicaux specifiques et de traits phonologiques était variable (groupe ‘non‐cohérents’). Les groupes ont été comparés d'après des tâches qui évaluaient la programmation motrice simple et complexe pour les mouvements de la main ainsi que pour l'apprentissage de mots nouveaux sur les plans expressif et receptif. Il n'y a pas eu de différence pour les tâches simples de programmation motrice des mouvements de la main. Cependant, le groupe non‐cohérent a exécuté d'une manière plus faible que tous les autres groupes les tâches plus complexes de programmation motrice avec contrainte de vitesse. Alors que les groupes ont eu le mĉme bon comportement pour les tâches d'évaluation de l'apprentissage des mots nouveaux sur le plan receptif, le groupe ‘non‐cohérents’ a eu des résultats bien plus faibles pour les tâches d'apprentissage de mots nouveaux sur le plan expressif. Ces résultats contribuent à renforcer l'hypothèse que les enfants ayant des troubles de la parole se manifestant par des erreurs de surface différentes ont des déficits sous‐jacents tout le long du processus de parole. D'une manière spécifique, les types d'erreurs non‐cohérentes sont associés avec un déficit de certains aspects de la programmation motrice fine.</jats:p><jats:p>Die motorische Planung dreier Untergruppen sprachgestörter Kinder wurde mit normalsprechenden Kontrollgruppen verglichen, die ihnen im Sprechalter und Sprachverstehen entsprachen. Die Untergruppen waren: 10 Kinder mit verzögerter phonologischer Entwicklung, die Fehler in den lautlichen Mustern aufwiesen, die für chronologisch jüngere Kinder typisch sind (verzögerte Gruppe); 10 Kinder, deren phonologisches System durch die konsistente Verwendung von in normalen Entwicklungsstufen nicht vorkommenden phonologischen Prozessen charakterisiert war (abweichende Gruppe); 10 Kinder, deren Produktion bestimmter lexikalischer Formen und phonologischer Merkmale variabel war (inkonsistente Gruppe). Die Gruppen wurden bei Aufgaben verglichen, die die Evaluierung a) einfacher und komplexer motorischer Planung für Handbewegungen und b) expressiver und rezeptiver Erlernung neuer Wörter ermöglichten. Die Gruppen unterschieden sich bei der einfachen motorischen Planung nicht, aber bei der komplexeren, zeitkontrollierten motorischen Planungsaufgabe war die Leistung der inkonsistenten Gruppe schlechter als die der anderen. Während alle Gruppen bei der rezeptiven Erlernung neuer Wörter gleich gut waren, war die inkonsistente Gruppe bei der expressiven Erlernung neuer Wörter wiederum schlechter als alle anderen Gruppen. Die Ergebnisse unterstützen die Hypothese, daß sprechbehinderte Kinder mit unterschiedlichen Oberflächenfehlern auch unterschiedliche zugrundeliegende Schwächen der Sprachverarbeitungskette haben.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The counterurbanisation decade of the 1970s appears to have been followed by a period of more mixed trends in migration between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas. This author examines the experience of Great Britain against the background of developments reported for other countries. The British Census small-area statistics are used to calculate 1981–91 rates of population change for a typology of local labour-market areas in order to test for the existence of population deconcentration, and the results are compared with the rates for the three previous intercensal decades. Annual population estimates are then used to examine the migration component of 1981–91 population change and to investigate the extent and timing of fluctuations in growth rates since the early 1960s. The results indicate that the differentials in the population growth rate between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan Britain narrowed somewhat between the 1970s and the 1980s, but the negative relationship between urban status and population change remained very clear. Moreover, contrary to the experience of the USA and a number of European countries, in the mid-1980s Britain saw a resurgence of nonmetropolitan growth which had widespread impact across the country. These results raise questions which can in part be addressed by in-depth research on the 1991 Census and related data sets. </jats:p>",

These establishments maintain the bulk of their linkages with the durable goods industries of the industrial heartland. Subcontracting transactions are confined largely to Northeast Ohio and the other major metropolitan industrial regions of the Midwest.

This ‘swing back’ occurred over only a three-year period. Regional labor-market changes appear to be the only factor able to cause such an abrupt shift to concentration, suggesting the importance of the regional restructuring hypothesis as an explanation. Changing internal migration patterns by two age-groups, 25–29 and 30–49, were responsible for the shift. A reduction of net in-migration to intermediate-sized regions with favorable structures as well as to small-sized rural regions with unfavorable structures, in the northern and central parts of the country, caused the shift. The concentration trend remained unaltered during 1989, in spite of large transfers of population out of eastern and into western Germany, because these exchanges favored the large-sized, densely populated, structurally weak regions in the Ruhr-Rhine and the Saarland. </jats:p>",

This article seeks to explain this divergence in American and British policy responses to the depression. While considering the extent to which differences in state capacities, ideology, political contingencies, and the structure of economic organization may have contributed to America's greater willingness to attempt a comprehensive experiment with corporatism in the early 1930s, this article focuses on the importance of the weakness of organized labor in the American—as opposed to the British—political economy as an explanatory factor in the divergent experiences of the two nations.</jats:p>",

It constructs motion plans to achieve 3D‐space goals of control points on the body, e.g. a hand, while avoiding collisions. Like the artificial potential field approach, the method performs motion decisions in 3D world space rather than in joint space. To handle the massively redundant degrees of freedom, we use a qualitative kinematic model, which specifies motions of body parts and dependencies among them, without specifying the exact distance parameters. This model helps the body select appropriate primitive motions for given goals of control points more globally than does the gradient vector of an artificial potential field of the body. The method simulates (in imagination) the suggested plan to find whether some body parts hit objects, and how much they penetrate the objects. Based on this simulated collision information, the method suggests intermediate goals of the collision body parts. A subplan to achieve these intermediate goals is again postulated by using the qualitative kinematic model. This explicit reasoning helps alleviate the basic cause of local minima in the potential field approach, namely, conflicts between attractive potential fields due to goal positions of control points and repulsive potential fields due to obstacles.</jats:p>",

A number of hypotheses are explored about how in-migration and out-migration fields wax and wane, thereby giving rise to the overall shifts in demographic effectiveness measured over the period. The results highlight the characteristics of recent (1980–88) shifts in US internal migration patterns including net migration reversals from strong net in-migration to strong net out-migration for states with significant energy sectors, the stanching of net out-migration from many states of the American manufacturing belt, the turnaround to net in-migration for all of northern New England, and the continuance of highly effective net in-migration to the sunbelt states of Florida, Arizona, and Nevada. </jats:p>",

Organizations are supposed to encompass qualities that allow them to achieve operative goals even if operative conditions are changed. The principle underlying preparedness planning is the maintenance of peace‐time functions in organizations during war and crisis, although such functions may be restricted. Changes influencing preparedness planning within the social service organization include ongoing organizational restructuring in terms of decentralization and increases in private enterprising within the municipal social service sector. Two factors of decisive importance to organizational appropriateness are information generation and information processing. The results from the study show deficiencies within the organization's ability to generate and process information between different organizational levels about demands put on the organization in situations of war and crisis.</jats:p>",

This paper shows that international circulation amongst Hong Kong doctors is neither new nor random. A survey of Hong Kong doctors with overseas work experience was undertaken by the authors to examine the factors influencing the length of employment overseas and the propensity to return. Statistical analysis of the results indicates that holding a foreign passport, previous overseas training, and the country of destination were key factors in detennining the length of residence abroad and propensity to return to Hong Kong. In the light of the changing importance for Hong Kong professionals of obtaining residency rights abroad, and given the widely varying immigration policies of the main destination countries in relation to issues such as recognition of Hong Kong qualifications, it is suggested that professional groups such as doctors choose their migration destinations in line with a predetermined migration strategy for either temporary emigration or for longer-term resettlement overseas. The survey results are of wider significance in the understanding of changing patterns of skill exchange involving the upper echelons of the populations of newly industrialising countries. </jats:p>",

Since the angular momentum of a space robot system is conserved, the motion of the system is subject to nonholonomic constraints. When the manipulator makes motion from an initial position to a desired position, variation of the base orientation depends on the trajectory of the motion owing to the nonholonomic property of the system. Since the satellite base is desired to have a constant orientation, we seek such a trajectory of the manipulator that a given motion is attained, that the base orientation is unchanged before and after the motion, and that the integral of the sum of the squares of accelerations of the joint angles is minimized during motion. First, we derive the equations of motion of the space robot, where the orientation of the satellite base is expressed in terms of Euler quaternions. We express the motion of joint angles in terms of the truncated Fourier series, and apply a nonlinear programming technique using a sequential quadratic programming algorithm to determine the optimal coefficients of the Fourier series.
