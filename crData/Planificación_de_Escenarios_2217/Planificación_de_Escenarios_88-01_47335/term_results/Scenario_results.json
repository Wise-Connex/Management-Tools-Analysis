      "abstract": "<jats:p>It is now well established that hydrogen chloride is unusual among common fire gases in that it decays from the atmosphere. No model of hydrogen chloride transport and decay exists as yet, which has been formulated in such a way that it is generic enough to be used for scenarios different from the one in which the experiments were carried out, and can be incorporated into more comprehensive fire hazard models. The present paper introduces such a model. It deals with the influence of various surfaces [poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), painted gypsum board, ceiling tile, cement block and Marinite], of surface to volume ratio and of humidity, on atmospheric hydrogen chloride concentration, both inside and outside the room of origin of the fire.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The present model incorporates generation of hydrogen chloride from poly(vinyl chloride), mass transfer to various wall locations, partition between the atmosphere and the surface, and a combination of diffusion and reaction inside the surface. The parameters in the model were fitted by using a non-linear (Marquardt) optimization procedure.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The model was corroborated using various experiments which involved the combustion of poly(vinyl chloride) in large- and small-scale scenarios.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>It was found that, for a non-sorptive surface such as PMMA, the rate of mass transfer to the surface is much larger than the rates of the various reactions at the surface, in all cases. Such a surface, thus, allows much higher peak hydrogen chloride concentrations and much lower rates of decay than any of the sorptive surfaces investigated.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>For sorptive surfaces and static systems the rate limiting process is the mass transfer to the surface. The activity of the various surfaces investigated was found to follow the order: ceiling tile &amp;gt; cement &amp;gt; Marinite ≥ painted gypsum board ≫ PMMA</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>The significance of this model is that it can predict hydrogen chloride decay in a real fire scenario. It is relevant to point out that normal construction surfaces are sorptive, and that hydrogen chloride decay will generally be quite fast in a fire, whereas it will be much slower in a small-scale toxicity test exposure chamber.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>We reconsidered the timing problem of the neutrino-dominated cosmological scenario, i.e. the inferred young age for the large-scale structure versus the observationally indicated older age of galaxies and quasars. It can be resolved by 4 anti-biasing: of galaxy formation. By applying a variety of alternative prescriptions for galaxj formation to N-body simulations of the neutrino scenario, we find that the clustering of galaxies could be suppressed relative to the neutrinos to an extent that eliminate} the timing problem. It requires that galaxies form preferentially in the flat Sheets relative to the denser ‘filaments’ and compact clusters. This could emerge eithe from differences in the efficiency of galaxy formation itself, or due to feedback influence from a first generation of objects (e.g. quasars) which suppress the formatio: of incipient galaxies locally. Such an effect could be due to radiation pressure b <jats:italic>L</jats:italic><jats:sub>α</jats:sub> trapping in the ionized region at the vicinity of a quasar. We simulated various examples in order to quantify the requirements from such anti-biasing mechanisms and investigated their physical plausibility.

The experts tell us it is not a question of if, but when. And the when could be in the next decade or two. That is not just a California problem. Be aware that there are 39 states in the United States which may be subject to substantial earthquake damage. The largest earthquake ever in the United States was along the New Madrid fault in southeast Missouri. That occurred about 1812, and was estimated to be 8.3 to 8.7 on the Richter scale. Of course, there were no scales then, or many people there at the time. It did, however, rearrange the Mississippi River. If such an earthquake hit at this point today, Memphis and St. Louis would be leveled. There is also another known fault near Charleston, South Carolina. Boston has been hit by earthquakes.
