      "abstract": "<jats:p>The aim of this article is to demonstrate that technology assessments can be supported by methods such as scenario modeling and qualitative causal analysis. At Siemens, these techniques are used to develop preliminary purely qualitative models. These or parts of these comprehensive models may be extended to system dynamics models.While it is currently not possible to automatically generate a system dynamics models (or vice versa, obtain a qualitative simulation model from a system dynamics model), the two thechniques scenario development and qualitative causal analysis provide valuable indications on how to proceed towards a system dynamics model. For the qualitative analysis phase, the Siemens – proprietary prototype Computer – Aided Technology Assessment Software (CATS) supportes complete cycle and submodel analysis.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The present study investigated the affective responses of 169 Hispanic and 196 African American participants to a simulated selection decision involving race-based affirmative action. Type of implementation procedure and qualification of beneficiary were manipulated in the simulated scenario, and subjects'affective reactions, perceptions offairness and competence, and feelings of stigmatization were measured. Strong effects were obtainedfor the recipient qualification and affirmative action procedure manipulations. Race differences (AfricanAmerican vs. Hispanic) on the majority of dependent variables were not significant. The present study demonstrated that as long as minority group members did not feel they were less qualified than other applicants, the negative consequences of being preferentially selected were muted. </jats:p>",
