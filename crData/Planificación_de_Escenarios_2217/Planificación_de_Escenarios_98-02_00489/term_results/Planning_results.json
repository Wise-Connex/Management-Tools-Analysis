The review suggests that property values provide a sensitive index of the effects of planning and the problems planning is designed to address. Furthermore, it reveals that planning can contribute to problems of housing affordability. However, this does not represent prima facie evidence that planning has failed; nor should the potential of such effects preclude the adoption of metropolitan plans. Instead, the evidence suggests that metropolitan planning can contribute to the solution of housing affordability problems as well as to their cause. </jats:p>",

Much has happened since then. There is a renewed interest in regionalism, particularly in conjunction with efforts to analyze and manage entire metropolitan areas. This bibliography incorporates works on regionalism and regional governance published since 1979. It draws from major sources in planning, urban affairs, and public policy. Entries are arranged in eleven categories, beginning with existing literature reviews of the topic. The bibliography contains 168 annotated entries, a subject index, jurisdiction and planning organization indexes, and a periodicals index. </jats:p>",

This article reviews and critiques the central theoretical and empirical approaches to the concept of spatial external economies and the firm, with a view toward clarifying the core range of definitions and perspectives. It suggests that these often competing perspectives must be better meshed to yield richer and more robust planning and policy prescriptions. </jats:p>",

Today’s loyalty schemes are modelled on the AAdvantage Programme; a frequent flier programme initiated by American Airlines in 1981, and lessons from the air‐line industry are briefly introduced. The primary purpose of this paper is to evaluate the extent to which loyalty schemes really can build loyalty. In order to do this, four categories of loyalty as identified in the literature are considered. Given existing criticisms of loyalty schemes it is concluded that such schemes have an important role to play in situations where no loyalty or spurious loyalty is evident. However, where sustainable loyalty is the ultimate goal, customer loyalty schemes are of importance only as part of a coherent value proposition.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The present paper discusses a knowledge-based interactive CAPP system for symmetrical turned parts. In this system, which is modular in structure, special emphasis has been laid on geometric reasoning and cut planning—two aspects which have received little attention in the CAPP systems reported in published literature. The present paper deals mainly with the description of the cut planning module of UOR_PLAN. The task of cut planning in UOR_PLAN is divided into two subtasks—macro cut planning and micro cut planning. Macro cut planning deals with the identification of pockets of unwanted metal. As a first step a mesh of nodal points is generated by taking into account the geometry of the part profile and the shape of the blank. Next, by rule-based successive elimination of nodal points from the mesh, pockets of unwanted metal for a given operation sequence are identified. This process is repeated for all possible sequences. The distinguishing feature of this technique is that it identifies the machinable volumes automatically without the preparation of an incidence/precedence matrix. A further breakup of machinable volumes is dealt with in micro cut planning. In phase one of micro cut planning, each machinable volume is divided into a number of rough cuts of equal depth by leaving a suitable finishing allowance. Optimum machining parameters (depth of cut, feed rate, cutting speed and number of passes) are selected by applying the sequential unconstrained minimization technique (SUMT). The best of the cut plans is selected on the basis of minimum production time. Phase two of the micro cut planning deals with the removal of the finishing allowance and has been discussed in an earlier paper. </jats:p>",

The other nine case studies highlight the ability of the framework to focus on smaller, incremental improvements in production planning and control performance. The empirical research also concludes that a lack of human resources to devote to improvements and implementations is the main difference between large and small companies when undertaking such exercises. Recommendations for future work on the framework are presented, and the usefulness of the framework for managers in small manufacturing companies, consultants and academic researchers is discussed.</jats:p>",

Using paired ionization chambers and activation foils, the accuracy (1 standard deviation, SD) in the determination of the absolute thermal neutron fluence, gamma‐ray dose and fast neutron dose amounted to 5%, 5%, and 18%, respectively. Methods were developed which assure an agreement between prescribed and actual obtained values of 1% (1 SD) for the absolute beam output and 5%–10% (1 SD) for the blood–boron concentration during irradiation. Clinical dosimetry studies were performed resulting in a set of reference beam data which are used for quality control, dosimetry intercomparisons and as input for a conventional semi‐empirical treatment planning system (TPS). Using these reference beam data and the electron and photon beam model of the TPS, the various dose components could be calculated fast and with a high accuracy in a homogeneous anthropomorphic head phantom. At the central axis, the agreement between measurements and calculations was within 2%–3% (1 SD). It is concluded that the accuracy in dosimetry, beam output monitoring, blood–boron monitoring and treatment planning is sufficient to start clinical studies of BNCT in Petten, The Netherlands.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Geographical information systems (GIS) are potentially powerful devices for integrating, manipulating, and communicating information, and are acknowledged to be vulnerable to the abuse of that power. A significant debate during the 1990s has challenged GIS users to respond to the suggestion that their technology is restrictive, elitist, and antisocial. In practice, the response from the GIS profession has been muted, and the paper therefore comments on the way in which professional GIS implementation might be interpreted from different perspectives. Comparisons are drawn between analytical GIS in post-Apartheid South Africa and operational GIS in the UK public utilities. GIS is shown to be an operational or decision support engine fuelled by information flows, and in creating the organisational pathways to support these flows it unlocks gateways the defence of which has traditionally underpinned the authority of management and government. A dilemma thus emerges. On the one hand, GIS has unprecedented power to disseminate access to usable information. On the other hand, it still supports a division which generates a technocratic elite. It is suggested that information democracy lies not in information flow as a technical process, but in information management. As a consequence, it is concluded that a code of data ethics may be at least partially effective in allowing a professional response to the critics of GIS. </jats:p>",

Notwithstanding this gloomy scenario, it is suggested that library planning based on awareness of indigenous needs and with realistic aims can achieve far more than has been the case in the past. Six factors are suggested as essential in any effective public library planning process in Pakistan; these may be valid in other developing countries as well.</jats:p>",

A technique for inverse treatment planning has been developed that uses only target dose levels which are easily selectable to be feasible. A nonlinear constrained minimization problem is formulated to reflect the goal of sparing critical organs as much as possible while delivering a certain target dose within specified uniformity. The objective function is the squared dose delivered to critical organs. The constraints require the delivery of certain target dose within specified uniformity and non‐negative pencil beam weights. A continuous penalty function method is introduced as a method for solving the large‐scale constrained minimization problem. The performance of the continuous penalty function method is optimized by numerical investigation of few numerical integration schemes and a pair of weighting functions which influence the utility of the method. Clinical examples are presented that illustrate several features of the technique. The properties of the continuous penalty function method suggest that it may be a viable alternative to conventional inverse treatment planning.</jats:p>",

This process has often been led by writers who have questioned the extent to which researchers who analyse numbers about people ignore other ways of studying society. Often examples of the ‘unsympathetic’ mapping of people's lives or the conspiratorial creation of particular statistical social landscapes are given as reasons to avoid quantitative research. In this paper I concentrate on some visual approaches to understanding society, in particular, the view of ‘human cartography’. I argue, through a series of examples, that there is much more to mapping society than simply reinforcing an image of the status quo. There are many people involved in alternative mapping, few of whom would see themselves as geographers. Perhaps human geography should consider why mapping is now so popular, how mapping is changing, and the part geography could play in redrawing the world, before dismissing mapping as a means to understanding? </jats:p>",

Using a case study of urban regeneration within the Thames Gateway area of London, the paper examines the locus of power in the relationships between central and local government and the key economic interests; this allows a reappraisal of the claims of the local authority to be enabling development. The paper then turns to the language of enabling as found in policy and academic literature and argues both that changes in the language of policy have been distinctive and that this is actively contributing to the new urban governance. This analysis is grounded in a framework for considering the relationship of language to the policy process, proposing a rhetorical methodology of policy discourse analysis. </jats:p>",

Tüxen emphasized the great value of PNV‐maps for different purposes in land use, landscape planning and nature conservation, in particular with regard to forestry, agriculture and landscape management. Different aspects are discussed in order to examine the validity and applicability of PNV‐maps in landscape planning and nature conservation. PNV‐maps are useful for the differentiation of natural and landscape units on a small scale (&lt; 1 : 100 000). However, maps of the potential natural vegetation are less useful for purposes of detailed planning on larger scales (&gt; 1 : 100 000). Problems arise, for example, from the often highly hypothetical character of the construction and the practice of taking remnants of ‘natural’ vegetation as a reference object for the PNV. With regard to the goals of modern landscape planning and nature conservation purposes (e.g. conserving biodiversity in the cultural landscape of Central Europe) the exact documentation of the actual real vegetation (ARV) on intermediate and large scales gives much more detailed information than a hypothetical PNV.</jats:p>",

Yet most sustainability programmes at international, national, and local levels require broad public participation if they are to reach their goals. We argue that organisational communication with the public is central to defining the form of participation that is expected, and that rhetorical analysis can show relationships that are implicit in these attempts to persuade. We analyse leaflets from a range of organisations to identify some of the elements that are common between them, both in their explicit content and their implied models of participation. Then we analyse the responses in focus groups to these common appeals. Our findings show that the generalised appeals and the rhetoric of crisis tend to distance policy organisations from the immediacy and dailiness of the public's own experiences of and talk about the environment. Because of this distance, the rhetoric does little to encourage participation and practical action. </jats:p>",

Sharing local taxes paid by new non-residential property is discussed, in the Israeli context, as a means to reduce overdevelopment of industrial areas in the metropolitan fringes as well as pressures on open space. Complementary regulative measures, where rural local government is separated from urban local government, are based on improved co-ordination between land-use planning and decisions on municipal boundary changes. </jats:p>",

I assert that much of what passes as phenomenological knowledge is constructed around an unfounded idealisation of the written text and the spatial stability it embodies.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the history of correlation and regression analyses, both in the discipline of statistics generally and in human geography particularly, is examined. It is argued that correlation and regression analysis emerged from a particular social and cultural context, and that this context entered into the very nature of those techniques. The paper is divided into three sections. First, to counter the idea that mathematics and statistics are somehow outside the social, the arguments put forward by David Bloor and Bruno Latour suggesting that mathematical propositions arc socially constructed are briefly reviewed. Second, using the ideas of both Bloor and Latour I turn to the development of statistics as an intellectual discipline during the 19th century, and specifically to the invention of correlation and regression at the end of that period. It is argued that the development of statistics as a discipline and its associated techniques are both stamped by, but also leave their stamp on, the wider society in which they are set. Last, the importation of correlation and regression analyses into human geography which occurred in the 1950s is examined. Following my general social constructionist argument, it is suggested that because of the difference in context the correlation and regression analyses devised in the late 19th century were often inappropriate for mid-20th century spatial science. </jats:p>",

During the same years, spatial planning policies were also revised. In order to achieve environmental policy objectives, restrictive planning policies were introduced to preserve landscape heritage; building activities were now to be concentrated in and near central cities. The old coalition between housing and spatial planning gave way, to a new coalition between spatial planning and environmental policy.</jats:p><jats:p>Five contradictions between current housing policy and spatial planning are examined: the artificial shortage of new housing land, the tension between urban density and consumer preferences, a rigid and uniform housing differentiation which is at odds with the natural flexibility of housing markets, the danger of spatial segregation, and the tension between house building activities and environmental priorities.</jats:p><jats:p>These contradictions can be explained as the result of an attempt by the Dutch government to combine a market‐oriented housing policy with substantial environmental ambitions (which have limited market support). The reformulation of both planning policy and housing policy is advocated, together with the shaping of both policy fields as a combination of market and policy elements. This will enable the desired improvement in consistency between spatial planning and housing policy.</jats:p>",

Drawing upon the recent debates regarding the intersection of culture, society, and economy, it is argued that the form of paper money conveys not only economic but social and cultural values. The paper is divided into three parts. The first section situates Canadian paper currency in terms of the consolidation of paper monies more generally in the 18th and 19th centuries, but with particular reference to Britain and the United States. I then turn to a more specific analysis of the design and production of paper money, illustrating how monetary images were transferred among artistic media. A third section focuses on some of the spatial aspects of paper money by exploring national and imperial monetary narratives which are in turn related to specific monetary practices. In a brief conclusion the importance of an historical analysis to our contemporary understanding of paper and other kinds of monies is outlined and points to our complicity in economic, social, and cultural networks. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors focus upon the changing nature of production and consumption within the retail financial services industry. The perennial problem which faces all producers of financial services is information asymmetry; that is, providers and consumers of financial products have unequal amounts of information about whether or not customers have the wherewithal to make them ‘capable’ purchasers. Thus, the problem of information asymmetry is usually manifested in a priori decisionmaking about the suitability of customers. This problem has traditionally been overcome by forging interpersonal relationships of trust with consumers through copresence. Increasingly, however, trust in consumers is being forged through technologically mediated means of information collection functioning ‘at a distance’ so that financial services producers are coming to ‘read’ consumers as ‘texts’, through the medium of databases. These developments have had a number of effects, such as increased competition in retail financial markets, while branch networks, which acted as durable barriers to entry to the market, have become less important as sites of market intelligence and knowledge. Consumers have also been forced to forge new relations of trust with retail financial service providers. This is increasingly being achieved through the use of various media and through identification with brands. Such developments have served to create social and spatial divisions of financial inclusion and exclusion, as producers use at-a-distance information to discriminate between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ customers. Those ‘inside’ the financial system are able to use their financial knowledge to take advantage of increased levels of competition between financial service providers. However, those excluded from the financial system are doubly handicapped as they live in both a financial and an information shadow. Such individuals are likely to pay an increasingly heavy price for their exclusion, particularly given the collapse of universal welfare provision and the allied growth of private welfare-related financial products. In recognition of this, in the final part of the paper we consider ways of countering problems of financial exclusion and low levels of financial literacy. </jats:p>",

London is our focus, not least because its representation as an imperial city during the modern period was particularly fraught with difficulty. In the first section of the paper we consider the value and limitations of a ‘post-colonial’ perspective, and specifically the extent to which the discourse of imperial cities was European rather than national in character. In the second section we turn to London, widening the conventional focus on the ceremonial core at Westminster to consider a number of alternative ‘hearts of empire’, sites which were also claimed as central places in the landscape of the imperial city. Here we question the assumption that London ‘became’ imperial in a circumscribed area and only for a brief moment in the late-Victorian and Edwardian era. In order to develop the argument that the ‘imperial’ was not merely the preserve of policymakers in Whitehall, we then consider the role of imperial culture in shaping a variety of other urban landscapes, especially the swelling London suburbs. Last, we address the contradictions and tensions in the idea of ‘imperial London’ as it developed around the turn of the 19th century. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, the EOI development was imbued with development contradictions, and caused crisis and dysfunction in Taiwan's spatial development and management. The author aims to analyze this crisis and dysfunction from political-economic perspectives, by discerning how the state intervened in spatial development and management along with the development of EOI. As the author demonstrates, the state manipulates the crisis and dysfunction of the planning mechanism to satisfy the political-economic requirements of Taiwan's EOI development. EOI development provided good environments for capital accumulation, but led to poor living conditions. The environmental results have brought Taiwan much wider political, social, and economic tensions, and have made increasingly unlikely the possibility of constructing a social coalition of sustainable development. The author contends that it is time for Taiwan to reorganise the development of EOI before the current crisis becomes destructive. </jats:p>",

The specific differences between these approaches in terms of their conceptualisation of what counts as childcare, who needs it, and how its delivery is structured raise broader questions about the understandings of society and space, about the importance of moral geographies, and about the possible strategics for achieving justice that underpin the different traditions of thought on social justice. </jats:p>",

The role of company support for the voluntary sector has become an issue of considerable significance in recent years, yet has been little analysed by geographers. Considerable variations are revealed in the geographical distribution of funds allocated by directly funded corporate charitable trusts to voluntary organisations in the United Kingdom; the patterns may be related to the sector of the companies that fund the trusts together with the location and nature of the charities receiving funds, The patterns suggest that the key element determining the geography of corporate philanthropy is the nature of the audience which the company is seeking to address through their donations policy. Manufacturing companies would appear to have stronger traditions of philanthropy being directed towards the communities where their production facilities are based, whereas service-based companies tend to disperse their donations more widely. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper consists of historical case studies of Amsterdam and Eindhoven which provide insight into political decisionmaking over plans for metropolitan government, Amsterdam extended its territory by more than three times in 1921, and Eindhoven by 80 times in 1920. After the 1920s large-scale annexations did not occur around the largest Dutch cities. The annexation of the Bijlmermeer to the southeast of Amsterdam (1966) was an exception. While Amsterdam annexed the Bijlmermeer, intermunicipal cooperation developed in the Eindhoven metropolitan area. It is argued that the political inheritance and the pattern of urbanisation play a major role in explaining the differences between Amsterdam and Eindhoven. Both cities also show similarities. Since the Second World War several plans have been developed for metropolitan governments, but they have not been very successful. Up to 1997, the typical Dutch solution was not metropolitan government but redistribution on a national level. The Netherlands is a small country; both in population and in size it is comparable with metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles or South East England. In an international comparative perspective, one might as well consider the Dutch national state as the real metropolitan government. It remains to be seen whether after a hundred years of discussion the national government will finally decide to establish some form of metropolitan government. </jats:p>",

Their exchange covers, among other items, the differing stances of these approaches to epistemology, ontology, research questions and methods, and the concept of ‘context’. We also further develop the concept of the ‘epistemology of the grid’, which we define as the spatialization of categorical thought. We link this epistemology to two others, Cartesian perspectivalism and ocularcentrism, arguing that their realization in social practice is generative of social order. </jats:p></jats:sec>",

During the period 1830–1918 geography school texts were influenced by European exploration, church sponsors of education, the mediation of religious and scientific explanation of the natural world, popular images of empire, and state education codes, grants, and inspections. These factors combined in differing degrees over the period studied to reflect hegemonic views of gender, race, and class. The comparative method, popularised as a means of transmitting geographical knowledge in this period, frequently resulted in methodological Eurocentrism, or specifically Anglo-centrism, and memory exercises instilled necessarily simplistic messages about geographical and political relations. Pupil-centred approaches, such as the use of adventure stories and family life as ciphers for geographical understanding, often served to masculinise the content of texts. State legislation for grant-related examinations served to homogenise the content of texts. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper reviews the approaches to multiple objective landscape planning that have developed in Swedish forestry in the 1990s. The objectives of such planning include primarily timber production and maintenance of biodiversity, but also aspects such as aesthetics and recreation. The variety of approaches and models that have emerged is caused by regional differences in land-use history, forest conditions, recreation pressure, and ownership. We distinguish three approaches: The species approach and the naturalness approach integrate conservation aspects, while the multiple aspects approach integrates several aspects (biological, social, economic, spiritual, etc.) into commercial timber-producing forestry. The species approach is exemplified by the key habitat - corridor model in which key habitats and corridors are preserved to support certain species. The natural landscape model illustrates an example of the naturalness approach, as it integrates natural forest features from a fire-disturbed landscape and gives examples of management implications at the landscape as well as at the stand level. The multiple aspects approach combines several objectives and defines important structures rather loosely. This approach was developed in areas where private nonindustrial forestry dominates. Nontimber and nonconservation aspects therefore become relevant to forest management. The supportive feature model exemplifies an application of that approach. </jats:p>",

Of further interest is the way in which well-established agricultural policy communities have attempted to keep a tight rein on the development of the regulation in order to prevent this new policy area from being infiltrated by nonagricultural interests.
