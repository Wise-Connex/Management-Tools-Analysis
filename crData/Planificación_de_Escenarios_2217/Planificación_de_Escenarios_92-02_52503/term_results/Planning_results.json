It begins by reviewing the literature reflecting the enthusiasm that greeted the introduction of computers in the 1960s and the harsh lessons that were learned in the 1970s. It then examines the current literature focusing on practical issues of applying microcomputer technology to professional practice and the political characteristics of public sector computing. The article concludes by evaluatingfuture prospects for computer-aided planning and suggesting useful directions for the future. </jats:p>",

One major indicator of how planners think about their relationship to decisionmakers and to the public is how they define the \"public interest. \" The argument is made here that unless there are countervailing controls, the further planners'ideas of the public interest diverge from the ordinary moral principle of democratic responsiveness, the more difficult they will be to legitimate. This article explores four ideas of the planner's role and the ideas of the public interest associated with them. They are pluralist aggregation, an economic/analytical approach, the common interest, and the good reasons approach. </jats:p>",

In one sense, they have revived the earlier commitment to community planning largely abandoned by the federal government over the past two decades. However, it is unclear how states and municipalities will fund continuous management of local plans, once they are completed and adopted. The federal Community Development Block Grant program offers a logical source of assistance, but amendments are necessary to correct program shortcomings and ensure quality control in planning outcomes. Local and state matching contributions should complement federal assistance. </jats:p>",

Judgemental\nforecasting techniques are suggested to be more suitable in new\nindustries because of the problems associated with other forecasting\nmethods. However, problems such as time pressure on executives and the\nneed for confidentiality are more acute when using judgemental\nforecasting techniques in new industries. The Delphi technique has been\nused many times as a method of forecasting the future of established\nindustries, but it has never been used to consider the future of a new\nindustry. Discusses ten problems which can be encountered when Delphi is\nused in this situation and provides practical hints on procedures to\novercome them, gained from its use to forecast changes in one new\nindustry, the market analysis industry. Since new industries rarely have\nestablished trade organizations to carry out such Delphi studies, the\nrole could be played by institutes of management education.</jats:p>",

What we traditionally call ‘thinking’ is based on a spatial metaphoric that visualizes thoughts as solid identities related in absolute space, forming regions or fields. Different traditions of thought differ in the way they conceive the line that surrounds them, for example, as a limit, a boundary or a ditch. In the paper the author tries to find out if thinking has to be limited by such lines. In order to do this, the author balances on the boundary, that is, stays in the paradox. If such a meaningless statement can succeed in becoming meaningful movement, thinking could show that, even though it depends on topo-logic, it can in fact exceed it. This may lead in the direction of a different conception of ‘knowledge’ and ‘communication’, a questioning of the idea of an ontology/epistemology, or of politics. They are not fully developed here, but it is presumed that to do this one would need a twofold move: Question the spatial metaphors in which binary oppositions take place to show what is underneath, and, at the same time, trust poetry. </jats:p>",

This specification also includes a recommended procedure for calculating the lateral forces exerted by casing on centralizers in 2-D inclined borehole. However these recommendations are no longer adequate for highly deviated/horizontal boreholes and deep, heavy strings. Extensions are needed in order to consider 3-D borehole curvature variations due to simultaneous changes in hole inclination and direction and to guarantee the influence of external loads on the casing strings.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>A computer program, named \"Lateral Load Program (LLP)\", was developed and field tested during the last few years based on the above assumptions. The LLP has the capability to calculate, starting from wellbore profile data (measured depth, inclination and direction), the dogleg severity, the spacing (constant or variable), the axial and lateral loads. The program also computes the stand-off according to the sag deflection prediction, based on lateral load and tension force from the pipe hanging below the centralizer, and generates a casing stand-off/depth/deviation and the hookload diagrams in advance, representing a valid support for operational planning and follow-up.</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Actual field data studies show that the LLP is accurate in predicting the real hookload;in the cased hole such predictions are exact, whereas in open hole they are few tons of the actual up and down weight. As a result of our field experience in many years of drilling activity, it is possible to conclude that achieving a stand-off of 60-70% is not enough to avoid channelling and to obtain proper cement placement. Based on this experience, by late 80's the casing centralizers spacing in deep, deviated and horizontal wells was optimized in order to achieve, as close as possible, a 100% stand-off. Several field examples confirm this assumption. The LLP is still upgrading and the fixed ends boundary condition is used in the last version (’91) for the calculation of casing deflection between two centralizers.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper the possibilities and hazards of a critical perspective on the history of geographical knowledge are considered. The focus is on the relations between modern geography and European colonialism during the ‘age of empire’ (circa 1870–1914). For writers as diverse as Joseph Conrad and Halford Mackinder, this was a moment of decisive importance for the making of the modern world. Although the interplay between geography, modernity, and colonialism has recently attracted attention from the historians of geography, it is argued in this paper that they have often conceived the role of geographical knowledge in somewhat narrow terms. The work of Edward Said is discussed at some length, as it highlights some of the key issues and dilemmas facing those who would rewrite critical histories of geographical discourse. A totalising view of ‘imaginative geographies’ (such as those of Orientalism) is argued against, and instead the heterogeneity of geographical knowledges is emphasised. The paper concludes with a more general question: Why have histories of geography at all, in these (post)modern times? </jats:p>",

Data from the study were obtained from a mail survey and three case communities. A key study conclusion is that while earthquake mitigation activity is higher among California communities than in communities of other states, it is considerably lower than for other types of hazards. Other key conclusions are that local officials can undertake a variety of activities to effectively advance planning for earthquakes, and that the more effective activities occurred through an interactive learning process where creative compromises among differing community perspectives were more likely. These conclusions imply that while there is a substantial need to better integrate earthquake mitigation into development and land use decision making, local government efforts to advance mitigation programs have a substantial potential for success. They also imply that achieving effective local response requires substantial changes in current practices of federal, state and local governments. </jats:p>",

Information on the current and historical distributions of the owl and its habitats was reviewed in light of economic, political, and legal constraints; results were used to develop a preliminary reserve system of habitat \"polygons.\" A map representing these polygons and their attendant properties served as a set of hypotheses that were tested. Statistical analyses of empirical data, predictions from ecological theory, predictions from population dynamics models, and inferences drawn from studies of related species were used to test properties of the preliminary map, including the number and sizes of habitat conservation areas (HCAs), their distribution, configuration, and spacing, and the nature of the landscape matrix between HCAs. Conclusions that failed to confirm specific map properties were used to refine the reserve system, a process that continued iteratively until all relevant data had been examined and all map properties had been tested. This conservation planning process has proven to be credible, repeatable, and scientifically defendable, and should serve as a model for wildlife management, endangered species recovery, and national forest planning.</jats:p>",

In this paper the results of recent surveys of comparable industries in Great Britain and Austria are used to begin to address this issue, with particular attention to some of the inherent difficulties in undertaking such comparisons. By using a mixture of simple cross-tabulations and multivariate logit models, differences between the two countries in the adoption of a number of new process technologies based upon microelectronics in the spheres of manufacturing production, design, and coordination are identified. It is suggested that, not only does Austria lag Great Britain in the introduction of new technology, but that variations between similar types of region are more pronounced and entrenched in Austria at the present time. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> We describe an interactive optimization system for multiperiod exhaust relief planning in the local loop of a public telephone network. In exhaust relief planning in the local loop one seeks the minimum cost capacity expansion plan that meets projected demand over a given planning horizon. The problem can be modeled as an integer programming problem. However, due to cost structures and varying transmission technologies, the single-period exhaust relief planning problem is NP-complete. The size of the problem precludes the use of general purpose integer programming. Based on the mathematical structure and complexity of the problem, we decompose the optimization problem into a single-period dynamic programming problem, and a multiperiod greedy heuristic. A software system surrounds the optimization algorithm and provides interactive planning capabilities, before and after creation of the optimized plan. Important aspects of the system are the model assumptions made to keep the problem tractable, and their effect on the standardization of input data and methodology. The system is in use by several hundred outside plant planners in a major U.S. telephone company. An overview of major elements of the package is given as well as a summary of important implementation issues that arose during the first three years of the on-going project. </jats:p>",

In this paper, it is shown that processing costs for the most accurate, heuristic, location-allocation algorithm can be drastically reduced by exploiting the spatial structure of location-allocation problems. The strategies used, preprocessing interpoint distance data as both candidate and demand strings, and use of them to update an allocation table, allow the solution of large problems (3000 nodes) in a microcomputer-based, interactive decisionmaking environment. Moreover, these strategies yield solution times which increase approximately linearly with problem size. Tests on four network problems validate these claims. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Research on generative computer-aided process planning (CAPP) for turned parts using combined fundamental and heuristic principles is presented. The rationale for the process planning approach is that many preconditions of machining processes can be expressed as a small number of domain principles. The domain is defined by processes and the part description as features for simple turned parts. The motivation is to detect faulty designs early on in the design process. Preliminary designs defined by features are first evaluated using manufacturability rules in a rule-based expert system, developed in LISP. Manufacturability rules are based on feature properties such as accessibility, stability, and critical material thickness. The rules were acquired from design and manufacturing personnel from industry through interviews. Parts that satisfy the manufacturability checks are used to generate all feasible process plans. A search algorithm selects the “best” process plan from the feasible set. Process plans are generated and subsequently optimized using two distinct sets of feasibility and optimality criteria which may be either fundamental or heuristic in nature. The presently incorporated criteria successfully restrict the set of plans to a small number without missing any apparently feasible process plans. Manufacturability evaluation, feasible process plans, and optimal process plans for actual industrial parts have been obtained and compared.</jats:p>",

Although there are few semantic differences with respect to metaphor use between the two groups, there are pragmatic differences; that is, in the way metaphors are used to create community, and its obverse, otherness or alterity. In their quest to develop foolproof methods that could be applied by everyone, modernist geographers proposed a democratic view. In contrast, for postmodernist economic geographers understanding the world requires an act of transcendence; this view is Homeric or heroic, wherein the world is divided into those who possess the depth of sensitivity to grasp complexity, and those who cannot and are thus merely ‘other’. </jats:p>",

Encouragement of planting flexibility via an option of reducing the base acreage is effective only if the availability of cropland is a limiting factor. However, movement toward the complete elimination of the notion of base acreage (that is, movement toward a completely free market unencumbered by government programs) would be the most effective option to reduce the value of a base acre thereby encouraging greater planting flexibility. An increase in the price of soybeans and a decrease in the price of corn would also serve to encourage switching from continuous planting of corn to a corn — soybeans rotation. However, as more soybeans and less corn are produced, the price of soybeans would fall while the price of corn would rise. As a consequence, the effectiveness of the policy options considered here in promoting planting flexibility would be reduced. </jats:p>",

An automatic transformation of the resulting assembly plans into one or several precedence graphs is given as well as a generalization of the classic precedence graphs in precedence hypergraphs able to represent disjunctive precedence conditions. </jats:p>",

A series of experiments was devised to examine the impact of rating and ranking procedures on the decision making behavior of users (e.g., planners, managers, analysts, etc.) when faced with situations involving multiple evaluation criteria and numerous alternative planning projects. The four MCDM models tested were MATS‐PC, EXPERT CHOICE, ARIADNE, and ELECTRE.</jats:p><jats:p>Two groups of analysts and decision makers were tested. One group consisted of experienced U.S. Army Corps planners, while the other was comprised of graduate students. Based on a series of nonparametric statistical tests, the results identified EXPERT CHOICE as the preferred MCDM model by both groups based largely on ease of use and understandability. ARIADNE fostered the largest degree of agreement within and among the two groups of individuals tested. The tests also lend support to the claim that rankings are not affected significantly by the choice of decision maker (i.e., who uses any of these MCDM models) or which of these four models is used.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper presents a new cutting tool selection methodology, namely the intelligent tool selection (ITS), which covers the whole spectrum of tool specification and usage in machining environments. The selection process has five distinct levels and starts by deriving a local optimum solution at the process planning level, which is progressively optimized in the wider context of the shop-floor. Initially, multiple tools are selected for each machining operation and tool lists are formed by sorting selected tools in order of preference. The second selection level provides a tooling solution for a component by considering all the operations required as well as the characteristics of the machine tool. The selected tools are then rationalized by forming a set of tools for machining a variety of components on a given machine tool at level 3 and by increasing the use of common and standard tools within a group of machines at level 4. Finally, the fifth level aims at reducing tool inventory by classifying existing tools into categories according to their usage and is also used for introducing new tools into the manufacturing system. </jats:p><jats:p> The selection method allows the implementation of the minimal storage tooling (MST) concept, by linking the ordering of new and replacement tools to production control. ITS also uses the concept of tool resources structure (TRS), which specifies all tooling resources required for producing a component. By using the framework provided by ITS, TRS and MST it can be shown that tooling technology interfaces with diverse company functions from design and process planning to material/tool scheduling and tool management. The selection methodology results in higher utilization of tools, improved efficiency of machining processes and reduced tool inventory. </jats:p>",

The model is an extension of a recently developed master-equation approach to interregional migration. The population dynamics of the French urban system, described by a set of 78 cities, is investigated within the period 1954–82. The importance of synergy effects (self-reinforcing collective effects) as well as socioeconomic macrovariables for the understanding of urban dynamics becomes obvious. A forecasting of urban dynamics (relative urban population, growth rates of the cities) for a closer period, year 2002, by using two different kinds of scenarios, confirm this result and give further insight into the nested structure of urban systems. </jats:p>",
