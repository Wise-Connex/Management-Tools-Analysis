      "abstract": "<jats:p> In models of decision making under uncertainty we often are faced with the problem of representing the uncertainties in a form suitable for quantitative models. If the uncertainties are expressed in terms of multivariate continuous distributions, or a discrete distribution with far too many outcomes, we normally face two possibilities: either creating a decision model with internal sampling, or trying to find a simple discrete approximation of the given distribution that serves as input to the model. This paper presents a method based on nonlinear programming that can be used to generate a limited number of discrete outcomes that satisfy specified statistical properties. Users are free to specify any statistical properties they find relevant, and the method can handle inconsistencies in the specifications. The basic idea is to minimize some measure of distance between the statistical properties of the generated outcomes and the specified properties. We illustrate the method by single- and multiple-period problems. The results are encouraging in that a limited number of generated outcomes indeed have statistical properties that are close to or equal to the specifications. We discuss how to verify that the relevant statistical properties are captured in these specifications, and argue that what are the relevant properties, will be problem dependent. </jats:p>",

Thus there is an urgent need for strategies to prevent the emerging global epidemic of type 2 diabetes to be implemented. Tackling diabetes must be part of an integrated program that addresses lifestyle related disorders. The prevention and control of type 2 diabetes and the other major noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) can be cost‐ and health‐effective through an integrated (i.e. horizontal) approach to noncommunicable diseases disease prevention and control. With the re‐emergence of devastating communicable diseases including AIDS, the Ebola virus and tuberculosis, the pressure is on international and regional agencies to see that the noncommunicable disease epidemic is addressed.</jats:p><jats:p>The international diabetes and public health communities need to adopt a more pragmatic view of the epidemic of type 2 diabetes and other noncommunicable diseases. The current situation is a symptom of globalization with respect to its social, cultural, economic and political significance. Type 2 diabetes will not be prevented by traditional medical approaches; what is required are major and dramatic changes in the socio‐economic and cultural status of people in developing countries and the disadvantaged, minority groups in developed nations. The international diabetes and public health communities must lobby and mobilize politicians, other international agencies such as UNDP, UNICEF, and the World Bank as well as other international nongovernmental agencies dealing with the noncommunicable diseases to address the socio‐economic, behavioural, nutritional and public health issues that have led to the type 2 diabetes and noncommunicable diseases epidemic. A multidisciplinary Task Force representing all parties which can contribute to a reversal of the underlying socio‐economic causes of the problem is an urgent priority.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Examination of two new expanded KT transitions and reexamination of road outcrops near Beloc, Haiti, reveals that deposition of the glass spherule-rich deposit (SRD) occurred within the early Danian Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina (Pla(1)) Zone, followed by an Ir anomaly, and 50 cm above it, a second Pd-dominated platinum group element (PGE) anomaly. The KT boundary is at an erosional unconformity between the base of the SRD and underlying Maastrichtian limestone, where an interval representing about 100250 thousand years appears to be missing (juxtaposition of planktic foraminiferal zones (Pla(1)) and Plummerita hantkeninoides (CF1)). It is possible that the spherule layers are reworked from original deposits at or below the KT boundary. The Ir anomaly is of roughly chondritic-type and compatible with an impact event, whereas the Pd-dominated PGE anomaly is a more basalt-type and compatible with a magmatic origin. This suggests a multi-event scenario consistent with one impact followed by a major volcanic event in the Caribbean or elsewhere. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the La Sierrita area of Nuevo Leon, Mexico, three spherule layers are present and separated from the overlying siliciclastic deposits by up to 6 m of pelagic marls. The marls are of latest Maastrichtian age (Plummerita hantkeninoides (CF1) Zone, Micula prinsii Zone) and deposited under normal pelagic conditions with no significant evidence of reworking or slumping. Original deposition of the spherule layers occurred during the last 300 ka of the Maastrichtian and well prior to the Cretaceous-Tertiary (KT) boundary event. Thus, if the spherules in northeastern Mexico provide critical evidence of an impact at Chicxulub, this impact predates the KT boundary. </jats:p>",
