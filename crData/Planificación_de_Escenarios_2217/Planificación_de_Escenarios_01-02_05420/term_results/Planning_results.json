      "abstract": "<jats:p> The gay, lesbian, and queer population is a marginalized group, but its concerns are not marginal to planning. It is a sizable group, heterogeneous (not least in income), and growing in visibility. This article examines the implications for planning practice of the emergence of gay men, lesbians, and related nonconformist groups. Most of the research that is easily applied to planning practice has focused on residential enclaves and neighborhoods. Work is also starting to appear on zoning and housing, business development including tourism, historic preservation, and the use of public space. </jats:p>",

The author accepted a position at the University of Louisville in June 1999, and in the fall of that year and the spring of 2000, the bibliography was updated to reflect the recent additions to this field.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to contribute to an emerging body of critique of communicative planning theory (CPT). The critiques in the paper are grounded in analysis of situated planning practice in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, where planners were ‘feeling their way towards’ democratising planning practice in line with the normative dimensions of CPT. Two critiques are offered. Both are fundamentally concerned with power and the tendency of CPT to operate as if the workings of power can be temporarily suspended through communicative planning practice to produce new consensual planning discourses. First, it is argued that CPT pays insufficient attention to the practical context of power in which planning is practised, thereby assuming away, rather than engaging with, the politics-laden and power-laden interests that infiltrate planning practice. Second, it is argued that CPT abstracts planners from their positioning in a nexus of power, knowledge, and rationality which validates expert forms of knowing/reasoning/valuing, and thus underestimates the challenges of asserting alternative forms. The paper concludes with a suggestion that any theory aiming at the democratisation of planning practice will need to depart from an orientation to consensus, a defining feature of CPT, and instead account for the irreducible nature of power and difference. </jats:p>",

In this paper I examine the geopolitics of Internet access and its implications. I open by situating electronic communications within contemporary social theory, emphasizing cyberspace as a contested terrain of competing discourses. Second, international discrepancies in access are illustrated, dramatizing the ways in which the Internet enhances the advantages enjoyed by a global elite consisting largely of white, male professionals. Third, I turn to discrepancies in Internet access within the United States, including class, racial, gender, and spatial disparities. I seek to demonstrate that geography still matters; the Internet creates and reflects a distinct spatial structure interlaced with, and often reinforcing, existing relations of wealth and power. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The space that can be seen from any vantage point is called an isovist and the set of such spaces forms a visual field whose extent defines different isovist fields based on different geometric properties. I suggest that our perceptions of moving within such fields might be related to these geometric properties. I begin with a formal representation of isovists and their fields, introducing simple geometric measures based on distance, area, perimeter, compactness, and convexity. I suggest a feasible computational scheme for measuring such fields, and illustrate how we can visualize their spatial and statistical properties by using maps and frequency distributions. I argue that the classification of fields based on these measures must be a prerequisite to the proper analysis of architectural and urban morphologies. To this end, I present two hypothetical examples based on simple geometries and three real examples based on London's Tate Gallery, Regent Street, and the centre of the English town of Wolverhampton. Although such morphologies can often be understood in terms of basic geometrical elements such as corridors, streets, rooms, and squares, isovist analysis suggests that visual fields have their own form which results from the interaction of geometry and movement. To illustrate how such analysis can be used, I outline methods of partitioning space, covering it with a small number of relatively independent isovists, and perceiving space by recording properties of the isovist fields associated with paths through that space. </jats:p>",

Beyond the core domain names suffixes (.com, .gov, .net, and .org) domains usually carry geographic identification (.uk, .au, .jp, and so on). As desirable domains are registered, organizations and individuals seek web locations in new areas to claim high visibility on the Internet. After examining the regulation, legal jurisdiction, and geography of domain name registration, in this paper I analyze the experience of six countries that have commercially attractive top-level domain names: American Samoa, Moldova, Nuie, Tonga, Turkmenistan, and Tuvalu. These domains illustrate how geographic issues can emerge in the practice of electronic interaction and identity. </jats:p>",

As a result, explanations of the relationship between telecommunications and urban growth are overly simplistic, forecasting either the centralization of decision-making in so-called ‘global’ cities or wholesale urban dissolution. Based on two measurements of Internet geography—domain name registrations and backbone networks—this study finds that access to advanced communications technologies have broadly diffused across a wide group of medium-sized and large-sized metropolitan areas. Finally, the implications of these findings suggest a need to rethink global cities and a practical need to address the growing divide between network cities and the rest of the urban world. </jats:p>",

Instead, cyberspatial cognition is crucial in constituting the effective cyber-environment and shaping human cyberspatial behavior. I propose a behavioral model of cyber-accessibility and examine how notions underlying conventional accessibility measures such as impedance and opportunity set can be extended for measuring individual cyber-accessibility. I argue that theories about spatial learning, cognitive mapping, and decision-making behavior are helpful for understanding individual cyberspatial behavior. This suggests that behavioral theories and models may provide a theoretical foundation for cybergeography. </jats:p>",

In particular, the effects of this design process in structuring the relationships, if any, between everyday living and ‘private’ household functions, that is, bedrooms, and the interface between inhabitants and visitors are examined. This is done in order to understand better the relationship, if any, between Eisenman's stated aims in his own theoretical writings about the design of these houses and the architectural object itself. </jats:p>",

Here we show how a set of isovists can be used to generate a graph of mutual visibility between locations. We demonstrate that this graph can also be constructed without reference to isovists and that we are in fact invoking the more general concept of a visibility graph. Using the visibility graph, we can extend both isovist and current graph-based analyses of architectural space to form a new methodology for the investigation of configurational relationships. The measurement of local and global characteristics of the graph, for each vertex or for the system as a whole, is of interest from an architectural perspective, allowing us to describe a configuration with reference to accessibility and visibility, to compare from location to location within a system, and to compare systems with different geometries. Finally we show that visibility graph properties may be closely related to manifestations of spatial perception, such as way-finding, movement, and space use. </jats:p>",

The justification for these efforts has been based on the premise that more and better quality information will result in reduced uncertainty and improved risk perceptions in decision situations. This premiss is examined in the context of decision maker behaviour, drawing on empirical research involving 50 managers undertaking strategic analysis and decisions. The research methodology employed a computer‐based simulation of a strategic decision situation, enabling the managers to access structured information databases to support their decision making. Concludes that the initial perceptions of uncertainty and risk relating to the decisions faced are unlikely to be modified irrespective of the quantity or quality of the information transmitted and processed by the decision maker. The evidence suggests that the decision maker may also construct their decision‐taking behaviour to constrain the opportunity for new information to alter the initial perceptions and choices made.</jats:p>",

For several years he has been an advocate for the NHS to explore the wider integration of complementary therapies more thoroughly. A number of complementary therapies (notably homoeopathy, acupuncture, osteopathy) have been available within the National Health Service (NHS) since its establishment in 1948. There has been an increasing understanding and usage of these therapies since the 1970s. Equally, there has been an expansion in the number and range of therapies covered by such practitioners (Fulder and Munro 1981). However, a clear distinction between an orthodox medical profession and a ‘fringe’ of alternative practitioners, which was first given legislative force in the 1858 Medical Registration Act, still exists (Mercer et al. 1995). This has been repeatedly confirmed, particularly with the almost complete exclusion of unorthodox, ‘alternative’ practitioners from the publicly-funded healthcare system when the NHS was established.</jats:p>",

The empirical results derive from individuals’ own interpretation and definition of the term satisfaction, as well as evaluation of their definitions. Finds that most people cited several definitions of satisfaction, illustrating that it is a multifaceted concept. The most common interpretations reflect the notion that satisfaction is a feeling which results from a process of evaluating what was received against that expected, the purchase decision itself and/or the fulfilment of needs/wants. It also finds that the particular interpretation is affected by contextual issues, such as whether it is a product or service under consideration.

Most probably, the majority of the wells will be drilled underbalanced in the near future. While onshore and offshore operations from fixed platforms have been conducted, UBD from floating units is still a challenge. With the majority of its hydrocarbon reserves located in deepwater, Petrobras decided to start a project to develop technology to drill wells with light-weight drilling fluid from a floating platform. This technology is seen today as the first step to reach UBD from a floating vessel, including deepwater locations. The present paper describes the steps taken so far to develop all the new equipment required and the HazOp meetings to discuss and approve the technical details and procedures. The paper also discusses the difficulties encountered during the negotiations with a rig contractor, to allow and fully understand the operation on board of one of its platforms. The paper finally discusses the best options from the lessons learned so far to have rigs ready to use this technology in the near future.</jats:p>",

There is a paucity of research that answers questions such as how long does it take to make a decision, is a formal plan prepared, and is advice solicited from external sources? This paper reports the results of a disk‐by‐mail survey that collected information on the export mode decisions of Canadian software firms. Managers of the responding firms most frequently reported that they made their decision quickly and by intuition, without the benefit of formal studies or consultation with outside experts. Further, the characteristics of the decision process have no statistically significant association with channel performance.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Enterprise resource planning (ERP) technologies can, despite their apparent flexibility, act as a rather obdurate tool for management’s political programmes. To understand this, a combined organisational politics and sociology of technology approach is adopted, viewing technology as a political programme for change. A total of 30 manufacturing case studies grouped around three ERP vendors and systems, show that using technology is not only an issue controlled by an enterprise’s actors. IT suppliers and management consultants and others form communities, which promote certain political programmes. These cases demonstrate that enterprise configurations of ERP do share commonalities, whereas two longitudinal case studies are used to discuss unique enterprise politics. While some features of the systems/political programmes were frozen, others were fluid, and could be configured in micro political processes. Thus hardness is contextual. The political role of technology is not just a case of flexibility or hardness, but a complicated pattern of negotiability, resources, social and geographical distance.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The policy and theoretical discourses of deinstitutionalisation have been centred on a fundamental normative polarity that opposes the ‘dehumanising’ institution to the more humane environment of community care. We reconsider this moral polarity by drawing upon three philosophical currents that emphasise the need for inclusive and compassionate governance. We argue that there are strong political — ethical and practical reasons why inclusive governance can improve human-services planning and delivery. First, by recognising and addressing the vulnerabilities of nonservice users, an inclusive ethics is most likely to maximise the welfare of all groups with interests in community care. Following from this, an inclusive ethics is more likely to foster the broad social support that we argue is necessary for successful community care. Third, an inclusionary outlook has the potential to broaden the design of community-care services and facilities. An inclusive ethics would radically open up policy design to a range of other service options that account for the complexities of place, policy context, and the needs of key interest groups, such as service users, workers, relatives/advocates, and local communities. </jats:p>",

The content of the discourse is affected because the consideration of an addressee's inferences may require the addition of information that addresses erroneous inferences or suggest the omission of easily inferred information. The coherence of the discourse is affected because the generated discourse should incorporate inferential relations that emerge from the consideration of an addressee's inferences. In this article, we describe a discourse planner that takes into consideration a user's inferences. In particular, we discuss its content planning and discourse structuring mechanisms. The content planning mechanism generates a set of rhetorical devices that achieves a given communicative goal. The discourse structuring mechanism takes into consideration schematic, inferential, and prescriptive relations between these rhetorical devices in order to organize them into a coherent sequence. Our discourse planner has been implemented in a system called WISHFUL that generates explanations about concepts in technical domains. We evaluated WISHFUL's performance to test the effect of considering a user's inferences during content planning and discourse organization and also to determine the suitability of the discourse produced by WISHFUL for different types of users. The results of our evaluation endorse the ideas embodied in the WISHFUL system.</jats:p>",

Foucault's later work on government provides the basis for a useable definition of culture as an object of analysis which avoids problems inherent in abstract, generalizing, and expansive notions of culture. The emergence of this Foucauldian approach in cultural studies is discussed, and the distinctive conceptualization of the relations between culture and power that it implies are elaborated. This reconceptualization informs a critical project of tracking the institutional formation of the cultural and the deployment of distinctively cultural forms of regulation into the fabric of modern social life. It is argued that the culture-and-government approach needs to be supplemented by a more sustained consideration of the spatiality and scale of power-relations. It is also suggested that this approach might throw into new perspective the dynamic behind geography's own cultural turn. </jats:p>",

Through a case study of the New Zealand Call Centre Attraction Initiative, this paper draws from the governmentality literature to show new forms of economic governance can be conceptualised as an assemblage of spaces, subjects, strategies, and numbers.

The Bureau's abolition is treated as a defining event in the profound shift that has been observable over the last five years in the forms of evidence produced and publicly aired about immigration. I seek both to form an explanation for the demise of this successful research institution and to provide examples of the research about immigration that was produced during the time of the Bureau, and after its closure. Using evidence primarily from a reading of contemporary media texts, government reports, and statistics, the analysis is made with reference to three themes. First, immigration as a contested ‘issue’, and the style of research done about it, is situated in the context of the new politics of nationhood emerging from the recent shift in federal governments. Second, views of the ‘facts’ of immigration that were publicly prevalent in the days of the Bureau's operation, are contrasted with those now dominant. Third, particular representations of immigration found in these contrasting accounts are examined. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent research and literature in which regional development concepts and regional innovation policy have been addressed, a strong interest in the role of knowledge and learning has been shown. In this, a strange phenomenon can be observed. Whereas much work is concentrated on learning within regions, and some reference is made to learning from external sources, scant attention is paid to the interregional dimension. This seems to amount to a dilemma: although development concepts and policy strategies are themselves the subject of constant exchange and learning processes at an interregional level, the interregional dissemination of such concepts, and concomitant processes of learning, are largely ignored. Even where a supraregional perspective is adopted, little is said, either analytically or empirically, about the nature and role of learning processes between regions. One basic message that follows from this, the authors conclude, is that researchers working on regional development and regional policy need to become more reflexive. In order to achieve this, a model of knowledge cycles is presented. The model not only helps our understanding of how observations taken from regional experiences can be translated into more general analytical concepts and policy prescription, it also draws the necessary attention to the way that such general abstractions are part, as well as catalyst, of processes of interregional learning. </jats:p>",

Several characteristics were observed in the temporal distribution of 1273 cholera cases and 4984 noncholera watery diarrhea cases, revealing differences between the temporal patterns of the two disease categories. The main cholera peaks were in September and October in each of the three study years. There was an irregular temporal cycle to noncholera watery diarrhea. There were many small, highly dispersed high-risk areas for cholera. In contrast, the high-risk areas for noncholera are clustered in only a few areas. These findings are also consistent with the theory that cholera is a disease for which the spatial distribution is partly controlled by environmental parameters whereas noncholera disease transmission is controlled by other nonenvironmental parameters. </jats:p>",

Reviews in the 1990s have focused on a perceived over-provision and recommended rationalisation. This paper explores the representations of place which emerged in the discourses surrounding the possible closure of St Bartholomew's Hospital (Barts), London. Through a discourse analysis of official and unofficial reports, Parliamentary debates, press releases, campaign material and coverage in the London Evening Standard and other newspapers, we assess resistance to closure and the construction of communities dedicated to the retention of Barts. Four different representations of Bart's are identified: as community resource, as a site of expertise, as a heritage symbol and as a site pertinent to the identities of Londoners. The effectiveness of these different strategies is considered and their positioning and use within the ‘Campaign for Barts’ is evaluated. We conclude that, notwithstanding the potential to present the (possibly temporary) retention of Barts as a recognition of its status as a locus of particular medical expertise, the potency of this health care facility as a symbol both of London and of medical tradition was the crucial factor in its reprieve. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the last decade Austria has successfully coped with extraordinary political and economic changes; most important among these was the accession to the European single market. Contrary to widespread expectation, Austro-corporatism did not continue to decline but made an astonishing comeback. This was accomplished despite no longer being able to rely on the government's traditional policy of explicit demand management. Left without a fiscal stimulus, and having to cope with the twin effects of economic internationalization and modernization, it was necessary to develop a new basis for the legitimacy of Austro-corporatism. This was made possible by a transition to supply-side corporatism, which appears uniquely suited to complement and take advantage of market liberalization, modernization, and economic integration. Under supply-side corporatism, corporatist actors function primarily as producers of collective goods not provided by an opportunistic market or by a political system constrained by a loss of economic competencies and political fragmentation. The competitive advantage of supply-side corporatism lies in achieving organized ‘flexibilization’ and decentralization; upgrading, that is, succeeding in market segments of high value-added products; macro-level coordination; and by rendering vital public policy support. A high level of macro-level coordination and concerted effort continues to be necessary to channel infrastructure development, investment in human capital, skill formation, and public investments into those niche segments of the industry in which Austria enjoys a natural advantage over its competitors. </jats:p>",

In the preparation of the Fifth Memorandum on Spatial Planning, however, spatial planning minister Pronk abandoned the corridor as spatial planning concept and moved to the ‘urban network’ as the central concept of spatial policy for the next decades.

In this study, we contribute to a ‘third way’ of knowing that is based upon a theoretically informed econometric analysis of the ‘soft’ processes that are hypothesized to drive local economic growth. In this first of two papers, (part 1 of the study) we focus on questions of methodology and measurement. Specifically, six sets of theoretical propositions on the nature of the mechanisms that promote local economic performance are reviewed: the growth-pole, growth-centres model; the product-cycle model; the flexible-production model; the learning-regions model; the competitive-advantage model; and the enterprise-segmentation model. From this review, eight measurable dimensions are developed that cover the main propositions of these models. These dimensions are calibrated using data for Australia, divided into ninety-four regions, for the period 1984–92. We conclude by exploring the limitations of our mapping between theoretical concepts, measurable dimensions, and surrogate variables, and examine the implications of this mapping for testing the validity of ‘soft’ geographical theories. In a subsequent paper (part 2 of the study) we test the validity of these models of local growth in the Australian context. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>An important theoretical concept in motor control is the idea that the CNS uses an internal model of the motor system and environment to predict the sensory consequences of motor commands. In arm movement control, a critical factor affecting the transformation from motor commands to sensory consequences is limb dynamics, including the inertial anisotropy of the arm, which refers to the fact that the inertial resistance of the arm depends on hand movement direction. Here we show that the CNS maintains an accurate internal model of the inertial anisotropy of the arm by demonstrating that the motor system can precisely predict direction-dependent variations in hand acceleration. Subjects slid an object, held beneath the index finger, across a frictionless horizontal surface to radially located targets. We recorded the normal (vertical) force exerted by the fingertip, as well as the tangential (horizontal) force proportional to hand acceleration. We found that normal force was precisely scaled in anticipation of tangential force, which, as expected, varied with direction. The peak rates of change of the normal and tangential forces, observed early in the movement, were highly correlated. Similar results were obtained regardless of whether the start position of the hand was located directly in front of the subject or rotated 45° to the right. Finally, we observed reduced force correlations under reaction time conditions. This suggests that the process of prediction, based on an internal model of the limb, is not fully completed within the reaction time interval.</jats:p>",

Whether local revenue is responsive to revenue sharing is examined by using cross-section and time-series analyses. The results of the cross-section analysis are inconclusive. However, evidence based on the time trend of the tax-effort ratio indicates that tax effort is influenced by the institutional framework of property taxation. This finding implies that local revenue is not responsive to revenue sharing. Whether local expenditure is responsive to revenue sharing is examined by using cross-section, time-series, and panel-data analyses. The results show that there is a strong positive relationship between the revenue sharing and expenditure trends. The Granger causality test indicates that revenue sharing drives expenditure, and this shows the existence of the circularity problem. These findings imply that local expenditure is responsive to revenue sharing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper develops a new perspective to describe and account for the geography of trade in advanced services. The authors begin by acknowledging the national and global significance of trade in advanced services within national economic change and also global trade policy. They find current approaches to this issue, based on firm decisionmaking, are narrow, and seek out a broader perspective. The foundation for that perspective incorporates established research on the preconditions necessary for the growth of advanced services in a modern economy. The authors argue that the presence or absence of these preconditions in trading nations shapes the likelihood of service firms creating imports or exports of services. Hence the framework focuses on home-country and host-country conditions as explanatory factors of service trade. The framework is illustrated by an analysis of the trade in advanced services from Australia, especially with its northern Asia Pacific neighbours which now figure as the main destinations for Australia's goods trade. This analysis shows that Australia does have a well-developed advanced producer services sector, but only a small part of its trade involves these activities. The explanation is found in the lack of the appropriate host conditions in the markets that are important in its goods trade. That interpretation is confirmed by the fact that the United States and United Kingdom (with favourable host–market circumstances) remain much more important destinations for Australia's small advanced producer service export activity. A policy implication is that the long-term growth of Australia's service exports to its Asia-Pacific neighbours will depend upon institutional change within those markets. </jats:p>",

CED has been widely perceived by a range of policymakers as one mechanism through which to moderate the scale of economic decline in more disadvantaged localities. A number of funding sources, and in particular European Structural Funds, have increasingly allocated resources to creating and sustaining CED projects. But evidence from this region points to a very limited population of community businesses which undertake trading activities. Moreover, the sector is bedevilled by a series of constraints including those revolving around finance and partnership working. A number of policy developments could enhance the status and sustainability of CED projects, including a more structured approach towards the funding and operation of intermediary agencies. Even then, CED is likely to prove only a marginal player in economic reconversion. The scale of market failure in ‘CED localities’ points to the need for a more interventionist and collective approach to regeneration. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The authors' principal purpose is to study why the government in Spain has maintained price regulations on medicines during the last thirty-five years. The hypothesis is that price regulations were related to the regulatory style of the Spanish government in the 1960s and, since the last 1970s, have become a key instrument for preventing the pharmaceutical costs of the National Health System from rising. In order to test this hypothesis, two questions are considered. The first relates to how business interests and their main representative bodies have managed to influence the implementation of price regulations during the last thirty-five years. The second question concerns the extent to which changes in the prices of medicines have been effective in preventing increased costs of the Spanish National Health System drug bill between 1964 ad 1994. After analyzing the political economy of the price regulation of medicines and pharmaceutical cost-limiting policies during the last thirty-five years in Spain, and after estimating a function of the public demand for medicines between 1964 and 1994 in Spain, the authors extract the following two conclusions. First, price regulation has become a very useful instrument for preventing public pharmaceutical costs from rising since the late 1970s in Spain. Second, business interests have found it increasingly useful over the last thirty-five years to establish a stable framework in the market for medicines based on price regulation and the public provision of medicines. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> During the 1990s competitive bidding became the principal way of allocating resources for urban regeneration. One of the objectives was to invigorate the approach of local authorities by exposing them to the pressure of competition. Another was to open up decisionmaking to a wider spectrum of interests, including the private sector and local communities. The authors examine the consequences for unsuccessful areas—an analysis which is crucial to any overall assessment of the approach. They focus on the competition for Priority Partnership Area status associated with the reshaping of Scotland's Urban Programme under Programme for Partnership. The analysis reveals a modest stimulus to partnership working in several areas, attributable to the need for agencies to cooperate in a time-constrained bidding process and to manage ‘compensation’ funds thereafter. These benefits were offset by the disillusionment caused by the experience and the penalties of losing resources. To avoid widening inequalities in the future, the authors argue, central government must recognise the impact of this disillusionment through improvements in the organisation of competitive bidding and through planning mechanisms for the mitigation of the adverse effects of losing. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the 1980s, the hegemony of the large US advertising networks has been challenged by a new breed of London-based agencies who pioneered what is known in the trade as ‘second wave’. On the one hand, second wave implied the emancipation of Soho from an ‘outpost of Madison Avenue’ to the ‘advertising village’ on the basis of momentous product and process innovations. On the other hand, a few London agencies rose to global top positions on the crest of the second wave by transforming themselves from international advertising networks into global communication groups. This paper starts from the assumption that both, the localised cluster of advertising agencies in the advertising village (the ‘Village’) and the global communications group (the ‘Group’), share basic principles of social organisation. It aims at demonstrating that the organisational logic of both the Village and the Group can be conceptualised in terms of a heterarchy. By drawing on case-study evidence from Soho on the one hand and from the world leading communications business, WPP, on the other, the five basic features of heterarchies—diversity, rivalry, tags, projects, and reflexivity—will provide the conceptual tools for the investigation into the social organisation of the Village and the Group. </jats:p>",

Two themes identified by the 1998 White Paper on energy sources for power generation are considered in depth: the related issues of diversity and security of supply; and the operation of the electricity market. The leading fossil-fueled generators have pursued a path of internationalisation in the course of the decade that contrasts markedly with the contraction of the indigenous coal industry. These corporate strategies and their regional implications are considered in a subsequent section. It is concluded that there are contrasting arguments presently being applied by government to different fuel sources. A likely consequence of recent policies will be high levels of imports of coal and gas by the second decade of the 21st century. This in part arises from government preoccupation in the early 1990s with reducing the degree of dependence upon coal as an energy source.</jats:p>",

Data were collected from regional health planning officers during a Search Conference and a series of Delphi rounds. The needs assessments were found to vary from regionally to locally driven approaches. Locally driven approaches ensured local involvement but the process was slower and required more effort from the planner. It was also felt that locally driven approaches could exacerbate tension between a community's imperatives and the regional focus of regional decision‐makers. In the overall regional budgets, the reallocation of health service funds according to the needs assessment findings was only small because of difficulties in refocusing from traditional clinical services in the short term. In contrast, the impact on health service thinking about population health issues was thought to have been more significant, for example, in the development of regional women's health plans. The use of community health needs assessments was useful, but for greater impact these should not now be so ‘broad‐brushed’, but be more focused on feasible changes that health services could support. Other priority‐setting techniques, such as marginal analysis, should also be used to determine where maximum health gains can be obtained.</jats:p>",

Social balance is now endorsed in some, but not all, the relevant urban policy statements of the New Labour government elected in 1997. A modified form of poststructural discourse analysis offers the best way of understanding the term and its implications. The approach focuses on different levels of social reality—the level of a national policy, the level of management and estate upgrading, and the level of the social experience of residents. In doing this, the approach reveals the varied and occasionally contradictory meanings of the term ‘social balance’; it highlights the increasingly common attempts by social housing agencies to control the characteristics of their tenants; and it enables a sceptical assessment of the practical significance of mixed housing estates for poor individuals and households. </jats:p>",

The central argument is that labour migration is a family strategy to acquire both physical and human capital for a future technological transformation. On the basis of an in-depth survey of returned migrants that was conducted in rural China, I focus on the explanation of return rural occupation change in a multivariate framework. I find that it is the improvement of the migrant's skills and entrepreneurial ability rather than their savings and remittances that strongly facilitates a return rural occupational change. The policy implication of the finding is to shift efforts from narrowing intersectoral wage differentials to improving rural learning and training opportunities. </jats:p>",

The rotation control system of the flexible arm is constructed with the desired signal planning for the joint angle and the PD controller.

As these methods have been developed to trace the evolutionary history of random mutations of the elements in biological sequences, they are not appropriate to measure the distances by which activities change their sequential order in activity diaries. In this paper we report on the development of a position-sensitive sequence-alignment method for activity analysis. First, the problem is specified, and the key concepts to analyse the problem are addressed. Then, the principles of the new method are introduced. The method is illustrated with data on activity patterns collected in the Netherlands. The paper concludes with a critical discussion of the basic assumptions of the method and avenues of future research are identified. </jats:p>",
