      "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Rivers in developed regions are under significant stress due to nutrient enrichment generated mainly by human activities. Excess nitrogen and phosphorus emissions are the product of complex dynamic systems influenced by various factors such as demographic, socio-economic and technological development. Using a Catalan river catchment, La Tordera (North-East of Spain), as a case study of an integrated and interdisciplinary environmental assessment of nutrient flows, we present and discuss the development of socio-economic scenarios through a participatory process for the sustainable management of the anthropogenic sources of nutrients, nitrogen and phosphorus. In this context, scenarios are an appropriate tool to assist nutrient emissions modelling, and to assess impacts, possible pathways for socio-economic development and associated uncertainties. Evaluated against the 1993–2003 baseline period, scenarios target the 2030 horizon, i.e., through the implementation process of the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC). After a critical examination of the methodology used in the participatory development of socio-economic scenarios, we present four possible futures (or perspectives) for the Catalan river catchment conceived by stakeholders invited to a workshop. Keys to the success of such a participatory process were trust, which enhanced openness, and disagreements, which fostered the group's creativity for scenario development. The translation of narrative socio-economic scenarios into meaningful nutrient emission scenarios is also presented. By integrating findings of natural sciences and socio-economic analysis, we aim to assist decision makers and stakeholders in evaluating optimal management strategies for the anthropogenic sources of nitrogen and phosphorus.\n                        </jats:p>"

Due to the traditional management system, too much dependence on the state ex-chequer and lack of competitive attitude in the state owned PSUs are either making a loss or being privatized or closed. The organizations, which have been privatized or are still making a profit, are carefully going for restructuring, downsizing, etc. for survival and growth in the competitive environment. The industrial relations scenario has been influenced by these factors. During the last decade strikes, lockouts, lay-offs, retrenchments, closures, etc. dominated the scenario. But there is a decreasing trend in the same in recent years. This is due to the acceptance of reality by managements, workers and trade unions. The role of the state is visible in setting the disputes through conciliation and adjudication proceedings. Conciliation seems to be faster to dispose the matters where as adjudication had become a time taking process. However in spite of financial difficulties the state has not failed in its duties to intervene and settle the disputes. </jats:p>",

The IPCC models predict a strengthening and a poleward shift of the tropospheric zonal jets in response to global warming. The change in zonal jets is also accompanied by a strengthening and a poleward and upward shift of transient kinetic energy and momentum flux. Similar changes in circulation are simulated by a simple dry general circulation model (GCM) when the height of the tropopause is raised. The similarity between the simple GCM and the IPCC models suggests that the changes in midlatitude circulation are predominantly driven by a rise in the height of the tropopause, and that other factors such as increased moisture content and the change in the low‐level pole‐to‐equator temperature gradient, play a secondary role. In addition, the variability about the ensemble‐mean of the zonal wind response is significantly correlated with the variability of the tropopause height response over the polar cap, especially in the Southern Hemisphere.</jats:p>",

The hydrological model (RhineFlow) is driven by meteorological data from a 90-years (ensemble of three 30-years) simulation with the HadRM3H regional climate model for both present-day and future climate (A2 emission scenario). Simulation of present-day discharges is realistic provided that (1) the HadRM3H temperature and precipitation are corrected for biases, and (2) the potential evapotranspiration is derived from temperature only. Different methods are used to simulate discharges for the future climate: one is based on the direct model output of the future climate run (direct approach), while the other is based on perturbation of the present-day HadRM3H time series (delta approach). Both methods predict a similar response in the mean annual discharge, an increase of 30% in winter and a decrease of 40% in summer. However, predictions of extreme flows differ significantly, with increases of 10% in flows with a return period of 100 years in the direct approach and approximately 30% in the delta approach. A bootstrap method is used to estimate the uncertainties related to the sample size (number of years simulated) in predicting changes in extreme flows.\n                    </jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Many regard metabolism as one of the central phenomena (or criteria) of life. Yet, the earliest infrabiological systems may have been devoid of metabolism: such systems would have been extreme heterotrophs. We do not know what level of complexity is attainable for chemical systems without enzymatic aid. Lack of template-instructed enzymatic catalysis may put a ceiling on complexity owing to inevitable spontaneous decay and wear and tear of chemodynamical machines. Views on the origin of metabolism critically depend on the assumptions concerning the sites of synthesis and consumption of organic compounds. If these sites are different, non-enzymatic origin of autotrophy is excluded. Whether autotrophy is secondary or not, it seems that protocell boundaries may have become more selective with time, concurrent with the enzymatization of the metabolic network. Primary heterotrophy and autotrophy imply pathway innovation and retention, respectively. The idea of metabolism–membrane coevolution leads to a scenario of progressive sequestration of the emerging living system from its exterior milieu. Comparative data on current protein enzymes may shed some light on such a primeval process by analogy, since two main ideas about enzymatization (the retroevolution and the patchwork scenarios) may not necessarily be mutually exclusive and the earliest enzymatic system may have used ribozymes rather than proteins.</jats:p>",

A possible realization of such a situation is when pairing into the bosonic entities occurs via resonant scattering of itinerant fermionic particles. Examples for that are the ultracold fermionic gases in optical traps and lattices, the correlated electronic systems and strongly coupled electron-phonon systems, such as seen in the high T<jats:sub>c</jats:sub> cuprates. We demonstrate the occurrence of a quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a phase uncorrelated boson liquid state in such systems, which is controlled by the competing effects of long and short range phase correlations of the constituents of composite quasi-particles. </jats:p>",

A comparison of the simulated baseline results with observations shows that PRECIS can well simulate the local distribution characteristics of maximum and minimum temperature and diurnal temperature range over China. Analyses of the simulated results in 2080s under SRES B2 scenario relative to the baseline show that there would be an overall increasing trend in the maximum and minimum temperatures in annual, winter and summer over China and the warming amplitude in the north of China is projected to be greater than in the south. There would be an increasing trend of extreme hot temperature occurring in summer in Northeast China and a decreasing trend of extreme cold disaster occurring in winter in North China. The changes in the annual diurnal temperature range in 2080s under SRES B2 scenario relative to the baseline are projected to decrease trend in the north of China and increase in the south of China. In winter diurnal temperature range would increase in the southern region of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, decrease in East China, Northwest China and the middle of Inner Mongolia. In particular, a stronger low value center is projected to exist in the north of the Tibetan Plateau.</jats:p>",

Although the classical view of a living protocell assumes that it includes information-carrying molecules as an essential ingredient, a dividing cell-like structure can be built from a metabolism–container coupled system only. An example of such a system, modelled with dissipative particle dynamics, is presented here. This article demonstrates how a simple coupling between a precursor molecule and surfactant molecules forming micelles can experience a growth-division cycle in a predictable manner, and analyses the influence of crucial parameters on this replication cycle. Implications of these results for origins of cellular life and living technology are outlined.</jats:p>",
