The international diffusion of planning ideas is defined as borrowing and imposition at national and local levels. In the case of Turkey, these experiences are viewed within the context of modernization and westernization. The most significant arena of this process took place in Istanbul. The process of adaptation began in the second half of the nineteenth century with the Tanzimat reforms and developed parallel to the degree of influence the United States and Europe had on the changes in the political regime and identity of the country in the wake of the two world wars. The financial support of the United States and World Bank investments sped up this process. A European Union harmonization process is now under way. The objective of this study is to relate the Turkish experience of international diffusion of planning ideas and evaluate the contribution of Istanbul's spatial formation. </jats:p>",

It argues that Sofia's planning has been persistently shaped by two perennial dilemmas—how to reconnect the city with nature and how to define its relationship with the region. In response to these dilemmas, different visions, shaped by both local conditions and dominant foreign theories, were proposed at different times. Some promoted a compact city, while others advocated a dispersed form. The case of Sofia demonstrates the significance of the city-nature and the city-region relationships in the evolution of planning thought. It also points to the difficulties that arise when local ideas of how to organize these relationships are inspired by international models made for cities with different historic experiences. </jats:p>",

Between 1885 and 1920, W. J. Murphy, Moses Sherman, Dwight Heard, and Benjamin Fowler used their connections to outside investors and federal politicians to advance the small city's promise and to individually profit from its growth. Political initiatives, such as establishing a reform-style government, commissioning a “City Beautiful” plan, and creating a plan commission, were outcomes of the city's early development that flowed directly from the actions of several business leaders. The case of Phoenix underscores how planning reflected the interests of a narrow segment of the political and economic interests of the city. </jats:p>",

This review considers existing evidence regarding the relationship between provision of quality affordable housing and benefits to the larger community. Evidence is considered in the areas of health and education. Given the high level of public concern with these two issues, evidence of benefits could be especially potent in public discussions of affordable housing. Future research is proposed in each area. </jats:p>",

The study is based on the data compiled in 2004, covering 645 public hospitals run by the Ministry of Health (MoH) as the main provider of primary and secondary health services in Turkey. The public hospitals, currently financed by a mixture of funds allocated from the general budget and individually operated revolving funds, need urgent solutions to their financial problems as a part of an ongoing national reform effort. The analysis adopts the Chi‐Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) decision tree algorithm, as one of the most efficient and up‐to‐date data mining method used for segmentation.</jats:p><jats:p>The study has found that the public hospitals could be categorized by the CHAID into 12 different profiles in terms of their financial performance. These profiles have guided us in determining the key financial indicators to be focused upon in the public hospitals and present best practices to improve their respective financial performances. The findings have also allowed policy suggestions as to the financial strategies that may be considered in improving the financial performance of the public hospitals toward a successful health sector reform in Turkey.

The recent literature stresses the importance of going beyond the mere financial and/or technical dimensions of the analysis. Consequently, the paper proposes an example of e‐health project evaluation aiming to develop measures which get close to the notion of benefits to the different stakeholders involved: top management, patients, local community. The case study refers to an Italian health care organization that implemented a project of digitalization of its clinical reports production few years ago. Based on on‐field research, different approaches are used to assess costs and benefits from different stakeholders' perspectives. The results of a multidimensional evaluation are reported to emphasize the need for different measures to assess the sustainability of an e‐health project according to the financial convenience, the social role of the organization, and the contingent situation.

An evaluation scheme is presented in this paper which can be used to assess groundwater vulnerability according to the requirements of the European Water Framework Directive (WFD). The evaluation scheme results in a groundwater vulnerability map identifying areas of high, medium and low vulnerability, as necessary for the measurement planning of the WFD. The evaluation scheme is based on the definition of the vulnerability of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It considers exposure, sensitivity and the adaptive capacity of the region. The adaptive capacity is evaluated in an actors' platform, which was constituted for the region in the PartizipA (\"Participative modelling, Actor and Ecosystem Analysis in Regions with Intensive Agriculture\") project. As a result of the vulnerability assessment, 21% of the catchment area was classified as being highly vulnerable, whereas 73% has medium vulnerability and 6% has low vulnerability. Thus, a groundwater vulnerability assessment approach is presented, which can be used in practice on a catchment scale for the WFD measurement planning.\n                        </jats:p>"

Nonetheless, standards are emerging for property owners and building managers to assess their sites and facilities’ risk level/vulnerability to a possible terrorist attack.

A reduction of these deposits cannot be achieved by means of technical solutions, but only through a change in agricultural practice in a river catchment area. To stimulate and support such a change in behaviour should be the aim of a regionally adapted river area management.&#x0D;\nIn order to minimize the costs that would be caused by the organization of such a river area management, a methodical approach is developed in this work which distributes the competences for political influence efficiently in a river catchment area. Efficiency means in this context that measures for the control of diffuse pollution can be implemented with a possibly low sum of transaction and production costs.&#x0D;\nThis methodical approach is applied in the catchment area of the river Ems. In this area homogeneous groups of neighbouring municipalities are created with the aid of a geographic information system in which measures for the control or the reduction of diffuse nutrient deposits could be carried out more efficiently than is possible within the counties in which the municipalities are presently united.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>This work presents the mathematical method to design complex trajectories for three-dimensional (3D) wells using spline in tension as coordinate functions. 3D spline-in-tension trajectories are obtained for various end conditions: free end, set end, free inclination/set azimuth, and set inclination/free azimuth. The resulting trajectories are smooth continuous functions which better suit the expected performance of modern rotary steerable deviation tools, in particular, point-the-bit and push-the-bit systems. A continuous and gradual change in path curvature and tool face results in the smoothest trajectory for 3D wells, which, in turn, results in lower torque, drag, and equipment wear. The degree of freedom and the associated parameters of the 3D curves express the commitment between the average curvature to the final length of the path that can be adjusted to fit the design requirements and to optimize the trajectory. Several numerical examples illustrate the various end conditions. This paper also presents the full mathematical expressions for the 3D path for four end conditions. The method is directly applicable to the well planning cycle as well as to automatic and manual hole steering’s. Spline-in-tension functions differ from the cubic functions in the extent that an additional parameter, which represent the “tension” of the curve, can be controlled. A totally “relaxed” curve is identical to a cubic curve, and as the tension increases a shorter curve length is obtained with a consequent effect in the curvature profile along the curve. In the limit, as the tension increases to infinite, the spline-in-tension approaches to a straight line. The tension offers an additional degree of freedom, which can be used to further optimize the final trajectory. The 3D spline-in-tension model provides the most versatile model to plan a 3D well trajectory to date. Suitable manipulation of the curve parameters, namely, L0, L1, and the three tensions, allows to give to the planned trajectory any desired behavior.</jats:p>",

Previous applications related to nursing care planning usually organize client information around a medical diagnosis. The approach described is focused around the reason for nursing care and a holistic nursing view of the client, rather than a disease model. Students use a software program to cluster and sort assessment data to identify client problems and describe relationships between the problems. This results in a nonlinear “picture” of the client that can be used for nursing care planning. The process is dynamic and flexible, prompting students to identify gaps in information, consider salience, and understand the complexity of the particular client situation. It teaches critical thinking skills and nursing theory, develops competence with technology, and fosters effective interchange between faculty and students. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;h4&gt;AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;P&gt;Received: December 22, 2004&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Accepted: January 20, 2006&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ms. Taylor is Professor and Dr. Wros is Associate Dean and Professor, Linfield Good Samaritan School of Nursing, Linfield College, Portland, Oregon.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Address correspondence to Jana Taylor, MS, RN, HNC, Professor, Linfield Good Samaritan School of Nursing, Linfield College, Portland, OR 97210-2932; e-mail: &lt;a href=\"mailto:jataylor@linfield.edu\"&gt;jataylor@linfield.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;</jats:p>",

Empirical models for the number of children born to women were estimated using Poisson and ordinal regressions. The results show the importance of variables such as maternal education for smaller family size, and that variables reflecting desired family size are strong predictors of the numbers of children born to women. Secondly, binary logistic models for dichotomous variables for women not wanting more children and if getting pregnant would be a ‘big problem’ showed non-linear effects of the surviving and ‘ideal’ number of children. Moreover, the results indicated a desire on the part of women to limit family size, especially as the number of surviving children increased. Probit models were estimated to address potential endogeneity of certain variables. Overall, the results indicated that counselling couples about small family size and increasing the utilization of health care services can lower fertility in Ethiopia.</jats:p>",

It is important to manage the risks for corporate integrity as a business continuity threat. Lapses in business and organisational ethics, scandals and changes in legal requirements create an opportunity for organisational communication scholars to utilise their skills and tools to ascertain the underlying organisational integrity and the nature of communication ethics in organisations. This paper advances a new interdisciplinary model for the assessment of indicators of organisational integrity in both public and internal organisational communication. The Communication Indicators of Organisational Integrity Model is proposed as a conceptual framework for the investigation of ethical organisational communication and communication as an indicator of the ethics of organisations. The model is a research approach that provides description, analysis, illumination and critiques of communication to reveal integrity and ethics in the organisation. When combined with other valid and reliable measures, these indicators should provide a key insight into an organisation’s ethical nature and integrity characteristics.</jats:p>"

The tsunami brought computer databases into the world of forensic identification and led to major involvement from four private-sector companies from Canada, France, Denmark and Norway. Between them, the firms created a system to improve the handling of missing persons’ calls; an automated fingerprint identification system; a system to generate possible matches between pre and post-death data; and a state-of-the-art morgue in Phuket, Thailand. In the past, there has been private-sector involvement in mass death incidents — for example, most funerals are conducted by private firms — but the tsunami marked a major shift to a public-private partnership in an area that has generally been limited to police and forensic scientists.</jats:p>"

Questions on religion are now often included in censuses and surveys. It does not follow from the perceived importance of the topic, however, that these questions yield useful data. The difficulties and limitations of using survey responses on religion, and the purposes that such information might nevertheless serve, are examined in this paper. The effects of religion may relate either to religious identity or to the degree of religious commitment (religiosity). Neither of these characteristics is easy to measure. The potential importance of religion means that demand for data on the topic is unlikely to disappear, however. Religion can affect age at marriage, marital stability, attitudes to family planning and desired family size, health and morbidity, and propensity to move, that is, fertility, mortality, and migration, the main topics of formal demography. It can also be relevant in various areas of applied population studies, including education, economic activity, social equality, crime, alcohol use, social attitudes, and social capital, making it a factor in public-policy debates. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">Critical national infrastructures (CNIs) — defined as any public or private infrastructure whose operation is essential for a country’s security and functioning, including such fundamental sectors as healthcare, economy, energy, transport, communication systems, law enforcement, defence and, in general, public administration — can be affected by a variety of events that can jeopardise their efficiency both directly and indirectly. CNIs increasingly rely on critical information infrastructures (CIIs), such as telecommunications. These networks must guarantee operational viability when critical events occur, as well as under normal working conditions. In some circumstances, critical events can affect not only the CNIs, but also their telecommunication infrastructures. Such failures are not necessarily caused by external events. To guarantee their correct and continuous operation, security aspects of CIIs must therefore be the focus of particular care. Guarantees on the effectiveness and correctness of the security measures deployed in the CII can be obtained through certification. This paper analyses the role of system/product security certification in this context. In particular, the paper describes the certification approach recommended by the Italian national certification body (Organismo di Certificazione della Sicurezza Informatica) to achieve the maximum benefit from the process, in terms of both efficiency and security.</jats:p>"

The strategy to complete the census database with records informed by the quality assurance procedures largely worked and should be maintained. Published census output and population estimates for England and Wales and for subnational areas contain significant uncertainty which is likely to remain for this and future decades. Both the estimates and the remaining uncertainty should be measured more precisely. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p xml:lang=\"en\">BT is a global business with operations in over 170 countries, has an annual turnover of £19.5bn and operates, like its customers, in the digital networked economy. This economy is one of globalisation, outsourcing, mergers and acquisitions, of increasing governance and compliance, and of course, of technological advances, mobility and information and communication technology (ICT). It is an economy that requires companies to reappraise almost every aspect of what they do and how they do it. Companies must assess the risks they face and their plans for ensuring the security and continuity of their business and its operations. Customers, shareholders, suppliers, regulators and other key stakeholders all have expectations that must be met constantly, not just when things are going well. For these and other reasons, BT decided to re-examine its approach to resilience and to ensure its fitness for purpose in the 21st century. The company wanted to make certain it was doing everything possible to protect its own business, defend its networks against attack, support its customers and discharge its responsibilities under the UK Civil Contingencies Act 2004. This paper explores BT’s decision in more detail and outlines the resulting strategy.</jats:p>"

In addition to shrinking regions which determine the spatial planning policy debate at present, structurally strong regions still exist even today that are characterised by population growth. This also includes the Bonn region. Prognoses show that its population growth will continue also in the future in contrast to numerous other cities and regions in North Rhine-Westphalia.&#x0D;\nIn the article the results of a study on migration flows and migration motives in this growing region are presented. One aim is to demonstrate to what extent social changes have impacts on migration decisions in the framework of demographic change. The results show that migration decisions of the older generation are increasingly characterised by a prospective look towards old age and that the ageing of society has impacts on housing location decisions and on the housing market already today. Furthermore new household forms which develop as a result of the plurality of lifestyles are leading to changed housing requirements. At the same time changed mobility demands are reflected in the selection criteria for the housing location. Finally the creation of ownership also reflects the aspect that one is living in a growing region.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

It was found that the state dept of health provided leadership in making the emergency plans, but not in implementation. Local departments of health appeared to have very little responsibility in emergency planning. Although every agency had a plan, when it came to implementation there was lack of coordination and breakdown in communication at all government levels. Recommendations for future policy include: 1) early evacuation of special needs patients; 2) improved training of staff to include practice drills; 3) improve communication systems; and, 4) increased funding of state and local departments of health to provide training. </jats:p>",

Sparsely settled areas with a new quality in the enlarged area of the Federal Republic of Germany and patterns of depopulation in the course of demographic change as well as an affinity to the urbanity of the knowledge economy are reinforcing unequal spatial development. This puts the traditional treatment of areas with low dynamics or sparse settlement massively into question and calls for a re-examination of expectations of justice.&#x0D;\nA re-interpretation of “equivalent living conditions” must allow a treatment of more strongly differentiated conditions, which promises sustainable functioning spatial structures. The promise of appropriate working and living conditions for everyone where he is growing up must be substituted by his enablement to lead a life in keeping with the times, possibly elsewhere (equality of chances). For a participation in working life adapted activities must also promoted in areas with low dynamics or sparse settlement.&#x0D;\nInstead of redistribution a self-responsible enablement is more strongly emphasised, but not as a relinquishment of common development and responsibility. Challenges and tasks (basic conditions/approaches) aim at an “infrastructure of enablement”, as far as feasible spatial roles, comprehensive communication, orientation (education) and co-operation are concerned.&#x0D;\nThe article advocates a reality-oriented and insofar future-oriented treatment of unequal living conditions instead of normative invocations. In view of a fundamentally more strongly segregating spatial structure, the tendentially uninhabited areas should remain less a taboo than be an incitement for new differentiation-, co-operation- or cohesion concepts, in order to meet also the fiction of “catching up in development” or factual “passive redevelopment”.&#x0D;\n</jats:p>"

A range of measures of the complex and, at times, conflicting supply-side policies are incorporated into models of retail market values. The models are estimated using data for a cross-section of British cities and cover the period from 1998 to 2003. The results show that planning policy intervention has a more pronounced impact on the investor market than the user market. It seems that a proactive policy environment, with a strong emphasis on towncentre management and improvements to the shopping environment, will exert a significant influence on retail capital values and yields. These factors are less likely to impact on the rents paid by retailers who appear to be more concerned with representation across major markets and are less sensitive to differences in local policy stance. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In the context of spatial regression analysis, several methods can be used to control for the statistical effects of spatial dependencies among observations. Maximum likelihood or Bayesian approaches account for spatial dependencies in a parametric framework, whereas recent spatial filtering approaches focus on nonparametrically removing spatial autocorrelation. In this paper we propose a semiparametric spatial filtering approach that allows researchers to deal explicitly with (a) spatially lagged autoregressive models and (b) simultaneous autoregressive spatial models. As in one non-parametric spatial filtering approach, a specific subset of eigenvectors from a transformed spatial link matrix is used to capture dependencies among the disturbances of a spatial regression model. However, the optimal subset in the proposed filtering model is identified more intuitively by an objective function that minimizes spatial autocorrelation rather than maximizes a model fit. The proposed objective function has the advantage that it leads to a robust and smaller subset of selected eigenvectors. An application of the proposed eigenvector spatial filtering approach, which uses a cancer mortality dataset for the 508 US State Economic Areas, demonstrates its feasibility, flexibility, and simplicity. </jats:p>",

Additionally, the considered propagation model includes both distance loss and log‐normal shadowing effects. First we suggest analytical methods to derive the whole distribution function (d.f.) of other‐cell interference, followed by corresponding log‐normal approximation introduced and validated to simplify the computation. An iterative method for solving fixed‐point equations is employed to determine both d.f. and the mean and variance for log‐normal approximation of the other‐cell interference. Finally, one important application of the derived distribution of other‐cell interference, the calculation of outage probability, is demonstrated.

However, only a limited literature to date has focused on the implications of climate change for specific protected areas jurisdictions (i.e., national and/or provincial/territorial parks systems). This paper provides an overview of the potential impacts of climate change on Canada's system of boreal protected areas, highlighting the cross-jurisdictional policy, planning and management sensitivities in this biome. Results of a nation-wide climate change survey with protected area organizations are also presented, which reveal a strong incongruity between the perceived salience of climate change for protected area policy and management and a lack of available resources to provide capacity to deal with the challenge of climate change adaptation. To safeguard against the limitations of traditional protected areas system planning, and to ensure the persistence of boreal ecodiversity over the 21<jats:sup>st</jats:sup> century and beyond, we call for more rigorous and practical discussion by Canadian protected areas agencies and organizations on the issue of climate change and for a collective and proactive management response.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Cell adjustment involves the random perturbation of tabular counts by statistical agencies, prior to publication, in order to minimise the risks of disclosing confidential information about individual survey respondents. A variety of cell adjustment regimes have been applied to past and present census outputs. For each a method of estimating the confidence interval associated with the aggregation of potentially perturbed counts is presented. In this paper I also investigate the impact that alternative cell adjustment regimes have on a variety of standard user analyses—ranging from the summation of cell counts through to the ranking of areas and the fitting of multivariate regression models—including, in addition, the effects of geographical aggregation. The conclusion of the paper is that the choice recently offered to UK census users between the current methods of cell adjustment adopted in New Zealand and those adopted in Australia is finely balanced and analysis specific. What is clear is that both methods have a significant adverse impact on a range of analyses—in particular, the ranking of areas. In consequence, a case is advanced for abandoning cell adjustment, or, at the very least, for publishing independently adjusted counts for all table marginals. Finally, advice is offered to users on minimising the impact of cell adjustment on their analyses. </jats:p>",

Nevertheless, these large‐scale patterns need to be supplemented with information from local studies that can identify specific problems and determine how the land can be divided between conservation and development interests. I analyzed biodiversity patterns at three different scales to show how various scales of research contributed to conservation planning. A gap analysis for all of sub‐Saharan Africa revealed that the network of wildlife reserves provides insufficient protection of narrowly endemic and threatened species, mainly because such species are aggregated in certain areas with dense human populations. A more fine‐grained analysis of the distribution of forest birds of eastern Africa generally confirmed the results obtained with coarse‐scale data and added precision by identifying forest tracts where conservation actions should be concentrated. Detailed local distribution data for one of the prioritized areas, the Uluguru Mountains in Tanzania, suggest that the actions to halt the loss of biodiversity should be concentrated in the submontane zone, immediately adjacent to densely populated areas. To achieve conservation on the ground, these general planning tools must be supplemented with other kinds of research concerning land‐use and local knowledge and with approaches that promote more sustainable development. Different types of institutions will be needed for these different tasks, but it is essential that researchers maintain a dialogue with planners in this area</jats:italic>.</jats:p>",

The main purpose of this paper is to provide a methodology to enable planners to undertake such analyses. We illustrate a case study of seismic risk‐benefit analysis for the city of Taipei, Taiwan, using available land use maps and surveys as well as a new tool developed by the National Science Council in Taiwan—the HAZ‐Taiwan earthquake loss estimation system. We use three hypothetical earthquakes to estimate casualties and total and annualised direct economic losses, and to show their spatial distribution. We also characterise the distribution of vulnerability over the study area using cluster analysis. A risk‐benefit ratio is calculated to express the levels of seismic risk attached to alternative land use plans. This paper suggests ways to perform earthquake risk evaluations and the authors intend to assist city planners to evaluate the appropriateness of their planning decisions.</jats:p>",

Of the few theoretical concepts which are used to try to explain the negative sides of clustering, that is, the decline of old industrial areas, evolutionary regional economics, in general, and the lock-in concept, in particular, are promising ones. Lock-ins have been furthest developed by Grabher in his study on the steel and coal-mining complex in the Ruhr Area, Germany. They can be considered as thick interfirm, institutional, and cognitive tissues aimed at preserving existing industrial structures and therefore unnecessarily slowing down industrial renewal. It is particularly in regions with political lock-ins in which the legacy of manufacturing endures. On the basis of a study on the restructuring of the textile industry in Westmünsterland in Germany, in this paper I analyse whether these kinds of lock-ins can also be observed in regions with strong concentrations of the textile industry, an industry that strongly differs from the above-mentioned steel and coal-mining complex. I show that the impact of lock-ins can be regarded as relatively weak in the textile region of Westmünsterland. Partly because of that, industrial renewal has been relatively successful, which in turn has kept lock-ins weak. </jats:p>",

A primary goal of the project was to increase the relevance and accessibility of this information for policy-makers and development program planners through its compilation and harmonization within a cartographic format. Understanding the many dimensions of a nation's rural economy is critical to policy-makers and program planners as they develop strategies to transform the rural economy in order to sustainably reduce rural poverty and accelerate broad economic growth. In many countries, there is a wealth of valuable and spatially explicit information that could enlarge and deepen such an understanding. However, this is often difficult to use because it is fragmented, found in many different formats, presented at different levels of aggregation, and held by agencies with different access policies and procedures. Several aspects of a statistical atlas of this nature recommend it as a model for initiating transformations in poor-access and fragmented information environments that characterize many developing countries. This article describes these characteristics, as well as the challenges that face those implementing such projects, and seeks to relate information projects of this nature to the broader importance of information access for guiding rural development policy and strategy formulation. </jats:p>",

This exploratory study required students in New Zealand and the Peoples' Republic of China to draw maps of potential trips to the south‐west of the USA in order to assess to what degree differences might exist as to (i) preferred places to visit; (ii) durations of stay; (iii) speeds of dispersion and concentration at the points of embarkation and disembarkation (in this instance Los Angeles); and (iv) total distances travelled. Differences were indeed found, and ethnicity appeared to be the main explanatory variable for the differences. Chinese students were found to travel slightly less, not to become so dispersed overall, but were also found to have higher rates of dispersion and slower rates of concentration at the commencement and at the end of the trip. The itineraries also suggest a further triangular pattern of travel that can be added to the categories identified by Oppermann. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

Further, audit program planning judgments were significantly affected by both the agency and the resource dependence variables. Finally, exploratory analysis indicates that when the board was stronger on both the agency and resource dependence dimensions, control risk assessments were the lowest and auditors decreased planned audit effort, while audit effort was increased for all other conditions.</jats:p>",

Previous studies have shown that axillary radiotherapy improves regional control. There is little published work on technique. Technique standardization is important in quality assurance and comparison of results especially for trials. Our technique, planned with CT assistance, is presented. To assess efficacy, an audit of patients treated in our institution over a 15‐month period was conducted. Of 24 patients treated, 13 were treated with radical intent, 11 with this technique. With a follow up of over 2 years, the technique had more than a 90% (10/11) regional control in this radical group. Both of the radical patients who were not treated according to the technique had regional failure. One case of late toxicity was found, of asymptomatic lymphoedema in a radically treated patient. This technique for axillary radiotherapy for regional control of skin cancer is acceptable in terms of disease control and toxicity as validated by audit at 2 years.</jats:p>",

We based our review on government documents, semi‐structured interviews with participants involved in this land‐use planning process, and our involvement with the issue from 1990 through 2002. Conservation biology had a major influence on the outcome of the land‐use planning process for this moraine. The landform was identified as an area of value by the environmental movement within the context of a number of ongoing government studies that began in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Conservation biologists and planners in government, the environmental movement, and the private sector carried out work related to conservation biology, including inventories and the development and application of criteria for the delineation of core areas and conservation corridors. Once the political timing was favorable (2001–2002), decision makers linked the science of conservation biology to planning policies and law in Ontario.

To our knowledge this is the first time long, wide conservation corridors on private lands were regulated through land‐use‐planning legislation and led to restrictions on urban development and aggregate resource extraction.</jats:italic> </jats:p>",

This approach constitutes a rigorous methodology for health-impact assessment, providing a quantitative measure of the stability of the region. Contrary to entrenched cultural assumption, affluent suburban counties and impoverished central-city neighborhoods remain strongly linked through a probability-of-contact matrix well indexed by the daily journey to work. The public-health ecology of the New York Metropolitan Region is remarkably unstable, greatly amplifying perturbations through mechanisms analogous to positive feedback in mechanical systems, with the single greatest influence being the percentage of the population living in poverty. Given the New York region's overwhelming dominance of national patterns for the hierarchical diffusion of disease and disorder this result has significant policy implication. More explicitly, lowering the rate of poverty in and near New York City would markedly reduce the vulnerability of the United States to emerging infection. </jats:p>",

The huge difficulties inherent in estimating simply the population's human geography, let alone its characteristics, are discussed, and I conclude that current estimates may now be as close as they will ever be to a true estimate of the population—but are in places very unreliable. The slightly haphazard way in which the United Kingdom finally arrived at its 2001 population estimates, by the latter half of 2004, is commented upon. The UK population was reported to have passed the 60 million mark twice: once in 2001 and then again in 2004. With such national uncertainty, confidence in local population estimates is obviously low. This uncertainty also raises issues over the practicality of recent attempts to estimate the size of the supposed illegal population living in the United Kingdom, even before any moral objections are raised over attempts to count those whose existence here is deemed to be illegal. An uncertainty principle is introduced whereby, as the population becomes more mobile, observation becomes ever more unreliable. I end the paper by discussing the implications of changing human geography for its enumeration with a suggestion for a revision to the census form in 2011 to allow us to count better in the future. I conclude that comparisons with administrative records are not a panacea for estimating the population of the United Kingdom. Instead, further checks within the census process are suggested for the future. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Microdata released for public use, such as the Samples of Anonymised Records, Labour Force Survey data, and longitudinal data, such as the Millennium Cohort Study, are subject to statistical disclosure procedures. These measures include data swapping, recoding, postrandomisation, and suppression. Considerable research has been conducted into the extent to which such measures protect respondent anonymity. However, the impact the measures have on the utility of the data is a neglected area of research. In this case study we examine the impact of standard statistical disclosure control measures on the utility of a sample census microdata set. We consulted data users about the impact of the variable recoding on the usefulness of the data and repeated published analyses on a file that had been subjected to perturbative disclosure control measures. It was found that disclosure control measures had a significant impact on the usability of the data (analytical completeness) and on the accuracy of the data in relation to the findings reached when the data were used in analyses (analytical validity). The findings should be of interest to those involved in statistical disclosure control and to data users themselves. Although further research is required in this area, we conclude that data quality assessment should be a central part of disclosure control practice and that universal standards for the relationship between disclosure control and data utility should be developed. </jats:p>",

These malls, whose impact on urban development is significant and varied, tend to be promoted and built by the private sector, which is restructured within the context of the globalization of economies. The aim of this article is to use the comparison of two cases, Mexico and Bogotá, to analyze the place of this phenomenon in contemporary urban planning.</jats:p>"

The voting and IUA methods were used by three working groups, the aim in using these methods being to support the working groups in formulating their decision proposals for Metsähallitus. Ordinal preference information was collected by using the voting methods, whereas the IUA method defined the participants’ preferences by using the interval scale. In all the three working groups, four out of seven alternatives shared the first place in ranking when applying the voting methods, and one alternative was priorized over the other alternatives when using the IUA method. The stakeholders’ feedback indicated that the methods used were not too difficult to use and understand. The IUA method was especially efficient in promoting the participants’ learning process, which as a consequence made formulation of the decision proposal easier for them. It was also noticed that the standard versions of the voting methods do not necessarily fulfill the needs of decision support in strategic natural resource planning as such. Instead, complementary use with more profound methods (e.g., IUA) may be needed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>SoftPM is a toolkit that supports a process‐based approach to software project management. It relies upon a software process modeling method based upon the idea of an Organization‐Entity to define standard processes and model project processes. The Process‐Agent is the core of this modeling method and is a well‐defined unit whose role is to encapsulate an Organization‐Entity's knowledge, skill etc. The Process‐Agent's infrastructure comprises descriptive knowledge, process knowledge and an experience library. The process knowledge is represented by process steps, whose execution determines the behaviors of the Process‐Agent. This causes Process‐Agent knowledge to be precisely described and well organized. In this paper, Little‐JIL, a well‐known process modeling language, is used to define a Process‐Agent's process knowledge. Benefits for process element knowledge representation arising from Little‐JIL's simplicity, semantic richness, expressiveness, formal and precise yet graphical syntax etc., are described. The article also demonstrates how this knowledge can be useful in supporting project planning activities, such as time estimation. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Bends in roads are known to cause road-traffic crashes, but do areas with many road bends have more collisions than areas with straighter roads? A geographical information system was used to generate indicators of average road curvature from a road-network dataset of England and Wales at the local-authority district level. The indicators were the number of bends per kilometre, the ratio of road distance to straight distance, the proportion of road lengths that were straight, the cumulative angle turned per kilometre and the mean angle of each bend. Generally the five measures were associated. Road curvature was highest on minor roads and least on major roads, and metropolitan districts had straighter road networks than nonmetropolitan districts. Counts of the number of road-traffic crashes resulting in fatalities, serious injuries, and slight injuries in each district were obtained from police ‘Stats 19’ records. The association between each of the curvature measures and the number of fatal, serious, and slight collisions in each district was determined by negative binomial regression analysis. Collision numbers were negatively related to road curvature after adjusting for other risk factors, so districts with straighter roads had more crashes. The cumulative angle was the curvature measure most strongly related to fatal road crashes. An increase of 1° per km was associated with approximately a 0.5% reduction in crashes, enough to explain more than a two fold difference in collision rates over the range of the data. Separate analysis of crashes on major roads, ‘B’ class roads, and minor roads confirmed the conclusion. Although individual road bends may be hazardous, these results suggest that road curvature at the district scale is protective. </jats:p>",

The student-directed summary of performance (SD-SOP) provides an opportunity for students to become engaged in their transition planning process. Special educators can use the SD-SOP to increase the awareness of students regarding their disability, provide a means for students to understand the results of transition assessment data, and obtain useful supports.

The goals of this project were 1) to identify whether state mental health preparedness was included in state public health and emergency management preparedness plans, 2) to document barriers to entry and strategies reportedly used by state authorities in efforts to incorporate reasonable mental health preparedness into existing public health and emergency management preparedness planning, 3) to employ a theory for organizational change to organize and synthesize this information, and 4) to stimulate further discussion and research supporting coordinated preparedness efforts at the state level, particularly those inclusive of mental health. To accomplish these goals we 1) counted the number of state public health preparedness and emergency management plans that either included, mentioned, or omitted a mental health preparedness plan; 2) interviewed key officials from nine representative states for their reports on strategies used in seeking greater inclusion of mental health preparedness in public health and emergency management preparedness planning; and 3) synthesized these results to contribute to the national dialogue on coordinating disaster preparedness, particularly with respect to mental health preparedness. We found that 15 out of 29 publicly available public health preparedness plans (52 percent) included mental health preparedness, and eight of 43 publicly available emergency management plans (18 percent) incorporated mental health. Interviewees reported numerous barriers and strategies, which we cataloged according to a well-accepted eight-step plan for transforming organizations.</jats:p>"

Pelvic symptoms and impact were assessed using the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI) and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ). PFDI and PFIQ scores were compared by prolapse stage and history of incontinence or POP surgery. Regression analyses were performed to identify other predictors of symptoms and impact. <jats:italic>Results</jats:italic>: Women were predominantly (90%) Caucasian and had mean age of 61 years. Women with stage II POP, especially those with prior surgery, reported more symptoms and impact than women with more advanced POP. There were no other significant predictors of symptoms or life impact. <jats:italic>Conclusions</jats:italic>: Women planning sacrocolpopexy with stage II prolapse and prior pelvic surgery reported more symptoms and quality of life impact than those with more advanced prolapse.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Cognitive dysfunction commonly occurs even in the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Impairment on frontostriatally based executive tasks is particularly well described but affects only a proportion of early PD patients. Our previous work suggests that a common functional polymorphism (val<jats:sup>158</jats:sup>met) within the catechol<jats:italic>O</jats:italic>-methyltransferase (<jats:italic>COMT</jats:italic>) gene underlies some of this executive heterogeneity. In particular, an increasing number of methionine alleles, resulting in lower enzyme activity, is associated with impaired performance on the “Tower of London” planning task. The main objective of this study was to investigate the underlying neural basis of this genotype–phenotype effect in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We scanned 31 patients with early PD who were homozygous for either valine (val) (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 16) or methionine (met) (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 15) at the COMT val<jats:sup>158</jats:sup>met polymorphism during performance of an executive task comprising both Tower of London (planning) and simple subtracting (“control”) problems. A cross-group comparison between genetic subgroups revealed that response times for planning problems were significantly longer in met compared with val homozygotes, whereas response times for control problems did not differ. Furthermore, imaging data revealed a significant reduction in blood oxygen level-dependent signal across the frontoparietal network involved in planning in met/met compared with val/val patients. Hence, we have demonstrated that COMT genotype impacts on executive function in PD through directly influencing frontoparietal activation. Furthermore, the directionality of the genotype–phenotype effect observed in this study, when interpreted in the context of the existing literature, adds weight to the hypothesis that the relationship between prefrontal function and dopamine levels follows as an inverted U-shaped curve.</jats:p>",
