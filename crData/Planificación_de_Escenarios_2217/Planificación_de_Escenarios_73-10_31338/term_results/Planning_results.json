      "abstract": "<jats:p>The North Sea is one of the world's important commercial fishing areas; yet the introduction in the early 1970's of oil-producing operations into the North Sea has not been hampered by particularly restrictive legislation or critical public opinion. If anything, the public and their governments have welcomed the oil public and their governments have welcomed the oil industry to their respective countries. The happy situation that prevails in the North Sea area has not been achieved without a great deal of effort by the oil companies and the governments; the way in which this effort was organized and directed forms the basis of this article.</jats:p>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Work of the North Sea Offshore Operating Committee</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>While the first plans for offshore oil production were still being drawn up, and the majority of oil fields in the North Sea were in the discovery phase, the industry, through the various North Sea country offshore operating committees, was setting up committees to study the problems associated with oil production in the marine environment. The first work of these committees was to accept the fact - one that is still not accepted universally - that oil spills were possible from the offshore oil fields and to study feasible methods of cleaning up an oil spill. This was done by first reviewing the published data and house reports of the classic oil spills such as that from the Torrey Canyon and the spill in the Santa Barbara Channel. From analysis of these spills it became evident that any plan or method would have to cover a wide range of individual company management structures or be extremely restrictive on any specific company's management. Accordingly, the groups restricted their studies to equipment and methods of cleaning up oil spills and gave only general advice on how individual company plans could be drafted to suit the available jointly owned equipment. All the conventional methods of cleanup were evaluated and it was decided that the only one that could be relied upon to be effective was dispersing the oil with chemical dispersants. (The North Sea groups are striving to develop methods that will pick up oil in the hostile North Sea, and are giving advice to operators and governments regarding improved operating practices that will minimize spillage.) Generally speaking, no mechanical equipment available today can collect or retain oil in seas that exceed 10-ft wave height. Therefore, the present plans of nearly all the North Sea Offshore Operating Committees are based on using oil-dispersing chemicals. The chemicals to be used were selected after consultation with, and on the recommendation of, the national government laboratories who were undertaking large-scale tests of dispersants. On successfully obtaining suitable supplies of approved dispersant, the next step was to decide on methods of application.</jats:p>\n                  <jats:p>P. 1153</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>",

The gravity and maximum entropy models are characterized by operational simplicity and adaptability to disaggregated data; they remain, however, descriptive in nature. The theoretical microeconomic models, on the other hand, have delineated the concepts of competitive equilibrium and Pareto optimality in an aggregate and deterministic way. There has been an implicit need, since the development of maximum entropy models by Wilson, to bridge the gap between the descriptive and the theoretical models. As Wilson himself has asserted: “The models will only become significantly better when they are extended to incorporate a detailed knowledge of preference structures and utility functions …” (Wilson, 1969b).

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Although the pioneering study by Christaller (1933) has produced a flood of publications on central place theory which now extend beyond the limits of a short survey, the fact remains that these publications rest on investigations that are purely static and retrospective. Essentially the publications represent no advance on Christaller's work. They attempt, that is, to describe existing positions and to develop indicators for the identification of central place structures. In doing so these writers adopt, without exception, the concept of “excess function”<jats:sup>(1)</jats:sup> which was already used by Christaller to characterize central places. [A survey of Christaller's ideas can be found in Berry and Pred (1965); see also Beckmann (1968), von Böventer (1969), Gustafsson and Söker (1972), Biermann (1973a) and elsewhere.] None, however, shows how this excess function came into being, or, alternatively, how it can be explained, and whether it exhibits objective spatial stability<jats:sup>(2)</jats:sup>. It is often overlooked, or uncritically accepted, that numerous value judgments and assumptions on the behaviour of consumers are, in addition, contained in this excess function. In other words, the discussions in these publications have no explanatory character. By the same token they contain, strictly speaking, no empirically-based theories; that is, they lack the ‘explanans' that would make it possible to forecast ensuing occurrences and phenomena (Popper, 1959). </jats:p>",

However, if discounting were abandoned, use of the standard cost—benefit-analysis framework would require the forecasting of shadow prices for all future dates, unless an arbitrary time horizon is adopted.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> India depends heavily on foreign experts to formulate its population policy because those domestic political leaders involved in policy making are alienated from the masses—they hold to Western values, lack competence in technical skills, are reluctant to come to grips with urgent social problems, and have given way to pressure from powerful vested interests. National and foreign priorities are closely identified. Policy formulators have sidetracked the fight against the basic social and economic problems of the country and have identified population planning with a birth control that masquerades under the name of family planning. This has been a fundamental and almost fatal mistake. Because of this approach, all attempts at family planning have failed to bring their intended results, and it has not been possible to make a significant dent in India's population problem. A threshold level of social and economic development must be attained before any family planning program can begin to bring about a sustained drop in the birth rate. Family planning should be part of a broadly based integrated plan of social and economic development. This will require changes at the political, administrative, social and economic levels to allow development of suitable plans to effectively and expeditiously implement the social and economic development programs. </jats:p>",

If a developing country is to improve its standard of living, the sudden decrease in death rate resulting from socioeconomic development has to be offset by a proportional decrease in fertility rate. This can be realized only if the population plan is inscribed in and implemented through a total economic plan. Therefore, family planning crash programs, which are started in some countries as a health oriented activity and are supported by advertising campaigns, meet ultimately with limited success. Presently the Egyptian population can be divided into three categories: (a) a rural community inclined to high fertility; (b) an urban community conditioned to low fertility norms; and (c) a transitional society which is ready to but has not yet adopted a small family norm. The economic plan should gear itself toward increasing the size of the last two categories by creating new social and economic situations which conflict with traditional behavior favoring high fertility. The role of population planning in this case will be limited to speeding up this transition. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The sharp decline in the death rate in Turkey after World War II caused a rapid population expansion. In 1965, Turkey had to change its traditional pronatalist policy. The objective of this new policy, specified in the First Five-Year Development Plan, was to counteract the adverse effects of rapid population growth on economic development. The plan envisaged a forceful implementation of its new policy. The subsequent Second and Third Plans, however, placed a lower priority on the control of population growth even though the actual rate of growth was not changed appreciably. The implementation of family planning programs by the government has always been slow and results have lagged far behind both targets set in the plans and public demand. It is encouraging that the public attitude continues to be favorable, in spite of slow government action, and that the level of contraceptive use is increasing. In fact, the small family norm is accepted by the majority of families in Turkey. Knowledge of modern contraception is rapidly being disseminated, though no modern means has yet displaced coitus interruptus as the most frequently used method. The probable reasons for the low priority given to family planning programs by the government are discussed. International agencies and governments which have bilateral agreements with the Turkish government always give a high priority to requests related to family planning. The resources they have provided, however, have not been utilized properly and have had little effect on the projects. Grant and loan giving agencies have recently requested the Turkish government to provide them with a long-range comprehensive program in population control so that they can coordinate their assistance within its broad framework. </jats:p>",

Programs there focus on clearly specified demographic goals and operational targets and are usually given a high status. Several are among the most successfully implemented programs in the world. Good evaluation systems and innovative approaches are among their special characteristics. The programs have some weaknesses in common, however. Among these are inadequate input, failure to reach the hard-to-reach, inability to lower the norm of family size, and failure to encourage the use of some effective means of fertility control such as induced abortion. Some programs are also approaching an important stage of transition: a plateau of acceptance, a changing age structure of the population, and a possibly improved fecundability will, henceforth, make attainment of program goals increasingly difficult. More innovative approaches and dynamic leadership to save programs from the natural process of “aging” will be required in the future. Notwithstanding these weaknesses, the countries in the Pacific have a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world that human fertility may be reduced through planned and organized effort. </jats:p>",

Several variables have been found to be associated with higher rates of maternal and infant mortality: maternal age over 35, parities of over 4, close spacing of births, and unwanted pregnancy. The health objectives of family planning are directed toward avoiding such births. This paper suggests that, at least in countries with high levels of mortality, avoidance of such pregnancies would result in considerably increased infant survival, and in reduction of maternal deaths. In population terms, however, the resultant growth would be more than offset by the simultaneous lowering of the birth rate. The indirect effects of providing family planning care in the health services are discussed in relation to policies aimed at limiting population growth. </jats:p>",

The research described in the third paper, “A residential model: 3.

Throughout the country, the concept that nations and families could help to improve their economic position and the quality of life by avoiding unwanted children was widely accepted. For a number of reasons, Congressional support of family planning is strong even though other economic pressures may reduce foreign aid and domestic health and welfare expenditures. Since family planning is an important element in development programs, successes in this field could encourage continuing U.S. support for overseas assistance in general. </jats:p>",

In the past decade family planning has evolved from a component of corporate philanthropy to a major U.S. government policy. The diffusion of family planning has been aided by its apparent “depoliticization” and “internationalization.” Differences of sex, race, nationality and class between researchers and subjects suggest ethical shortcomings in the clinical investigation of new contraceptive technology. The further diffusion of family planning depends partly on developing more acceptable methods and partly on developing new methods of dissemination. Various public opinion campaigns and incentive schemes designed to increase the acceptance of family planning by the underprivileged represent a move from voluntarism toward coercion. It is unfortunate that the development of the potentially liberating practice of family planning has been accompanied by these exploitative phenomena. </jats:p>",

Differences between the two groups in activity patterns and attitudes to high-rise flats, appearing around the periphery of the central area, were only marginal, but the hard core poor were much more uncertain about the impact of urban renewal on their life styles. It was concluded that problems of adjustment to urban renewal would be considerably greater for the hard core poor, and, as they comprised the older, less well educated segment of the population with fewer family ties, their future welfare could become a government responsibility. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This article describes present attitudes and future prospects of population planning in the People's Republic of China. New knowledge available since China has broadened its contacts with the rest of the world permits the drawing of a fairly detailed picture of the family planning program developed there over the past 18 years. Family planning is an integral part of a national health services system. Integrated with all administrative and production units and including virtually the entire population, this system makes extensive use of “barefoot doctors” selected from local communities as well as a large and growing corps of professional health personnel organized to serve effectively both the cities and the countryside. Family planning is achieved by social and medical methods of fertility control including late marriage, use of contraceptives, abortion, and sterilization. The analysis of reasonably reliable data on family planning in six city, suburban, and rural communes with a total aggregate population of 170,500 located in three parts of the country, shows some startling results. Late marriage has lowered the proportion of married women of child bearing age to 14 per cent. A surprising 68 per cent of these women are practicing birth control, and almost two-thirds (65 per cent) of these are protected definitively by sterilization. The third who are using reversible methods are further protected by the availability of abortion on demand. It may well be that about 35 per cent of all potentially fertile women in China are now practicing family planning. It seems probable that this effective mix of methods can be fairly rapidly extended to cover the whole nation and that it will make enough of a contribution to slowing population growth to have a significant effect on the ability of China to meet its economic and security objectives and to raise its standard of living. </jats:p>",

Strikingly, fertility has declined most rapidly in the rural areas where the family planning program was particularly strong. Total fertility, however, has not declined since 1967–1968, generally because budgetary problems for the family planning program have been severe. The present annual population growth rate is 2.2 per cent and the prospects are bleak that a 1.5 per cent growth rate will be achieved in 1976, a goal made explicit in the government's Third Five-Year Plan. Government planning has not sufficiently recognized that even if age-specific fertility continues to decline, a changing age structure will increase the national growth rate to 1.8 or 1.9 per cent by 1981. The authors reconsider the stated national goal of a 1.5 per cent growth in 1976, concluding that it can only be achieved with increased government commitment to family planning, higher targets, incorporation of abortion into the program, and a great increase in the number of sterilizations. </jats:p>",

As effluents are required to meet increasingly stringent standards, the unit costs associated with adding capacity to existing wastewater treatment systems to renovate some waters for reuse are shown to substantially decrease. A nonlinear elimination algorithm is developed to delineate optimal policies. A model employing the technique was applied to the wastewater treatment system of a typical urban system and the water quality objectives varied. A comparison of costs with and without various levels of reuse were made and unit costs of reused water under these conditions determined.</jats:p>",
