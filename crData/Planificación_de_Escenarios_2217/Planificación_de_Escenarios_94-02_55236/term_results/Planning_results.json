Drawing on a diverse literature, this article describes methods-tools and procedures-that encourage deliberate problemformulation, thereby reducing the chances of such an error occurring. A number of problem formulation methods are described usingfictitious accounts of their application in a planning situation. To put them in context, these descriptions are preceded by a discussion of the occurrence of the Type III error in planning and responses to it, a brief review of the state of knowledge about problemformulation, and an overview of problem formulation methods. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The professional fields of planning and public health both arosefrom the Progressive movement of the early twentieth century. The fields share many common concerns, including air and water pollution, disposal of hazardous waste, the sick building syndrome, and the aging of building stock. Yet despite their common historical origins and mutual concerns, a comparison of articles and book reviews published between 1978 and 1990 in theflagship publications of the two professions-the Journal of the American Planning Association and the American Journal of Public Health-suggests only minor overlaps between the twofields today. Similarly, a review of the linkages between planning departments and schools of public health at eleven U.S. universities that have accredited graduate programs in both fields suggests only limited interactions. It is important that the links be strengthened between planning and public health through a common literature, professional interaction, and increased cross-disciplinary education. </jats:p>",

The method involves drilling dynamic analysis and planning, real-time monitoring, and interpretation and control of tricone bit bouncing, bottomhole assembly (BHA) buckling and lateral vibrations, and stick-slip torsional oscillations, although it is expected that this list will expand as the understanding of drilling dynamics phenomena increases. Several field examples, each resulting in improved drilling performance, illustrate the method. It is recommended that the service industry adopt an integrated approach towards drilling vibration control.</jats:p>",

This agreement did not, of course, prevent minor parties or independent candidates from contesting by-elections, but it did mean that in most by elections there was little chance of the party in possession losing the seat. The incentive to local party activity was thus reduced and it was further limited by the suspension by Act of Parliament of local elections, leaving it to the local parties to replace by nomination councillors who died or retired. The advent of the coalition government further restricted normal party activities in Parliament since there was now no opposition party. Criticism of government actions and proposals was left to individuals or temporary groupings. A further limitation was the suspension of private members’ bills and motions.</jats:p>",

These include pollution control, water quality improvement, flood defence, water resource management, fisheries management, conservation of the natural water environment, promotion of water based recreation and also navigation in some locations. Arising from the multiple use of river systems, their interactions and use requirements, the concept of Catchment Management Planning has been developed. Each river use should have an assigned objective and standard determined in respect of water quality, water quantity and river topography. Catchment Management Plans are prepared in consultation with interested parties. A review of some European river management suggests the size of some rivers and the responsibilities of relevant organisations exacerbates comprehensive and integrated river management.</jats:p>",

Along each path, the cutter is intersected with the individual geometric primitives describing the part. The cutter-part intersection data are then merged using the CSG part description tree, and retained to be accessed during the milling process simulation. Using the stored intersection data and an analytic reformulated mechanistic milling process model, the cutting forces and dimensional accuracy of the parts are simulated before the machining actually takes place. By using an inverse solution for the milling expressions, the feed rate is automatically scheduled to satisfy force, torque, and part dimensional error constraints. The accuracy and efficiency of the milling process simulation model are demonstrated experimentally.</jats:p>",

Methodologically we unify seemingly conflicting demographic and economic frameworks into a single “structural” proximate-cause model as well as controlling statistically for the targeted (nonrandom) placement of family planning program inputs. The results are consistent with both frameworks: 75% of the fertility decline resulted from increased contraceptive use, but was induced primarily through economic development and improved education and economic opportunities for females. Even so, the dramatic impact of the changes in demand-side factors (education and economic development) on contraceptive use was possible only because there already existed a highly responsive contraceptive supply delivery system.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Silicon Valley is the computer and microelectronics capital of America. To analysts from different academic disciplines and ideological persuasions, the economy of Silicon Valley has many faces. In the most romantic characterization, the Valley's astonishing success as home base for a myriad of companies that design, produce, and export computers, workstations, microchips, disk drives, and software is mainly a story about supremely—even belligerently—independent entrepreneurs. According to a second interpretation, the Valley is a full-fledged ‘industrial district’ on the north central Italian model, made up of a dense thicket of mostly small and medium-sized (but also some quite large) ‘flexible specialists’ that alternately cooperate and compete with one another, that are embedded in a local political economy with a shared culture and norms, and that may be well connected to the rest of the world but whose interfirm production relationships are thought to be highly localized. </jats:p><jats:p> There is also a third perspective. Silicon Valley was created by, and remains profoundly dependent on, major multinational corporations and on the fiscal and regulatory support of the national government—especially in the ‘person’ of the US Department of Defense. The Valley is fundamentally a world headquarters of, or at least an important node within, global networks of big firms and their small firm subcontractors and suppliers, and, as such, is subject to the same contradictory tendencies toward concentration of power but decentralization of production that are coming to characterize the entire global market-based economic system. </jats:p><jats:p> The three aspects of Silicon Valley's political economy—rampant entrepreneurship, an unusually high degree of interfirm circulation of engineering labor and other signs that have become associated with district-like behavior, and the visible hand of major corporations and their government—university partners in shaping the region into a base from which to manage operations that are executed beyond the Valley's domain—are in fact not mutually inconsistent. In this paper, however, I argue that the third constitutes the dominant tendency driving the reproduction of this vibrant regional economy, and has done since the years after World War 2. </jats:p>",

In the gentrification literature it is assumed that the influx of the middle class into working-class neighbourhoods disrupts the association between social relations and residential spaces and that this influences class relations. The results of research in a gentrifying London neighbourhood do not support such spatial formalism and, on the basis of social network analysis, suggest an array of sociospatial relations which are not tied to neighbourhood, It is suggested that the involvement in neighbourhood varies temporally (according to stage in the life cycle) and by gender, rather than spatially or by class location. The discussion is concluded with an assessment of the implications of this argument for the gentrification literature in particular and for social geography in general. </jats:p>",

Young's sweeping criticisms of Marxism are powerful, but they loose sight of the value of work which attends to politico-economic processes while problematising the limits of marxism's meta-narrative. Young's writing is limited itself. It introduces work that breaks with Westem-centrism, but, as it does so, it sometimes falls prey to a form of ‘new’ Orientalism that manipulates and represents such work in the interests of ‘the West’, These limits to the book provide an example of anemic geography. This reified and reifying geography fails to deal adequately with the questions of geographical complexity opened up by the displacement of Western History. Instead, it clokes them beneath the use of a geographical vocabulary employed as a vehicle in the metaphorisation of political debate. Alternatives are possible. </jats:p>",

The filtered backprojection dose calculation significantly reduces the computation time for a large number of x‐ray beams compared to a conventional convolution dosimetry method. A factor of 20 reduction in computation time is demonstrated for a 2D implementation of the model. The method has proved useful for speeding up an inverse treatment planning algorithm for conformal radiotherapy, and has the potential to be implemented in the reconstruction hardware of a radiotherapy CT simulator.

In this paper I seek to specify a social location for left—liberal politics among a distinctive cadre of social and cultural professionals, the cultural new class. This cadre also bears a distinct geographical identity, with an overconcentration in the central cities of large metropolitan areas, not least in their gentrifying districts. The part played since 1968 by the cultural new class in these gentrifying districts in redefining the urban politics of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver is examined. In particular, the role of a gentrifying middle class in challenging a postwar hegemony of growth boosterism practised by the conservative regimes in all three cities, and their parallel attempt to sustain an alternative regime of reform politics, are assessed. </jats:p>",

To measure a metaphor, in this paper, a method of moving between the figurative and the literal is used. Development paths for 150 nations are measured for the period 1965–87 by using a methodology that can be described as historical factorial ecology. The measurement of development paths involves analytically combining the social, historical, and geographical dimensions of the development and underdevelopment process, an interpretation of which requires and encourages a combining of the sociological, historical, and geographical imaginations. The findings indicate that the debates within development theory resulted from different theories focusing upon different types of development paths. Development is complexly multidimensional with economic and social development paths resembling the linear and multilinear claims of orthodox modernization theory and with political development paths approximating the antilinear claims of underdevelopment theories. Development and underdevelopment theorists, like the blind wise men encountering the elephant, each described only parts of the beast, assuming that the economic trunk was identical to its political leg. </jats:p>",

It is assumed that this approach will be implemented within the framework of a three level hierarchical CIM architecture that consists of the following levels in the hierarchy: shop floor, workstation and equipment (Joshi et al., 1991). Our approach to CAPP consists of machining feature identification, definition, classification, representation, and reasoning, provided through a CAD model of a product. Geometric entities are identified from a Drawing Exchange Format (DXF) file. The identified entities form the basis for the construction of primitive manufacturing features. The primitive features are assembled together based upon the precedence among features, into a graph, called a feature graph. However, the primitive features may or may not be manufacturable in terms of depth of cut, tool geometry, surface finish, and material handling required. Hence it is necessary to convert the feature graph into a manufacturing task graph, which consists of specifications of alternative functional tasks that are manufacturable. The task graph may be converted into a hierarchical set of process plans, based on the planning criteria at each level in the control hierachy, to reflect the processing requirements at each level. The shop planning function decomposes the task graph into a set of workstation level plans. Each workstation level plan is aggregated into a set of equipment level process plans by the workstation planning function. The equipment level plan is converted into a unique task sequence by the equipment planning function. This sequence is then executed according to specifications by the equipment level execution function. Provision of alternative routes in process plans provides for flexible means of on-line planning and control.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Canada's fringe festivals are important interventions in the discourses and institutions framing Canadian theatre, leading some to recognize them as sites of a radical cultural politics. Most commentators have placed their attention on performance at these events, but in this paper, the focus is on the manner in which these events reorganize urban spaces into festival spaces, constructing informal discursive arenas within which the interaction of patrons, artists, and organizers is encouraged, and which situates performance, display, and the negotiation of social identities within an intersubjective field less influenced by certain constraints in traditional theatre. What is often overlooked, however, is that these discursive arenas are constructed within, at the same time as they engage, the social and spatial organization of the city, and are therefore marked by certain exclusions and inclusions. By refusing to abstract these festivals, as ‘artistic events’, attention can be paid to their ‘topography’, to explore the relations between cultural practice, social identity, and the organization of the city. </jats:p>",

The tension between a financial orientation and a production orientation towards property development is highlighted. During the 1980s, planning and urban policy in Britain promoted the former orientation, but the needs and opportunities of the local economy emphasised the latter. The importance of understanding the specificities of local property-development organisation and relations for the design and evaluation of public policy directed at the property sector is stressed. </jats:p>",

Therefore, an interpretation is provided of, first, the ways in which a range of economic agents within a ‘structure of building provision’ interact with given sets of spatial practices to capitalise an established social space. And, second, the way in which these agents then realign to develop around newly emerging sociospatial relations is examined. The underlying influence of changes in the wider economic ‘setting’ of these agents is highlighted, with particular reference to how their economic calculations are mapped onto social space and the overall consequences of these processes. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Agricultural land-suitability assessment involves the analysis of a large variety and amount of physiographic data. Geographical information systems (GISs) may facilitate suitability assessment in data collection. To generate accurate results from the data, appropriate suitability-assessment methods are required. However, the assessment methods which can currently be used with GISs, such as that developed by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the statistical pattern—classification method, have limitations which may lead to inaccurate assessment. An artificial neural network is an effective tool for pattern analysis. A neural network allows decision rules of greater complexity to be applied in pattern classification. By formulating the land-suitability-assessment problem into a pattern—classification problem, neural networks can be used to achieve results of greater accuracy. In this paper, a neural-network-based method for land-suitability assessment is discussed, and a set of neural networks is described. The integration between the neural networks and a GIS is addressed, and some experimental results are presented and analyzed. </jats:p>",

The second part is to find what are the proper heating and cooling conditions to get the desired plastic strain. The authors investigated the relation between the final form of the plate and the plastic strain or the inherent strain to be applied for the plate bending. For this purpose, the finite-element method (FEM) is employed.

However, some difficulties still remain for proper control of programmable systems, especially at higher speeds. These can be categorized into two groups: trajectory planning and trajectory tracking. Conventional trajectory planning methods are ineffective for general application, especially when velocity and acceleration conditions are included. There are many mathematical functions but polynomials are shown to be the most versatile for trajectory planning; however, these can give curves with unexpected oscillations, commonly called meandering. Tracking of a motion in this situation could engender severe practical problems. In this study, a new interpolation method using polynomials with arbitrary powers is proposed to overcome this disadvantage. </jats:p>",
