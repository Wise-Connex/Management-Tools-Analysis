      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper an attempt is made to discover the sociohistorical meaning, rationality, and limits of urban planning. The paper falls into five major sections. First, some rudimentary criteria are suggested as a basis for identifying the principal tasks of a theory of planning. Second, an attempt is made to situate contemporary urbanization processes within the capitalist mode of production. Third, planning itself is then situated within and derived out of the historical dynamic of capitalist urbanization. Fourth, conventional urban planning theory is criticized. Fifth, some questions of urban policy and political practice are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The paper considers work by Gardner and Ashby on the relationship between the connectivity of large systems and their stability, which suggests that all large complex dynamic systems will have a critical level of connectance beyond which they will go suddenly unstable. Further evidence by May on ecological systems supports this view. Reliability in systems, that is maintenance of stability of critical values over long periods of time, is held by Ashby to flow from such systems not being fully joined or connected. </jats:p><jats:p> It is suggested that these considerations must apply also to attempts to plan and control the future of socioeconomic systems, both in relation to the planned system itself, and to the planning system which tries to invoke requisite variety to control the planned system. Stable systems in planning are thus seen as small, probably subsystemic in nature, not fully-joined, and hence hierarchical in structure. ‘Central’ planning results in instability because of size and complexity of control systems needed, and ‘equality’ is not a sustainable concept, as it requires or implies full connectedness. Finally, three kinds of system situations are put forward as representing gradations of stability and thus of ‘plannability’ or design possibility. These situations tend to show the limits of the plannable. </jats:p>",

For systematic traffic-management measures, such as those of traffic restraint, it is desirable to examine shifts of benefits and costs between different groups of travellers. This requires equilibrium models of two or more types of traveller, each of which responds differently to charges or to travel-time changes. An appropriate technique has been developed to deal with this question, and results are presented in terms of two situations where benefit and cost transfers could arise: The effect of private parking places, and the differential impacts of road pricing. </jats:p>",

Much of the legislation encourages local units of government to introduce water resources planning measures which will be preventive instead of corrective. Extensive public works measures, environmental destruction and the threat to human life can thus be eliminated or reduced. Research has developed and tested a method for identifying the elements of a water resources protection program for small urbanizing watersheds which was technically adequate and socially acceptable to the communities implementing such programs. Research results suggest that deliberate efforts will be necessary to inform and educate local units of government as to the usefulness of the legislation; and that the program must reflect local natural resource conditions and local preferences for the method of accomplishing the protection. Successful implementation could be restrained by inertia of local units of government, a lack of tradition in such programs, and hostile existing agencies.</jats:p>",

However, psychologists know that decisionmaking in real life involves the chooser in complex and difficult conditions. In addition, the methods used to ascertain preferences and needs do not seem to be reliable indicators of what people actually choose. The study to be described, although confirming the problems which beset house buyers when choosing a house, and planners when attempting to decide what people need and prefer, also appears to show that actual purchase behaviour itself is a poor indicator of what people really want. </jats:p>",

The greater complexity of the corporate situation highlights the conceptual inadequacy of the principal components technique for the construction of mental maps, with a simple psychological scaling technique appearing to be conceptually more adequate and equally as effective. But, it is the number of items on which data are collected which emerges as the issue of greatest consequence in this type of study, the suggestion having been made that respondents should not be asked to select more than say nine or ten locations from a list of alternatives. </jats:p><jats:p> The example of a corporate mental map, constructed in the light of the methodological discussion, was shown to have important implications for the spatial learning model proposed by Taylor (1975b), which had been derived from industrial linkage studies. Instead it was suggested that a metric reflecting the organisation of a national space economy into a series of hierarchically arranged and reasonably discrete regional space economies should replace simple euclidean measures of distance (that is, geographic space) within the model. </jats:p>",

All other major planning evolutions – material procurement, plan development, Job order Issues, and work scheduling – are heavily influenced by the degree of accomplishment of these two key elements. Although the completeness of repair requirement identification varies widely with the project, in the case of aircraft carrier overhauls the accurate Identification of all repair requirements is further complicated by the complexity and large number of systems and equipments. This paper presents a method for countering the advene effects of these complications and discusses a procedure for integrating both repair identification and establishment of repair responsibility into the aircraft carrier complex overhaul advance planning process via the Ship Alteration and Repair Package (SARP). In addition, it is shown that the described procedure accommodates established practices in aircraft carrier overhaul planning which have already proven effective and also provides coordination to improve total overhaul performance through improvement in the advance planning process.</jats:p>",

Of these single women, three in five planned to marry shortly and two in five had no marriage plans. The main part of the study concentrates on this latter group. A sample of 50 women was interviewed and the results provide some factual data on their family and educational background, their sexual and contraceptive behaviour and their attitudes to related issues. They came mainly from upper-middle income groups and had a high standard of education. Although they were, almost without exception, born into Roman Catholic families, only just over a quarter were regular church attenders. All but 6% were already sexually experienced at the time of their first visit and most were now involved in a stable sexual relationship which involved having intercourse at least once a month; while well informed on contraception, only a small minority had always used a reliable method. Since the mean interval between first intercourse and their first visit to the clinic was over 2.2 years, the majority had been at risk of becoming pregnant. One in six of those interviewed had experienced pregnancy and half of these had sought an abortion. While 76% of the sample considered abortion acceptable in at least extreme cases, only 12% were without strong moral reservations; in the event of pregnancy 32% would consider seeking an abortion. A correlational analysis of some of the results is presented.</jats:p>",

Some of these problems may have simple remedies; others need much more complex solutions. With a good overall family planning programme, changes at both local and central level can be made within a country to encourage birth spacing and birth limitation methods, and to make them more easily accessible to the great majority of the rural populations.</jats:p>",

Two primary problems in integrating social analysis into planning are examined; making trade‐offs between policy acceptability and theoretical competence, and managing social analysis in planning. For illustration, the article builds on emerging trends within the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. It concludes by observing that creative application of social theory to policy problems along with innovative data gathering techniques are the primary routes to managing these problems.</jats:p>",
