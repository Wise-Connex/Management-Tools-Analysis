      "abstract": "<jats:p> The federal grant strategy found in the Older Americans Comprehensive Services Amendments of 1973 represents a marked departure from earlier strategies of the Older Americans Act. While the national goal of the legislation is more clearly specified and funding has sig nificantly increased, the introduction of new substate plan ning bodies—Area Agencies on Aging—is seen here as the most important change. The new national strategy is geared toward the development of these new agencies, and its success will depend very much on their discharging the functions assigned to them. This paper argues that, because the new legislative strategy is based on a rational goal model and conceptualizes the area agencies accordingly, it neglects certain requisites of organizational life. Using, instead, a social system perspective of the area agencies and their environment, the paper suggests that these agencies will, of necessity, concern themselves with matters other than those mandated in the legislation. These other con cerns will affect both the national objectives which the area agencies choose to emphasize and the intensity of their effort. Specifically, the area agencies may view the mandate to draw-in and mobilize resources at the area level as not in their organizational interests. The paper concludes that: their engaging in this role in tentative fashion will result in either incremental or goal-displaced activities; their em barking in this role wholeheartedly may prove dangerous to them organizationally and may result in substantial mod ifications in the national strategy and their role in it. </jats:p>",

Within weeks of arriving in Malaya, Clarke made agreements with three Malay rulers for British Residents to be attached to their states, and laid the foundations for the relentless spread of British protection over the whole peninsula. These repercussions mystified Colonial Office officials at the time and left future generations of historians to unravel the mystery of what had happened and why.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The management of cholesteatoma has been a controversial subject for many years. Advances in technology, magnification and surgical skills have enabled the otologist to deal more effectively with cholesteatoma over the years. However, attention must be paid to the pathological nature of cholesteatoma when planning surgical attack upon it. Rather than simply being skin that has gotten lost and becomes unable to cleanse itself of its epithelial debris, cholesteatoma is an invasive, erosive and destructive process. It feeds upon the bone by invading it with osteoclastic cells and others which are apparently capable of regenerating cholesteatoma matrix. Unless these residua are removed along with the matrix, one cannot be certain of total ablation of disease. Microscopic inspection at the operating table cannot be trusted to make this determination. Therefore, the case is presented for dealing with cholesteatoma in a two-stage operation. One-stage operations which reconstruct the ear at the same time as the removal of cholesteatoma matrix predispose to the recurrence of cholesteatoma in several ways. The neophyte otologist should not feel that extraordinary operations are the standard and should be prepared to utilize the basic mastoid operations as a preliminary to timed reconstruction of the middle ear. Observation of the ear over an interval is the best way to determine that cholesteatoma has been removed in its entirety. </jats:p>",

Called the Screening‐Linking‐Planning (S‐L‐P) Conference Method, the technique takes advantage of certain characteristics of people in the heat of crisis that make them particularly amenable to change and allow a care‐giver to promote marked positive growth in brief periods of time. The method encourages the social network of the person in crisis to cluster around the person in a supportive way, to make positive expectations, and to provide feedback for identity‐repair purposes. The technique has proved effective with persons in acute crisis as well as those who have chosen a career of chronic crisis (i.e., chronic patienthood). A major part of this paper is devoted to case studies describing the application of this technique in a variety of situations.</jats:p>",

This tradition, and these assumptions, were partially challenged and modified by the movements for progressive reform and democratic socialism which developed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. But the greatest challenge came during the severe depression years of the 1930s : the belief was widespread among radicals during the first half of the decade that the end of an era was at hand, that capitalism and its ethos had run their course, and that the socialist cooperative commonwealth was now within reach. </jats:p>",
