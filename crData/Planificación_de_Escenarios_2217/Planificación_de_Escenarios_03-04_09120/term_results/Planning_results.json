      "abstract": "<jats:p> In line with the paradigmatic shift towards spatial ecology, it is generally accepted that the conservation value of a habitat remnant cannot be determined in isolation from its wider landscape. Sensitivity to the spatial context of forest patches should, therefore, characterise habitat management. Conversely, neoliberal planning disregards ecospatial configuration because it abandons resource decisionmaking to the spatially ad hoc outcomes of market processes. Analysis of bush-lot subdivision—the foremost protection mechanism for indigenous habitat on private land in the Auckland Region—demonstrates that the neoliberal agenda for planning contradicts fundamental tenets of conservation ecology. With its foundations in voluntarism and market mechanisms, bush-lot subdivision induces selection bias in the location of protected remnants. Strategic and interventionist approaches will be required to moderate the impact of habitat loss, fragmentation, and perforation. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In a previous paper, emergence and ways of computing with emergence were discussed. Emergence goes hand in hand with ambiguity. Ambiguity, of a particular kind, is foundational in shape grammars. Shape grammars compute with shapes that have ambiguous or indefinite parts. This part ambiguity is exploited easily and well in shape grammar computations. Another kind of ambiguity is considered here. This is representational ambiguity—an ambiguity of the nature of the elements that make up shapes. Shapes are represented with elements—points, lines, planes, and solids—that can have ambiguous and fluid interpretations as material, conceptual, symbolic, or other entities. Like part ambiguity, representational ambiguity is integral to the beginning, exploratory stages of a design process. Among the best and most explicit treatments of representational ambiguity were those given by two prominent design theorists of the 20th century, Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Informal examples of representational ambiguity from the writings of Kandinsky and Klee are reviewed here. These are used to motivate ways of handling representational ambiguity computationally. New kinds of algebras for shape grammar computations that support some of the ambiguities suggested by Kandinsky and Klee, as well as other kinds, are proposed. </jats:p>",

Strong support was garnered for the three hypotheses of the study, namely: (1) empowered knowledge workers make a significant impact on the quality of planning outcomes; (2) planning cultures empower knowledge workers; hence (3) improving the quality of planning through the motivational path of knowledge workers’ empowerment.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The Dutch physical planning system is at a turning point. Recently the government proposed a new institutional framework for spatial planning. At first sight, the intended changes look like an example of improvements resulting from a learning process. However, the main lines of the proposal blatantly deviate from the insights into planning, balanced decisionmaking, and ‘governance’ that have emerged during the past decade. This is illustrated and explained from three perspectives. First, the growing need for change was put forward several times by the Scientific Council for Government Policy, a think tank whose task is to advise the government from a certain intellectual distance. The development of ideas by this agency is an example of cognitive learning. Second, the example of infrastructure planning that is crucial in this cognitive development is used to illustrate this by confronting the ideas with the experiences in two major national projects. As a third line, the deviations between the empirical evidence, the analysis, and the advice to the government on the one hand, and the governmental proposal on the other, are explained in relation to the ‘advocacy coalition framework’ theory on policy-oriented learning. </jats:p>",

The author asks whether there is a measurable correlation between aesthetic ratings for textural images and their physical properties. A bank of Gabor filters covering a range of frequencies and orientations are used to extract properties. Three studies are conducted and the correlations between aesthetic ratings and the properties were significant and large. The correlations proved robust when image identifiability was incorporated in the first and third studies and removed from the second study. In this, it is suggested that memory and association are not exclusively driving (aesthetic) preference; that it is also tuned to properties of spatial frequency and orientation of certain visual stimuli. </jats:p>",

The globalization of public health has important implications for access to essential healthcare. The rise of inequalities among and within countries negatively affects access to healthcare. Poor people use healthcare services less frequently when sick than do the rich. The negative impact of globalization on access to healthcare is particularly well demonstrated in countries of transitional economies. No longer protected by a centralized health sector that provided free universal access to services for everyone, large segments of the populations in the transition period found themselves denied even the most basic medical services. Only countries where regulatory institutions are strong, domestic markets are competitive and social safety nets are in place, have a good chance to enjoy the health benefits of globalization.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>The demands on governments and local authorities are changing in response to community expectations for environmentally sustainable outcomes. To reverse declining water quality in rivers and ensure sustainable use in the 21st century, the State Government in New South Wales has introduced a package of Water Reforms. The introduction of integrated water, sewerage and drainage planning is one of the Water Reform initiatives. Traditionally, government and local authorities have managed their water supply, sewerage and stormwater drainage systems as separate entities. Integrated urban water planning is a structured planning process to evaluate concurrently the opportunities to improve the management of water, sewerage and drainage services within an urban area in ways which are consistent with broader catchment and river management objectives. The New South Wales Department of Land &amp; Water Conservation (DLWC) has developed an integrated urban water planning process through a number of recent pilot studies. The process links urban water management objectives to overall catchment and river management objectives. DLWC is currently developing a set of guidelines for integrated urban water plans. DLWC has developed the Integrated Urban Water Planning methodology through three pilot studies in the New South Wales towns of Finley, Goulburn and Bombala. The pilot studies have shown that an integrated approach to water, sewerage and stormwater planning can identify opportunities that are not apparent when separate strategies are developed for each service. The result is better-integrated, more sustainable solutions, and substantial cost savings for local communities.</jats:p>",

The ability of neighborhoods to function as service providers is a critical and understudied aspect of neighborhood research. This paper offers a methodological contribution of the analysis of neighborhoods as service providers. Provision of services is defined in terms of accessibility, or the spatial proximities between residents and the facilities. Because the focus is on neighborhoods, access is defined on the basis of the pedestrian rather than the automobile. In addition, the needs of the neighborhood population are considered. A case study of Portland, Oregon, is used to demonstrate how an evaluation of pedestrian access could be conducted at the neighborhood scale. </jats:p>",

In that light, this article analyses six planning methods currently in use in the Netherlands. The most salient findings are that these methods lack an explicit vision of sustainability, they do not give due consideration to symbiotic or utility‐sharing options, they do not sufficiently engage the companies involved in the development and their policy instruments have a limited environmental impact. The planning methods prove to have many shortcomings: the definition of sustainability is unclear; there are no quantitative standards; information on symbiosis and utility sharing is inadequate; the economic and organizational implications are largely ignored and the environmental impact is insufficiently monitored. However, eco‐industrial parks can only have greater environmental benefits through symbiosis and utility sharing. Therefore, location‐ and company‐specific factors have to be taken into consideration. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. and ERP Environment</jats:p>",

How much was this evolution shaped by successive planning models formulated over the last century? The paper reports on an analysis of the land-use patterns of four neighbourhoods developed at different times over the 20th century. Data originate from field surveys and a systematic measurement of the land uses of the study areas. Findings paint a mixed picture. They show that some societal changes (rising affluence for example) have affected neighbourhood morphology, whereas others (such as cultural diversification) have left few traces. A comparison of different land-use features identifies both the advantages and downsides of each neighbourhood's morphology. It becomes difficult in this light to perceive the evolution of neighbourhood planning as a linear progression towards improved land-use efficiency and quality of life. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> This paper outlines a method for using the mathematics of fuzzy sets that is well suited to measure and characterize periurbanizing ( desakota) systems typical of China, Southeast Asia, and other areas experiencing rapid urbanization. Drawing on Kosko's ‘fuzzy hypercube’, we derive three distinct but interdependent measures: (1) extent of urbanization, (2) level of fuzziness, and (3) degree of entropy. The feasibility of the proposed method is demonstrated by using remote sensing data for Ningbo, China. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Despite the popularity of the neotraditional development concept, attempts to investigate the effectiveness of various mixed-use core (MUC) designs in terms of induced localized walking trips are rare. In this study, we use the logsum measure of accessibility derived from a random utility model to investigate how neighborhood design and regional setting affect mode and destination choices for shopping and how these effects vary by income and day of week. We then use the random utility model to simulate changes in the design configuration of the neighborhood MUC and evaluate the effects of the changes on within-neighborhood-accessibility and travel-decision parameters. Our results provide insight on how traditional neighborhood residents choose destinations and modes for their shopping travel and how the geometric design of the MUC can affect travel decisions. We found that local and regional accessibility have interrelated effects on the choice decisions of traditional residents, which results in variations in travel decisions over neighborhood space. In addition, these variations appear even after controlling for income groups and day of week. In simulations evaluating the effectiveness of alternative MUC designs, we find that the optimal MUC design is the one that maximizes proximity to all residential locations in the neighborhood. That is, MUC designs that are confined to the center of the neighborhood are less effective in inducing within-neighborhood shopping. </jats:p>",

This study analysed a government intervention to improve coding accuracy of health care organizations in South Korea. The intervention was implemented in 1997 by 226 organizations that had submitted erroneous claims in 1996 for five selected diseases. In 1998, 94% of these organizations eliminated coding errors for these diseases. Those organizations least responsive to the intervention were tertiary hospitals, those publicly owned, and those with other complex organizational characteristics. Overall, this simple intervention appeared extremely effective, and wider adoption of such techniques should be explored. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>When an organization needs to use scenarios as a framework for logically discussing internal and external issues, it should be aware of the two predominant causes of failure of scenario projects: (1) a lack of agreement on the purpose of the effort; and (2) a lack of understanding about how scenarios might help different organizational cultures and styles. To avoid these pitfalls, leaders need to first assess the potential usefulness of scenarios using the culture of their organization and the goals of the effort as context. This article discusses three organizational cultures and illustrates how each uses scenario planning for three different purposes (directional strategy, contingency planning, and learning and team building). “Leader‐driven organizations”: if the purpose of scenario planning is for setting direction, then scenarios are used to structure debate; however, in the end, the leader decides the direction and everyone follows, leaving the debate behind. If the purpose of the scenario work is for contingency planning, then scenarios would primarily be used to sensitize the leadership group to possible changes; not decision making on a specific topic. When learning and team building, then the leader driven culture use scenarios to open up the idea space in search of the out‐of‐the‐box ideas. Ideally, leaders make scenarios a way for people to work new ideas into the planning and decision‐making system. “Plan‐driven cultures”: such companies value stability. If the scenario work is for setting direction, then the outcome will only be valued if the events leading to an endstate are treated as critical path lists. “Evidence‐driven cultures”: develop in highly capital‐intensive industries that have long time horizons. Because long‐term commitments cannot be changed quickly, real evidence is of paramount value to these cultures. Scenarios provide a framework of expectations to match up with the real world as it develops.</jats:p>",

The site-specific plans are the hands-on, operational guides to initial responders. The planning strategy of using combined umbrella plans and local area plans is now in use on projects in Africa, Russia, Middle East, and SE Asia. If applied consistently on a regional basis, the resulting plan framework can provide companies and governments with detailed tactical plans in many developing parts of the world.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Unary operator domains -- i.e., domains in which operators    have a single effect -- arise naturally in many control problems.  In    its most general form, the problem of STRIPS planning in unary    operator domains is known to be as hard as the general STRIPS planning    problem -- both are PSPACE-complete. However, unary operator domains    induce a natural structure, called the domain's causal graph. This    graph relates between the preconditions and effect of each domain    operator. Causal graphs were exploited by Williams and Nayak in order    to analyze plan generation for one of the controllers in NASA's    Deep-Space One spacecraft. There, they utilized the fact that when    this graph is acyclic, a serialization ordering over any subgoal can    be obtained quickly. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive study of    the relationship between the structure of a domain's causal graph and    the complexity of planning in this domain.  On the positive side, we    show that a non-trivial polynomial time plan generation algorithm    exists for domains whose causal graph induces a polytree with a    constant bound on its node indegree. On the negative side, we show    that even plan existence is hard when the graph is a directed-path    singly connected DAG.  More generally, we show that the number of    paths in the causal graph is closely related to the complexity of    planning in the associated domain.  Finally we relate our results to    the question of complexity of planning with serializable subgoals.</jats:p>"

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Companies today face many conflicting priorities in remaining competitive. Some of the challenges include leading company staff in thinking bigger, operating in direct relationship to customers and stockholders’ needs, while staying flexible and adaptable to economic and market shifts. How does a facilities manager stay connected to the business strategy, manage more projects with less staff, and still provide responsive service, while the business environment the manager supports is changing rapidly? The manager may be faced with consolidating facilities owing to a merger or company restructuring. Consolidation presents several challenges that must be met. The manager must work with executives to align equipment deployment and facility use to merger goals and objectives. He/she must consolidate facilities management infrastructure into a cohesive unit from the different approaches of the original companies. This requires the ability simultaneously to coordinate the strategic, tactical and technical aspects of consolidation, while maintaining the seamless operation of the company. If it is a large operation, with facilities spread across a region, facilities management may have been distributed, with each location responsible for their own projects and maintenance. A major change effort such as consolidation requires a centralised facilities management structure that is tied directly into the strategy of the company. The answer for many companies in meeting these challenges is enterprise programme management (EPM). Enterprise programme management is a way of thinking, communicating and working, supported by an information system, that organises an enterprise’s resources in direct relationship to leadership’s vision, and the mission, strategy, goals and objectives that move the organisation forward. Simply put, EPM provides a 360‐degree view of an organisation’s collective efforts.</jats:p>",

The Caspian Sea area alone has estimated reserves of 70 billion barrels of oil. The northeast Caspian region, the focus of major exploration campaigns in the last two years, is a unique environment where the sea level can vary between zero and 10 metres purely as a consequence of the wind direction. Temperatures range between +40 degrees Celsius in the summer to −40 degrees in winter, with the north east Caspian sea being frozen for some four to five months of the year. These factors not only make the region very challenging from an operational point of view, but present a whole new set of challenges for the oil spill response planners. The Republic of Kazakhstan (RoK) is a very large country and industry is widely distributed with operational oil spill risks arising from pipeline operations, exploration, production and distribution of refined product. The goal was set by the oil industry to assess the spill risks in the region and firstly to identify individual Tier 1 requirements. Having established the Tier 1 needs, the study progressed to a review of the logistics and of the available infrastructure. Using a combination of these resources, one could determine whether a credible Tier 2 capability could be developed or whether additional stockpiles and trained personnel would be required.</jats:p>",

The growth in car‐borne traffic has increased rapidly and consumes more and more land because of land‐extensive structure of cities and the traffic demand between human activities (home, work, services). Planning solutions emphasizing the separation of urban functions, in order to avoid health problems, have, together with the availability of inexpensive land on the outskirts of urban areas, contributed to the current generation of environmental problems, primarily from increased dependency on private cars. The OECD and EU have developed principles of sustainable transport and sustainable traffic to tackle the growth of traffic. Urban form and location of activities together with economic incentives and well organized public transport has a significant impact on traffic flows. There is not yet a general political agreement on how the reduction of traffic demand should be legally regulated, but some criteria are suggested to measure sustainable mobility in land use planning.

In defining and readjusting the scope and content of the national HIV/AIDS control activities, policy makers sought to identify the most cost‐effective options for HIV/AIDS control. The cost‐effectiveness analysis reported in this paper uses a mixture of local and international information sources combined with appropriate assumptions to model the cost‐effectiveness of feasible HIV prevention options in Chad, with estimates of the budget impact. The most cost‐effective options at under US$100 per infection prevented were peer group education of sex workers and screening of blood donors to identify infected blood before transfusion. These options were followed by mass media and peer group education of high risk men and young people, at around US$500 per infection prevented. Anti‐retroviral therapy for HIV infected pregnant women and voluntary counselling and testing were in the order of US$1000 per infection prevented. The paper concludes with recommendations for which activities should be given priority in the next phase of the national HIV/AIDS control programme in Chad.

Specific pre-planning for the physical response to specific oil properties, local geography, and environmental conditions is frequently neglected. The tactical action planning concepts presented in this paper address these issues by carefully examining the characteristics of specific oils under the spectrum of ambient conditions, the physical properties of the potentially impacted area, probable spill movement, and the presence of sensitive resources. These concepts also address the availability of response equipment and those techniques that will perform under the conditions encountered. Field surveys are then conducted to identify and catalogue specific control sites where initial response actions may be appropriate. Surveys include taking digital photographs of the area and collecting GPS coordinates of response locations. The resultant plans will facilitate the initial response to releases anywhere along the subject pipeline. Data and recommendations are organized in the form of a hard-copy manual consisting of maps, tables, and illustrated instructions. Data files, interactive mapping software, and data management software are also provided on CD. A software component allows the planning effort to be used during drills and exercises, as well as for emergency response management.</jats:p>",

Tundra cliffs range in character from ice-rich exposures that are dominated by rapid thermo-erosional processes to high (10–15 meters) sediment-rich cliffs that may be eroded by slumping or basal sapping. One product of this rapid erosion of the tundra is to produce large volumes of peat and in many sections these form the dominant shore-zone material. In low-lying areas the flooding of the tundra has produced extremely complex shoreline configurations characterized by the elevated rims of patterned ground. These unique arctic shore types present different sets of challenges for shoreline cleanup and treatment and have been included in the U.S. marine oil spill response guide published in 2001 by API, NOAA, USCG, and USEPA and several specialized Arctic response manuals published recently by Environment Canada. A low-altitude aerial videotape survey in 2001 produced continuous images of the mainland and barrier island coasts of the Alaskan Beaufort and Chukchi Sea coasts from the Canadian border to Point Hope, used to map the shore types as part of a mapping project for the Minerals Management Service. The mapping revealed that the three arctic shoreline types are present on more than half (54 per cent) of the coast between the Canadian border and Point Hope.</jats:p>",

While the vessel was attempting to move to a safer anchorage, winds in excess of 100 knots blew the freighter into Second Priest Rock, damaging several of the vessel's fuel tanks. The vessel subsequently ran aground on the shore of Summer Bay. Approximately 39,000 gallons of heavy fuel oil were spilled, oiling Summer Bay and nearby Humpy and Morris Coves. High winds and surf carried oil upstream into a nearby lake and on to the dunes. Windblown oil also contaminated vegetation and an archaeological site. This paper reviews the overall incident, and briefly summarizes the results of the damage assessment and restoration planning process undertaken for this spill.</jats:p>",

With such an asset, there must be a process to facilitate and guide capital spending decisions that underpin a strategy for delivering a gas growth agenda. The process must encompass development engineering and subsurface assessment to a level of accuracy so as to identify pre-investment opportunities that can be leveraged towards future growth. In the short to medium time frame, the questions of timing and volume of next gas supply are key questions to be answered. The process must include a mechanism to value exploration prospects so that the ordering of opportunities recognises multiple, risked outcomes, and hence, assists in the framing of longer-term developments. A successful process can reveal the future in terms of critical decision points, key drivers that impact financial performance, optimal capital spending profiles, and help guide the pace of growth. The subject of this paper is the process that bpTT is using to help guide its aggressive gas growth agenda.</jats:p>",

The results confirm that the online and postal respondents are demographically different. Online data collection is shown to be less expensive per respondent and that data collection is faster, however, an overall lower response level is achieved relative to the postal data collection method. Of greater importance, though, are the findings that respondents seem to answer questions differently online than they do via postal methods. The conclusion here is that online data collection should not be treated as a direct substitute for postal data collection in every instance.</jats:p>",

Distributions of outflow percentages were then imposed on various annual vessel traffic patterns to determine the probability distribution functions of spill types that would be expected if there were spills.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The position of a city in any hierarchy of world importance is not a static phenomenon. This paper takes the example of Tokyo and explores its interaction with the dramatic economic and political events in Japan over the past 20 years. Although Tokyo is widely regarded as one of the top three 'world cities', the argument is supported that it retained many national characteristics, partly based on its location in a 'developmental state'. As national fortunes have changed, so has Tokyo's relationship with its global environment. The paper focuses on strategic urban policy and the way that this reflects Tokyo's world role, as perceived by national and city governments. Three phases in approach are identified since the 1980s. Twenty years ago Japan was experiencing economic boom and this was reflected in dramatic development projects in Tokyo. The concept of 'world city' was used at this time to legitimise such development. The 1990s were viewed in Japan as 'the lost decade' with great uncertainty over policy direction as the boom collapsed and urban policy in Tokyo entered a phase of inertia. It is argued that the city is now entering a third phase in which a new competitive attitude is emerging regarding the role of Tokyo and this is leading to changes in strategic urban policy. However, this new approach is still embedded in old structures and conceptions and hence there are tensions in developing future policy. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In this paper I develop an idea of commemorative ‘dis(re)membering’ as a tool for a critical, nonessentialist reconfiguration of memorial landscapes, heritage discourse, and dominant official narratives of the past. The notion of commemorative dis(re)membering is not limited to any one particular case but is a general approach which fundamentally questions taken-for-granted assumptions about memorialization as a social process. The empirical focus of the paper is on Swedish labor-company camps established by the military in the late 1930s. I present a historical background to the camps, and proceed to consider the discourse that framed and enabled the creation of them. In reference to Continental European social theory and philosophy, I address the position of the camps in relation to the constitution of the law and the social imaginary. I proceed to situate the argument in the context of recent attempts to address forms of ‘dissonant heritage’ and pave the ground for a critique of heritage logocentrism. This critique is then advanced through an elaboration of dis(re)membering in relation to overarching issues of democracy, subjectivity, identity, citizenship, and the role of the past in the present. Finally, I propose a permanent replacement of the imaginary lineage of heritage with a ‘rhizome history’ of ‘disinheritance‘. In suggesting the erasure of heritage, I propose that objects of the past should be mobilized as disinheritance assemblages for critical and subversive purposes in order to make the past implode into the present and across spatial scales in ways that unsettle fundamental social imaginary significations. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Urban development is a complex dynamic process involving various actors with different patterns of behaviour. Modelling urban development patterns is a prerequisite to understanding the process. This paper presents a preliminary multiscale perspective for such modelling based on spatial hierarchical theory and uses it for the analysis of a rapidly developing city. This framework starts with a conceptual model, which aims at linking planning hierarchy, analysis hierarchy, and data hierarchy. Analysis hierarchy is the focus of this paper. It is divided into three scales: probability of change (macro), density of change (meso), and intensity of change (micro). The multiscale analysis seeks to distinguish spatial determinants on each of the three scales, which are able to provide deeper insights into urban growth patterns shaped by spontaneous and self-organised spatial processes. A methodology is also presented to implement the framework, based on exploratory data analysis and spatial logistic regression. The combination of both is proven to have strong capacity of interpretation. This framework is tested by a case study of Wuhan City, China. The scale-dependent and scale-independent determinants are found significantly on two scales. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The long‐running debate between the ‘rational design’ and ‘emergent process’ schools of strategy formation has involved caricatures of firms' strategic planning processes, but little empirical evidence of whether and how companies plan. Despite the presumption that environmental turbulence renders conventional strategic planning all but impossible, the evidence from the corporate sector suggests that reports of the demise of strategic planning are greatly exaggerated. The goal of this paper is to fill this empirical gap by describing the characteristics of the strategic planning systems of multinational, multibusiness companies faced with volatile, unpredictable business environments. In‐depth case studies of the planning systems of eight of the world's largest oil companies identified fundamental changes in the nature and role of strategic planning since the end of the 1970s. The findings point to a possible reconciliation of ‘design’ and ‘process’ approaches to strategy formulation. The study pointed to a process of planned emergence in which strategic planning systems provided a mechanism for coordinating decentralized strategy formulation within a structure of demanding performance targets and clear corporate guidelines. The study shows that these planning systems fostered adaptation and responsiveness, but showed limited innovation and analytical sophistication.

      "abstract": "<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>A review of the law and responsibilities for oil spill response reveals a need for taking oil spill response incident management planning beyond just describing what will be done, to a new level that describes specifically who will do it. Facilitating the development of an effective management team in the first 24–48 hours of a spill is critical to setting the response operations in a positive motion, and ultimate success. The development of a draft Incident Command System (ICS) structure to meet the expectations of a Type II incident and pre-identification of personnel for specific assignments will enable a more cohesive personnel qualification process, training and exercises focused on general incident management, and ultimately a better prepared cadre of response personnel. The vision for Coast Guard District Thirteen is a District Response Group that is organized into a defined and pre-approved ICS structure, with these expectations set. The National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan requires the Coast Guard to form District Response Groups. By definition, this is all personnel and every asset the Coast Guard has within each District. However, this does not speak to the qualifications of these personnel, or address the tasking some units may receive, both of which are known. In the early hours of a major spill, confusion reigns and calls for help are made. This can be a call for help that is specific, such as the number of beach monitors, OPS Section Chiefs, or Check-in Recorders that are needed, or the more likely request is to send whoever is available. The latter is not likely to enable success if well intentioned but inexperienced management personnel show up. If we know who is available within the Coast Guard district, then we know our strengths. Therefore, we also know our weaknesses, and can identify gaps. By identifying our ICS structure, we can examine our resources, needs, and expectations; and have a plan that works while remaining flexible. There is no need to assemble a management team on the fly in the first 24 hours of a spill.</jats:p>",

This multidisciplinary effort involved process design, development of tools and templates, training and deployment, facilitation and mentoring, production of prototype plans, and ongoing coaching during implementation in 2002. The new approach, featuring scenario planning and economic modelling, has elevated planning services to an advisory level by emphasising shareholder value while satisfying business unit needs. Within the first year of implementation, the process has been fully endorsed by corporate leadership and adopted by business unit management.

There is also recognition that the urban–rural dichotomy that is deeply ingrained in planning systems is inadequate for dealing with processes of environmental and developmental change in the peri-urban context. This paper argues that environmental planning and management of the peri-urban interface cannot simply be based on the extrapolation of planning approaches and tools applied in rural and urban areas. Instead, it needs to be based on the construction of an approach that responds to the specific environment, social, economic and institutional aspects of the peri-urban interface. The paper also outlines approaches to environmental planning and management in the peri-urban interface, examining its specificity in terms of both the challenges faced and possible approaches for implementation. </jats:p>",

The methodology facilitates a generic modeling of fatigue and corrosion degradation for both structural and process type components. Furthermore, special considerations are given to the important aspect of updating of inspection plans when degradation has been observed.

Strategies, operational procedures and equipment were selected for each type of emergency response. This condition reduced overall performance for different types of emergencies and restricted an emergency brigade's responsibility and commitment when facing an emergency. The members of a fire brigade, for example, did not have enough experience to control an oil spill and simply felt that they were not responsible for such work. In 1989, new legislation in Colombia established an approach for emergency response in which local, regional and national committees were created at municipal, departmental and national levels. These committees were responsible for emergency response coordination that depended on the emergency type and size, and on the resources involved. It soon became evident that individual contingency plans should be incorporated into a single comprehensive document. However, there were no guidelines available to provide contingency planners with the tools necessary to develop such integrated plans. The Colombian Petroleum Institute's new approach for designing and structuring Contingency Plans for the Colombian oil industry is presented in this document. New schemes for comprehensive emergency response are discussed, considering strategic, operational and data processing issues. Master Contingency Plans provide Local Contingency Plan developers with suitable tools that will enable them to develop their own plans in a comprehensive way, while coordinating the plans with the Colombian National System for Disaster Prevention and Response considered in Colombian law.</jats:p>",

In addition, the CRA approach allows the cost/benefit evaluation of alternative environmental policies and strategies relative to the baseline risks and disruptions associated with oil spills (as well as other costs and benefits of petroleum use).</jats:p>",

However, quite what such indices measure is uncertain as the concept of competitiveness as applied to economies has no clear or agreed definition among scholars. Still less is there any consensus regarding the factors that contribute to national competitiveness. Notwithstanding, governments have incorporated this vague and ill-measured concept both into policy parlance and into public expenditure plans, suggesting that an objective and practical method for identifying national competitiveness is urgently needed. The author reports an exploratory, inductive, approach to identifying the components of competitive advantage of a specimen economy (Hong Kong), by using data from 127 firms operating within it. An inventory of forty-one firm-suggested advantages of Hong Kong is scored, then exploratory factor analysis is used to derive a statistically and conceptually robust index of ten scales representing components of Hong Kong's competitive advantage. Results point to a new, grounded, approach to identifying competitiveness, not just of nations, but of regions and cities too. </jats:p>",

Given start and goal positions in a virtual environment, our scheme gives a sequence of motions to move from the start to the goal using a set of live-captured motion clips. Based on a novel combination of probabilistic path planning and hierarchical displacement mapping, our scheme consists of three parts: roadmap construction, roadmap search, and motion generation. We randomly sample a set of valid footholds of the biped figure from the environment to construct a directed graph, called a roadmap, that guides the locomotion of the figure. Every edge of the roadmap is associated with a live-captured motion clip. Augmenting the roadmap with a posture transition graph, we traverse it to obtain the sequence of input motion clips and that of target footprints. We finally adapt the motion sequence to the constraints specified by the footprint sequence to generate a desired locomotion.</jats:p>",

It is argued that writing Berlin cannot offer a unifying text or conceptual system which arranges the city ipso facto into a single territory, a generalise space of selected indices and icons. Alternatively, the writing of the city explores the ongoing transformation of the city in text. My purpose in this paper is, therefore, irrefutably bound up with the capacity of the urban text to remap imaginatively the changing condition of the city onto the text itself—hence the fashioning of textual presences as surrogate city spaces. The notion of performance is furthermore deployed to account for the immediacy and evanescence characterizing the Berlin of classical modernity, a period that rehearsed the contradictions of modernization in accelerated form. From journalistic reportage to novels, the textual performance of Berlin necessitates an enabling reception and adaptation to the destabilizing nature of urban industrial modernity, which in turn can be plotted in two interrelated ways: first, in the proliferation of textual strategies which approximate the montage effect of the incipient modernization of the city; second, in the writerly anticipation of cinematic innovations as the scripting of a ‘moving’ urban culture of modernity. Taken together, these writings inhabit traveling geographies which provide models of performative identification for appropriating and embracing the complexity of the modern city. </jats:p>",

The majority of respondents (95%) indicated that their discharge arrangements were explained to them and 90% were satisfied with these. Whilst over two‐thirds indicated that the information provided in hospital to assist with discharge had been helpful, they highlighted some areas for service improvement. Resources to prepare them better for discharge included increased contact with consumer consultants and more information about mental health problems, medication and relapse prevention.</jats:p><jats:p> <jats:bold>Conclusion.</jats:bold> This study constitutes another small step towards decreasing the gap between consumer expectations and actual treatment by asking consumers about their perceptions of discharge planning.

The Incident resulted in the release of approximately 236,000 gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek, Bellingham, Washington. The spilled gasoline ignited, burning much of the riparian vegetation including a large section of mature forest in an urban park. The combination of the spill and fire resulted in the complete elimination of terrestrial and aquatic biota in several miles of the creek. Affected biota included several species of juvenile salmonids, including chinook salmon, which are listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. The Incident also resulted in recreational fishing and park closures. The Oil Pollution Act regulations require the Trustees to invite the Responsible Party to participate in the damage assessment and restoration process. By working together, restoration of injured resources and services may be achieved more rapidly and costeffectively. Shortly after the Incident, the Trustees and the Company recognized that a cooperative process would reduce duplication of studies, increase the cost-effectiveness of the assessment process, increase sharing of information, decrease the likelihood of litigation, and, most importantly, speed the restoration process. Another benefit of the cooperation was the ability to accomplish restoration goals in coordination with the emergency response activities. This paper summarizes the overall Incident and discusses the restoration planning process, including the emergency and long-term restoration actions.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The goal of this paper is to evaluate the level and examine the dynamics of housing consumption and residential crowding in urban China almost a decade after the housing reform was launched. I argue that housing consumption and residential crowding are affected not only by demographic and socio-economic factors, as they are in market economies, but also by institutional factors that are unique to China because of the dualism in housing reform. Using a 1996 national survey, I find that the level of housing consumption is still low and residential crowding is common. A room of one's own continues to be a dream for most Chinese. However, Chinese households now have more control over their housing, and their housing behaviors are beginning to share similarities with the West. For example, life cycle, household income, housing tenure, and city size have similar effects on housing consumption and residential crowding as they do in Western housing markets. It is still clear, however, that the socialist institution—the hukou system—continues to influence housing consumption, although to a lesser extent than in the prereform period. Households with rural or temporary hukou are at a disadvantage in the housing market, in the sense that they occupy less spacious housing and suffer more from residential crowding than do those with urban and permanent hukou. Yet, these last are more constrained by institutional variables such as job and work-unit characteristics, which affect housing consumption differently across cities. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of local measures such as Anselin's LISAs and Ord and Getis G statistics to identify local patterns of spatial association. The statistical significance test based on local statistics is one of the most important aspects in performing this kind of analysis, and a randomized permutation approach and normal approximation are commonly used to derive the p-values of the statistics. To circumvent some of the shortcomings of these existing methods and to offer a more formal approach in line with classical statistical framework, we develop in this paper an exact method for computing the p-values of the local Moran's I<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, local Geary's c<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>, and the modified Ord and Getis G statistics based on the distributional theory of quadratic forms in normal variables. Furthermore, an approximate method, called three-moment χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> approximation, with explicit calculation formulae is also proposed to achieve a computational cost lower than the exact method. Numerical evaluation on the accuracy of the approximate null distributions of the local statistics demonstrates that the proposed three-moment χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> method is useful in some situations although it is inappropriate for approximating the null distribution of I<jats:sub>i</jats:sub>. The study not only provides an exact test for local patterns of spatial association, but also put the tests of several local statistics within a unified statistical framework. </jats:p>",

These arguments are elaborated and illustrated with reference to one of Britain's most successful local development companies, Govan Initiative.

To face these new challenges, PETROBRAS launched a program for excellence in environmental, health and safety management that includes the development of oil spill contingency plans for its facilities. The present paper describes an oil spill modeling project for 25 facilities along the Brazilian coast. The implementation of the project involved a detailed meteorological and oceanographic characterization of each study area with a review of existing data, data collection, and hydrodynamic modeling covering more than 9,000 km of coastline. Based on the requirement of scenarios for both typical and critical conditions, the oil fates and trajectory modeling system OILMAP was applied to simulate oil spill incidents in all 25 sites, most of them oil terminals from TRANSPETRO, a PETROBRAS subsidiary. Due to Brazil's continental dimensions, the environmental conditions simulated ranged from the subtropical Patos Lagoon in the southernmost part of the country to the equatorial Solimoes River, including estuaries, coastal zones, and offshore sites. The developed modeling system allows oil spill contingency specialists to develop response plans for typical spills in the selected locations. By performing reverse trajectory calculations from sensitive sites such as water intakes or fragile wetlands, it is also be possible to identify probable release locations of spills and principal avenues of vulnerability for these important resources. This paper presents a description of the implementation of the system and the results of this modeling approach for a typical oil terminal located in the city of Vitoria, eastern Brazilian coast.</jats:p>",

In this context, Resolution 293 of Brazilian National Environmental Council (CONAMA) was enacted regulating Facility Response Plans for oil spill incidents. These plans, which should be approved by the competent authority, include a vulnerability analysis that should discuss the probability of oil reaching certain areas as well as the environmental sensitivity of these areas. Oil spill modeling is an important tool to estimating the areas likely to be affected by an oil spill. Although oil spill modeling is also part of the environmental studies required in the environmental permitting process for oil E&amp;P activities, there are not well defined criteria to compose the oil spill scenarios to be modeled.

Failure to recognize this means that bringing about environmentally more sustainable urban mobility patterns is only possible at economic, social, and political costs that are unacceptable in most societies. In this paper we identify and discuss ways out of this dilemma, in the form of solutions that pursue the goal of increasing both sustainability and accessibility. We start by contending that what people ask is not a generic mobility, but rather opportunities to participate in spatially disjointed activities. Accordingly, accessibility should be defined as the amount and the diversity of ‘spatial opportunities’ that can be reached within a certain amount of time. Solutions to the accessibility–sustainability dilemma building upon this perspective (that is, planning concepts, policy measures) have been the object of recent research at the Universiteit van Amsterdam and are discussed and we look for, and find, evidence of the feasibility of these solutions in the actual trends in the Amsterdam urban region. Some policy implications of the findings are discussed. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Integration means different things to different people and as a consequence appears to only partially deliver on promised outcomes. For effective integrated water cycle management these outcomes should include improved water use efficiency, less waste, environmental sustainability, and provide secure and reliable supply to meet social and economic needs. The objective of integration is the management and combination of all these outcomes as part of a whole, so as to provide better outcomes than would be expected by managing the parts independently. Integration is also a consequence of the Water Reforms embarked on by the NSW State Government in 1995. The key goals of the reforms are clean and healthy rivers and groundwaters, and the establishment of more secure water entitlements for users. They are also essential for meeting the Council of Australian Government (COAG) water management strategies. The policies and guidelines that formed the NSW Water Reforms were the basis of the Water Management Act 2000 (NSW) (WMA) which is the legislative framework for water management in NSW. The NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation has developed an approach to integrated water cycle management for rural centres in NSW based on a catchment and policy context. This approach includes consideration of catchment wide needs and issues, environmental sustainability, government policy and community objectives in the development of an integrated water cycle plan. The approach provides for a transparent assessment of priorities and how to deal with them, and while specific to urban centres, could easily be expanded for use in the management of the whole of the catchment water cycle. Integration of the water cycle is expected to offer benefits to the local environment, community and economy. For instance, any unused proportion of an urban centre's water entitlement, or an offset against this entitlement created through returned flows (such as via good quality sewage effluent discharge to a river), can provide a surplus which is available to be traded on an annual basis. Further, improved demand management within an urban centre can be expected to result in a reduction in abstraction against the licence entitlement. This may result in the increased availability of in-stream water for environmental or other purposes and is expected to increase the economic value of returned water. Improved water use efficiencies are also expected to result in reduced capital works (and their associated costs) as the efficiency of service delivery and resource use improves. In this paper an example of the application of this process is provided and the outcomes discussed.</jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The following two characteristics of point‐to‐point human arm movement on a plane have been well demonstrated: (1) The path is roughly a straight line but slightly curved. (2) The velocity profile is bell shaped with a single peak. Several models have been proposed to explain these features. Four criteria for trajectory planning based on optimal principles have been proposed: the minimum hand jerk criterion, the minimum angle jerk criterion, the minimum torque change criterion, and the minimum commanded torque change criterion. It has been shown that trajectories generated by the minimum commanded torque change model correspond well with measured trajectories in a horizontal and sagittal work space. However, it was very difficult to establish a robust method for obtaining an optimal trajectory based on the minimum commanded torque change criterion, because of the need to solve a nonlinear optimization problem. Recently, Wada and colleagues proposed a new method to stably calculate optimal trajectories based on the minimum commanded torque change criterion. The method can obtain trajectories satisfying the Euler–Poisson equations with sufficiently high accuracy. We show that optimal trajectories based on the minimum commanded torque change criterion in three‐dimensional space can be calculated by applying the method. Finally, we show that the measured trajectory is closest to the minimum commanded torque change trajectory by statistical examination of many point‐to‐point trajectories in three‐dimensional space. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

      "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1997, local government in the United Kingdom has found itself at the sharp end of an ambitious programme of potentially far-reaching reforms known collectively as the ‘local government modernisation agenda’ (LGMA). These initiatives are intended to promote ‘joined-up government’ and holistic service delivery—two of the hallmarks of New Labour's approach to public service improvement. To date there has been very little analysis of the ways in which local authorities are approaching this task at a corporate level. The authors examine the theory and practice of joining up policymaking and service delivery in local government. They draw upon an analysis of the perspectives of key actors involved in the formulation and implementation of current local government reforms at the national level and the experiences of a sample of authorities that have been among the most active in seeking to integrate the various elements of the LGMA at local level. The evidence suggests that the superficially attractive logic of more integrated policymaking and service provision, which runs so strongly through current reforms, belies the multidimensional nature of joined-up working. The presentation of the LGMA as a coherent package of reforms therefore disguises the degree to which different forms of joining up may conflict. In particular, the push for closer vertical integration between local and central government, with ever-tighter control being exerted from the centre over priorities and performance, is seen as constraining progress towards more effective horizontal joined-up working at a local level.</jats:p>",

The authors developed a model CERP for the Yukon River villages that would allow each community to direct their own response resources and organization in the event an oil spill or other disaster threatened their community. The YRITWC s goal was to provide watershed communities with a simple, user-friendly response manual that was still consistent with other regional, state, and national plans. Therefore, while the Yukon River CERPs were developed specifically to integrate with the Subarea Plan for oil and hazardous substance spills and with other existing regional, state, and national response networks, they are geared toward community responders. The YRITWC views community ownership of the CERP as critical to developing a level of trust and sustaining working relationships with the State and Federal agencies involved in oil spill and emergency response. This paper describes the process used to develop a model CERP that adequately addressed the need for technological and natural disaster response planning in Yukon River native villages and to promote a functional emergency response system in rural, isolated communities.</jats:p>",

It shows the effect of transformation of livestock premiums in hectare premiums on the profitability of grassland management. The following scenarios were analysed: Introduction of a grassland premium (77 €/ha), increase of the grassland premium to 179 €/ha and abolition of the maize premium, uniform area premium (307 €/ha), combination model (crop premium 307 €/ha, grassland premium 205 €/ha, dropping of all animal premiums except for the milk and bull premiums). The calculations show, that a grassland premium of 77 €/ha would not lead to any considerable adjustment reactions. The simultaneous dropping of the maize premium and the increase in the grassland premium (179 €/ha) would lead to small advantages for the grassland economy. A uniform hectare premium (307 €/ha) would lead to strong income redistributions between the examined enterprises (up to +/-50 €/ha). Loss of grassland on favourable sites would continue. On unfavourable sites grassland fallow would considerably increase. The combination model would lead to less serious income redistributions. Taking along effects on marginally used grassland and the rise of land rental prices would be less pronounced. Grassland fallow will not have any significant effects on the quality of the groundwater recharge. With regards to nature conservation aims substantial problems will arise, since the extensive use of pasture will not be partially financed any more through animal premiums.</jats:p>"

At a world scale, the recent phase of this diffusion has been enhanced and enforced by a neoliberal global financial architecture. However, within many Third World countries, especially during recent decades when an integral component of their integration has been an agreement with the international financial institutions, the local acceptance of globalization has led to an intense contestation between those who win during incorporation and those who lose. In many Southern nations, the discord is muted, obstructed, or is masked; in others, though, the conflict is open and public. The author employs the voices of the winners and losers in an open and public conflict where the contestation was in fact published in the national press. His focus is the debate over the costs and benefits of international incorporation which occurred in Trinidad and Tobago with structural adjustment programmes. The country, with its democratic government and free expression, serves as a window into an otherwise murky process, for elsewhere this contest has often been unrecoverable and subterranean. Integral to the understanding of the spread of globalization into the Third World is the operation of the winners in a compradorial fashion—here, we learn how such disciples establish a national mindset which assists the international spread of globalization. </jats:p>",

Here an introduction into his theory of social systems is provided, and the possibilities for a geography of social systems is explored. A key element of our proposal is a differential notion of space as a possibility of distinction, which complements Luhmann's epistemological notion of time.

      "abstract": "<jats:p> The purpose of this paper is to compare two methods for the identification of priority areas for intervention and funding based on quantifiable assessments of multiple social need. This is an increasingly important aspect of evidence-based policy in a range of social programmes both in Britain, and in other countries. The context within which this methodology is assessed is the preparation of multiannual plans for the provision of services to children and young people. This is a statutory requirement in Britain on all local authorities, and is based on the Children Act 1989. The first method develops a composite indicator in which areas are scored on several variables, and the scores combined to identify those areas that are consistently high across all variables. The advantage of this method lies in its arithmetic transparency, which makes it ideal for use by local authorities and agencies engaged in needs assessment and planning. The potential drawback is that this composite indicator disregards any spatial structure in the data and gives no measure of statistical significance. The second method identifies statistically significant clusters using the exploratory technique of Besag and Newell for cluster detection in rare events. Clusters are combined to identify those areas affected by multiple problems. As shown in the paper, the two methods produce similar patterns of social need which is reassuring from a policy perspective as a large number of areas are now requiring a multiagency ‘joined-up’ approach for needs assessment, targeting intervention, and monitoring outcomes. The findings of this paper will be of relevance to researchers and practitioners. </jats:p>",

Drawing on findings from a national-level questionnaire survey, and follow-up semi-structured interviews with key respondents from the National Health Service (NHS), we have found that there has been an increase in GIS uptake within health organisations in the last decade. However, there has been limited collaboration between NHS organisations and local authorities on projects that utilise GIS. This lack of interorganisational activity is underpinned by the lack of a service-level agreement for digital data provision within NHS organisations, ambiguous understandings of data confidentiality requirements, and a limited awareness of the benefits of joined-up working arrangements. The paper concludes with a suggestion that significant organisational and cultural changes are required to facilitate enabling contexts for enhanced collaborative use of GIS between NHS organisations and local authorities, in order to support the wider joined-up government agenda currently being promoted in the United Kingdom. </jats:p>",

      "abstract": "<jats:p> Beyond their educational function, schools are frequently a focal point for community life. We argue that this latter role was compromised in New Zealand by a decade of neoliberal realignments within education policy. During the 1990s the abolition of school zones, the commodification of education, and the drive for efficiency in the allocation of educational resources undermined the place of school in community life. In this paper we explore the impacts of a school closure on an urban neighbourhood in Invercargill, New Zealand. We present and interpret narratives gathered during an interview-based study of the closure of Surrey Park Primary School. Our analysis highlights parents' perspectives on the role of the educational bureaucracy in the closure debate, the ambiguous role assigned to ‘community’ within the restructured system, the impact of the closure for low-income families, and the place of schools in contributing to the neighbourhood social cohesion. Our analysis concurs with international research suggesting that breaking links between schools and communities has potentially significant educational impacts on children. </jats:p>",

Our purpose is to offer an alternative reading of the social history of Hong Kong-the orthodox accounts of which remain largely predominant in the general historical understanding of that society-by examining the machinations that surrounded attempts by the European colonial elite to control the production of urban form and space in the capital city of Hong Kong, Victoria. Here the European Residential District ordinance of 1888 (along with other related ordinances) is considered in detail. An examination of European cultural self-perception and the construction of colonial identity is made by considering not only the actual ways in which urban form and space were manipulated through these ordinances but also the visual representation of the city in art. Here the intersection between ideas and images concerning civil society, cultural identity, architecture, and the official practices of colonial urban planning is demonstrated. It is argued that this coalescing of ideas, images, and practices in the colonial environment of British Hong Kong not only led to the racialisation of urban form and space there but also contributed to the apparent anxiety exhibited by the European population over the preservation of their own identity through the immediacy of the built environment. </jats:p>",

Most biodiversity features targeted in past conservation planning have been largely aspects of ecological and biogeographical pattern rather than process. However, the persistence of biodiversity can only be ensured through consideration of the ecological and evolutionary processes that underpin biodiversity, as well as its present spatial pattern. This paper identifies spatial surrogates of ecological and evolutionary processes for regional conservation planning in one of the world's biodiversity hotspots, the Cape Floristic Region. We identified six types of spatial components (namely edaphic interfaces, upland–lowland interfaces, sand movement corridors, riverine corridors, upland–lowland gradients and macroclimatic gradients) as surrogates for key processes such as ecological and geographical diversification, and species migration. Spatial components were identified in a GIS using published data and expert knowledge. Options for achieving targets for process components have been seriously compromised by habitat transformation. Between 30 and 75% of the original extent of the spatial components currently remain functional. Options for achieving upland–lowland and macroclimatic gradients are very limited in the lowlands where most of the habitat has been transformed by agriculture. We recommend that future studies place their research on ecological and evolutionary processes in a spatially explicit framework. Areas maintaining adaptive diversification (e.g. environmental gradients, ecotones) or containing historically isolated populations should be identified and protected. The spatial dimensions of eco‐logical processes such as drought and fire refugia also need to be determined and such insights incorporated in conservation planning. Finally, connectivity within these areas should be ensured to maintain species migration and gene flow.</jats:p>",

Self‐rated health and sex predicted prolonged length of stay (χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 15.3, <jats:italic>df</jats:italic> = 5, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> = .009), but only explained 2.2% of the variability, with an AUC of 0.58. The predictors of nonroutine discharge disposition were self‐rated health, caregiver availability, age, sex, and diabetes mellitus (χ<jats:sup>2</jats:sup> = 125.8, <jats:italic>df</jats:italic> = 11, <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> &lt; .001), accounting for 23.0% of the variability, with an AUC of 0.79.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>CONCLUSION:</jats:bold> The clinical utility of using the PRA as a screen for early identification of persons who use nonroutine discharge planning is limited, although certain individual items may be useful.</jats:p>",

The goal is to automatically generate arm trajectories that avoid obstacles in unknown environments from high-level task commands. Our system consists of three components: 1) environment sensing using stereo vision with disparity map generation and online consistency checking, 2) probabilistic mesh modeling in order to accumulate continuous vision input, and 3) motion planning for the robot arm using RRTs (Rapidly exploring Random Trees). We demonstrate results from experiments using an implementation designed for the humanoid robot H7.</jats:p>",
